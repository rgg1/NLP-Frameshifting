Basically. it says that this present legislation before us. the stimulus package. would Increase employment at that point in time by 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. I did the math on that. and 1.3 million jobs by the end of 2010 comes to $680.769 per job. If the most optimistic estimate of 3.9 million new jobs created between now and the last quarter of 2010. it is only $226.923 per job. Interesting comments by the Congressional Budget Office. which says on page 5: In principle. the legislations longrun impact on output also would depend on whether it permanently changed incentives to work or save. However. according to CBOs estimates. the legislation would not have any significant permanent effects on these incentives. They go on to say: CBO estimates that by 2019 the Senate legislation would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net.",

According to the economic models developed by the Presidents economic advisers. this proposal would create twice as many jobs for half the cost. about 6.2 million new jobs for $480 billion. as opposed to the alleged 3 to 4 million jobs for $888 billion under the Democratic proposal. One of the best parts is a 7percentagepoint rate cut for small businesses done exactly the way we did for corporations under the FSC/ETI bill. This would apply to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. precisely the kind of businesses that create jobs. Finally. it contains a provision that expresses our policy that the United States should not increase its marginal income tax rates while the unemployment rate is above the level of 2008. and taxes should not be increased to pay for the impact this stimulus will have on the deficit which we know is large. That is precisely what caused the second half of the Great Depression and slowed down the economic recovery in Japan. I urge colleagues to support the McCain amendment and the Thune amendment.",

I want to make it very clear that the Gregg amendment is not a meaningless amendment. It has a lot of meaning because what it does is it kills health reform. Oh. yes. this is a meaningful amendment. make no mistake about it. It goes right to heart of what the health reform is all about: making sure people at the lowincome end of the scale have a little bit better coverage: that is. people on Medicaidthat is section 2001the tax credits and the copays that are in there. again. to help moderateincome people and families be able to afford better coverage for themselves and their familieshe guts that tooand. of course. the expansion of SCHIP. So really. yes. I say to my friend from Iowa. this is a meaningful amendmentif you want to kill the bill. if you want to kill it. I suppose since most of my friends on that side of the aisle would like to kill the bill. they will probably vote for the Gregg amendment. But it completely guts itcompletely guts it. Why? To help protect the wasteful subsidies to the insurance companies at the expense of families who are struggling to afford insurance and seniors who rely on Medicare. This bill lowers premiums for American families. businesses. and the country as a whole. The Congressional Budget Office just said that this week. It strengthens Medicare. it improves benefits. and it adds years of life to the Medicare trust fund. Lets be clear. Not one dime of the Medicare trust fund is used to pay for this reform. and no guaranteed Medicare benefits will be cut. If anyone can prove otherwise. please come forward. We have had a lot of rhetoric about it. but prove that this statement is not true: Not one dime of the Medicare trust fund is used to pay for reform and no guaranteed Medicare benefits will be cut.",

IN. he served two tours of duty in Iraq. It was in Iraq in 2003 where Lieutenant Colonel Gentry and the more than 600 soldiers he bravely led were exposed to the lethal chemical sodium dichromate while guarding the Qarmat Ali water treatment facility in Basrah. In 2006. Lieutenant Colonel Gentry was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given 2 months to live. He not only valiantly fought this debilitating illnessand survived much longer than doctors expectedbut he also fought to bring crucial details about the tragedy at Qarnnat Ali to the Nations attention. With his quiet courage. he advocated for justice for the soldiers under his command until his final days. Due in large part to his efforts. the Department of Defense is now investigating why so many service men and women were exposed to this deadly chemical. As Americans. we take pride in the example Lieutenant Colonel Gentry set as a soldier. a leader. and a patriot. I had the privilege of speaking with him on the phone a little more than a month ago. Even in what turned out to be his final days. he remained steadfast in his dedication to his troops and in his efforts to ensure they received proper care. Jim is survived by his devoted wife LouAnn Grube Gentry. five children Sarah Clark. Jason Newman. Emily Gentry. Jennafer Newman. and Ellen Gentry. his parents George and Brenda Sue Gentry. brother Sanford Gentry. and sister Carolyn Hodges. Lieutenant Colonel Gentry was a brave man who put his soldiers before himself. both on and off the field of battle. Today and always. he will be remembered by family and friends. fellow soldiers and all Hoosiers as a true American hero. We cherish the legacy of his service and his life. It is my sad duty to enter the name of LTC James Gentry in the RECORD of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom. democracy. and peace.",

She is now in the third week of her hunger strike. and her health has seriously declined. An agreement between the Spanish and Moroccan governments was reportedly reached on Friday. but it fell through at the last. minute and Ms. Haidar remains at the Lanzarote Airport. Given this dire situation and the damage it is causing to efforts to resume goodfaith negotiations on the future status of the Western Sahara. I want to repeat my appeal to the Moroccan authorities to reinstate Ms. Haidars passport and allow her to return home to her family. Morocco and the United States are friends and allies. The denial of citizenship and forcible exile of Ms. Haidar is inconsistent with international human rights norms to which Morocco is a signatory and will accomplish nothing positive. It also raises the question. as do the recent arrests of other Sahrawi activists. of whether the United Nations mandate in Western Sahara should be expanded to include human rights monitoring. I believe the State Department should seriously review this issue when the UN missions term comes up for extension in the Security Council in April. There is still time. but it is running out. to resolve this issue in a manner that serves Moroccos interests and protects Ms. Haidars rights.",

I would like to speak for a minute with regard to one of our strongest allies in the Middle East. and that is the State of Israel. I am thankful for the strong relationship that we have. that our two countries share so much in common. We have both faced war and fought for peace and for freedom. We both continue to pursue liberty. despite ongoing opposition. We both face many common enemies. Throughout my time in Congress. I have been a strong supporter of Israels right to exist. When you think about it. it is even disturbing that we have to come here and talk about it in such terms. But the truth of the matter is. there are few countries. few peoples on Earth who are more In the cross hairs than Israel. Not even the U.N. can be called upon to defend Israel. In fact. the U.N. often stands with those who condemn Israel. Israel has remained a shining beacon of democracy in a dark part of the world. standing with the United States against the threat of Islamic extremism. and we must be unwavering in our continuous support. In conclusion. the United States should continue to work with Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli Government and with the people of Israel to ensure that Israel continues to receive critical military assistance. including the military defense needed to address this existential threat.",

Since its creation in 1948. the State of Israel. surrounded by hostile neighbors. has been forced to develop technologically advanced defense capabilities to protect its existence as a democratic. Jewish state. While this amendment addresses the totality of the U.S.-Israel military and security relationship. I would like to focus on the provision of critical missile defense assistance to Israel. Israel is about to become the first country in the world to have a true national missile defense. and perhaps no other country has such a pressing need for one. Almost twenty years ago. Iraq launched 93 Scuds at other Middle Eastern nations. including 39 at Israel. Most recently. in 2006. Hezbollah launched scores of Katyusha rockets at civilian targets in northern Israel. imposing a state of siege on the population. And we cannot forget the ongoing. relentless. decadelong rocket and mortar attacks from Palestinian militant groups in Gaza against innocents in southern Israel. In addition to killing and injuring a number of Israelis. these militants have inflicted great psychological damage on the population. including Israeli children. But the missile danger to Israel and the United States is even greater than what has challenged us before. Today. Israel faces threats from both Iran and Syriawhich have made clear their desires to develop nuclear weapons--and from the ballistic missile delivery systems that could reach Tel Aviv. other critical U.S. allies. and U.S. forces stationed throughout the region. Iran remains committed to developing rockets capable of delivering warheads to Tel Aviv. Syria. which has one of the largest missile stockpiles in the region. has. with Irans help. reportedly developed a surfacetosurface missile that would enable Syria to launch attacks on key Israeli military and civil installations with precision. Providing missile defense for Israel is obvious: It is a vital U.S. ally. a small democracy surrounded by foes armed with short. medium. and longrange projectiles and missiles.

Mr. Chairman. this amendment would clarify that section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act does not preclude Federal agencies from purchasing fuel that is not predominantly derived from tar sands or other highcarbon sources. At the same time. this amendment maintains the intent of section 526 by ensuring taxpayer money is not being used to subsidize highly polluting technologies. Originally contained in the Carbon Neutral Government Act and incorporated in the Energy Independence and Security Act. section 526 precludes Federal agencies from entering into a contract that would result in construction of a refinery of fuel that produces more greenhouse gas pollution than conventional petroleum fuel. This exact amendment. introduced by Mr. BOREN of Oklahoma last year. passed the House on a voice vote. unfortunately. it was not adopted by the Senate. This language represents a compromise that preserves the intent of section 526 without tying the hands of Federal agencies that need to procure fuel. Without using carbon capture and sequestration. turning coal into liquid fuel produces up to twice as much greenhouse gas pollution per unit of energy as conventional petroleum fuel. and fuel processed from tar sands generates 14 to 42 percent more greenhouse gas pollution per unit compared to production of conventional petroleum fuels. Section 526 has successfully protected taxpayers from costly and destructive subsidies of highly polluting fuel production. The reality is that fuel derived from tar sands already comprises a small proportionroughly 6 percentof much of the gasoline and diesel fuel consumers purchase. Mr. Chairman. this amendment simply clarifies that the hands of the Federal Government are not tied and that Federal agencies can. in fact. procure commercially available fuel that is available to them.

Let me try to explain in the limited time that I have. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 has in it a section 526. which does not allow any agency of the Federal Government to use a fuel source that has one scintilla increased amount of carbon dioxide footprint other than just standard old bubbleup petroleum. The Department of Defense uses about 350.000 barrels of refined petroleum product every day. most of that by the Air Force in the use of jet fuel. In this country. we have so much domestic source of nonconventional bubbleup petroleum. and Im talking about things like shale. in particular. and the liquefication of coal. converting coal into petroleum. In this country. Mr. Chairman. we probably have a 150year reserve of coal. and yet we cannot touch that even though the Department of Defense has done research on the clean liquefication of coal. the clean mining of shale. Shale is a rock thats just soaked. its like a sponge. its just soaked with petroleum. and there are literally hundreds of millions of barrels of petroleum within that shale. And yet. because of this section 526 in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. we cannot use it. We cannot use that at all. So what we have found. of course. is that most of the petroleum that we import from foreign countries is not coming from OPEC. its coming from Canada. And whats the problem? That oil that we get from Canada comes from tar sand. Its got a little sand in it. and it causes a little increase of production of carbon dioxide. a footprint thats more than conventional petroleum. So thats all the amendment does from the gentleman from Virginia. I support the amendment. but what we need to do is eliminate section 526. And I have an amendment that I signed on with the gentleman from Texas and the other gentleman from Texas . and thats what we should have done. That amendment should have been made in order. We need to eliminate section 526 and take the handcuffs off the Department of Defense. Were talking about big bucks here. Mr. Chairman. I do support the gentlemans amendment.",

I have said it a couple of times when Ive talked to you on the floor here on this issue: the State of Utah launched last year a reform of the health care system based on Utahs unique demographics.

There are some who have simply asked. \"Why cant you just sit down and compromise? Why cant you work things out?\" I think I join with you in saying I am more than happy to sit down and work with anybody who will work with me. The bottom line is we have not been allowed to work together. which is why I was saying earlier to let those other ideas. the other bills. have an updown vote as well. Bring them to the floor and allow a true debate on all ideas. Dont siphon the ideas down to what is allowable by the leaders of Congress. Allow us to actually work together. As I think you intimated. there are some things. certain provisions. on which both Republicans and Democrats do agree. Let them stand by themselves and see what we can actually accomplish without taking an idea on which we basically all agree and then adding 10 or 15 bad ideas on which we fundamentally disagree and saying. Okay. its take it or leave it.",

As to most legislation Ive seen that works pretty well. surprisingly enough. people are sold on it. There is a process of a bunch of people coming together. defining a problem. working on a solution. Frequently when they start. the bills are pretty rough. are pretty hard to understand. and have a lot of questions and problems in them. but as more and more people have a chance to work on them. to roll their sleeves up and have input in them. the bills get refined. In the business world. if you want to mess something up. you send it to a committee. In the political world. when committees work on legislation. they tend to refine the product. After a period of time. what happens is you have certain ideas that some people just cant tolerate. and you tend to throw the radical stuff out. What you can agree to comes together. When that happens and particularly when it happens across party lines. you dont have major fundamental reform. but you change. and you fix things in ways that solve peoples problems. What happened this year is we had 80 less seats than the Democrats. so they thought. We dont need the Republicans. The dickens with the Republicans. Weve got such a majority that we can do whatever we want. As theyve marched off to totally change all of health care. now theyve gotten kind of in a jam because theyre realizing the public is not agreeing with it. and they dont have one Republican vote. Thats very. very unusual politically that there is not at least one Republican who would vote for a bill. That says that this has been such a partisan kind of approach. and thats why there is cause to scrap it. Its not that people are going to go back to ground zero in health care. but theyre saying this approach right here is just too much.",

I was told that once again today. the President. in his remarks. said. if you like your plan. you keep your plan. if you like your doctor. you can keep your doctor. Now. if that line sounds familiar. it is because it was a staple in the rhetoric for all of last year. with a couple of problems. I have been told that media outlets like the Associated Press and ABC News debunked that claim. showing that that cacophony of programs and lines going through. that that simply was not the case. And the White House then said. well. we are not taking that line literally. and eventually it was removed. It is coming back now. but it still is not accurate. The problem is. if you like what you have. you may not end up keeping what you like. You may end up being told what to do. which is the problem every time when you try and transfer power from individuals back to Washington to tell us what is best for us. We sometimes may not agree. And that is the sad part. That is the fundamental problem that a few tweaks around the edges cant solve. But that is a significant problem. And I think the gentleman from Missouri hit the nail on the head when he said this is one of those fundamental issues. which is why this program should not be forced through. but you should back up and start again with something that doesnt have that premise of Washington being empowered to tell us how we will live our lives. There are 8.000 State legislators out there. all of whom are bright. all of whom can come up with programs for their States. Allow the States to be the laboratory of democracy that Louis Brandeis used to talk about. We can do better. We can do better.

If we dont deal with the massive amount of litigation that forces doctors to do more and more procedures just so they are covered just in case someone decides to sue them. we will never actually get a handle on the costs of health care that keep going up.

People who volunteer and engage in community service play a vital role in neighborhoods across the country. National Volunteer Week invites all Americans to give back to the community in some form of service. Last week. President Obama signed into law the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. The law recognizes the necessary role volunteerism and service play in our country and creates 175.000 new service opportunities over the next several years. Through four new service corps. the Serve America Act will engage volunteers to work in their communities in the areas of health. education. green work and programs to support veterans and their families. Today. more than 400.000 individuals have volunteered through AmeriCorps. one of the largest national service programs working in local communities across the Nation. Whether its tutoring children in afterschool programs. cleaning up parks or serving food to the homeless. volunteers answer unmet needs by partnering with nonprofit organizations. schools. faithbased and community agencies to volunteer their services in local communities. Amazingly. seniors working as part of the Senior Corps have generated more than 1 billion volunteer service hours. Schools are also working to increase service opportunities in the communities. More than 1 million high school students participate in servicelearning programs in their schools. On a national level. volunteers have helped America alleviate some of its most pressing problems. During 9/11. millions of volunteers responded in our countrys time of need through their churches. schools and oftentimes as individuals wanting to help their neighbor. More recently. over 80.000 volunteers traveled to Fargo. North Dakota. to fill sandbags. strqngthen levees and help flood victims evacuate their homes. When the call is sounded. this Nations citizens rally together to begin the rebuilding that is needed. National Volunteer Week recognizes the critical role volunteers play in their communities. This week honors their hard work and contributions. I want to thank Congressman PLATTS for bringing this resolution forward and reminding us of the importance of volunteerism. Madam Speaker.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 491. which encourages each institution of higher education in the country to seek membership in the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges Consortium. SOC. Whether at home or abroad. military servicemembers deserve our Nations utmost respect and support. It is. therefore. important that our Nations Institutions of higher education respect the commitment that military servicemembers make in protecting the freedoms we often take for granted. The SOC recognizes the sacrifices that many of these servicemembers make. and it provides servicemembers with the opportunities for continued learning. The SOC appreciates the positive attributes military servicemembers bring as active participants in a diverse college environment. The SOC works toward improving the relationship between the military and institutions of higher education. Increased understanding provides the flexibility necessary for servicemembers to meet the educational requirements that schools demand. The SOC manages to balance the development of programs and procedures that meet the unique needs of servicemembers while protecting and assuring the quality of educational programs. The SOC includes over 1.800 colleges and universities. Members of this consortium should be commended. However. In order to create additional opportunities for deserving servicemembers. we need to encourage other higher education institutions to join the SOC. The SOC enables Americans to express our gratitude to servicemembers and to ensure that they have access to the same educational opportunities that are available to other citizens. The SOC provides a wealth of pathways to a quality education while being sensitive to the needs of those who have served our country or of those who are currently on active duty. Under this program. servicemembers can easily transfer credits earned while working toward a degree. they can attend a myriad of campuses and can opt for distance learning in certain instances. [ 1200 It is imperative that servicemembers are able to obtain an excellent education. not only because it makes our troops stronger. but because it serves as a necessary way to express gratitude for all of the ways that our servicemembers sacrifice to protect our country. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Representative ADLER for bringing this resolution forward. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Res. 491. a resolution encouraging each institution of higher education in the country to seek membership in the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges. or SOC. Consortium. The SOC Consortium was created in 1972 to provide educational assistance to servicemembers who had trouble completing their postsecondary education due to their frequent moves. Today. more than 1.800 colleges and universities are a member of this important consortium with operational September 23. 2009 CONGRI partnership between the Department of Defense and the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. All institutions that join the consortium must agree to have militaryfriendly policies on campus. Generally. these institutions agree to things like reasonable transfer of credit policies. providing credit for military training and experience. and providing credit for at least one nationally recognized testing program like the collegelevel examination program. The consortium also assists institutions and students in following new policy changes that may benefit servicemembers or veterans. Committee Republicans have long been supportive of ensuring that Americas servicemen and -women are easily able to accomplish their goal of achieving a postsecondary education degree. The Higher Education Opportunity Act passed last Congress included a number of new initiatives for servicemembers and veterans. The bill required the Secretary of Education to provide a Web site that should serve as a onestop shop for servicemembers to access information about all education benefits. This bill also included a program to provide funds to institutions to develop oncampus centers that will help servicemembers navigate everything from course registration to educational benefits to help pay for college. These programs will help ensure that these students receive all of the information they need without having to navigate through all the redtape. I recognize that many institutions already have militaryfriendly policies in place whether or not they are a part of this consortium. Through this resolution. we are encouraging even more institutions to review their policies and to think about whether there is more that they could give back to those who are fighting for Americas freedom. I certainly want to congratulate my colleague Mr. ADLER for introducing this important resolution. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Washington. and Pennsylvania on September 11. 2001. will live on in American memory as one of the darkest days in our Nations history. We can never forget the images of the members of the New York City Fire Department and Police Department. as well as other first responders. who demonstrated unsurpassed courage and bravery as they worked day and night to retrieve and rescue victims from Ground Zero. In the days shortly after September 11. Governor George Pataki asked the Navy to name a ship involved in counterterrorism after the State of New York to honor the sacrifice and strength of the people lost that fateful day. On November 7. 2009. the fifth San Antonioclass amphibious transport dock ship will be commissioned as the USS New York LPD 21. The ships bow is comprised of 72 tons of steel forged from the World Trade Center wreckage. F. Curtis Jones. a native son of New York. will serve as Commander. The USS New York will be able to deploy 700 marines and equipment to execute amphibious assault capability anywhere in the world on a moments notice. This ability is critical to our ongoing efforts to suppress terrorist organizations. as well as protect and defend the United States of America. Madam Speaker. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the captain and commissioning crew of the USS New York as their ship joins the United States Navy by supporting H. Res. 856. As a Mississippian.

This resolution supports partnerships between career and technical colleges. employers. and students so that students can be prepared to enter high demand technical fields. Career and technical education colleges help students apply practical information learned in the classroom to employment. CTE schools serve a diverse set of students. They serve secondary students who need job skills to transition into the workplace and employees who need to upgrade their skills for new technologies. Employers work with CTE programs to hire fully competent. welltrained workers for professional technical positions. As America has evolved from an industrial economy to a knowledge economy. the globalization of business and industry requires workers to acquire core knowledge and skills that can be applied in a wide and rapidly changing variety of work settings. With the changing business industry. employers want more competent. skilled workers. but they are having a difficult time finding these workers. More than 80 percent of respondents in the 2005 National Association of Manufacturers Skills Gap Report indicate that employers are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers. CTEs are situated to respond rapidly to changing job market demand to prepare potential employees. Along with CTEs. community colleges help spur the economy and provide a skilled workforce that contributes more than $31 billion to the Nations economy. This year. community colleges in this country will award more than 500.000 associate degrees and 270.000 associate certificates. November 4. 2009 CONGRE In September of this year. the House of Representatives passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act. This bill includes an unprecedented investment of $10 billion into community colleges by encouraging partnerships between community colleges. States. businesses. job training. and adult education programs. and by creating a new competitive grant program for community colleges to improve instruction. bolster student services and implement other innovative reforms. Community colleges play an important role in career and technical education. and in many communities are leading the way in providing workforce development programs that meet the needs of local businesses.

I rise today in support of House Resolution 880. recognizing the efforts of postsecondary Institutions offering career and technical education to educate and train workers for positions in highdemand industries. Postsecondary institutions that offer career and technical education are an incredibly valuable resource to our communities. These institutions enable adults in the community to improve their lives by furthering their education in order to improve their employability and working life. Career and technical education enables students to learn specific skills or earn a certificate or a degree that employers require or prefer. Many institutions that offer career and technical education also have valuable connections with employers in the community. These connections allow these institutions to better serve their students. Employers in highdemand industries are able to communicate with postsecondary institutions what skills. certificates and degrees they expect potential employees to exhibit. The close relationship between postsecondary institutions that offer career and technical education and employers provide students. and potential employees. with a valuable advantage. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that 15.6 million new jobs will be added to the labor force between 2006 and 2016.

On November 13. 1909. 400 miners went to work at the Cherry Mine In Cherry. Illinois. This mine was one of the first to have electric lighting. but on the day of the disaster. the system was not working. Instead. miners were using torches to light their way. Mules were being used to bring coal to the mine elevator. and the hay to feed those mules provided the fuel that started the fire that ultimately killed 263 miners. Miraculously. 200 miners working that day escaped. Even more amazing. though. 21 miners survived for 8 days underground with no food and little water. In order to suppress the fire. those above ground sealed the mine. Conditions below ground deteriorated rapIdly. Led by mine manager George Eddy. the 21 miners who survived went into the recesses of the mine to escape the fire and seek good air. Ultimately. the miners barricaded themselves deep in the mine. attempting to block out the bad air. They were able to pool water from seepage in their shelter. 55. Pt. 20 November 4. 2009 The tragedy of the Cherry Mine has sadly been repeated in one form or another throughout the history of mining. With this resolution. we honor those lost in the mine. We also honor those who demonstrated their courage and resolve in the face of the tragedy. Just as we see in todays miners. those trapped in the mine fought hard to stay alive. The men above ground did everything they could to put out the fire with the hope of saving their fellow workers. I rise today to recognize the loss at the Cherry Mine and to honor those who work in our mines today. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. Madam Speaker.

The genesis of Tree Fresno can be traced to a group of residents who had gathered during Fresnos Centennial in 1985 to explore ways to improve the city. This group of civicminded residents determined that the planting of trees would beautify the city and create more livable and walkable neighborhoods. The idea to beautify Fresno through the planting of trees was met with great support and enthusiasm from the community as evidenced by a telethon that netted $27.000funds that provided seed money for Tree Fresnos maiden project that resulted in the planting of trees in downtown and the citys vibrant Tower District. Over the past 25 years. Tree Fresno has spearheaded and successfully completed a number of communitywide efforts that have led to the greening of the greater Fresno area. Throughout the years. Tree Fresno has grown the tree canopy on local school campuses and along some of the major thoroughfares in Fresno such as Blackstone and McKinley Avenues. On one remarkable day in 2000. thousands of Tree Fresno volunteers planted 4.400 trees in and along an abandoned rail corridor between Fresno and Clovis. In addition to the planting of trees. Tree Fresno has also been instrumental in educating the public about the importance of responsible environmental stewardship. Through programs such as Tribute Trees. Trees for Campuses and Kids and the Junior Board of Tree 56. Pt. 11 16157 Fresno. the organization has made an indelible impact on raising the overall environmental awareness and efficacy of the residents. especially the young people. of Fresno and surrounding communities. The many accomplishments of Tree Fresno over the past 25 years are a testament to the vision of its founding members. the dedication of its staff and the support and commitment of thousands of volunteers and supporters who have given so generously to help make Fresno a better place to live. It is my pleasure to congratulate the board. staff and many friends of Tree Fresno for 25 years of environmental leadership in the greater Fresno area. I send my best wishes for many more years of continued success.*",

It is all too rare that we get to talk about successful partnerships between private industry and the Federal Government. This legislation would cement just such a successful partnership between a subsidiary of an Alaska Native Corporation. Doyon Limited and the National Park Service. Briefly this measure would authorize a special use permit and over the longer term an equal value land trade to facilitate a microhydro project within the nonwilderness portion of the Denali National Park. The microhydro project would allow Kantishna Roadhouse. a backeountry lodge that accommodates thousands of visitors a year. to substantially reduce their diesel use. Because the lodge is not connected to any utility grid. it must generate its own power. By converting much of the load to a renewable resource. the lodge would improve local air quality and reduce truck traffic on the single park access road. thus improving the experience for visitors to the lodge and park as a whole. It additionally would help the lodges bottom line. The legislation has been developed with the assistance of Alaska Region of the National Park Service. and they are supportive of the project. Eureka Creek. the source of the hydro power. is not a fishbearing stream. and the Park Service is interested in acquiring the lands to be traded from Doyon ownership.

California suffered a terrible tragedy when a natural gas transmission pipeline unexpectedly exploded beneath a busy residential neighborhood. The catastrophic explosion and the resulting fire was a horrific event. creating a massive fireball that many described as the largest earthquake they had ever felt. The tragedy killed four people. injured 66. and destroyed nearly three dozen homes. Preliminary estimates put the cost of the damage and recovery at $65 million. This tragic incident should not have happened. Californians and all Americans must feel confident that their communities are safe and that the regulatory agencies responsible for ensuring the safety of natural gas pipelines are doing everything possible to guarantee their safety. That is why we are introducing this legislation today. Our bill is based on the Department of Transportations. DOT. proposal for improving pipeline safety and includes additional provisions to address concerns raised by the San Bruno blast. The Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010 will increase the number of Federal inspectors and require the Department of Transportation to certify an inspection method for gas lines that cannot use \"smart pig\" technology. \"Smart pig\" technology is used to test the structural integrity of a pipe and identify any defects. The bill would also require DOT to promulgate regulations for the installation of automatic and remote shutoff valves. update the definition of \"high consequence areas\" to include seismicity of the area. age of the pipe and whether a pipe is able to use the \"smart pig\" technology. and require DOT to set standards for detecting leaks on natural gas lines.

I think this is a very important resolution which highlights an issue that directly impacts not just national security but employment in my district and many others. Science. technology. engineering. and mathematics are the backbone of Californias 36th District economy. We are the home to the Los Angeles Air Force Base Space and Missile Systems Center and to large facilities of all of the major aerospace firms. as well as critically important innovative second and third tier suppliers. As I am fond of saying. my district is the aerospace center of the universe. L.A. Countys unemployment rate is over 13 percent. but the 36th Congressional Districts unemployment is half that. almost entirely because of science and technology jobs. especially in the aerospace industry. But the industry faces a coming \"gray wave.\" Some 60 percent of aerospace workers are over age 50. and almost 26 percent are already eligible for retirement. Not enough young scientists and engineers are coming out of college to fill their ranks. Mr. Speaker. we cant build rockets without rocket scientists. and other countries know that. The United States graduates about 70.000 engineers annually. a meager 15 percent. China graduates over half a million engineers every year. We not only need the next generation of spacecraft to reach Mars and beyond. we need the next generation of space engineers to get us there. And if we are to maintain space dominance when others. especially China. challenge us. we need more engineers. While we are struggling to educate enough engineers to assume the torch from those retiring. we are also losing many of them to the sexy new world of Internet technology. Building rockets is losing luster to Facebook. eBay. Google and other IT firms. If we want to continue to be the worlds leader in space. we have to get our young people dreaming bigger. literally dreaming out of this world. We need to inspire our young people the same way President Kennedy did 50 years ago when he committed the United States to winning the space race. STEM education is the key. Mr. Speaker.

Engineering. and Mathematics. As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee and of the House Science and Technology Committee. it is absolutely clear to me that our countrys ability to develop. to prosper. and to compete will depend upon investing in our childrens educations and in the scientific community. A central piece of this effort must be to encourage girls and underrepresented minorities to be involved in STEM at the K12 undergrad and graduate levels so they can. if they choose. turn their educations into careers. They dont have to take the careers of STEM. but they have to be prepared to make those choices by the time they get to college. That is why I sponsored the Patsy T. Mink Fellowships. which President Bush signed into law in 2008 as part of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. The Patsy T. Mink Fellowships provide encouragement for women and minorities to go into the graduate programs where they are represented. such as into the STEM programs. and then to move into teaching in these fields. I am also preparing to reintroduce a bill. Go Girl. as it has been previously entitled for the many. many years that Ive been here. which will provide grants to schools to promote STEM education for girls. and we have included underrepresented minorities for K12 students. Mr. Speaker. helping young women and minorities go into these STEM fields is an investment in our future as a country. so I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H. Res. 1213.",

We need to increase professional involvement with our youth throughout our educational pipeline. Efforts such as National Lab Day will help bring about positive change for our country. It is no mystery that STEM professionals will cure the next epidemic and invent the next technological breakthrough. Ultimately. a nation that graduates a high amount of STEM professionals will be a nation that will thrive in the 21st century. These fields are among the highest paying and the most stable. Their rate of growth is increasing exponentially as our society grows increasingly technological and our world becomes more interconnected. Mr. Speaker. the time to act is now.

Res. 1213. which recognizes the need to improve the performance of American students in the science. technology. engineering. and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 2006. 4.5 percent of students in the United States graduated from college with a STEMrelated diploma. By comparison. 33 percent of students in China graduated in the STEM field. The United States has been a global leader in technology and innovation for decadesbut we will quickly fall behind unless our country encourages more young people to pursue STEM careers. We must take an all hands on deck approach to improve our national STEM outlook. National Lab Day helps drive young students curiosity for science and technology by encouraging handson projects in the classroom that prove the sciences are fun. We must work to ensure that high schoolers. particularly young women and atrisk students. take college prep courses in science and math that prepare them for future careers as scientists. And we must stand by young scientists while they are in college to see that they graduate with a STEM diploma in hand. Improving STEM opportunities both professionally and in the classroom has long been a priority for me. and I continue to be amazed by the type of work that is happening in my own district. For example. Polyera. a nanotech company in Skokie. Illinois. is working to develop polymer inks for organic photovoltaics. or printed solar cells. Imagine a company thats able to print off solarpowered cells just as easily as printing off a newspaper. Nanotechnology is an absolutely incredible step forward. but what I get excited about. especially when Im talking to the next generation of potential scientists. is that they are already thinking about the next big thing. A cure for cancer. putting an astronaut on Mars. or finding new sources of renewable energythese are challenges that will be solved by todays STEM student. There is a place for initiatives that motivate students to pursue STEM throughout their educational careers. With targeted action. like that encouraged by National Lab Day. we can remain global leaders in this vital field. Again. I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1213.",

Charles Townes produced what would become a precursor to the laserthe first microwave amplifier. Townes and his colleagues teamed up with Bell Laboratories in 1957 to begin extensive research on the amplification devices. Their focus shifted only to those amplifiers which produced visible light. In 1958. Bell Laboratories submitted a patent for an optical laser. However. such a device had yet to be successfully created. It was not until Charles Townes and Gordon Gould met in 1958 that the fundamentals of the laser and of the open resonator design were first discussed. In 1960. Theodore Maiman constructed the first operational laser. He used theories and plans published by Bell Labs. Gould. and Townes to construct this remarkable device. Charles Townes was later awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics. along with scientists Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov. for their work in quantum electronics. which laid the groundwork for the construction of lasers. We rely on lasers in our daily lives. and they are found in everyday products. such as laser printers. barcode scanners. and numerous medical devices. The world sales of lasers are estimated at well over $5 billion to date. Today. in large part. we realize that great success stories. such as the construction of lasers. are due to American ingenuity. which stems directly from the investment in basic research and in our outstanding institutions of higher learning. The laser is a prime example of basic research that ended up having multiple applications well beyond what its creators could have ever conceived. The construction of the laser is but one example that leaves me confident in Americas place at the top of the scientific world.

Lets review the technological. scientific. and political accomplishment that the TIROS I satellite represents. In October of 1957. the launch by the Soviet Union of the Sputnik satellite struck fear in the hearts of Americans. Sputnik II went into space weighing over 1.000 pounds and carrying a dog. Meanwhile. the United States was developing far smaller satellites and experiencing troubles and public setbacks. On December 6. 1957. a Vanguard rocket failed to launch a U.S. satellite into space when it exploded on national television. In January 1958. the U.S. successfully launched a 31pound Explorer I satellite. but even this victory was quickly followed by the loss of another Vanguard satellite in February. As the early space race continued through 1958 and 1959. the Soviet Union always seemed to be a step ahead of the United States. The shock of Sputnik and the fear that the United States was losing its competitive edge inspired a national effort to prove and improve American leadership in the fields of science. math. and engineering. The U.S. poured energy and resources into basic research and development as well as science. technology. engineering. and mathematics education. Less than 3 years after the launch of Sputnik. these investments were beginning to pay off. The usefulness of satellites to observe the Earth remained unproven. and by 1960. U.S. scientists and engineers had designed and built a new series of satellites to test the proposition and to demonstrate American dominance. The first launch of TIROS in April of 1960 was a clear U.S. victory in the space race. and it was the worlds first meteorological satellite and the first to relay video images of the Earth from above. TIROS represented a scientific milestone and a clear message to our rivals and to ourselves that we had an \"eye in the sky\" and we could watch the planet. During the 78 days that it was in operation. TIROS I sent home almost 23.000 images. including those of a tropical storm. the cloud system of a large",

Galileos brilliant refinements of existing telescope designs allowed humans for the first time to discern the Earths closest neighbors to a level of detail that was breathtaking. such as valleys of the Moon. fellow planets in our solar system. and the moons of Jupiter. Most importantly. unlike his peers who trained their telescopes to look across the Earths terrain. Galileo instead aimed his telescopes to look out into the heavens. Four hundred years later. who could have imagined the transformations unleashed by Galileo and his search of the night skies. both in terms of designs and capabilities of followon telescopes. as well as informing Earths inhabitants of their genesis and their place in the universe. Today. groundbased telescopes sitting high atop mountain peaks are collecting immense amounts of data. enabling astronomers to discover new details about our solar system. our galaxy. and our universe. Just as important. their findings raise new questions. leading to followon research campaigns all across the globe. Spacebased telescopes. which have only been launched in the last several decades. have been equally spectacular. Virtually every citizen on Earth has seen pictures produced by the Hubble. Chandra. Compton. and Spitzer space telescopes. And the future of spacebased and groundbased astronomy promises to be just as exciting. To cite one example. NASA is hard at work completing construction of the James Webb space telescope. scheduled to be launched in 2014. It is designed to look at the infrared spectrum and will have a mirror thats 21 feet across. far larger than the mirror on Hubble. The potential discoveries that await are unknown.

H.R. 3246 will advance technologies of the future by reauthorizing the Department of Energys vehicle technology program and build on an existing energy infrastructure to demonstrate and deploy more fuelefficient automobiles and heavy equipment. Over the years. the Department of Energy has worked with the industry to develop. demonstrate. and deploy vehicle technologies for automobiles and heavyduty vehicles. Some of those research needs have been addressed through publicprivate research programs like the 21st Century Truck Partnership. the FreedomCAR. and Hydrogen Fuel Initiatives. Unfortunately. in the past. our research priorities have shifted inconsistently between passenger and heavyduty vehicles. As a result. many longterm goals remain unfulfilled. H.R. 3246 offers the research parity and focus to advance technologies all across transportation sectors by including medium- to heavyduty trucks and nonroad equipment. While the total number of heavy trucks is small compared to passenger vehicles. their fuel consumption and emissions justify a consistent investment in basic research and development of hybrid models and other advanced truck technologies. There is no onesizefitsall approach that will address the unique needs and demands on construction. industrial and agricultural equipment. Therefore. we must examine the full range of components within nonroad equipment systems to produce the greatest overall efficiency benefits at the least cost. I know everyone here recognizes the essential role nonroad equipment plays in improving our infrastructure. Fuel remains a primary driver in the cost of major construction and infrastructure projects. With advances in nonroad equipment technologies. we will further our drive for efficiency and fuel savings beyond the engine alone so that we can see tremendous benefits in project productivity and energy efficiency.

It will be essential for Congress to follow through and fully fund this authorization in the annual appropriations process. I am particularly pleased that this bill recognizes the enormous fuel savings potential in the medium and heavy duty market and specifies that up to $200 million per year be devoted to developing advanced technology medium and heavy duty trucks. This complements legislation Ive introduced to extend the tax credits for the purchase of medium and heavy duty trucks for 5 years and double the amount of the credits. These vehicles move 80 percent of the goods transported in the U.S.. serve as utility maintenance vehicles. and perform refuse collection services in our communities. It is estimated that the fuel consumption of the 90.000 refuse collection trucks in the U.S. is equivalent to 2.5 million passenger vehicles. Putting as few as 10.000 hybrid electric trucks on the road would reduce diesel fuel use by 7.2 million gallons per year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 83.000 tons. In a word Mr. Chair. this bill is vital. It is a vital step toward a full partnership between the Federal Government and the domestic auto industry in developing the cars and trucks of the future and building them here in the United States. I urge all my colleagues to support it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I wish to express my strong support for H.R. 3246. the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of The global competition for producing the cars and trucks of the future is happening now. There is no question that in the years ahead. people will be driving hybrids. plugin hybrids. battery electric vehicles. and cars and trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells. The question is whether these technologies will be imported from abroad. or produced right here in the United States by a sustainable. cuttingedge American automobile industry. The global economic downturn and credit crisis have limited the resources that automakers and vehicle manufacturers can draw on to support their research and development activities. As American automakers struggle to become globally competitive and we race to make the best and most fuelefficient vehicles. we have a chance to accelerate their development through the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2009. The Advanced Vehicle Technology Act will reauthorize the Department of Energys Vehicle Technologies Program. through which the Department partners with industry to provide research. development. demonstration. and commercial application of advanced vehicle technologies in the U.S. These programs have led to numerous successes. including a dualmode hybrid transmission system used in transit buses and trucks manufactured in the U.S. Through supporting advanced vehicle technologies. this legislation also reaffirms our commitment to reducing energy use to combat global warming and increase Americas energy independence by reducing the need for imported oil. Recognizing the importance of this legislation. H.R. 3246 has been endorsed by General Motors. Ford Motor Company. Chrysler. the UAW. Nissan. the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. Daimler. Magna International Delphi. ArvinMeritor. Robert Bosch LLC. Caterpillar. Dueco Odyne. Achates Power. and the Engine Manufacturers Association. Let us invest in American energy independence.

Chairman GORDON. and his colleagues on the Science and Technology Committee for their contributions to the future of advanced automobile technologies in the U.S. As long as we are exporting our dollars overseas in exchange for oil. our economic and national security are at risk. The future of the American auto industry and thousands of American jobs rest on the ability of domestic car companies to research. develop. and commercialize new. clean. efficient technologies. including hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. that will be the backbone of a new U.S. vehicle market and economy. Hydrogen fuel cells can provide power for a wide array of transportation applications. Fuel Cells are a proven technology and already in use today. In Hartford. CT. the transit department is using a fuel cell powered bus that emits no pollution. Every time we replace a gasoline powered bus with a fuel cell bus it is equal to removing 77 cars from our roadways. The hydrogen and fuel cell industry already supports 2.100 jobs in Connecticut alone and with this bill is poised to add many others. Hydrogen fuel cells are clean and efficient and will allow us to become more energy independent while reducing carbon emissions. Supporting this bill will give us more options to create jobs in Connecticut. keep America competitive. and reduce pollution. I encourage a \"yes\" vote on this bill.",

It is typical of a big. complex bill such as this that it is difficult to pass. and you get a sense every now and then of whether it is likely to pass or unlikely to pass. This week has been a particularly difficult week for the bill. I have noticed the majority leader trying to create a sense of inevitability about the bill. But. increasingly. it seems to me. with it becoming clear that with so much of it being paid for by new taxes. and then last night the chief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services saying the cost is going up. premiums are going up. with the Mayo Clinic saying it is beginning to not take Medicare patients. and the idea of putting millions more Americans into a program already going broke which you are taking $1 trillion out of is a bad idea.

Quinnipiac said 14 percent more disapproved than approved. the week before Gallup said 9 percent more disapproved than approved. We can see what is happening here: widening public opposition.

But then it began to have so many problems. and the red flags began to pop up just like they are popping up with this comprehensive health care bill. There came a time. perhaps much like December 10. when the sense of inevitability was replaced by a sense that we were making a historic mistake. and a bill that got on the floor with 64 votes only had 46 to get off. I have a feeling this bill. the more we learn about it. the wiser thing to do is to let it fall of its own weight.

As you start seeing the evidence mount. and the fact that the American public is understanding the weight of this mounting evidence about this legislation. we could be at the tipping point right now. where it has become so evident that the purpose behind health care reform has not only been missed by this legislation. but it has been made worsethe objectives. I point to this chart. the cost curve. When you talk to most Americans about what they believe the purpose behind health care reform is. the vast majority say it is to control the skyrocketing costs. Well. those who are promoting the bill say it does that. it bends that cost curve. Which cost curve? Is it the size of government? That goes up $2.5 trillion in the first full 10 years of implementation. The cost of health carethe CMS report came out. it is about the 10th report. but this is from the actuary of the Medicare and Medicaid system who analyzed this independently. and he says health care costs are going to go up. not down. The CBO said the cost of insurance is going to go up. not down. The Federal deficitthey say the bill doesnt make the Federal deficit go up. In fact. regarding that. the only way they can claim that is if they implement their budget gimmicks of delaying implementation of the bill for 4 years on the spending side. while raising taxes now. or if they raise hundreds of billions in taxes and cut Medicare by hundreds of billions of dollars. These things are starting to be understood by the American people. That is why I believe we are starting to see those kinds of answers in the polls. It is not just the CNN poll. as the leader knows.

You can fairly say the amendment. rather. has no other purpose than to facilitate a strong argument. On Tuesday. when Senator CRAPO laid down his amendment. the majority didnt show us this sidebyside amendment until shortly before we thoughtand they thoughtwe were going to vote. So that very limited notice makes you think it may be more likely to distract from or muddy the clear question the Senator from Idaho brought. that is. the motion to commit before the Senate. The motion was designed to be to be straightforward. and the Senator did that. A vote for the motion is a vote to send the Reid amendment and underlying bill back to the Finance Committee. Under the motion. the Finance Committee would report back a bill that eliminates the tax increases on middleincome taxpayers. One could not say it anymore simply. That is what the motion does. The other bill is a straw man. After the remarks by the distinguished leader. I would say this may be a seminal event. I think that is one of the key votes where the other side could start to realize this and start to finalize this without all the rhetoric and ideology and philosophical support for this bill. and they could start the road back. if you will. of doing it in a stepbystep. thoughtful waydoing it. meaning real health care reform.

This tax increase is just one of the many tax increases likely to stay in the new Democratic proposal. On this chart. which is for the year 2019. because that is when this bill Is fully implemented. we see positive dollar figures. I have highlighted these dollar figures in yellow. For those who may not be able to see. I will reiterate that this chart only has positive dollar figures on it. But remember. as I explained yesterday. when we see positive dollar figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation. that committee is telling us that taxes for these people are going to go up. That means for all of the tax returns listed on this chart. taxes will be going up for each. And this tax increase. the medical expense deduction limitation. reaches as low as someone making $10.000 a year. Maybe some of these lowincome individuals and families who will see a tax increase under this provision will receive a subsidy for health insurance. These people may be able to offset this new tax liability. But you can bet your bottom dollar that a large portion of the middleincome individuals and families are not receiving a subsidy. This means that this tax liability highlighted In yellow cannot be offset by the government benefit. My Democratic friends cannot escape that fact. Even if my friends drop some of the tax provisions in the current Reid bill. many tax provisions will most likely remain. And those tax provisions will increase taxes on middleclass Americans.

He also served as the president of the Louisville Bar Foundation. In 1986. Mr. Doll was named Lawyer of the Year by the Louisville Bar Association. Bob was also active in his community. as he served as president of the Greater Louisville YMCA board of directors and maintained a leading role in the Boy Scouts of America.

Since its enactment 1 year ago. the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act has cemented the importance of volunteerism and community involvement in American society. This legislation reflects the willingness of Americans to dedicate their time and effort to help their neighborhoods through a common goal of community improvement. The success of the Serve America Act is apparent not only in its progress so far. but in those results yet to come. The creation of 175.000 new volunteer opportunities. through existing service programs such as AmeriCorps. is increasing volunteerism in America to the highest level since 2003. The Serve America Act has demonstrated that even in this period of economic uncertainty. investment in communities continues to reap the highest rewards. The Serve America Act has allowed Americans to play an active role in our economic recovery through their volunteerism by empowering individuals to initiate real and lasting development within their communities. And by rewarding those who volunteer their services even during their fulltime education. this legislation has enabled countless diligent students to combine community activism with greater educational possibilities. I am particularly proud that this legislation created the Musicians and Artists Corps that I championed to train and deploy skilled musicians and artists to low income communities. schools. health care and therapeutic settings. and other areas. where they promote music and arts engagement programs. As someone who knows firsthand the proven social benefits of music and creative arts programs. I believe this program will have tremendous rewards. The Serve America Act has been a call to service to all Americans. and undoubtedly it has inspired American citizens from all walks of life to give back to their communities. The Musicians and Artists Corps allows musicians and artists who are eager to serve to contribute their special skills and diverse talents to this community of activism. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act has contributed significantly to increasing service in our country. and I am proud to commemorate its passage and support its continuing good work.",

My top priority as chairwoman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Terrorism. Unconventional Threats. and Capabilities is to provide all the necessary resources to our military in order to protect our country from terrorist threats. I would like to especially recognize our U.S. Special Operations Forces. who have been an integral part of our counterterrorism strategy. The U.S. Special Operation Forces have been successful in developing valuable relationships with the governments in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ultimately leading to the capture of hundreds of al Qaeda fighters and affiliates. However. terrorism is not limited to Iraq and Afghanistan. Currently. our forces are also in regions such as Yemen to root out terrorists and send a loud message to those who seek to do us harm that we will not let them operate freely like that. Congress must be proactive about addressing all terrorist threats to our country through intelligence. diplomacy and with our Armed Forces.",

I have been arguing that the terrorist at Detroit Metro Airport that was arrested there is an unlawful enemy combatant who should be tried in a military commission. The decision to try this terrorist in civilian court. to give him the right to remain silent. as well as giving him three taxpayerfunded attorneys. is absolutely wrong. in my opinion. Mr. Speaker. as well. this trial will place undue costs and manpower burdens on the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan. neither of which is in a position to absorb additional securityrelated costs. It is wrong. Mr. Speaker. to ask hardpressed communities. local communities. to pay these costs simply because we were the targets of this attack while we played no role in the decision to hold this trial in the City of Detroit. It was the decision of Eric Holder and the Federal Government to try this terrorist in civilian court in Detroit. so I think that the additional costs to local and State government should be borne by the Federal Government. The Department of Homeland Security must stand up and guarantee to fund any cost to the City of Detroit or the County of Wayne or the State of Michigan that they would not normally incur. 0I 1615",

Our amendment will help our domestic timber industry remain competitive and will help ensure against further domestic timber manufacturing job losses. We are talking about job creation. We are talking about job recovery. We are talking about ensuring that we do not lose any more of these vital jobs in rural America that sustain this country. It would extend provisions enacted in the farm bill set to expire this year which help large integrated and small familyowned companies. as well as the shareholders of timber REITs. In short. the amendment would provide a uniform 15percent rate for cutting timber and additionally would reform the timber REIT rules. This policy change has strong bipartisan support. It has passed the Senate in the past and will do a great deal to protect our timber jobs right here at home. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to protect the jobs we have in rural America in our timber and forest products industry.",

I think most of us feel somewhat the same way. I am growing increasingly concerned about the bill. as to whether it Is really going to be a stimulus. I come from a State which has more people unemployed today than the population of a dozen States. a State where the breadlines are growing. where the need for assistance is growing. where the State has a huge deficit. where counties are unable to fund their operating maintenance. where all capital projects have stopped. and where the State is now furloughing employees. I think while we dither. Rome burns. This crisis is so multidimensional and the dominoes are falling so much more rapidly than any of us thought and they are pushed from so many different points. The fact is that people cannot get creditcredit for your big corporations to open a new hotel. credit. if you are a small employer. to pay your payroll. Credit remains frozen. The housing crisis continues to work its problems. What. In my view. a stimulus is not. candidly speaking. is a tax package. I do not believe in this economy tax cuts are stimulus. The current state of the package. as I understand it. is that tax cuts are roughly 40 percent of the package. 20 percent is local assistance. State and local assistance. 15 percent is safety net spending. 15 percent is infrastructure spendingthat is alland 10 percent is other spending.

The technical explanation expresses the committees understanding and legislative intent behind this very important piece of legislation. It is available on the Joint Committees Web site at www.jet.gov and is listed under the document No. JCX4409. Over 6 weeks ago. the House sent legislation in a bipartisan way to the Senate to extend unemployment insurance for workers who live in high unemployment districts. high unemployment States. that have already used all of the tiers of the benefits available under current law. Since that time. hundreds of thousands of workers have lost or gone without unemployment compensation. This committee. with the leadership and working together in a bipartisan way. sent to the Senate a bill which allowed an additional 14 weeks of unemployment benefits in every State and a total of 20 weeks in high unemployment States. Our committees worked hard together in order to soften the blow that so many hundreds of thousands of people have felt. Mr. Speaker. I yield the balance of my time to Chairman JIM McDERMOTT. who. over his lifetime. has spent so much time in trying to improve the quality of lives of those that have suffered economic deficits in this great country of ours. and with the permission from the Speaker.

Mr. Speaker. has been the housing industry. and the tax credit that weve given firsttime homebuyers. according to the Realtors and the homebuilders with whom Ive talked. has been a real plus. That is one of the few things that weve done around here that has helped the economy and helped create some jobs. Now. in this bill. were not only extending the firsttime homebuyer credit. which I think is going to help the economy. but were also going to say to people that already own homes. were going to give you a $6.500 tax credit if you choose to move up and buy another house. Thats been one of the shortcomings that weve had over the last few months. because people that want to get another home feel like with the economy being the way it is right now. they dont want to move. But if you encourage them with a $6.500 tax credita tax credit. We like tax cuts and tax credits. If we give them a $6.500 tax credit. I guarantee you there is going to be a lot of people that will move up into more homes. newer homes. and it will really help economic growth in this country. So I just want to congratulate the sponsors. even on the Democrat side. for putting this in the bill. I really think this is a plus. I dont compliment my colleagues too much over there. but the $8.000 tax credit that is being extended for firsttime homebuyers is good. and the $6.500 tax credit for people that are going to buy a home. a second home or a third home. as they get rid of their first one. I really think this is going to be a plus for the economy. So even though I disagree with my colleagues 95 percent of the time. this is one time they have put something good in a bill.",

The stimulus went into effectpartially. anywayafter we passed it in February with no votes from the other side. and in the third quarter of this year. were at a loss of 256.000. Thats a gain of 435.000 jobs. You compare that to the last year. the last 4 years of the former administration. and I think that the stimulus has been a great help. This Congress is working hard to get people back on their feet. For this reason. it is imperative that. today. we pass the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. I am proud to say that weve also extended the homebuyer assistance through the firsttime homebuyer tax credit while putting in place new and significant fraud protection. I think thats important.

We had 14 percent inflation. When Ronald Reagan came in. Mr. Volcker had to raise the interest rates. or did raise the interest rates. to 21.5 percent. What happened was the economy took another huge nosedive because of the terrible inflation and economic problems that were created during the Carter administration. which was not threequarters of a century ago. it was just a mere 20some years ago. The other thing I would like to say is that while we are doing the right thing by passing this bill. and I complimented my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for the extension of the home building credit for firsttime homebuyers and adding to it the tax credit for secondtime homebuyersand I think those are great steps in the right direction. and I will support this billthe things that they are doing on the other side of the aisle with the stimulus bill. $1 trillion. with the health care bill that they are going to try to ram through here Saturday thats going to cost $1 to $3 trillion that we dont have. when there is a better way to do that. really troubles me.

But I do know the organizations that represent small businesses that we are all well acquainted withNational Federation of Independent Business. the Chamber of Commerce. the National Association of Manufacturers. the National Association of Wholesalers and Distributors. builders and contractors. electric contractors. franchise associationsI can go right down the list.-all say this does nothing to lower their costs. In fact. it increases the cost of doing business. increases the cost of doing health care. What they have argued repeatedly is one of the suggestions the Senator from Tennessee mentioned. that small business health plans would drive their health care costs down. which is why they have been such strong advocates for this over the years. I guess the other question I would ask of my colleague from Tennessee is. would an approach. a suggestion like small business health plans require tax increases that would hit small businesses? Incidentally. the latest version with the managers amendment. which we just received Saturday. increases the tax increases in the bill that were previously $493 billion and are now $518 billion. As the Senator mentioned. with the tax credit businesses get. they up that a little bit but not enough to help most small businesses in light of the $518 billion in tax increases in the first 10 years. and when it is fully implemented it will be about $1 trillion. But the payroll tax that is going to hit a lot of small businesses was increased dramatically in the managers amendment. The individual mandate was almost doubled in the managers amendment. So the taxes in the bill go up with this proposal. I guess my question is. with all these tax increases that are going to have a crushing Impact on small businesses.. does a suggestion such as the one made by the Senator from Tennessee for small business health plans require tax increases or Medicare cuts. which is what is going to be necessary to finance this 2.700page behemoth?",

Half the doctors in the country do not take care of patients on Medicaid because the reimbursement is so low that they cannot afford to continue to care for those people.

    "speech": "Each Member of the Senate will have to decide once again when this bill emerges from the conference whether he or she wants to be one of the 60 votes necessary to take up and pass the conference report. In this case my own sense of the Senate is the same as that expressed in the last few days by Senators CONRAD. NELSON. and others. If significant changes are made to the Senate bill in conference. it will be difficult to hold the 60 votes we now have. I have two priorities that will matter a lot to me. The first is to continue and maintain the health care reforms that will improve the costeffectiveness of our health care system and help reduce the national debt. Second. I hope there will be no attempt to reinsert a socalled public option in any form in the conference report. That would mean I will not be able to support the report. I want to support it. I believe I am not alone in that opinion among the 60 who supported the bill last night. Our exploding national debt is the biggest threat to our Nations future. That means we must begin to make politically difficult decisions to reduce our debt. That means saying no to some groups and some ideas. including some we would otherwise support. because we simply cannot afford them. A final hope about the conference report. Perhaps some will say it is naive. I hope the conferees will find a way to produce a report that can be supported by some Republican Members of the Senate and House. It is a sad commentary on this moment in our political history that so major a reform will be adopted with no bipartisan support. Hopefully the conference will find a way. difficult as I know it might be. to conclude this long legislative journey with a bill that is not only worth supporting. as I believe the Senate bill now surely is. but also engages the support of Members of both parties.

That is somebody who is very well respected on the majority side. and it is something we have been saying. and they are saying the same thing. The fact is. what we are going to do is put 15 million people into Medicaid that we know has worse outcomes. we know is an unfunded mandate on the States. and we know 40 percent of the doctors refuse to see them.

The title of his letter to the editor is. \"The First Cost Controller Will Be Your Own Doctor.\" It is something I have been talking about since we started this.

He said a previous article written: ... doesnt emphasize a potential stealth costcontrol aspect proposed in the bill. It will start pilot programs that would transfer the gatekeeper role to doctors at the bedside. a role cuirently held by \"payers\" (HMOs and goveinmentagency insurers. including Medicare and Medicaid). The transfer will be via capitation fee payments. making clinics \"responsible\" for the cost of care of \"insured lives\" for one year. S.. The illusion of many pundits and policy makers is that mini provider gatekeepers can control costs after the very powerful payer gatekeepersThat is. Medicare. Medicaid. and the large insurance companieshave failed for decades. The problem for patients is the dilemma of all managedcare gatekeepers: cost. quality. access. pick any two. It is not pleasant to think that ones gatekeeper doctor will have to decide whether to order surgery for your painful [worn out] hip or only to increase the dose ofAntiinflammatories because they are worried about costs.

Only a week before her death. the City Council of Rock Hill recognized Harriet Bucy for her role in having Rock Hill selected among the one hundred best communities in America for young people. Accomplishments like these will last long after her. Harriet Bucy was an artist and used her passion for art to teach it to others. Her spirit and ability as a teacher won her the notice of school district officials. and she was drafted for a succession of assignments. In each. it became clear that she had a gift for inspiring and managing others. Harriet Bucy was a founder of the Rock Hill School District Foundation. and helped it build a network of support. and provide numerous teachers with thousands of dollars in scholarship grants.

Governor Rileys Education Improvement Act mandated more involvement between schools and community. without specifying how these relationships were to be created.

And in my home state of North Carolina. the elderly population is growing much faster than the national average. As our population ages. a rising number of baby boomers will become susceptible to one or more chronic health conditions that will cost our Medicare system billions of dollars. At the same time. our citizens age 65 and over have expressed an overwhelming preference to live independently at home for as long as possible. among family and friends. What is the solution? Since the elderly population overwhelmingly prefers to receive their healthcare at home and since such treatment is much more cost effective. our government should be investing in home healthcare. Today. home healthcare is more than just basic. longterm care. It is much more advanced and sophisticated. Highly skilled nurses and therapists are already working within the existing Medicare system to help patients manage heart disease. diabetes. balance problems and other illnesses that. if not properly treated. can increase the cost to Medicare.

They all deserve recognition as partners in this quest to get peoples attention on the most neglected side of the public safety equation. our firefighters. This legislation. we think. is unique. We had a difficult time in the beginning when were writing this legislation. It took about 2 years. We had about enough people to fit in a telephone booth. And then we brought the firefighters to Washington. and all of a sudden. we had over 280 sponsors. November 18. 2009 CONGRE In the 106th Congress. prior to. the former speaker just pointed out. 9/11. that FIRE Act passed. It had bipartisan support. There was no Federal support for our brave firefighters. be they career or volunteer. They were working with outdated equipment. In some places in the country. they had to push the equipment to the fire. literally. They couldnt get the necessary training in order to provide the best protection for their local communities. The one thing we made sure we took care of is that there would not be a differential. there would not be a firewall. so to speak. between the volunteers and the career. If you look at the grants of the first 5 or 6 years. there is an overpreponderance of volunteer departments. because we did not want to make this what so many bills in the past had been. And I might add. Mr. Chairman. this money goes directly to the communities. no skimming. no nonsense: $6.5 billion. both of these bills. the SAFER bill. which deals with our personnel. in 9 years. over $15 billion requested. We are far from even close to responding to the needs that existed before 9/11. This legislation. in its ranking and review. the FIRE Grants program itself received the second highest rating of any program in the Department of Homeland Security. The only agency that beat It out by one percentage point was the Secret Service. Since the inception of the FIRE and SAFER grants. the programs have provided over. as I said. $6.5 billion for our local communities. And the point I want to make here is that the FIRE Grants programs are as vital and necessary today as they were in 2000.",

We salute them. Weve had two major studies from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. The \"all clear\" should not have been given to these people who worked in hazardous situations.

Chief Casson of the Cottonwood Fire Department and Chief Moore of the Clarkdale Fire Department both explained that for their small departments. SAFER grants can make all the difference in whether they have the number of firefighters on staff required to keep their communities safe. With the economic downturn. SAFER has become more important than ever. but falling tax revenues make meeting the matching requirement difficult. This has happened to small fire departments across the Nation. Many have even returned the grants they were awarded. 55. Pt. 21 28007 This is why I introduced H.R. 2759. which would waive the costsharing requirement for the most recent grant cycle. helping departments hire the staff they need during this tough time. While my legislation is not specifically contained within this act. I am glad that this bill significantly improves the SAFER program to help departments with these conditions. This act reduces the overall costshare requirement for departments and. more importantly. allows the director to waive this requirement in the case of economic hardship. Therefore. in the future. the departments with the greatest need should be able to take advantage of this program. Mr. Chairman. will you work with me to ensure that the SAFER works as intended. helps the departments most in need. and addresses the concerns of small. rural fire departments?",

It has been almost 10 years since the Cerro Grande fire ripped through thousands of acres in my district in northern New Mexico with devastating effect for the wildlife. the environment and the people in its path. Drought conditions and high temperatures contributed to the size of this fire. while dry winds accelerated its path through Los Alamos. Each year. fires plague our communities. They hurt people. They devastate communities. They devastate families. But when we can come together and make sure that we are working to provide support for our local fire departments. for our first responders and for those that put their lives on the line every day. we are able to make a difference. These FIRE grants will provide volunteer and career fire departments across the country with vital funding to increase firefighting capabilities. better respond to medical emergencies. handle natural disasters and operate more effectively. Supporting local fire departments is more important now than ever before. Now that States are facing many budgetary shortfalls. it has become increasingly difficult for local governments to maintain the equipment and training necessary. Mr. Chairman. as we came down today. I was reminded of a chief in New Mexico who lost his life responding to a fire about a week after he had just gotten word that he had received a grant for the fire district to replace the truck that broke down in the midst of a range fire that he lost his life in. These grants make a difference in peoples lives. To his wife. to his spouse. that fought so hard with us in New Mexico to get a fire fund in place to be able to help us out locally.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise to express my support for H.R. 3791. the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2009. The Fire and SAFER grant programs reauthorized by this bill are highly effective and vitally important programs which provide muchneeded support to fire departments and emergency responders across the country. As chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee. I strongly support reauthorization of these two grant programs. First responders rely on Fire grants for the training. vehicles. and equipment that are necessary to keep our communities safe. while SAFER grants provide the necessary funds to hire and train new firefighters and to help recruit and train volunteer firefighters. In 2008 alone. the Fire grant program received $3.2 billion in requests for grants. which highlights a serious need in the firefighter and first responder community for more resources. I continue to support strong funding for both the Fire and SAFER programs. I am pleased that H.R. 3791 authorizes $1 billion annually for the Fire program and approximately $1.2 billion annually for the SAFER program over the next 5 years. The Fiscal Year 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations Act that passed the House in June provided double the amount of funding for the SAFER program over last year. However. I am disappointed that the final funding level approved by Congress for the Fire grant program in Fiscal Year 2010 is $175 million less than last years funding for that program. Both of these programs merit robust funding. The bill under consideration today incorporates the unified recommendations of the major fire service organizations that represent volunteer. career. and combination fire departments across the country. For example. this bill adds an \"economic hardship waiver\" for the Fire grant program for fire departments that are unable to meet certain matching requirements or budget requirements. In addition. the bill adds an economic hardship waiver to allow fire departments to retain staff with SAFER grant funds whom they would otherwise have to lay off in these difficult economic times. This bill also allots 10 percent of Fire grants to the Fire Prevention and Safety program. which is up from 5 percent in previous years. I hope that both the Fire and SAFER grant programs will see continued support from this administration and the Democratic leadership. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in support of H.R. 3791. the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act. The economic downturn is adversely affecting the budgets of local governments and threatening a range of emergency services that communities count on. As declining state revenues force governors and city managers to make difficult choices. the budgets for programs that assist firefighters. first responders. and local communities nationwide with the equipment. training. and personnel have all been reduced. To help ease some of the burden. the Recovery Act and the FY09 Supplemental Appropriations Act included provisions designed to enhance the existing resources of the SAFER and AFG programs by waiving the matching requirements and restrictions for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. But. the Assistance to Firefighter Grant and the SAFER grants programs will expire in FY 2009 and FY 2010. We gather here today to reauthorize these programs until 2014. Today. not only must fire departments fight fires. they must also handle emergency medical services. and serve as first responders in the case of terrorist attacks or natural disasters. As the array of tasks falling to local fire departments has grown. SAFER and AFG grants have helped local communities keep pace. In addition to reauthorizing these two vital programs. H.R. 3791 permits the use of grant funds for volunteer and nonfire service emergency medical services organizations. increases funding for fire prevention and firefighter safety programs. and covers matching and maintenance requirements for fire departments facing economic hardship. Mr. Chair. these programs are vital to the safety and welfare of the American people. They need to be reauthorized. I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 3791.",

I recognize the value of improved data regarding fire department compliance with response standards. and I agree that we should aspire to help the fire service achieve higher compliance rates. However. I think it is important to note that a lack of compliance with these standards does not necessarily indicate a problem on the part of the department or local municipality. There are over 25.000 fire departments in the United States. all working under unique circumstances with respect to local hazards. populations. mutual aid agreements. operating budgets. and so on. In many cases. it simply does not make sense for departments to be in full compliance with what the Federal Government would consider full compliance with these standards based on their individual circumstances. particularly in rural areas where resources are very limited. For these reasons. I would hope that the task force established by this amendment considers these practical barriers to standards compliance in making recommendations to Congress regarding how best to improve standards compliance. I would just ask the gentleman if he would agree with this interpretation.",

The Pride Foundation created an endowment that would be prudently managed and professionally administereda place where the LGBT community and its supporters could confidently contribute knowing full well that their donations would not only be used in accordance with the donors wishes. but would also leave an enduring legacy for future generations. In 1987. the Pride Foundation awarded its first organization grants. totaling $7.654. Today. the Foundation grants hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.

Mr. Watson bravely and fearlessly enlisted to serve in the military and became a member of one of the most inspiring and decorated Air Force squadrons of our time. the Tuskegee Airmen. Despite racism and bigotry in the country. Mr. Watson and his fellow airmen selflessly devoted themselves to fight for our nation. Mr. Watson served as a Service Master for over twenty years. During WWII. Mr. Watson was sent into battle for one of the most harrowing and brave missions: to lifeflight wounded soldiers off the battlefield. He performed these duties faithfully and honorably and after 20 years of work. retired from service. As a young man. Mr. Watson and his fellow airmen became Americas first AfricanAmerican military airmen. These brave young men enlisted or joined from all over the country and trained to become fighter pilots. mechanics. engineers. intelligence analysts. and parachute riggers. among many other specialties. From 1941 to 1946. nearly 1.000 pilots graduated from the Tuskegee Air Force School. and four hundred fifty of them served overseas. These fighters had many accomplishments including flying over 15.000 sorties into enemy territory. accomplishing a nearly perfect record for not losing U.S. bombers. and destroying 112 German airplanes. These men not only faced a war abroad. but also challenges at home because of segregation and racism. Their struggle eventually contributed to the desegregation of American society and their patriotism was rewarded with several honors. most notably on March 27. 2007. when the Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional Medal of Honor. On September 23. 2010. a ceremony will be held to honor Mr. Watsons incredible life. His dedication and service inspired a generation. and I am proud to recognize Willie Watson. whose service to our country in its time of need will never be forgotten.",

In each of the cases reviewed by the GAO. there was a criminal conviction. a finding of civil or administrative Iiability. or a large financial settlement. In other words. everyone agrees that what happened is simply wrong. We do not need a change in Federal law for such behavior to be condemned. Sometimes the most powerful tool we have as elected officials is the bully pulpit. and Chairman MILLER and Mrs. MCMORRIs RODGERS have certainly availed themselves of it. They have worked hard to call national attention to the misuse of seclusion and restraints in our schools. States clearly recognize the need to proactively limit the use of these disciplinary tools. Today. 31 States have policies and procedures in place to govern when and how seclusion or restraint techniques may or may not be used. Another 15 States will have such protections in place in the near future. Many. many independent school districts and school boards have such procedures in place. The question today is: Who is best equipped to create and enforce those policies? To answer that question. I would point to a letter from the Council of the Great City Schools. which States. \"Every injury to a student in school is a matter of serious concern. but all such incidents are not necessarily matters of Federal law.\" In fact. until recently. the U.S. Department of Education was not even collecting data on the use of seclusion and restraint tactics in schools. The Department has no experience or expertise regulating in this area. Yet. H.R. 4247 would establish a new. onesizefitsall Federal framework that overrules the work of these States. I will include the letter from the Council of the Great City Schools in the RECORD. along with letters from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. the American Association of School Administrators. the Council for American Private Education. the American Association of Christian Schools. the Association of Christian Schools International. and the National Conference of State Legislatures.",

The hearing which was held at the Education and Labor Committee was one of the most stunning. amazing. eyeopening events. I think. of this Congress. The bipartisanship which came together after that hearing to craft this legislation. again. I think is a testament to your leadership and the bipartisanship that you have created on that committee. Mr. Speaker. back in 1998. The Hartford Courant won a Pulitzer Prize for a fourpart investigation of seclusion and restraint all across the country. The name of the series was \"A Nationwide Pattern of Death.\" which Id like to offer a copy of for the RECORD. and which. again. in chapter and verse. laid out the shocking. uneven application of this type of force against Americas schoolchildren. In Connecticut. it actually resulted in action in terms of legislation which was put into place. Many of the minimum standards which are included in the legislation were voting on today were incorporated into that measure. But. clearly. as a Nation. we have much more work to be done.

But it says as a Nation we are not going to tolerate this type of behavior. of which schools themselves are mandated reporters. If it was happening in a childs home. and as a teacher became aware of it. they would be required by law to report it to child protection agencies as a result of Federal law. We can do at least as much for the school environment which children go to every day in this country.

I would like to thank Chairman MILLER as well as the members and staff of the Education and Labor Committee for their leadership on this crucial piece of legislation. Last year. Chairman MILLER requested that the GAO investigate allegations of abuse in schools. The GAO report revealed many cases of abuse and harmful restraint. and most of those cases involved children with disabilities. Additionally. the GAO report found that no Federal agency or other entity collects comprehensive information on these practices that occur in our schools. Without consistent data collection. it is impossible to calculate an accurate number of children. families. and schools that have been affected by these harmful practices. Just one instance of harmful restraint of our children is one too many. Unfortunately. there have been hundreds of allegations. and some children have even died. Unlike federally funded institutions such as hospitals. schools have no Federal laws that address minimum safety standards in schools. Instead. State laws and regulations vary tremendously. which leave our children vulnerable. Indeed. New Jersey is one of the 19 States with no laws or regulations related to seclusion or restraint in schools. It is imperative that we protect our children and provide them with a safe place to grow and develop. As a former teacher. I know that teachers and other school employees have the best interests of the children at heart. This legislation can address the problems of harmful restraints and ensure the safety of both children and school professionals. This bill will provide grants for professional development training and also give States and local districts the flexibility to determine training needs. Our children deserve to learn in a secure. protected environment. and a Federal solution to this problem is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague for yielding time. No one wants children to be in danger in this country. especially children who are in public institutions designed to serve them. Teachers. principals. and other school personnel have a responsibility to ensure the environment is maintained at all times. In many cases. it is vitally important. though. that teachers and classroom aides use Interventions and supports that are both physically and emotionally safe for the child. What the bill before us fails to recognize is that 31 States currently have laws and regulations in place that govern the use of seclusion and restraints in schools. An additional 11 have policies and guidelines in place. and in some cases school districts may also have their own guidelines governing the use of such practices in the classroom. In addition. the Federal Government has no reliable data on the prevalent use of harmful seclusion and restraint techniques in public and private schools and whether they result in child abuse. It is my belief that State and local governments can identify student needs and determine the most appropriate regulations better and more efficiently than the Federal Government. Our Founding Fathers knew what they were doing when they assembled the U.S. Constitution and the protections it guarantees. specifically the 10th amendment. The authors of this amendment. ratified in 1971. remembered what it was like to be under the thumb of a distant. allpowerful government and understood that a onesizefitsall approach just doesnt work. Since the U.S. Constitution was first ratified. the Federal Government has slowly. steadily. and insidiously eroded the notion of States rights and our individual liberties. What we need to focus on. as the distinguished ranking member talked about earlier. is the strong punishment of those who do wrong. but not to create costs to the local units of government who must comply with Federal rules and regulations. and in addition giving the Federal Government authority it should not have. This bill is not needed. The States and the localities can handle these situations. They will look after the children. They are the people closest to the children that they are serving. They will do it. If they dont do it. the community will be up in arms and will require them to do that. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on this legislation.",

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4247. the Keeping All Students Safe Act. and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker. I want to begin by acknowledging the sponsor of this bill. Chairman MILLER. Because of his commitment to protecting students from abuse. our schools are safe havens once again. Mr. Speaker. restraint and seclusion in schools is often unregulated and is too frequently used for behaviors that do not pose danger to the children or others. These emergency interventions are also disproportionately used on some of our most vulnerable students. children with disabilities. Today Fragile X advocates. including my constituent. Holly Roos. are here to lobby Congress to pass H.R. 4247. Hollys son Parker was diagnosed with Fragile X Syndrome. the most common known cause of inherited mental impairment in the world. I met with Holly today. and she is concerned that Parker. her son. was inappropriately restrained at school because he seemed to be exhibiting aggressive behavior after a possible seizure. Mr. Speaker. Parker is a real life example that speaks to the importance of adopting minimum safety standards for the use of restraint and seclusion in our schools. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that this bill also makes an investment in positive behavior supports. an evidencebased approach designed to create a positive school climate that reinforces good behaviors and supports academic achievement. My State of Illinois has effectively reduced the majority of behaviors which resulted in the use of seclusion and restraint by implementing this preventative approach throughout the school system. This bill ensures our schools are safer and more effective learning environments. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R. 4247.",

Children with autism. many of whom are nonverbal or have other communications challenges. are especially vulnerable to dangerous interventions at school by staff who can at times be illprepared to deal with unique behavioral issues. I sat recently with a constituent from Greenwich. whose autistic daughter suffered terrible isolation and trauma in her school years. and who herself founded a group of volunteer advocates whose sole mission is to prevent other autistic children from suffering these same abuses. The GAO study cited by my colleagues included stories which shock the conscience: a 7yearold who died after being held face down for hours by school staff. and 5yearolds allegedly being tied to chairs with bungee cords and duct tape by their teacher and suffering broken arms and bloody noses. These could have been your children or mine. This legislation is an important step toward ending inhumane treatment of children with autism and other disabilities who. like all students. should be able to trust their educators and feel completely safe in their school environments. There are. of course. rare and extreme emergencies where it may be necessary to physically intervene. But we affirm today. Mr. Speaker. that any behavioral intervention must be con56.

For my friend to stand on the floor and say the continual exporting of jobs is good for the country is beyond the ability of someone to believe. Not only does the fact that these jobs are transferred to another country create tremendous job losses. but we give these people tax benefits for doing so. It is hard to comprehend how such a policy ever came to be. This is an effort to stop it. We have some very commonsense ideas. One says: If you want to come back to the United States and you want to create some jobs here. we will give you a tax benefit for that. But we do say that if you are going to tear down a plant. an operation in America. you should not get a tax benefit for doing that. as now exists. Right now. if you move a wood manufacturing company out of the State of Washington. tear down your plant and move it to China. you get a tax break for that. The American people dont want that.

These events highlight the many American jobs provided by the structural steel industry and the contributions of structural steel as a safe. strong. green. and effective building material. The structural steel industry is a major employer in Illinois. Today. the United States has 4 major structural steel mills. 10 hollow structural shape producers. and more than 2.600 steel fabricators. Together. they employ over 185.000 Americans. producing 4.5 million tons of fabricated structural steel in 2009. In Illinois. more than 100 structural steel firms provide more than 2.000 good jobs. Most of the structured steel in a building can be recovered and recycledas much as 98 percent. In fact. columns and beams that are made at U.S. steel mills include an average 93 percent of recycled materials. It is the most recycled material on the planet. There is a renewed interest in this country in domestic steel as a building material. and structural steel accounts for 5 percent of the steel consumed in the United States. Shipping steel from other countries creates a huge and unnecessary carbon footprint. LEED certification. an environmental rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. relies heavily on the use of domestic steel in new construction. The industry continues to incorporate improvements in the technology used to build steel projects. These improvements are also bringing down construction costs and increasing safety at construction sites. In light of these economic. environmental. and safety factors. it is no surprise that there is a threetoone preference for using structural steel in the construction of multistory residential and nonresidential buildings.

If adopted. this proposal would sacrifice our Nations longterm investments in the employees needed to efficiently and effectively run government programs for a shortsighted approach that does nothing to address our current fiscal challenges. Far from being fiscally responsible. these policies would end up costing the government more over the long run. by increasing our reliance on contractors whose work would not be capped. Arbitrary restrictions on hiring Federal employees open up opportunities for waste. fraud. and abuse as contracting expands without investment in oversight. Over the past decade. Federal contracts have nearly doubled in size. to over $500 billion. but the size of the workforce overseeing contractors has stayed constant. We must reverse. not reinforce. that trend. Over the past two years. we have made efforts to rebalance the work performed by Federal employees and contractors. Many times. replacing contractors with Federal employees allows agencies to more efficiently meet their missions and provide vital services. The American people expect strong leadership from the Federal Government and we must make sure the Federal Government has the people it needs to perform critical functions and to properly oversee the important work done by contractors. Freezing the Federal workforce could once again lead to dramatic overreliance on contractors. putting agency missions and taxpayer dollars at risk. The American people deserve a government that hires the right people with the right skills to run their government in an effective and efficient manner. An arbitrary cap on Federal employees is a poor substitute for the careful. thoughtful approach to Federal workforce planning we need.

They are his policies that are borrowing too much. spending too much and taxing too much. On the other hand. Republicans continue to offer a better way forward.

American families and small businesses across the country are tightening their belts. and certainly Congress needs to do the same.. Instead. the Obama administration offers a budget that doubles the national debt in 8 years. and by 2012. the American people will be paying $1 billion per day in net interest on that debt.

Imagine that your doctor tells you that you must undergo surgery that may threaten the use of a limb or leave you with a serious chronic condition. It is only natural to want a second opinion from another doctor when facing such a serious health event. Besides giving patients muchneeded peace of mind. second opinions can benefit health plans by reducing the number of invasive procedures and result in better patient care through increased dialogue about treatment options. Some health care groups see the value in such requests and provide patients with a second opinion. When I was a member of the California State Assembly. I heard from a number of patients who experienced a glitch in their health care coverage. They noticed the absence of a clear process for obtaining medical second opinions. These patients. many struggling with challenging health conditions. had difficulties obtaining second opinions through their health plans. After meeting with patients. physicians and health groups. I authored a law in California that guarantees coverage of second opinions. The law in California was a good first step. Unfortunately. only a small number of states have similar laws on the books. It is time to extend second opinion coverage to health plans nationwide. Americans deserve quality and comprehensive health care coverage. I urge you.

It lies with a clerical regime who conducts its most egregious activities in the dark. hidden from the worlds eyes and. thus. escaping media attention. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps quietly funnels weapons and funding into terrorist groups from Iraq to Afghanistan. from Lebanon to Gaza. Iranian centrifuges enrich uranium at nuclear plants often hidden from weapons inspectors. And terrorist groups make voyages to Iran to receive training at unspecified locations. This is the regime we are talking about. and this week the true colors of that regime are on broad display. We must rally the world around the cause of the Iranian people. I urge the administration. I urge President Obama to follow the lead of this House. to speak out on behalf of the Iranian people and their quest for freedom and human rights.",

Give me liberty or give me death. That is why the United States of America cannot be silent. It is our foundation. I was reminded of the words of Thomas Jefferson when he wrote that. All men are created equal. and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. and among those life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. That is what we stand for.

Americas willingness to express its heartfelt support for the Iranian people and their struggle against the mullah dictatorship that oppresses them. Now. it has been said that you cannot champion the oppressed unless you are willing to take on the oppressor. America should not intervene in every struggle taking place. but we should be unapologetically on the side of those who are in desperate battle for their own freedom. Tempered rhetoric can be interpreted by tyrants as weakness. We need to send a strong message to those tyrants and a strong message to the people who are willing to risk their lives on the streets of Tehran that we are on the side of the people and the side of democracy and freedom. Any other message would be a betrayal of our fundamental principles. the principles of liberty and democracy that so many Americans have sacrificed to give us and to pass on to other generations. Yes. we should not intervene. but it is up to us to make sure those people struggling throughout the world know we are on their side. We must be bold in our words of support. I was honored to be one of five speech writers serving Ronald Reagan. He too was told to tone down his rhetoric. He too was told that strong words would be interpreted as belligerence. But with his strong words. he ended the Cold War. without the conflagration that hung over our heads for decades. He made it a better. a more peaceful and a freer world with a strong message and no apologies. We should follow the lead of Ronald Reagan.

On December 8. 2009. Doctor Sandlin was tragically murdered in front of nurses and staff at the LeatherwoodBlackey Medical Clinic in Perry County. Kentucky. Doctor Sandlin routinely refused to give doctorshopping drug seekers a prescription for pain pills without passing proper evaluation. He refused to allow his practice to be part of the drug epidemic. although many physicians in the past have given in to fear of demands and threats by drug seekers across the region. After being denied narcotics for a second time that morning. a patient returned to Doctor Sandlins office and fatally shot him in the head. Doctor Sandlin returned home to Perry County. after graduating from the University of Louisvilles School of Medicine. to provide healthcare to less fortunate individuals. He served generations of families for 28 years until his untimely death. Doctor Sandlins medical practice may be over. but his style of practice will live on as the pinnacle of good medicine.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today I am pleased to introduce legislation today that will provide guidance and prevent abuse in the appointment of corporate monitors to implement deferred and nonprosecution agreements. Last Congress. the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law led the charge against the politicization of United States Attorneys Offices in the last Administration. Additionally. both last year and this year. the Subcommittee held hearings on deferred and nonprosecution agreements in criminal cases against corporate defendants. and the selection of corporate monitors to implement those agreements. Those hearings. as well as recent press articles. revealed the need for guidelines to govern the appointment of corporate monitors in these cases. The Governments use of deferred and nonprosecution agreements as a prosecutorial tool with respect to corporate defendants has grown exponentially in recent years. Unfortunately. the selection and use of corporate monitors to implement those agreements has been tainted by a disturbing lack of guidance. and even more troubling indications of abuse. In one case. a former U.S. AttorneyChristopher Christieselected former Attorney General John Ashcroft to serve as a corporate monitor. for which Mr. Ashcroft collected fees of up to $52 million. The circumstances surrounding his appointment and service as a monitor were not made public at the time of his selection and other than the hearings the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee held on the issueno provision was ever made for oversight or accountability concerning Mr. Ashcrofts selection or performance as a monitor. To prevent such reckless abuse from taking place in the future. I have introduced legislation that will prohibit United States attorneys and assistant United States attorneys from acting as or working for corporate monitors for specified periods after their service with the Government terminates. This legislation will provide accountability. transparency. and uniformity in the appointment of corporate monitors to implement deferred and nonprosecution agreements. Public trust and confidence are essential elements of an effective justice system--our laws and their enforcement must not only be fair. but they must also be perceived as fair. The perception of unfairness and favoritism undermines governmental authority in the justice process. My legislation will help restore fairness and rebuild trust in our public process.",

Their first meeting place was at 4 Race Street. where Hebrew School classes were held and services were conducted. As the congregation grew. it moved several times to accommodate the expanding membership. In 1918. the religious body purchased a threestory Victorian home at 177 Speedwell Avenue in Morristown. The building was remodeled to accommodate religious services and religious school classes. Between 1921 and 1924. the idea of creating a multipurpose community center arose. During this time period. a demand for wider use of the facility for religious. cultural and social purposes developed. The desire for a building suited to these multiple purposes gained momentum. Maurice Epstein. founder of the M. Epstein Department Store. led a campaign to raise $34.000 toward this goal. Shortly thereafter. plans were presented to the membership and the cornerstone of the new building was laid on March 3. 1929. From the 1930s through the 1950s. Jewish community life revolved around the center. In the 1960s additional classrooms and a new social hall were built and in the 1980s the former gymnasium was converted into a ballroom. In 1987. the building. listed on the National Register. received a Heritage Commission marker. A nursery school was added in Culturally. socially and spiritually. the Morristown Jewish Center Belt Israel has been a positive force in peoples lives. and its members continue to enrich the wellbeing of Morristown and the surrounding area through its presence.

The name of Bethlehem Baptist was adopted and Reverend Issac Jones was named the first pastor. Initially. before they had a building. the congregation met under a brush arbor and in the homes of various members. Over the last century. the faithful congregation of Bethlehem Baptist encountered many trials and tribulations. including a fire that destroyed their first building. yet they never lost their faith or their love for their church. Their present sanctuary was built in 1963 and has been enhanced over the following 47 years. adding on an annex. two classrooms and an office complex. In August of 2000. the Bethlehem Missionary Baptist congregation was the proud host of the Eastern Shore Baptist Convention.

It assures that health care is affordable for lower- and middleincome families. It fills the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole. and it provides free preventive services in Medicare. It has the support of consumers. doctors. nurses. senior citizens. children. people with disabilities. farmers. and small business ownersorganizations that represent virtually every segment. In my district. like every other district. Republican or Democrat. Ive got 67.000 uninsured people who will be helped. 8.000 people with preexisting conditions. 14.000 businesses will get tax credits. 8.300 seniors will have the doughnut holes filled. And every district in the country has similar numbers. I defy you to go home and tell those people you voted to deny them quality. affordable health care. I am proud to have helped author this legislation. I encourage each of my colleagues to join me in voting \"yes.\" I can assure you. these guys arent going to have to pay for it in the future.",

Mr. Speaker. we have been listening ad nauseam for months from the Democrats. who have been saying that anybody who doesnt support a government takeover of health care is supporting their insurance friends or their friends in the pharmaceutical industry. Guess who contributes to political campaigns? Lawyers contribute more than all the rest together. To who whom do they give their money? Surprise. Surprise. Ninetysix percent was given to Democrats in this year. Is that why they are left out of the health care reform bill? Everyone who has looked at this issue for years has said to start with tort reform. Start with tort reform. The three most recent studies all this year said that Americans are spending $200 billion a year on tests and procedures that are unnecessary. defensive medicine. because. if they are not done. the doctors will be sued. Thats $2 trillion over 10 years. That would pay for this $1.5 trillion behemoth. It is ignored except in one fashion: there is mention in this bill that. if your State has already reduced jury awards and has gotten control over tort reform. you will be punished. Ladies and gentlemen. this is not about health care. This is about rewarding your friends and about punishing your enemies. It has been going on all year. and it is a huge mistake.",

Most Americans also want other citizens to have their health care needs covered by insurance. Democratic health care reform responds to these concerns. and like Social Security and Medicare. it is as American as apple pie. Consider this letter from a constituent of mine from Fraser.

We spent another $1 trillion on a stimulus bill that has yet to produce any jobs as promised. This record spending doesnt count the omnibus spending bill that we had and the fact that we grew our budget to $3.6 trillion all in one year. If this werent enough. we are being asked now to create a new trilliondollar. governmentrun health care program despite the fact that we cant pay for the two existing government programs that we have todayMedicare and Medicaid.

I speak. of course. of the late Senator Craig Thomas. who was also a Member of this body. a tireless advocate and protector of those values that continue to shape Wyoming and its people. Wyoming is a State blessed with unparalleled natural resources. from spectacular mountain ranges and wide open plains to the vast mineral deposits that lie beneath them. In Wyoming. we find balance regarding how those very resources are managed. The bill we are considering today fails in achieving that have balance. While our economy reels and the Federal deficit reaches record highs. this bill places an additional $10 billion burden on the taxpayers in Wyoming and across the Nation. These are not dollars being spent to ease economic woes or create jobs. these are dollars being spent in large part to restrict access to our public lands. to limit responsible energy production in the West and to codify the vague and illconceived National Landscape Conservation System. Supporters of this 1.200page massive omnibus package will tell you that most of the bills it is comprised of are largely noncontroversial. In some cases they are correct. but in many cases they are not. Nearly 100 of the bills wrapped into this measure were never considered by the full House. let alone by those of us who were freshmen.

We are all aware of the challenges in moving legislation. particularly this legislation. through the Senate. But that does not mean we should defer to the judgment of 99 Senators and let the voices of the 435 members of the House and their constituents go unheard. There are a lot of good things in this bill. For example. I am pleased S. 22 includes stand alone legislation I have introduced. H.R. 488. to decrease the matching funds requirement and authorize additional appropriations for Keweenaw National Historical Park in Michigan. Another provision in the bill would support the North Country National Scenic Trail. which snakes more than a thousand miles across my state. Despite the inclusion of these provisions. this could be a stronger bill with input from the House. There is no better example of this than the one amendment that was allowed. that offered by Mr. ALTMIRE. His amendment protects access to public lands for recreational activities otherwise allowed by law or regulation. including hunting. fishing and trapping and clarifies states authority to manage fish and wildlife populations. I have drafted an amendment. which due to the way this bill was brought to the floor I was unable to offer. to strip a provision designating 11.739 acres at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore as the Beaver Basin Wilderness Area. The proposed wilderness designation is located entirely in my congressional district and lacks the support of the local city and county governments. This issue deserved debate and consideration by the House before pushing through this public lands bill. Quickly adding S. 22 to the suspension calendar and effectively blocking input and changes is not appropriate regular order.

Very simply because they were a response to the directive of President Bush on August 17. What was that. the August 17 directive? It basically was a directive by the President to States to develop policies to make it very difficult for people to leave private health insurance to move into the Childrens Health Insurance Program.

The language that was written last year and that would be in my amendment is that in the higher income States. the lowincome kids must be covered at a rate equal to the top 10 States. and if a higher income State fails the test. then it wouldnt receive the payment only for those higher Income kids. So there Is no difference between all of the other States and even New York and New Jersey with respect to the lower income kids. but the incentive here is obviously not just to cherry pick the higher income kids but to try to make sure you are covering the lower income kids too. To conclude my comment. either you go with something such as Secretary Leavitt proposedand I dont think that with the new administration that is going to remain on the booksor you are going to have to have something such as the language that was prepared by my Democratic colleagues last year which at least minimally deals with the problem of crowdout by identifying the best practices and ensuring that the States at least have some kind of a plan to apply those best practices to prevent this huge problem of crowdout.",

The amendment In question is kind of a watereddown version of that August 17 directive. That directive basically discouraged States from providing childrens health insurance availability to kids of moderate income. That Is what the August 17 directive did. It discouraged States from. at their own discretion. a State option. providing childrens health insurance coverage for kids who are above 200 percent poverty and a little higher. which has a tendency to mean those families would not have private health insurance but would have insurance under CHIP. It is simple: If you are for discouraging kids going to the CHIP. middleincome peopleactually. lower than middle incomevote for the Kyl amendment because that basically is a watereddown version of the August 17 directive. If you are for the August 17 directive. you are probably for the amendment. If you are not for the August 17 directive. you are not for the Kyl amendment. I oppose the amendment.

But that is not an argument not to deal with crowdout in the very bill that is going to deal with crowdout and in the very bill that we dealt with crowdout last year. In other words. the language of the Kyl amendment is the language that was put in the bill last year. It was not put in comprehensive health care reform. It was put in the SCHIP bill because it is in the SCHIP bill that the problem of crowdout occurs. The chairman notes that we do not know exactly how big the problem is. but CBO has given a good estimate. It provides that an Institute of Medicine study would describe the best way to measure crowdout. That has to be submitted 18 months after enactment. This is not exactly warp speed. We have 18 months to figure out the magnitude of the problem. GAO would submit a report to analyze the best way to address the crowdout. And then within 6 months of receiving the reports. the Secretary of Health and Human Services would develop recommendations on how to deal with it. We are now 2 years from now. or when the bill passes. and then 6 months after that the Secretary would publish the recommendations. and eventually we get to the point. after the studies. to figure out how big the problem is and what to do about it. The Secretary publishes it. and then the States have the obligation to look at these options and best practices and to institute them. probably 2% years after this bill becomes law. So we are not exactly jumping the gun here. and it is far more appropriate to put the language in this bill. the SCHIP bill. as we did last year. than it is to wait for some future health care legislation. I dont buy that argument. Again. I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment. It is the same thing everybody who will be voting for this legislation voted for last year.",

The problem is this: States cannot control their economies. Lets say there is a recession. Lets say there is high unemployment. Lets say people lose their private health insurance coverage. States cannot control that. They cannot control what the total coverage in their State will be. public and private. If a State cannot guarantee that 80 percent. it cannot control it. then that State loses its Federal funds. So I think that even though it sounds pretty good on the surface. the trouble is States cannot control the dynamics that are going to determine whether the States get those Federal dollars.

Now it is especially important that CARICOM live up to its moral obligation and provide Haiti with overwhelming support and commitment. The mentorship that CARICOM can provide to Haiti at this time is vital to Haitis development into a country that is selfsustainable. The regional access and cultural commonality that CARICOM presents to the Haitians is one that should not be underscored. I must acknowledge that the contributions that CARICOM have already made to Haiti are well appreciated. but I am convinced that in this global economic climate. it is especially necessary for CARICOM to reach within itself to offer a renewed commitment to the good people of Haiti.

The Alliance of Illinois Judges has also been set up to advocate for their members. The formation of All reminds us that lesbian and gay judges in Illinoislike lesbian and gay employees all over the countryare treated differently than their heterosexual counterparts. All intends to address these inequities. In the last 15 years. the judiciary in Illinois and in Cook County has been transformed by the addition of many highly talented and dedicated gay and lesbian judges. Their presence in Cook County has brought about a sea change in attitudes in one of the largest consolidated court systems in the world. In 1993. Cook County and Illinois took a giant step forward when Judge Tom Chiola. one of the founding members of AIJ. was elected not only as the first openly gay judge but also as the first openly gay elected official in Illinois. Then. in 1996. Judge Sebastian Patti was elected in a countywide election in Cook County. the second largest county in the nation. And in 1999. Nancy Katz. the first lesbian judge. was elected an Associate Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court. This month the Alliance of Illinois Judges is being launched with 16 founding members. Madam Speaker. I want to offer my very best wishes to the Alliance of Illinois Judges and to all its members.

Teddy Roosevelt once spoke of his fondness for the out of doors when he said. \"there are no words that can tell the hidden spirit of the wilderness. that can reveal its mystery. its melancholy. and its charm.\" This legislation contains a protection for a number of Americas public lands and in particular. for a treasured place back in my home of Idaho called the Owyhee Canyonlands. Last summer. I had the privilege of spending a week floating the river which created the area this bill will protect. We saw redband trout in the pristine rapids. camped along the lush river banks. climbed up the rocky canyon walls to see bighorn sheep. and stood at the top looking at a rich desert plateau of sage grouse. antelope and bald eagles. When passed. this bill will permanently protect as wilderness 517.000 beautiful acres in the southwestern corner of my home states landscape and would provide wild and scenic status to nearly 315 miles of rivers. It will also guarantee that the ranching families who have protected this land for generations will continue on. with their grazing rights protected. None of that would be possible without the hard work of my friend and colleague in the Senate. MIKE CRAPO. who fostered a collaborative process of ranchers. public officials. community leaders and conservationists to preserve our cherished Owyhees. Many of these provisions in this bill have been waiting on Congressional action for years and are supported by Members from across the political spectrum.

In the beginning of the 108th Congress. I joined a number of my colleagues in announcing the introduction of this critical piece of legislation. On that spring day in 2003. we were joined by Christopher Reeve. Each of us who had the privilege of working with Chris knows that his voice was strong and his perseverance was limitless. He worked tirelessly to raise awareness of spinal cord injuries and bring science closer to a cure. I would like to take this opportunity to recall what he said to us on that day six years ago: \"I am honored and humbled to have my name associated with such a powerful piece of legislation. The passage of this bill will send an unprecedented message--the issues of research. rehabilitation and quality of life are paramount to improving the lives of those living with disabilities.\" These words ring true todayand I know that the spirit and force behind them are more powerful than ever as we prepare to pass a bill that will truly make a difference in the advancement of paralysis research. This legislation will authorize funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to expand and coordinate NIH activities on paralysis research to prevent redundancies and accelerate discovery of better treatments and cures. It will also establish a grant program in the Department of Health and Human Services for activities related to paralysis. including establishing registries and disseminating information.

I will vote today for S. 22 because I have been an advocate of initiatives like many that are authorized in this package that protect our nations historical. cultural. and scenic heritage. Several provisions in this bill will specifically help to preserve areas in my district and throughout the state of Virginia. I have cosponsored and voted for the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act. which is included in this package and provides grants to assist with the purchase of important Civil War sites that have not yet been protected. This program has helped preserve many sites in my district. rich in Civil War heritage. Most recently. the purchase of the site of the Battle of Third Winchester is contingent on receiving grant funding from this program. Other initiatives that will preserve important sites in Virginia that are included in this package are the Virginia Ridge and Valley Act. the Northern Neck National Heritage Area Study Act and the WashingtonRochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail Designation Act. While I agree in general with the intent of programs included in this package. I also have concerns regarding some of its provisions. There is language included in the bill that would prohibit natural resource development on about 1.2 million acres in Wyoming. According to the Bureau of Land Management. this provision would permanently take 8.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 300 million barrels of oil out of production. I believe that it is irresponsible to put restrictions on domestic energy production. Environmentally friendly domestic energy production should be considered as part of a comprehensive energy plan to help stabilize the cost of gasoline and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. I also maintain that longterm. permanent energy policy must be developed through clean. alternative and renewable energy resources to fuel our cars and light our homes and businesses. Solar power. wind power. clean coal technology. nuclear power. the hydrogen economy. new energy transmission technology. hybrid vehicle development. biofuelsevery option must be on the table for investment and development to secure our nations energy needs for the 21st century.

By all measures. both rovers were incredibly successful during their original 90day missions. Both rovers were able to maneuver around the surface of Mars. and they sent back scores of captivating images. The information they sent back has helped us to better understand the past and present geology of our planetary neighbor. and provided indication that water once flowed on the surface of Mars. The little rovers proved to be so robust that their original 90day mission was extended. and extended. and extended again. Ultimately. the mission was extended six times. That is a tribute to our scientific knowledge in this country. Both rovers continue to function and are roving the surface of Mars as I speak. Without a doubt. these rovers have been wildly successful. Besides being impressive fetes of science and engineering. they have inspired countless children of our country with their amazing images of the red planet.

[0 1145 By almost any measure. the Mars exploration rovers have been an extraordinary success. These rovers. named Spirit and Opportunity. were originally intended to perform a 90day mission on the hostile surface of Mars. Spirit was the first rover to land on the Mars surface on January 3. 2004. Spirit was joined on the Martian surface by Opportunity 3 weeks later on January 24. 2004. From the very early phases of the mission. these rovers have exceeded even the wildest expectations of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory team that designed and built them. Originally intended to perform a 90day mission to search for evidence of water and other conditions that could have supported life on the harsh surface of the red planet. they have now exceeded that goal by over 1.800 days. Along the way they rewrote our knowledge of the Martian environment by discovering and verifying geological evidence of ancient Martian environments where hospitable conditions may have existed. While on Mars. these rovers have explored over 21 kilometers of Martian terrain. survived dust storms. mechanical difficulties. and endured three cold. dark Martian winters. The advanced scientific instruments deployed in conjunction with Cornell University have relayed over a quarter million images. including evidence of explosive volcanoes and subsurface water. At a time when Americans could use some good news. it is fortunate that we can recognize and commend the men and women of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Cornell University for their outstanding success in designing. developing. launching and operating the Mars Exploration Rovers.

House Concurrent Resolution 64 calls for the President to designate 2009 as the \"Year of the Military Family.\" For over 7 years. our Nation has been in sustained conflict. Our servicememhers are facing multiple deployments. but they are not the only ones who are shouldering the burden of the war. Nearly 2 million of our military families have also shared in that burden. While I am proud of Americans across this great Nation who have volunteered or contributed funds and supplies to support our deployed and injured troops. those who have been on the forefront of those efforts are the military families. Over the last several years. military families have faced months of separation. some as long as 18 to 20 months. With over 1 million children between the ages of birth and 23 years of age who have parents in uniform. there have been many missed birthdays. graduations. holidays. and a childs first words and other major life accomplishments that are all too common as troops continue to experience backtoback deployments. Military families endure such hardship and sacrifices so their servicemember can proudly continue to serve the Nation. Military families often provide moral support. as well as comfort. to each other. especially during these difficult times. However. many families. especially those in the Reserves and Guard. do not have that luxury. Often these families must face these hardships alone. far from support programs and far from facilities that are located on military bases. The President and Mrs. Obama have stated that military families will be a top priority for this administration. I applaud the President and Mrs. Obama for their commitment to their military families. Mr. Speaker. I urge the President to continue this commitment and recognize the sacrifices of military family members who have given support to their servicemember and this nation. and declare this to be the \"Year of the Military Family.\" I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important resolution.

There are some 3 million Americans today who represent the family members of our brave soldiers. I am pleased to say that I count myself among those family members.

I think it is of the utmost importance. And we applaud the First Lady of the United States.

We now have 1.8 million family members of active duty military personnel. and just over 1 million family members of reservists. Of every two soldiers who are deployed. one leaves behind a wife or a husband who will wait for months. and sometimes even years. before they see their spouse again. Nearly 2 million children have fathers or mothers who are in the military. and these children. undoubtedly. feel great pride in having a mother or father serve their country. but they also feel a great burden of growing up with one parent who often is far from home and missing those important times.

We were. in essence. blocked out on the front end saying something we thought was the wrong type of principle to build upon.",

Much of the savings they have talked about is just like the doe fix that back in 1997. the AMA. both sides of the aisle agreed to do something to save money for Medicare. As the Senator knows now. the Reid amendment takes out all the doc fix. now with a $285 billion gap over the next 10 years to deal with physicians. It is another example of how we dont have the courage. We put in place cuts. We are not going to do that. We know what damage that will cause to patients. In this particular case. we should not do that. But the fact is many of these cuts that have been discussed will never take place. They will never take place. At the end of the day. I come back to the very thing you talked about. that is. we have $12 trillion in debt. $38.6 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Medicare alone. and here we are passing a bill that is using up the resources we might otherwise use to make it solvent. Instead of doing that. we are leveraging a whole new entitlement. I heard some of the pundits this morning parroting some of the things I have heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle. Lets pass this bill. We know it is not very good. but we will fix it as we move along. What I fear is the way we are going to fix it. we are going to fix it by adding tremendous debt on future generations. My guess is over the next very short period2 or 3 monthsthe other side of the aisle is going to come right back up here with a huge. several hundred billion dollar unpaid bill to deal with one of these issues we have been talking about.

Before the school cast anchor in the southern college town of Athens. the institution resided in numerous locations. including Washington. D.C.. Philadelphia. and Harvard University. On June 4. 1953. the United States Navy purchased 58 acres of land in the Oglethorpe Historic District of Athens. The beautiful property held a rich history of education. Dating back to the 1860s. the property served as campus to Georgia University High School. the Confederate Military School. the School for Disabled Confederate Veterans. the University of Georgias College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts. the State Normal School. and Coordinate College. Its legacy of education continued with the commissioning of the Navy Supply Corps School on January 15. 1954. ENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156.

These services offer pregnant women and their health care providers information and consultation regarding exposures to medications. chemicals. infections. and illnesses that may pose a risk of birth defects. a risk to the pregnancy. or a risk to the mother while pregnant. They also provide similar information on exposures during breastfeeding. Fifteen years ago. there were over 30 such services across the country. Today. there are fewer than 15. State and private funding has provided inadequate support. and even those that remain open have sustained budget cuts of as much as 60 percent.

School social workers bring valuable skills and expertise to schools and student services teams to ensure that every child has an opportunity for success. On a daily basis. school social workers help educators. administrators. and parents address students emotional. physical. and environmental needs. School social workers help educators to understand cultural. family. and community factors affecting students. Everyday. they work with administrators to design and implement prevention programs and policies that address school attendance. bullying. sexual harassment. teen pregnancy. child abuse and neglect. special education. and more. Issues like cyber bullying and harassment are extremely underreported and on the rise in schools across the country. Adult intervention at school is necessary to effectively curb these trends. School social workers also work as liaisons between parents and schools. They work with parents so that they may participate in their childs education. understand special education services. and access other services related to their childs needs. In healthcare we must treat the whole person and in education we must do the same. School social workers recognize the importance of connecting emotional. behavioral. and academic services in order to maximize childrens opportunities for success. Too many children do not receive the mental health services they need. Improved and expanded school mental health programs would help to close this discrepancy. The kinds of services that so many students desperately need are precisely the type of services that school social workers can provide. As our economy continues to struggle. and families all over the country are losing their homes and jobs. the need for school social workers only multiples. That is why I am proud to be the sponsor of this resolution.

Mr. Speaker. there is a mounting need for local educational institutions to provide the mental health services social workers offer when working with students emotional. physical. and environmental needs. When students are coupled with sincere and understanding social worker. they are more likely to succeed and achieve behavioral and academic success. This legislation will affirm that social workers are life lines to children. schools. families and communities and those we fully are committed to any and all initiatives that promote the need for such crucial workers. Mr. Speaker. 1 in 5 of the 17.500.000 children in need of mental health services actually receive these services. and research indicates that school mental health programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences. decreasing discipline referrals. and improving academic achievement. It is imperative that more social workers are properly trained and deployed into these various school systems to assist students in reaching their most favorable level of potential and achievement. especially children with serious emotional barriers. The observation of School Social Work Week during the week of February 28 through March 7. 2010. calls attention to the fundamental role school social workers play in the lives of students in the United States. As many may know during the first years in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina. the Houston school system. mainly Houston Independent School District. was flooded with children from the affected area school systems. After being through such a horrific ordeal. students were expected to continue with their studies as normal. It took the dedicated work of school social workers which assessed what was already in place to help the students. conclude what was missing and formulate a plan to build the students aptitude to bounce back from adversity. Now many of these students have gone on to succeed academically and socially. So in conclusion. I support H. Res. 1091 and I encourage my colleagues to join me.

I am privileged to rise today to honor the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) for their meaningful work and the imprint the organization has made on our nation. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference has a rich history and has played an important role throughout Americas Civil Rights Movement. The work of the SCLC is based on the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. The SCLC ensures that his dream continues to come true across the nation. In Virginias First Congressional District. Gloucester County is home to Holly Knoll. a true American treasure. Just recently I visited Holly Knoll. which is not only the birthplace of the United Negro College Fund. but is also the site of a giant 400 yearold Oak tree where Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. penned his famous \"I Have a Dream Speech.\" This groundbreaking speech was written to spark American drive and passion in order to overcome the struggle of freedom and equality for all of our nations citizens. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) from 1957 to 1968. a precursor to the SCLC. At its first convention in Montgomery. AL in August 1957. the Southern Leadership Conference became the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The SCLC has perpetuated Dr. Kings mission through their advocacy on education. leadership. voter registration. and civil rights issues. Dr. Kings dream is made a reality by the great efforts of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The hope for equality for children of all races. creeds. and backgrounds is a struggle which endures and one that the SCLC addresses by their continued work and faithfulness. Dr. King challenged the nation on August 28. 1963 when he stated in his speech \"We can never be satisfied.\" He also said. \"My friends. even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow. I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equal.\" Today I am honored to recognize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the collective efforts of its leadership and volunteers to make certain Dr. Kings dream is a reality across the nation and throughout the world.",

The Federal Government is large. and we can use all the help we can get. Unfortunately. these important reports often go unread. They fall. without testimony. on deaf ears. and Congress does little or nothing about it. I welcome the fact. Mr. Speaker. today that we are setting a baseline. a starting point for oversight by the authorization committees. Im pleased to serve on the committee that has broad jurisdiction. and by agreement with the Rules Committee. and with the leadership of Chairman TowNS. we have secured the fact that nothing in this rules change would limit the unlimited jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Reform to. in fact. look at these same reports and to hold hearings on any one or any 13.000 of these various remaining claims as the Bush administration leaves. Mr. Speaker. I want to speak particularly to Mr. TANNERs statement which. I think. was appropriate. and should be dealt with. During the Bush administration. 98.000 such findings came out of the GAO and the IGs. 13.000 were not dealt with during that administration. roughly a 14 percent leftover. I look forward to the fact that the Government Oversight and Reform Committee will have the help of all the authorization committees to look into those. and I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis. both within the committee of primary oversight and with each the committees of jurisdiction. because I think its important that as we allow a new administration to set goals. we deal with all of the leftovers. the 13.000 that perhaps would have been taken care of in the ordinary course. but now need to be quickly looked at so the new administration can get on to its agendas. And of course. as time goes on. I suspect that we will be looking at failures that occur on the new Presidents watch. I look forward to working with the gentleman from California on a bipartisan basis. to deal with the remaining roughly 14 percent of those that occurred on President Bushs watch. I look forward to this legislation. I once again commend Chairman TOWNS for his work to make sure that the committee of primary oversight is not limited by this resolution.

I came to Washington from the private sector. where accountability and performance measurements are naturally part of best practices. As a Member of Congress Ive long advocated for increased transparency and oversight of government spending and performance. As the peoples representatives. we have a responsibility to hold Federal Government agencies accountable for the tax dollars that they receive and the services they provide. And. like my colleague from Wisconsin. I applaud the Presidentelects appointment of a chief performance officer. So we have Executive Branch measurement of government results as well. Although the last Congress improved agency and program oversight. this resolution takes accountability to the next level. House Resolution 40 mandates committee hearings every 4 months when reports suspect agency level waste. fraud or abuse of taxpayer dollars. Furthermore. whenever an agency or program fails its annual audit. additional hearings are required to ensure changes are enacted to prevent the continuation of business as usual. Finally. Congress. working with the GAO. will hold hearings to investigate those programs. departments or entitlements deemed high risk for abuse. such as the 2010 census. Particularly in a time of economic uncertainty. Americans rightfully expect Congress to create higher standards and practices to eliminate waste. fraud and abuse. Unfortunately. for the last 12 years the GAO has been unable to analyze the financial balance sheet of the U.S. government due to numerous agencies failing their audits. As we work to stabilize our financial markets and stimulate this economy. we must also attend to longterm fiscal restraint and responsibility. With this resolution and resulting hearings. Congress will have the information necessary to make the tough choices needed to bring our fiscal house in order. These practices will ensure greater return on taxpayer outlays. Again.

There were Republicans there. They pledged their support for this bill. But the second thing is when we talk about tourism. it is not we are not only talking about the CEOs of airline companies. The jobs. as you know. we are talking about in Nevada. are jobs such as maids or the people who work at the flower shops or the people who work in the frontline in the restaurants or the people. the bellboys. Those are real jobs. One out of eight people employed in this country is employed in the tourism industry. What I heard in Nevada was something like 400 conventions had been canceled out of Las Vegas. We are just starting to see some improvements in our State. We call Duluth the Las Vegas of Minnesota. But we are starting to see improvements with business travel picking up. with some hope for consumers. This bill would bring in those key people to spend $4.500 every time they come into this country. and that is the international travelers. So if the majority leader would comment on what this means to real people. the bill the Republicans have now stopped. as we are trying every day to get more jobs in this country.",

My son and the pals he runs around with traveled one summer all around the country watching ball games. That is tourism.

The men and women who make up the Capitol Police protect not only Members of Congress but all the people visiting Capitol Hill. from foreign dignitaries to Girl Scout troops. Sergeant Eney was a loyal and dedicated member of the U.S. Capitol Police. He served on the force for twelve years. On August 24. 1984. U.S. Capitol Police officers participated in SWAT training. That evening. the officers wanted to practice a particularly difficult exercise just one more time. During this final activity. Seg. Eney was accidentally shot and killed. Sergeant Eneys life was cut tragically short. He was 37 years old. He left behind his wife Vivian and their two daughters: Shannen and Heather. My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Eneys family as we remember that tragic day. Shortly after Sergeant Eneys passing. Vivian spoke of her husband and other fallen officers. She could not have spoken truer words when she said. \"It is not how these officers died that made them heroes. it is how they lived.\" Her famous words are forever engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. It is up to us to honor Vivians words. Twenty five years later. we remember Sergeant Eney as a man dedicated to risking his life for his Nation. He was a brave and courageous man. He lived every day protecting his country and the future of his children. I am so proud of every U.S. Capitol Police officer who puts their life on the line.

Working in partnership with that office. the National Institute for Communications Interoperability would address the most critical issue facing the first responder community today. their ability to command and control emergency resources in response to terrorist attacks. natural disasters and crimes through interagency communication.

State and Federal tax dollars that have already been allocated in previous Homeland Security measures and in previous budgets throughout the United States are used more wisely.

The cuts include a 35 percent reduction to the Groundbased Midcourse Defense program. a system located in Alaska and California for the purpose of protecting this country against the type of missile North Korea is gearing up to launch.

I rise today in support of this bill and to praise Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member McKEON as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees on Armed Services and especially the staff for getting this bill right. This week were having a great debate about energy in our country. Most Americans dont realize that the Department of Defense is responsible for approximately 80 percent of all the energy used by the Federal Government. The final bill that we were able to pass out of committee this week includes groundbreaking language to encourage continued advances on responsible energy. Working with the Department. we included a series of new reporting requirements. We increase the use of electric and hybrid vehicles. we speed up the development of biofuels. and we encourage additional investment and use of geothermal energy. We also made some commonsense decisions regarding our fighter aircraft fleet. As a committee working in a bipartisan manner. we set aside the rhetoric. and we took into account current and future threats to balance the force. We sustained the current operational fleet. We supported additional F22s requested by our combatant commanders. We maintained robust F35 funding. And we provided additional flexibility for the Air Force to fill the impending fighter gap with less expensive but quite capable 4.5 Generation fighters. I again congratulate Chairman SKELTON. Ranking Member McKEON and the committee staff for their hard work on this legislation. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support it.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this rule. I offered an amendment on Monday to address an injustice against the members of our armed services that were shut out from consideration by this rule. Briefly. my amendment would have given an acrosstheboard pay raise of 5 percent to our military personnel. According to estimates made by the Congressional Research Service. the pay gap between military personnel and civilians in comparable positions is 3 percent. Given that the cost of living increase for 2010 is 2.9 percent. my amendment is an important first step to addressing this problem. Particularly during a recession but really at any time it is unacceptable that our men and women in uniform receive less than their civilian counterparts. Recently I was in Afghanistan and had the opportunity to see firsthand the professionalism and the commitment of our troops. what service they render to us. why are they being treated this way. I received assurances from the House Parliamentarian that my amendment was In order. and the Congressional Budget Office said it complies with all PAYGO requirements. I cannot understand why the majority would deny our troops the right to an upordown vote or. at the very least. a debate that would at least bring out the issues. If we have time to debate an amendment that would require a study of the number of subcontractors used by the Department of Defense. we should have time to debate giving our troops a fair wage. Mr. Speaker. this is the second time that Ive offered this amendment to increase the pay of our troops and the second time that it has been denied. I would urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.",

There has been much talk about fiscal responsibility bn the floor of this House. and I come to the floor to support the rule and support the bill. I support it because of the inclusion of the Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program because when we talk about fiscal responsibility. it is through competition that we achieve fiscal responsibility. Since fiscal year 2006. nearly $2.5 billion has been provided for the development of the Joint Strike Fighter competitive engine program. and last month President Obama signed the Weapons Systems Acquisitions Reform Act of 2009 into law. This supported an increased use of competition and defense procurement. The expected cost of the primary Joint Strike Fighter propulsion system has increased by $1.8 billion while the competitive engine program has not experienced any cost growth at all. In fact. the contractor has indicated a willingness to negotiate on fixed price terms for the remaining development and production of the competitive engine. We know that competition works. When we looked at the F15 and F16 in the 1970s. we found that the great engine war brought lower prices. better engines. better competition. and more reliability. We have the same thing today with the Joint Strike Fighter. and in this bill we have included the competitive engine program. which is critical to the success of the Joint Strike Fighter engines. I urge you to support the rule because with it comes enhanced contractor responsiveness. technological innovation. improved operation readiness. and a more robust industrial base for the United States.",

Pt. 16 21645 experimental forest at Fort Valley. Arizona. by the Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Experimental forests and ranges provide places for longterm science and management studies in many of the major vegetation types across the country. Fort Valley. the first experimental forest research station. established in 1908. as was mentioned earlier. was used to study how the ponderosa pine regenerates as the entire forest was being decimated through extensive logging. yet was not regrowing. Recommendations derived from research at Fort Valley were the basis of many U.S. Forest Service management practices that now allow us to responsibly log our forests so that they continue to produce. The 80 experimental forests and ranges in existence today play an integral role in our Nations ability to maintain healthy forests and establish responsible forestry practices. Thirtyfive States have one or more experimental forests. including three in my home State of Mississippi. Experimental forests and ranges provide samples of many ecological and environmental conditions across the United States. They support many forms of multisite research. monitoring and data sharing that address questions at regional and national scales. As a tree farmer. I understand the vital role that experimental forests and ranges play in keeping myself and other tree farmers at the forefront of forestry research. As we continue to face challenges such as new diseases and invasive species in the forestry industry. experimental forests and ranges will be the key to finding solutions to these challenges and ensuring Americas tree farmers continue to be competitive and profitable. So I ask my colleagues. Members on both sides of the aisle today. to join me in recognizing the 100th anniversary of the establishment of experimental forests and support the passage of this resolution.",

I appreciate the efforts of Chairman PETERSON and Ranking Member LUCAS to bring this bill to the floor today. H.R. 511 simply gives the USDA the authority to terminate an easement it entered into with the Village of Caseyville on September 20. 1999. due to a disagreement over how the land could be used. The Village received $60.000 and the easement covered 44 acres. The Village believed that the Warranty Easement Deed under the \"Emergency Watershed Protection Program\" allowed the 44 acres to continue to be used for flood control. However. the National Resource Conservation Service began referring to the easement as a \"Wetlands Reserve Program\" propertythat program is not concerned with flooding. but rather protecting and restoring wetlands. The differences in approach led the Village to seek a termination of the easement. including paying back all of the $60.000 to the Department of Agriculture. After a great deal of discussion. the Department of Agriculture stated that it did not have the authority to terminate the easement. and suggested this legislative approach. I again. thank the Committee for its attention to this matter and urge my colleagues to support the bill.",

The southern portion of the district that Im honored to represent. covering the village of Palmetto Bay and the city of Pinecrest. continues to grow rapidly. Due to the population growth. public services have been stretched. and fire response times. as Mr. LUCAS pointed out. have fallen below the district average. This morning I met with distinguished leaders from the village of Palmetto Bay. They reiterated to me the urgent need for this fire station in our south MiamiDade County community. So this problem really deals with the issue that new construction for public services in MiamiDade is confronting a lack of available land. The USDA station currently occupies. as Mr. HOLDEN pointed out. approximately 200 acres in southeast Florida with plenty of land to spare. So. Mr. Speaker. the citizens of my community were not asking for a handout. as Mr. LUCAS was pointing out.

This bipartisan support demonstrates the national importance of our domestic hardwood lumber industry. and I am pleased this Congress is recognizing the contributions the hardwood industry makes to both our economy and our environment. Hardwood forest owners are stewards of a valuable national resource. and their efforts to conserve hardwood forests have been a remarkable success. Over the last 50 years. hardwood lumber stocks have more than doubled and hardwoods continue to grow almost twice as fast as they are harvested. The U.S. Forest Service analysis supports the evidence of this strong conservation record: The Forest Services forest inventory and analysis program has documented hardwood trees to be an \"abundant. sustainable. and legal resource.\" Our hardwood forests are managed by thousands of small landowners and families who take care of this resource. Constituents of mine in southwest Indiana play a role in maintaining our hardwood stocks. and the same is true both throughout Indiana and across this country. Americans should be proud of this strong environmental record. and as Members of Congress. we ought to keep this fact in mind as we look for opportunities to support best practices in stewardship and environmental management. For example. environmentally preferable construction programs are increasingly important to the building and trade industry. and should Congress direct support for these programs. we should remember domestic hardwoods and their potential to contribute to an environmentally friendly future. I was proud the House passed an amendment I offered to H.R. 2187 earlier this year to preserve sustainable hardwood lumber as a green construction resource for local school districts.

I represent Mississippis First Congressional District. a district strong in forestry and timberland. This industry is dominated by smallbased. familyowned businesses which will benefit from the passage of this resolution. These small landowner businesses often have fewer than 50 acres. much of which may at one time have been crop or cattle farm. Many landowners have rededicated these lands solely to the production of timber. These timber stands are valuable longterm investments which expand to job opportunities in a myriad of related businesses: sawmills. logging. trucking. insurance. and many others. Hardwood lumber growers and manufacturers in Mississippis First District are valuable members of the communities in which they live and. like many others in Mississippi. have children and grandchildren who hope to stay in these businesses and continue to enjoy all that life offers closer to home. Hardwood timber stands are a critical part of savings and investment for many of my First District families. Without strong markets for lumber. those investments would plummet. House Resolution 81 will help ensure stronger markets without government intrusion.

I strongly support this standalone measure. which would repeal the \"dont ask. dont tell\" policy that discriminates against military personnel based on their sexual orientation. Enforcement of this policy has not only wasted millions of taxpayer dollars but has caused irreparable harm to our military by dismissing more than 12.000 welltrained and qualified members of the Armed Forces.

This view is not only shared by nearly eight in 10 Americans but corresponds with findings from the recently released Defense Departments Comprehensive Review Working Group report.

The Army and Marine Corps have been forced to reduce standards of eligibility just to reach minimum recruitment levels for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Meanwhile. our men and women in uniform work sidebyside with openly gay soldiers from thirteen coalition partners. including the United Kingdom. Canada. and Australia. as well as U.S. officers and agents in the CIA. NSA. and FBI.

Dont Tell\" policy has been broken for years. We have lost thousands of qualified soldiers. translators. and officers because of a fundamentally bigoted policy. It is shameful that men and women who continue to serve must continue to hide who they are. Repeal of \"Dont Ask. Dont Tell\" has the support of the Commander in Chief. the Secretary of Defense. and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A Pentagon study released last month found that the military is ready for repeal and the vast majority of enlisted men and women believe repeal will be positive or make no difference. Despite the overwhelming evidence against them. opponents of this bill cling to their intolerant views to support a shameful policy that has made our country less safe. Todays vote is an important step toward the day when LGBT Americans enjoy true equality. including the right to marry. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. and I hope that the Senate will pass this legislation and end this policy now.",

Last week. Mr. BAUCUS ordered the Medicare regulators to investigate and likely punish Humana. Incorporated for trying to educate enrollees in its Advantage plans about precisely this fact.

Mr. Blum. as I said. happens to be a former senior aide to Mr. BAUCus and a health adviser to the President Obama transition team. So for the record. CBOs Director Elmendorf says that cuts to Medicare Advantage \"could lead many plans to limit the benefits they offer. raise their premiums. or withdraw from the program.\" But they want to put a gag on the deliverers of this coverage because they are writing to their patients. to the people they are covering. and telling them that they are going to lose coverage if this bill passes. that Medicare Advantage is going to be gutted. Senator BAUCUS is now saying we want to put a gag in the mouths of people who are providing this coverage so they cant tell the senior citizens of this country that they are going to lose Medicare Advantage coverage.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. President Obamas decision to scrap a longrange. Europeanbased missile defense shield was not only met with concern among our European allies. but more importantly has sounded alarms here at home where the Presidents action will leave the Nation vulnerable to Iranian longrange missile attack. Three years ago. in response to growing threats from Iran. the U.S. developed plans to install a missile defense system in Eastern Europe to protect Europe and the United States from potential longrange missile attack. Under the program. 10 interceptor missiles would be located in Poland and a radar station would be built in the Czech Republic by 2013. The Europeanbased missile defense system would add an additional layer of defense to the continental United States. which already has a small network of interceptors on the west coast. The Europeanbased missile defense shield was endorsed by our NATO allies. who called it a \"substantial contribution to their collective security.\" Now. the Obama administration has taken the unusual and highly questionable position of canceling the planned Europeanbased missile defense system in favor of a scaledback program that will not be ready until 2020. The threat represented by Iran is real and growing. Last February. Iran launched a satellite. demonstrating substantial progress toward achieving a reliable longrange missile program. A month later. the head of the U.S. European Command testified before the House Armed Services -Committee that Iran would be able to deploy an Intercontinental ballistic missile. an ICBM. capable of reaching all of Europe and parts of the United States by the year The President stated his decision was based upon reduced threats from Iran and greater cost efficiency of his alternative defense systemand anyone watching the news knows that there Is no diminished threat from Iran. However. a July 2008 classified report produced by the Institute for Defense Analyses concluded that the Europeanbased missile defense system that the administration now wants to cancel would. in fact. be the most cost effective. I have called on the administration to declassify this reportso that all of the facts can be known and we can have a robust debate.",

As America rebounded. we responded to these acts of terrorism with the skill and spirit of our military and our intelligence community. The war we continue to fight abroad today began before September 11. 2001. It began without provocation and without warning. It was not a war of our choosing but rather was made our priority. It was the slaughter of innocents by people with a twisted sense of religion who play by no rules.

We remember how Americans from all walks donated blood. gathered at candlelight vigils. and organized care packages for relief workers. The resilience that propels us forward as a people is drawn from the courage of our heroes and the compassion of our citizens. Each year on this day. we have the opportunity and the solemn responsibility to honor the heroes and victims. and to keep faith with their loved ones. Though these thoughts and prayers. we can heal. and we can steel ourselves to repeat the words never again. Over the last year. we have seen in the most immediate way how terrorists still have innocent Americans in their sights. starting with a plot to blow up the New York City subway system. and continuing with the attacks at Fort Hood. Times Square. and on board Northwest Flight 253. Each of these attacks represented new strands of terrorism. new signs of an enemy ready and willing to adapt. Now more than ever. as citizens and patriots. we must remain vigilant in our efforts to confront and defeat the terrorist threat. That is why we should also take a moment today to salute the endurance. discipline. and valor of our troops. who have volunteered to take the fight to the enemy and keep the light of freedom burning bright.",

Today. it is appropriate that the formal federal recognition ceremony at the West Virginia National Guard for its Joint Interagency Training and Education Center coincides with the ninth anniversary of terrorist attacks on America.

This resolution designates the fourth day of June. 2009 as National Children and Families DO ur children are this nations most important resource. and this resolution highlights the invaluable role families have in raising healthy. welladjusted children. Families come in many different shapes and sizes. but they all play a critical role in the care and development of their children. Research shows that spending time together as a family is critical to raising strong and resilient kids. And studies have shown. the more often children eat dinner with their families. the less likely they are to smoke. drink or use drugs. so we should be in the business of supporting families. Early childhood experience lays the foundation for later development. and the first three years of a childs life are especially important. Investing resources in children and families will pay large dividends for our society. not only in increased productivity. but also for more opportunities for our children to realize their dreams. We must take it upon ourselves as a society to cultivate loving and supporting families whenever possible. National Children and Families Day provides us an opportunity to recognize our responsibility to foster family environments that nurture the next generation and to promote a positive environment for families across America.

He earlier decided to put a halt on the development of oil shale projects. That could be up to 1 million jobs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1622. my legislation to reauthorize the natural gas vehicles research. development. demonstration and deployment program within the Department of Energy for 5 years. I would like to thank Ranking Member HALL and Chairman GORDON and also my colleague from Oklahoma. DAN BOREN. for bringing this important legislation to the floor today. Natural gas is the bridge fuel for decreasing our dependence on foreign sources of oil and putting our Nation on a path to energy security. It is critical that we make a strong effort to Incorporate more natural gas vehicles into our transportation fleet. There are more than 150.000 natural gas vehicles on the U.S. roads today and over 10 million world wide. Increased U.S. natural gas vehicle research. development. demonstration and deployment will only increase these numbers if we make the proper investments as my bill does. Natural gas vehicles are an important part of our national transportation infrastructure. In 2008 alone. natural gas vehicles displaced almost 300 million gallons of petroleum in the United States. In fact. nearly one in five new transit buses on order today is specified to be natural gas powered. proof that we are moving in the right direction. We also have a proven reserve of natural gas right here in the United States. We have enough known natural gas reserves to last more than a century. As a matter of fact. 98 percent of the natural gas we consume is produced right here in North America. Natural gas is Americanmade energy. In addition to our vast supply. we already have a way to get natural gas to the consumer with over 1.5 million miles of natural gas pipeline distribution across the United States. Natural gas vehicles are also better for the environment. Greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas are 23 percent lower than diesel and 30 percent lower than gasoline. Natural gas vehicles also produce virtually no particulate matter or emissions. To meet our Nations energy needs. we must continue to develop alternative and renewable sources of energy. However. we cant shoot the horse we are on until we find a new horse. Natural gas is the bridge fuel for decreasing our dependence on foreign sources of oil and putting our Nation on a path to energy security. I encourage passage of H.R. 1622 today.",

Mr. Speaker. The U.S. dairy industry is an important contributor to our Nations agriculture economy. The United States leads the world in cows milk production. accounting for more than $284 million in farm receipts in 2007. Dairy farmers across the country are producing the milk and dairy products that we give to our children and to our grandchildren. knowing that they are getting the nutrients that they need for strong bones and for growing bodies. Mr. Speaker. unfortunately. our Nations dairy farmers are feeling the severe pain of very difficult and trying economic times that theyre experiencing right now. We are committed to doing everything we possibly can to help our dairy farmers through this very challenging time as quickly as we can. Dairy prices remain at historically low levels. and many farmers cannot even get the credit that they need to stay in business. We must help our dairy farmers. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Livestock. Dairy. and Poultry and food security. I have scheduled the second in a series of three hearings this week to take a very thorough look at the difficult economic conditions facing the dairy industry and to look at the options that we have to help our Nations dairy farmers. Help them we must. and help them we will to weather these financial difficulties until the economy can recover. We must get our dairy farmers back on their feet where they rightfully belong. Mr. Speaker. I urge the passage of this resolution that will. In some small way. give due recognition to the hard work and to the sacrifices of our Nations dairy farmers.

Mr. Speaker. for the past 70 years. we have celebrated the month of June as National Dairy Month. While there have been some years during this time where dairymen have had cause for celebration. I think we would be hard pressed this year to find a dairyman who is in much of a mood for celebration. As dairy prices started to rise in 2007. reaching record levels by June of last year. prices started to decline this past September and October. ultimately reaching a devastatingly low price by February. While there has been some slight rebounding in prices. dairymen across the country are still suffering from extremely low prices received in the marketplace and from extremely high prices for inputs. such as feed and fuel. In fact. while the average uniform price In the Northeast Federal milk marketing order for June of 2009 is $11.93 per hundredweight of milk. the USDA estimates that it costs dairymen in my home State of Pennsylvania $27.15 per hundredweight of milk just to produce it. Mr. Speaker. I recognize that the adoption of this resolution is a bit late this year. but as we honor National Dairy Month for the 70th consecutive year. I ask all of my colleagues to consider the actions we take here in this Capitol Building and how these actions reflect on the small family farming businesses around the country. Farmers do their best in keeping us well fed and in keeping us clothed and in keeping us housed. and we can. at the very least. consider the financial burdens that we place on these men and women when we contemplate legislation that would dramatically increase their costs of production. I want to thank my good friend from Georgia for the hearing that he held last week and for the two hearings that we are going to conduct on behalf of the dairy industry. I really appreciate that.

In Connecticut. over 350.000 people were served in the last year by our food banksa number that is way higher than the prior year.

In my district. hunters and constituents like Warren Speh and Bob Jean have donated more than 10.000 pounds of deer meat that was hunted at Bluff Point State Park in Groton alone as part of an effort to manage the deer population and also donated that food to the local food bank in the New London area.

The agitation it produces must be submitted to. It is necessary to keep the waters pure.\" Its safe to say that Jefferson would not take kindly to libel tourists. the subject of H.R. 2765. In the wake of 9/11. the American media has become increasingly alarmed over a phenomenon called libel tourism. Libel tourism is the practice of suing for libel in a country with weaker free speech protections than the United States. Surprisingly. most of these suits are filed in Great Britain as its libel and slander laws provide great writers and journalists less protection than those here in the United States system. So how do courts handle foreign judgments that clash with the American legal values? A foreign ruling will not be enforced in a U.S. course if the ruling offends State public policy or the Constitution. The House version of H.R. 2765. which we passed unanimously in June 2009. contains three major provisions. First. it states that a U.S. court. either State or Federal. shall not enforce a foreign judgment for defamation if the judgment is inconsistent with the First Amendment. Second. it clarifies that a foreign ruling denying an American citizen due process guarantees will also not be enforced. And. third. H.R. 2765 prevents enforcement of foreign rulings that conflict with the U.S. telecommunications law that protects consumers rights to criticize corporate misconduct on Internet bulletin boards. F- 1830 This version. as amended by the Senate. includes essential provisions to help deter libel tourists from bringing these suits in the first place. Among these is a feature that allows a U.S. citizen who loses a foreign suit to bring a declaratory action in Federal court to determine whether the foreign verdict is \"repugnant to the Constitution or the laws of the United States.\" Mr. Speaker. this bipartisan legislation provides appropriate and necessary protection for U.S. journalists and authors and represents the strongest policy response to libel tourism. The issue has been thoroughly considered by the House Judiciary Committee. I urge the Members to support H.R. 2765 as amended by the other body. I reserve the balance of my time.",

They had a comprehensive approach to the problem. They reduced juvenile murders from 13 a year to zero for 3 consecutive years. In Pennsylvania. they invested in comprehensive programs in a hundred different localities. spent $60 million. and they counted up a few years later and figured that they had saved over $300 million. five times more than they spent. because they were so effective in reducing crime and other social problems. In Virginia. they had an area where they had 19 murders one year. They came in with a comprehensive. evidencebased approach to crime reduction. and within a couple of years. they had two murders. And if you look at that $21/2 million that was invested in that program. there is no doubt that we saved at least that much in reduced medical care at the Medical College of Virginia Trauma Unit.

H.R. 2780 ensures that the Secret Service has the ability to secure all necessary areas surrounding the restricted buildings and grounds that house our leaders. their families. and foreign heads of state. The bill clarifies section 1752 of title 18. which sets penalties for knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without the lawful authority to do so. Currently written. the code does not distinguish between those who are there lawfully. such as Secret Service agents and other authorized staff. and those who are there without permission. This bill does not create any new authorities for the Secret Service and does not restrict the liberties of American citizens. H.R. 2780 simply clarifies and improves existing criminal statutes that are necessary for the Secret Service to resolve security issues and implement prevention strategies before tragedy strikes. There have been enough climbing incidents at the White House fence for at least one Web site to dedicate itself to chronicling the escapades of \"White House fence jumpers.\" While some of these individuals are attempting a collegiate prank. other such breaches could be catastrophic. This bill will enable the United States Secret Service to continue to deliver the highest level of protective services. consistent with their proud tradition. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the STALKERS Act of 2010 makes a number of changes in the United States Code with respect to the offense of stalking. It clarifies. strengthens. and enhances the current law. First it allows law enforcement to intervene in cases where a victim may not be aware of the seriousness of the threat before its too late. The existing statute requires a person have reasonable fear of bodily injury or to undergo emotional distress. These injuries are difficult to demonstrate. often frustrating both victims and prosecutors. H.R. 5662 addresses this problem by permitting law enforcement to intervene in any event of stalking that might reasonably be expected to cause another person serious emotional distress. This small change will go a long way towards both effective law enforcement and justice for victims. Second. the bill reaches criminals who make use of new technologies to stalk their victims. It extends the law to any course of conduct in or substantially affecting interstate commerce. which will apply to cyberstalking. acts of surveillance and other forms of stalking that employ emerging technologies. Third. the bill takes several steps towards more effective enforcement of the Federal stalking statute and other stalking laws. It increases the maximum term of imprisonment by 5 years if a criminal violates a protection order or if the victim is under the age of 18 or over the age of 65. The bill also requires the Attorney General to conduct an annual study of best practices and enforcement of stalking laws nationwide. In short. this legislation updates current law to target the full range of behavior that stalkers direct towards their victims. It will help law enforcement seek justice. help victims seek closure. and increase protections of the most vulnerable amongst us. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her hard work and advocacy on behalf of victims of stalking. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.",

That is the code or the laws that govern our military. Since I am the ranking woman on all military issues here. I was the author of that. Having looked at that and done that for the military code. I thought about all the issues that were still outstanding in the current Federal civil code. So I am here today to thank you. Mr. Chairman. for allowing me to bring this long overdue piece of legislation. the STALKERS Act of 2010. Representative VIRGINIA Foxx of North Carolina and I have bridged party lines to introduce H.R. 5662. and I want to thank her for her leadership on this issue. There is also a companion bill that will be introduced in the Senate. we hope. next week. No one can deny that the Internet is a remarkable tool. capable of connecting billions of people throughout the world. Unfortunately. it has also proven to be an effective weapon for stalkers to prey on innocent people. Current Federal stalking statutes simply have not caught up with what is going on with the new tools and the emerging technologies that criminals have at their disposal. So the STALKERS Act would bring our lives into the 21st century by giving law enforcement the tools that it needs to combat stalking in the digital age.",

    "speech": "Act would protect victims and empower prosecutors by increasing the scope of existing laws to cover acts of electronic monitoring. including spyware. bugging. video surveillance and other new technologies as they develop. Currently. Federal laws cannot be enforced unless stalking victims can demonstrate that they are in reasonable fear of physical injury. Because stalking is often a gateway to more violent acts. by the time a victim can actually demonstrate that they have \"reasonable fear.\" it may be too late. So the STALKERS Act lowers the threshold for action by permitting law enforcement to prosecute any act of stalking that is reasonably expected to cause another person serious emotional distress. Our laws should help to protect the victims. not serve as a roadblock to their safety. This legislation helps to do that. At its core. stalking is about power and control. It is a violation of the worst kind and our justice system needs every single tool available to combat this crime. I am proud to have introduced this STALKERS Act. and I urge my colleague to pass this bill. It is time we fight against stalking and other forms of harassment and intimidation and be on the side of victims.",

In 1963. he became the first Japanese American ever to serve in the U.S. Congress. And in this Chamber he has served his State and our country with great distinction. Senator INOUYE has served on the Senate Watergate Committee. the Congressional Iran Contra Committee. the Senate Appropriations Committee. and as Secretary of the Democratic Conference. And during his long and productive career in this Chamber. he has become my dear friend. I was honored and pleased when he was the person who nominated me for my third term as Senate whip in 1975.

The Nevada City Fire Department was formed in June 1860 after a group of local women set up theatrical shows and a ball to raise funds to form a fire department. The fire department began with three fire companies: the Nevada Hose Company No. 1. Eureka Hose Company No. 2. and the Protection Hook and Ladder Company No. 1. In 1861. the first fire station was built to house the volunteer fire departments in downtown Nevada City and had a service area of about 1 square mile. Over the years. the Nevada City Fire Department has evolved to meet the growing needs of Nevada City. In 1938. a new city hall and fire station were built and. in 1960. the first paid fire chief was hired. Nearly four decades later. in 1999. a new fire station was built to accommodate the departments needs. In 2000. the city hired its first paid fire fighter to staff the fire station during the day and. by 2003. three paid fire fighters were hired to man the fire station 24 hours a day. Today. the Nevada City Fire Department has 20 employees serving over 3.000 residents with three fire engines and two fire stations. They respond to over 500 calls for service every year in their 2 square mile service area. and assist on calls from mutual aid areas including wild land fires on national forest land. As the community celebrates the Nevada City Fire Departments sesquicentennial anniversary.

I would like to congratulate and thank Chairman GORDON and the gentleman from Nebraska for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. It has been tremendously successful all across the country and in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and in my congressional district. Mr. Chairman. the purpose of my amendment is to allow river rescue associations to participate in the grant program under the Volunteer. NonFire Service EMS and Rescue Organizations section of the reauthorization. Mr. Chairman. this situation was brought to my attention by Mr. Steve Ketterer of the Harrisburg River Rescue Association. which is the capital city of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the largest city in my congressional district. It sits on the Susquehanna River. and the Harrisburg River Rescue Association does a tremendous job all year long. not just In flooding situations. performing rescue operations on the Susquehanna River. They have applied repeatedly to this program for a grant and have been determined to be ineligible. My amendment simply would make river rescue associations eligible under the Volunteer. NonFire Service EMS and Rescue Organizations section of the bill. At the direction of the chairman and his staff. we have reached out and have had consultation with the International Association of Fire Fighters and the National Volunteer Fire Council. Both groups are satisfied with the amendment making river rescue eligible under the rescue organization section of the bill and felt it did not harm either the intention or the compromise of the bill. This would not take any funding from firefighters. This makes them eligible for funding under the EMS funding. So I would encourage adoption of the amendment and reserve the balance of my time.",

The 18th Congressional Districts struggling economy is the reason I continue to try to use every available opportunity to push for amendments and legislation that will spur job creation and economic development and provide relief to the hardesthit communities in the country. The Bureau of Labor Statistics ranks the metro area of Merced. Modesto. and Stockton with some of the highest unemployment rates in the Nation. All three are above 15 percent. and all three well above the national unemployment rate of 10.2 percent. My amendment simply provides a little more direction during the grant writing process by including unemployment rates in the criteria used to evaluate these various grant applications. This will provide a little extra help to communities like Los Banos and Merced to maintain and improve their fire protection services. These and many other cities in my district and across the country have critical needs that they cannot meet under the current financial stress that they are having.

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chairman. This amendment would require that local unemployment rates be considered as a factor in awarding grants to fire departments. While I understand the current state of the economy should make this a concern in bills we consider. the Fire grant program has. since its inception 8 years ago. awarded grants competitively based upon the potential of the applicants proposal to enhance a fire departments ability to respond to fires and related hazards. I am somewhat concerned that this change may result in an upset in the delicate balance of consideration that has been achieved over the years. The factors used by FEMA in evaluating these proposals have been carefully developed and refined in consultation with national fire service organizations. They include. for example. a departments geographic response area. its population served. unique hazard vulnerabilities. and its budgetary situation. All of these factors directly impact the departments ability to respond to hazards and. thus. are appropriate criteria. I believe the gentlemans amendment is well intentioned. but I am concerned that the unemployment rate of the locality a department protects is simply not directly related to fire hazards or the departments ability to respond to them. While a fire departments operating budget could potentially be indirectly impacted by a poor local economy that impacts tax revenues. this factor is already explicitly noted in the legislation based on need. Further. I would caution generally against the practice of Congress dictating the specific criteria to be used by FEMA in making awards. This bill codifies consideration of highlevel factors that were developed by the fire service and are currently used by FEMA. but it does not attempt to incorporate new ones based on particular interests. If we begin to open up this program to congressional direction of this sort. we risk adding a level of prescription that could transform the current highly competitive process to one driven by interests unrelated to the needs of the fire service.

We talked about our area in central California being the Katrina of California where we have such devastating consequences that we may not be able to meet some of our fire needs in our communities as they just collapsed financially. So if we find situations where were not meeting the fire protection needs of those communities. we think that its very important. This has just become one of many criteria in evaluating these grants. Not the sole criteria. not the most important criteria. but certainly to allow those individuals who are making the decisions to just take this into consideration. Thats the purpose of my amendment. The communities of Merced and Los Banos. in particular. have contacted my office. indicating that this is something they feel is a necessary imperative. But I can imagine cities across the countryMiami. Detroit. other placeswhere they may find themselves in similar kinds of economic situations. It might be your State by the time this bill becomes law. So I would just say that I think its something that is important for everyone to have as a capability to be taken into consideration.

I cosponsored this resolution with Senator COLLINS to affirm my commitment to ending global antiSemitism. bigotry. and hatred. In the 21st century. there is no place for people or groups who would harm or deny rights to others based on their religion. race. gender. or ethnic identity. Yet antiSemitismspawned from centuries of hatred. persecution. and repeated attempts to destroy the Jewish people from their early days of slavery through the Inquisition\" Holocaust. and beyondstill pervades many cultures and societies. In some places around the world. this deeply rooted hatred can quickly turn political rallies into hate crimes. with chants of \"death to Israel\" and expressions of support for suicide or terrorist attacks against Israeli or Jewish civilians all too frequent. These calls have often been followed by violence and vandalism against synagogues and Jewish institutions. Hate crimes send a powerful message because they affect more than the individual victims. they are meant to intimidate and instill fear in entire groups of people. Hate crimes create a sense of vulnerability and insecurity in others who may share characteristics with the victims. And this sense of fear is precisely the intent of those who commit such crimes. Even here in the United States. antiSemitism frequently rears its ugly head. most recently in the horrific shooting attack at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. I am privileged to be chair of the Helsinki Commission and a member of the both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. In those capacities and as a Senator generally. I am afforded numerous opportunities to speak out against the scourge of antiSemitism. racial bigotry. and ethnic hatred worldwide.

This act will establish a National Organ and Tissue Donor Registry Resource Center to provide technical assistance to state donor registries. The center will also serve as a State registry information clearinghouse for the evaluation and development of best practices for donor registries nationwide. Further. the act will codify minimum operating standards for donor registries. and establish a grant program to develop. expand. and evaluate State donor registries. Finally. the act will create a study on the feasibility of establishing a living donor database in order to track the short and longterm health effects for such individuals.

Over the next year the City of Santa Fe will commemorate the arrival of Spanish settlers and the designation of the City as the capital city of the Spanish territory now known as New Mexico. On their arrival the Spaniards found a thriving Native American culture. These Native American and Spanish cultures served to enrich each other and led to the creation of a vibrant social. cultural. and financial center that made the settlement of the Western United States possible. Despite the difficulties and periodic clashes the Spanish. Native American. and Anglo cultures in Santa Fe fought and worked to create a unique and vibrant culture that enriched all in the area. It is this confluence of cultures and the incomparable natural beauty of the area that make Santa Fe. The City Different. an American treasure that should be recognized and celebrated. Santa Fe is celebrated worldwide for its thriving artistic community. including the Santa Fe Opera. museums. and working artists. Many of these artists were drawn to its natural beauty. the light and air of the place. It is this special something that led artists like D.H.

NM. The Villa de Santa Fe was founded in 1609 by Don Pedro de Peralta as the capital of the Spanish province of New Mexico. making it the oldest capital city in the U.S. The city of Santa Fe is blessed with a diversity of cultures. rooted in its remarkable history. At the time Spanish colonists arrived in New Mexico. they found many thriving Pueblo communities. including in the area around what was to become Santa Fe. Although there were conflicts between the two people. they learned from each other. shared knowledge. traditions. and skills. while preserving their own unique cultures that persist to this day. Descendents of the original Spanish colonists can still be found in Santa Fe. and the nearby Pueblos continue to enrich the city and the region today. The city continued to evolve and grow through history with influences from the Mexican Revolution and characters from the western American frontier such as Billy the Kid. With the breathtaking landscape of the high desert. snowcapped Sangre de Cristo Mountains as a backdrop. and wellpreserved historical landmarks including the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi and the Palace of the Governors. Santa Fe has become a major tourist destination and an inspiration to many artists. including Georgia OKeeffe and D.H. Lawrence. Today.

I want to thank you on behalf of the millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness because health insurance companies do not acknowledge that the brain is part of the body. that there is such a thing as alcoholism and addiction in this country. Madam Speaker. thanks to your leadership. we passed the Paul WellstonePete Domenici Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act last session. and thanks to your leadership with this legislation. there is no discrimination against those with mental illness. And in each and every one of the health care plans. there is absolute parity in health care coverage for those with mental illness. Thank you. Madam Speaker. for this historic legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last weeks New York Times Magazine featured an interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Some of her comments were absolutely astonishing coming from a sitting Supreme Court Justice. but the most disturbing comment came in reference to abortion. In reference to Roe v. Wade. the infamous Supreme Court case. she said this: \"Frankly. I had thought at the time Roe was decided. there was concern about population growth. and particularly growth in populations that we dont want to have too many of.\" I cannot imagine any acceptable context where a serious person could refer to \"populations that we dont want too many of.\" This eugenic way of thinking debases the value of all human life. All people are created equal and deserve the most fundamental right to life no matter what race. religion. or socioeconomic background. I am shocked that a member of the Supreme Court believes that a compelling reason for the legality of abortion is because our society wants to reduce the growth of specific populations. Justice Ginsburgs comments are an assault and insult to the values of the American people.",

Now Democrats are responding with comprehensive health care reform. and we are hoping that our Republican friends will join us as we overhaul the broken health care delivery system. Health care reform will control spiraling costs. Without reform. the cost of health care for the average family of four is projected to rise $1.800 each year. and insurance companies will continue to control health care decisions. Under our legislation. families with health insurance will see lower costs. rate increases for preexisting conditions and gender or occupation would be eliminated. outofpocket expenses would be capped. children will be guaranteed affordable dental. hearing. and vision care. preexisting condition denials and insurance companies lifetime payments limits would be eliminated. We must answer the call of the American people by enacting health care reform. Lets do it for the American people. and lets do it for the American economy.",

The objective from the beginning Is get the government to run it. and well use any excuse that we can to justify the fact. but we already know the solution and the destination. and that Is we just believe in the government running this thing. And there are a lot of people on the Democrat side that are completely open and honest and say thats their objective. and there are other people that are trying to obscure the fact that thats where theyre going.

As a senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I appreciate the economic benefits a strong. reliable rail network provides our economy. Rail has kept our economy connected and competitive for decades and is critical to driving our economic recovery. Key to the rail network are short line railroads. which keep 13.000 small and rural rail customers connected to the main line railroad network and the global economy. However. short line railroads must invest heavily in repairing and maintaining track. more than any other segment of the rail industry. To address this. Congress enacted the Section 45G short line railroad tax credit. which encourages short line railroads to invest in critical track maintenance. These improvements are necessary to improve the efficiency of our national rail network and keep our economy moving. This tax credit expired on December 31. 2009. Without an extension of this tax credit. short line railroads are unable to initiate longterm plans. and have halted much needed infrastructure projects across the countryprojects that create goodpaying jobs on and off the tracks. The Section 45G credit generates approximately 3.305 fulltime jobs annually and supports tens of thousands of jobs in Americas steel and timber industries that make railroad ties or steel rail. Madam Speaker. it makes economic sense to provide certainty to this industry and extend this tax credit. Short line railroads are too important to our economy. As a cosponsor of H.R. 1132. legislation to extend the credit through 2012. I urge swift action on extending the Section 45G short line railroad tax credit and urge my colleagues to support it.",

William Booth. was born in economic and spiritual poverty. yet he founded a worldwide organization dedicated to their eradicationan organization that now serves the neediest of the needy in 120 countries. In 1865. the Salvation Army began in the East Side of London. and several years later General Booth sent a few of his followers to establish army roots in America. In 1885. Major Alfred Wells arrived in Sacramento with the determination to follow the lead of General Booth by ministering to anyone in need. Back then. there were many families and individuals looking for work. looking for food and looking for hope. Fast forward to the present time125 years laterand the Salvation Army is still in Sacramento. still reaching out to people who need assistance with jobs. food. and of course. hope. Today. on May 19. 2010. the Salvation Army marks 125 years of service to Sacramento. As they look to the future. they know times may become even more challenging. And yet. they are ready to accept that challenge. Nothing will deter the Salvation Army from continuing its service to the Sacramento community. Over the years as the needs of the Sacramento region have changed. the armys programs in Sacramento have reflected those needs. There have been shelter programs for men. women. and families. rehabilitation programs for those overcoming alcohol or drug problems. programs for emergency and disaster response. and disaster preparedness training. programs providing sports leagues. youth activities. tutoring. and child development centers. and many more.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. 3619. the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2009. which directs the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to conduct a study and submit a report to Congress examining the Coast Guards ability to respond to the effects of possible changes to U.S. immigration policies toward Haiti. While it is certainly responsible to examine a worstcase scenario. my amendment also asks that the study look at what has happened in past experiences as we discuss the anticipated repercussions of changes in our immigration policy. Changes in policies affecting Haiti are nothing new. In fact. it was just over 10 years ago that we here in Congress passed the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. which affected far more Haitian nationals than any of the currently proposed policies would affect. I firmly believe that what happened then and our current relations with the Haitian government will result in little change. if not a decrease. in Haitian interdictions. However. my assurances are not enough. Those who are critical or skeptical of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians often claim that any change could result in a massive surge. or might completely overwhelm the Coast Guard. This is in spite of the fact that when we last adjusted the status of thousands of Haitian immigrants. we actually saw a decrease in interdictions. and despite the assurances from the Haitian government that they will do their part to ensure their citizens are aware that no new immigrants would qualify. However. as of now. we have little more than speculation to ascertain what the results would be. My amendment will help provide us with an objective perspective on the Coast Guards expectations and their ability to continue to effectively guard our maritime borders. TPS. or some other comparable relief. for our Haitian neighbors is long overdue and this administration has been stalling for far too long. This study will hopefully help us show that our government has rationally and realistically examined all possible scenarios and we are well equipped to contend with any possible effects. Mr. Chair. my amendment furthers this bills commitment to ensuring the safety of those traveling on the high seas and protecting our national security. and I respectfully urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

This is a simple amendment which would require that the Department of Homeland Security. in consultation with the Department of Transportation. report to Congress on the decommissioning of the LORANC system. LORANC is a radiobased navigation and positioning system which many mariners use as a backup to GPS. It is also a primary means of navigation for bush pilots in Alaska. At the request of the Obama administration. the FY10 Homeland Security Appropriations Act does not include funding to continue the systems operation. This is being done despite the fact that the Department of Homeland Security came to the conclusion in February of 2008 that a backup system to GPS is needed. I am very concerned about the impact this will have on the safety of our waterways. In many regions around the country. the GPS can be found unreliable. I do not believe. as some in the administration have suggested. that we should go back to the days of navigating by sextant and lighthouse.

I would like to begin by thanking Chairman OBERSTAR and Chairman THOMPSON for their very diligent and intense work on this very important bill touching so closely to the topic of national security and making sure that our borders are secure and people are safe. We have. taken great strides in the last few years to ensure that our coasts. our rivers. our bridges. our tunnels. our ports and ships are safer than perhaps they were before. But the reality is that they are. as we all know. still vulnerable to attack. With more than 95.000 miles of shoreline. more than 290.000 square miles of water and approximately 70 million recreational boats in the United States. the United States Coast Guard and local first responders simply cannot protect our Nations waterways on their own. Individual citizens are often in the best position to notice suspicious activities that may be early indicators of terrorist activity. Any observations of suspicious or unusual activity could be extremely valuable to our national security. so we need a system in place to train volunteers to report their findings. The amendment that I offer this evening strengthens. streamlines. and improves the national effort to engage local citizens in the fight to protect our waterways through the Americas Waterway Watch Program. This program is an essential step toward improving our national maritime and homeland security outreach and awareness strategy. educating industry and the public on the need to be vigilant and to report suspicious activity. The amendment aims to develop a system to collect and share these reports. My amendment would authorize full funding for this program for the very first time. allowing the Coast Guard to fulfill the promise of the program by providing resources. training support and awareness of best practices to our Nations small vessel owners. recreational boaters. tugboat operators. fishermen and marina operators. those people who are day in and day out closest to where activity is likely to occur.

Polling has demonstrated that the American people support both. Independents and senior citizens. two groups crucial to the debate. have warmed to the idea of the public insurance option. Fiftyseven percent of all Americans now favor a public insurance option. The fact is. 56 percent of all Americans favor a provision mandating that all Americans buy insurance because Americans know that if you decide to not get insurance and all the rest of us do. when you get sick. we are surely going to take care of you. So everybody has to help out and do whats right as part of this. The number rises to 71 percent. should the government provide subsidies for many lowincome Americans to help them purchase insurance. 71 percent of Americans say that we should do that.

But let me just talk myths. as I said a moment ago. Theres this idea out there that the public option is some government takeover or even a governmentrun program. It isnt true. The fact is the public option is a program where youd have private doctors. where you would have the doctors of your choice that you could go to. It would be a lowcost alternative. And it certainly wouldnt be some kind of a takeover thing that theyre talking about. The idea that mandated health care is a new tax is also false. Were paying already for people who arent covered. If you show up at the emergency room. were taking care of you. so were already paying. Its not a new tax on anybody. There are other fallacies well talk about. and well talk about more as the hour wears on. but the fact of the matter is there are myths out there that must be debunked.

Now this legislation will make it impossible for Presidential records to be buried. Its going to set strict time frames In which information has to be released to the public. It is not going to permit former Presidents to have unlimited. broad authority to be able to claim through the existing President executive privilege. and it is not going to enable designees of Presidents to assert claims of executive privilege after the death of a former President. So this is a very important moment where transparency in government trumps the assertion of executive privilege. That can only be good for democracy.

Introduced by Chairman TowNS. this bipartisan bill is intended to promote the timely release of Presidential records under the Presidential Records Act of 1978 by rescinding Executive Order 13233. Issued by President Bush in November 2001. the executive order granted new authority to Presidents. former Presidents. their heirs and designees. and Vice Presidents. allowing them to withhold information from public view unilaterally and indefinitely.

The bill revokes a Bush executive order. issued in November 2001. which gave broad new authority to Presidents and former Presidents to prevent the release of Presidential records. The order gave former Presidents the ability to pick and choose the records viewed by historians and to shape their legacy through the selective withholding of information. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978. these records belong to the American people. not to the president who created them. Todays legislation restores the original intent of the Act and will lead to greater openness and improved understanding of presidential decisionmaking. This is not a partisan issue.

Presidential libraries are becoming increasingly expensive. and fundraising for their construction begins during a Presidents term. These are broad campuses with museums. conference centers. and other institutions. some of which are entirely separate from the federally run libraries. According to press reports. it cost more than $80 million to build George H.W. Bushs library and $165 million to build the Clinton library. Press reports have suggested that the fundraising target for President Bushs library is $500 million. Under current law. individuals. corporations and even foreign Interests can make anonymous. unlimited donations to these organizations. Such donations can be made while the President is still in office. There is enormous potential for abuse in this system. Special interests could make multimillion dollar donations to a Presidential library foundation in an effort to influence the President. and the public would remain completely unaware. In order to prevent real abuse. as well as the perception of abuse.

It is. by nature. one in which we believe we are appropriately asserting a daylight requirement on past and future Presidents and would certainly hope that we would view this bill as noncontroversial in most areas. Madam Speaker. our Nations Presidential libraries attract millions of visitors each year. They have become elaborate institutions. and the cost of building and maintaining these facilities has grown dramatically. Under current law. Presidential libraries are built with private funds. then turned over to the Archivist for operation. Amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act mandated the establishment of an endowment to cover some of the costs of operating the library. which are usually met through the establishment of a charitable organization. Funding for construction and the endowment comes from private sources. But under current law. no duty to disclose the source of those contributions exists. On both sides of the aisle. there is strong support for increasing disclosure. Earlier. under Mr. DUNCANs leadership. the House passed solid bipartisan legislation to require the disclosure of contributions to organizations that raise funds for Presidential libraries and related facilities. And a bill identical to the bill before us passed the House last year by a wide margin. We recognize the perception of impropriety that contributions to a Presidential library can raise. given the huge sums that must be amassed. and the attraction this avenue may hold for those seeking favors or influence. This legislation will provide a needed degree of transparency to that process. If I may.

Ive presided over thousands and thousands of felony cases. I have sent I dont know how many people to prison. Thats not a concern. My reputation was. as one criminal was overheard telling another. \"He will give a fair trial. but if youre guilty. you dont want his court.\" I dont have a problem sending people to prison. but one thing. probably the best conservative organization as far as getting out the message. the Heritage Foundation. and the ACLU have actually been in agreement on. this body. almost on whims. throws in a prison sentence as an added provision. and we are having people go to prison who shouldnt. If it is a dollar issue. then fine them 1 million. 10 million. whatever would be appropriate. But we should not. in this body. continually subject people to being taken down in their home. handcuffed when they made an error that should not be criminalized. So that is the concern I have. This never went through Judiciary. It has been through prior Congresses. It never went through Judiciary. the Crime Subcommittee. to look at that specific aspect.

These requirements help to preserve the integrity of our democratic system by ensuring that campaign donors do not exercise undue influence over elected policymakers. Similar requirements do not apply to Presidential library fundraising campaigns. and this creates the potential for large donors to exert. or appear to exert. improper influence over a sitting President. The fact that private foundations are required to raise money to build and maintain Presidential libraries lowers the burden on taxpayers. but it also increases the incentive to pursue aggressive fundraising for libraries that have become more and more expensive over the years. Under H.R. 36. Presidential library foundations would be required to report on a quarterly basis all donations 55. Pt. 1 January 7. 2009 of $200 or more. This requirement would apply to donations made to the foundation during the time that the President is in office and during the period before the Archives agrees to use the land or the facility.

This budget will help keep our Nation and our servicemembers safe from the threats that we face.

What does it say?\" We read this amendmentwhich I know the authors seek to ensure congressional insight into the budget process and the Quadrennial Defense Review. and those are very worthy goals. but unfortunately. reading this amendment in the way it is drafted will overwhelm the Pentagon and harm critical Department of Defense efforts. They wont have time to do much more than comply with this amendment. It is drafted in such a way that it just couldnt be done. And I am sad that a worthy goal is being thwarted by the improper drafting thereof. The Department of Defense routinely enters into such agreements to protect the privacy of servicemembers and. of course. to protect sensitive information. As a result. the amendment would require several reports on thousands of nondisclosed agreements. For instance. casework for wounded warriors. health care quality assurance processes. criminal and administrative investigations. accident investigations. contract source selections. accepting proprietary data from private industry. other business transactions that require confidential treatment until concluded. l 1230 The amendment will result in the reporting of thousands of transactions to Congress. each requiring an Individual report containing large volumes of information and justification. Due to the administrative burden and the chilling effect of this amendment. the Department of Defense may be forced to reduce efforts to assist wounded warriors and otherwise help servicemembers solve their problems. I commend them for their worthy goal. but in the lesson taught me by my professor. Mr. Fratcher. reading it just makes it impossible for the Department of Defense to comply with it. So. consequently. I seriously am strongly opposed to this amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Lets say that we have a servicemember who is suspected of sharing sensitive information with another country or someone they shouldnt share it with. and those investigating the alleged offense enter into a confidentiality agreement not to share any information about the investigation because it would impair the investigation. As I read this amendment. within 2 weeks of entering that agreement it would have to be reported to the committees of the Congress substantial information about it. I dont see any protections in the amendment that would say that the disclosure of the agreement would have to be done in such a way so as not to impair the investigation. Look. theres a difference between transparency and redundancy. Theres a difference between transparency and paralysis. We need to have transparency so we can do our constitutional job. But if we have paralysis. we impair the executive branch from doing its job. We share the goal of this amendment. but we reject the means. and we would urge a \"no\" vote on the amendment.",

I am honored to recognize this young lady for her outstanding achievements and superior quality of character. Cheyenne is the youngest of three children and the daughter of a single. working mother. She is involved with Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America and works with her Big Sister at the Emergency Animal Rescue organization. When Cheyenne is not helping rescued animals. she continues volunteering her time at promotional events to raise money for Emergency Animal Rescue. In addition to her involvement with the rescue group. she is a hardworking and dedicated student. receiving excellent grades in school. Her dedication to such a demanding organization while balancing schoolwork is truly remarkable. Along with all of her achievements. Cheyenne took the Large Animal Rescue course in California to further expand her knowledge of animal rescue. This rigorous 2day training program teaches ways to extract animals from multiple dangerous and life threatening situations. At 12 years old. she was awarded the certification for Large Animal Rescue by the California State Fire Marshal. making her the youngest person to ever receive these qualifications. Madam Speaker. this is an extraordinary young lady whose actions and accomplishments directly reflect the type of person she is and will be.

Thankfully. there are hundreds of students in a town I represent who can say that their lives were touched by Fran Greenspan. For over twenty years. Fran has been involved in the education of students in the Half Hollow Hills School District. After she gave up teaching to raise her family. she joined the Parent Teacher Association. then the districts school board and ultimately became the districts President. She was a passionate advocate for child safety. expansion of the districts gifted students program and improvement in the drug and alcohol awareness programs. Her list of accomplishments is lengthy. but does not fully express the measure of her impact because woven into each one is a caring and warmth unique to Fran. For example. she founded and hosted a small program in the district for families with working parents who left for work before the start of the school day that needed a place for their children. At the elementary school each morning. Fran served those kids breakfast. For years. The Breakfast Club eased the burden on working families. and each child that passed through it became one of Frans children. In this and a thousand other ways. the community came to know and cherish Fran Greenspan. In honor of her years of dedication and service. the districts central administrative building now bears her name.

The fiveyear survival rate for ovarian cancer patients is 46 percent. while the tenyear survival rate is calculated to be as low as 39 percent. In 2009. it is estimated that more than 21.550 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14.600 will die of the disease. However. there is hope. If ovarian cancer is treated before it has spread outside the ovary. the fiveyear survival rate is an outstanding 93 percent. Unfortunately. due to the lack of an effective early detection test. less than 20 percent of cases are found early enough to treat. Survival rates vary greatly depending on the stage of ovarian cancer at diagnosis. Women diagnosed at an early stage have a dramatically higher fiveyear survival rate than those diagnosed at a late stage. Since there are currently no effective screening tools for ovarian cancer. raising patient and health care provider awareness is crucial and the only way to help women recognize potential warning signs that can extend and improve their lives. To this end. I urge my colleagues and their staff to join me in recognizing September as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.

First of all. he says he cant support this bill because we didnt deal with Fannie and Freddie. That is kind of like me saying I am not going to vote for the earned income tax credit because It doesnt deal with all of what caused poverty in America. You cant deal with every subject in every bill. We passed a bill that has dealt with Fannie and Freddie. and it has been over there in the Senate for a long time. And we are going to pass some other legislation to deal with Fannie and Freddie at some point. but it is not addressed in this bill. just like the whole totality of poverty is not addressed when we passed an earned income tax credit or when we passed health care. That is just a non sequitur. as far as I am concerned. He talks about. we didnt deal with disclosure so Im not going to vote for the bill. Everybody in America that got a loan that is in foreclosure now. everybody who is in default now got full disclosures of what the terms of their loans were. And they were ineffective to prevent the kind of predatory lending and policies that this bill addresses. So I dont know what the gentleman is talking about when he says \"we didnt deal with disclosure.\" We intentionally didnt deal with disclosure because we acknowledge that disclosure and telling people that we are giving you a bad loan is not enough to protect them any more than disclosure that a doctor may not be the best doctor in America is going to stop people from going to the doctor.

It is well known that the misrepresentation and the unverified nature of a borrowers income was a contributing factor to the mortgage crisis. Some borrowers purposely misstated or altered their incomes on documents in order to qualify for loans they couldnt afford. and some lenders either ignored or encouraged that practice. Columnist Gretchen Morgenson wrote last year: \"While borrowers may have misrepresented their incomes. either on their own or at the urging of their mortgage brokers. lenders had the tools to identify these fibs before making the loans. All they had to do was ask the IRS.\" Our amendment would require lenders to do this by simply verifying the borrowers income documentation with the IRS. They already have a program to do this. the Income Verification Express Service. This program utilizes IRS tax transcripts to verify a borrowers income within 2 business days. often the same day. for less than $5. This simple step will help catch fraudulent behavior before a lender closes on a loan that a borrower may not be able to afford. In his recent report to Congress. the special investigator inspector general for TARP recommended thirdparty verification of income like this IRS tax transcript program to prevent fraud. Income verification will strengthen the integrity of our mortgage system by ensuring borrowers receive a loan they can repay. lenders underwrite loans that are less likely to default. investors regain their confidence in the securitization process. and in the case of governmentsupported loans. taxpayers are protected.

It is well known that misrepresentation and the unverified nature of a borrowers income was a contributing factor to the mortgage crisis and the foreclosure crisis that we find ourselves in. Lenders either routinely ignored or encouraged this practice. leading to a higher risk of default. delinquency and foreclosure for borrowers and for Americas families. In fact. according to the Comptroller of the Currency. nearly 50 percent of all subprime mortgages relied on stated income. no verification. And the Mortgage Asset Research Institute found that 90 percent of the borrowers reported incomes higher than those found in the IRS files. And even more disturbing. almost 60 percent of the income amounts were exaggerated by more than 50 percent. In my district. foreclosure is a very serious issue. There were over 79.000 foreclosure filings in 2006. compared to 15.000 in 1995. One in seven of these homes was subprime lending. A quick. reliable and confidential income verification process will improve things so much. It will catch fraudulent behavior before the lender closes on a loan or before a borrower gets involved in a loan that he or she cant afford. strengthening the integrity of the mortgage market.

Frankly. the profligate availability of credit is a major reason for the current problem. So. yes. there are people who used to get mortgages who wont get them under this bill. Some lenders dont like that. There are lenders who made loans and they wont be able to make the loans under this bill. but that is precisely the point. The point is not to allow credit to be as loosely granted as it was even for qualified mortgages. People got mortgages who shouldnt have gotten them.

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 142. supporting National Mens Health Week. Since first being signed into law on May 31. 1994. National Mens Health Week has been celebrated all over the Nation during the week leading up to Fathers Day as a way to raise mens health awareness and to promote a healthy way of living among men. Men suffer from many health problems at a higher rate than women. They are almost twice more likely than women to die of heart disease. and between the ages of 45 and 54. men are three times more likely than women to die of heart attacks. Additionally. diseases such as testicular cancer and prostate cancer affect thousands of men every year. Studies have shown. however. that with proper lifestyle choices and medical assistance. men can fight and survive these diseases. Many health discrepancies between men and women can be attributed to lifestyle differences such as drinking. smoking. and other highrisk behavior. with men more likely than women to partake in these practices. But these differences only contribute a portion of the shorter life span and poorer health of men. In reality. men are less likely than women to visit a doctor. missing opportunities to pinpoint and change unhealthy habits and to diagnosis and treat diseases. Significant numbers of malerelated health problems such as prostate. colon. and testicular cancer could be detected and treated with mens greater awareness of their susceptibility to these health problems. When detected early. men who are diagnosed with these cancers have a high survival rate. Awareness. combined with the appropriate use of tests such as exams and cholesterol screenings. can detect many health problems early and increase the survival rate of these diseases to nearly 100 percent. National Mens Health Week not only benefits men. but also the important people in their lives. National Mens Health Week encourages men and their families to increase their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle. regular exercise. and medical checkups. Moreover. better longterm health among men can contribute to fewer medical expenses for their families. for taxpayers. and for employers.

This resolution expresses our support for the goals and ideals of National CaribbeanAmerican Heritage Month. Introduced by my colleague. Representative BARBARA LEE of California. on May 14. 2009. and reported out of the Oversight Committee by unanimous consent on June 18. 2009. House Concurrent Resolution 127 enjoys the support of over 50 Members of Congress. Since June of 2005. Congress has taken time each year to recognize Americans of Caribbean descent for their significant contributions to American culture and history during National Caribbean Heritage Month. Beginning as early as the year 1619. generations of Caribbean immigrants have come to America and significantly contributed thei rich traditions and culture. ethnic. and religious diversity to our social fabric. Regrettably. we must acknowledge that many CaribbeanAmericans arrived against their own volitionas slaves and indentured servants. whose struggles for freedom continue to reverberate. Many others came to this country in search of a better life for themselves and their children. and today. over 5 million Americans proudly share Caribbean heritage. CaribbeanAmericans have offered lasting contributions to every sector of our society. from public service. science. and athletics to business. education. and entertainment. Prominent CaribbeanAmericans include such historical and cultural figures as Alexander Hamiltonwho was born in the Caribbean regionformer Secretary of State Colin Powell. Eric Holder. our current Attorney General. and Shirley Chisholm. the first African American Congresswoman and first African American candidate for President. Other influential CaribbeanAmericans include Harlem renaissance poet. Claude McKay. actor and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte. and Sidney Poltier. the first African American actor to receive an Academy Award for best performance in a leading role. Mr. Speaker. these and countless other CaribbeanAmericans have made invaluable contributions to our Nation. and it is fitting that we on honor them today.

The Caribbean people have had a place in the history of the United States from its very beginning. The first Caribbean people who immigrated to the United States did so in 1619 as indentured workers who were brought to Jamestown. Virginia. During the centuries that followed. many people were brought to the United States from the Caribbean as slaves and. since 1820. millions more have emigrated. bringing with them their talents and high values. which have enriched our Nation and assisted in its formation. Many notable people in the history of the United States have strong Caribbean ties. Those already mentioned are certainly very important to the history of our country. Alexander Hamilton. not only the first Secretary of the Treasury. but also one of the authors of the Federalist Papers. was born in the Caribbean. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sidney Poitier. and musician Harry Belafonte are all CaribbeanAmericans. as you have heard.

The United States and the nations of the Caribbean have had many traits that are indicative of our similarities with one another. The histories of the United States and the countries of the Caribbean have faced similar trials of slavery. colonialism. and the struggle for independence. The people who comprise our separate nations are similar in that we are all different. coming from very diverse racial. ethnic. cultural. and religious backgrounds. In addition to celebrating the contribution CaribbeanAmericans have made to the United States. we honor these historical similarities between our nations. I ask my fellow Members of Congress to join me in recognizing the contributions of CaribbeanAmericans to the history of the United States and the way in which their presence enrichep and strengthens our country.

The ties between the United States and its close neighbors to the south are ones that go back to the founding of our early colonies. the fight for independence and the founding of this country. George Washington. our first President. visited family in Barbados. As youve heard many times this afternoon. Alexander Hamilton. his aidedecamp. a Revolutionary War hero. chief author of the Federalist Papers and first Secretary of the Treasury. was born in Nevis and raised in St. Croix in my own district.

Caribbean nations are important neighbors and partners within the global community. playing a vital role in the pursuit of peace and prosperity throughout the world.

In New York Carib News June 16. 2009 edition. the article highlights the important contributions made by Caribbean Americans to both the Untied States and their respective home countries. The article refers to President Obama as having recognized the importance of the Caribbean American community and the enormous contributions it has made to the United States over past centuries. The Caribbean community continues the tradition of offering a vibrant culture. as have so many other cultures that have helped to define our American heritage. It is important to note the contributions made by English. French. Spanish and Dutch speaking nations of the Caribbean. as each of these brings its own cultural aspect to the larger American community. It is imperative that we note not only the contributions Caribbean Americans have made to the United States. but also the contributions they have made to their home countries. Each year. Caribbean Americans remit billions of dollars per year to CARICOM nations. and maintain a multibillion dollar buying power. some of which is used to advance the growth of their home countries. The Caribbean Heritage Month celebration that will kick off in Brooklyn is defined by music. theatre. panel discussions. a cultural fair. and other activities that actively illustrate the culture of the Caribbean. In the years to come. it is important that the United States maintain a strong relationship with the Caribbean nations. The value that these nations place on growth and economic development. as well as personal advancement are values reflected in American culture and thus show the commonalities that our country shares with these nations. As we continue to cultivate these relationships. let us not forget the wealth of interchangeable benefit such communication and interaction with one another can yield. Caribbean Heritage Month plays an integral role in shaping Americas understanding that such nations play in our progress and growth. May this Caribbean Heritage Month designation continue to draw from the unique culture of Caribbean Americans. and be used as a source of influence for continued CaribbeanAmerican relations.",

A Humvee driver while in Iraq. he took on dangerous positions. often leaving himself exposed to IED and smallarms attacks. As an infantryman in Afghanistan. Jacob saw firsthand the perils of combat. but he faced those perils with courage. Those close to Jacob noted that the stresses of combat and long deployments seemed to have little effect on his infectious personality.

National Public Radios recent firing of longtime news analyst Juan Williams was a wakeup call for many Americans to political correctness and liberal bias at NPR. However. its not the liberal bias that offends me so much as that American citizens are forced to subsidize it with their hardearned tax dollars. Long before the Juan Williams fiasco. I sponsored legislation to pull the plug on taxpayer funding for NPR. I enjoy some programs on NPR. but I have long believed that it can stand on its own. The question is not the quality of programming on NPR. The question today is whether government programs and services that can be funded privately should be subsidized by taxpayers. As a country. we no longer have this luxury. if we ever did. With the national debt over $13 trillion. the government simply cant afford to continue funding nonessential services. Americans voted through the popular Web site YouCut to place this proposal on the House floor for a vote today. The selection of this measure shows the American people desire to rein in unnecessary spending. My proposal would prohibit Federal dollars from going to NPR through any of the various Federal grants they now access. I myself enjoy NPR programming. but why should Americans foot the bill for this when we have to borrow about 40 cents on every Federal dollar? NPR local radio stations directly receive congressionally appropriated funds that reached over $65 million in 2010 alone. Plus. local stations directly receive grants from other Federal sources such as the National Endowment for the Arts. NPR stations then use these taxpayer dollars on licensing fees for NPR programming. which are then funneled back to NPR headquarters here in Washington. DC. Taking this indirect funding into account. Federal funds now make up an estimated 20 percent of NPRs annual budget. Let me be clear. this measure will not prohibit local stations from receiving any other funding. It will just prohibit them from using taxpayer money to acquire NPR programming.",

    "speech": "When you mix NPR and FOX News and you go back and deconstruct that. they have rules of journalism that they follow. that people are supposed to follow. and Mr. Williams had trouble following those rules before. But notwithstanding that. the point is we need to have the public in public broadcasting. The Federal minuscule dollars that are invested in that compared to the amount of money that is wasted in defense. in agriculture subsidy pales by comparison. And I think we are going to be able to work with some of the new Members of Congress to deal with things that have defied reform in the past. I am looking forward to some of what they say. But public broadcasting is a resource. is a treasure for Americans from coast to coast. It is trusted by more Americans than any other resource in terms of the news. and it is far more than just news. It is education. It is culture. It is history. And it would be a tragedy to eat away at NPR to make it harder to serve the difficulttoreach areas of our country.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. the issue is about spending. It is about stopping the rampant spending in Washington. And on November 2. Americans spoke decisively and sent an undeniable message to Washington to end wasteful spending. In the new Republican majority next Congress. Madam Speaker. the YouCut program will be an integral part of our efforts to transform the culture of spending in Washington into one of savings. More than 2.4 million YouCut votes provide us with a clear mandate to rein in spending and make the tough choices to get America back on the right path. This weeks winning item. Madam Speaker. is a proposal developed by the gentleman from Colorado. Representative DOUG LAMBORN. This proposal would eliminate taxpayer funding for National Public Radio. When executives at NPR decided to unfairly terminate Juan Williams for expressing his opinion and to then disparage him afterwards. the bias of the organization was exposed. To be clear. it is not the governments job to tell a news organization how to do its job. But whats equally as certain is that it should not be the taxpayers responsibility to fund news organizations with a partisan point of view. Eliminating taxpayer funding for NPR is precisely the kind of commonsense cut that we have to begin making if we want to fundamentally alter the way business is conducted in Washington. Over the past 2 years. Americans have become exasperated as theyve watched the Federal Government grow to an unacceptable level of spending. by spending record levels of money it simply doesnt have. In order to get America back to opportunity. responsibility. and success. Republicans and Democrats must come together and begin making tough choices. Todays YouCut vote is an opportunity for both parties to come together and to tell the people that have sent us heremessage received.",

The Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill has highlighted the pressing need for research on technology to make deepwater drilling for oil and natural gas safer and cleaner. While the investigations into the causes of the disaster are still ongoing. the disaster has already made Congress and the public aware of the significant shortcomings in much of the oil industrys current deepwater drilling technologymost notably its blowout preventers. This legislation refocuses the Department of Energys deepwater drilling research to place higher priority on research on technology that will increase the safety and reliability of deepwater drilling technology in the years to comeand rightly so. The National Energy Technology Laboratories facility in southwestern Pennsylvania has been the Department of Energys leader in research on ultradeepwater drilling for oil and natural gas for many years. NETL has a talented staff with unparalleled expertise and a long and successful record of research projects to improve the safety and efficiency of fossil fuel production technologies like deepwater drilling. It only makes sense that this legislation preserves the National Energy Technology Laboratories role in conducting research on a subject on which they have so much knowledge and experience. I am pleased that Chairman GORDON has confirmed that it is the Committees intention that the National Energy Technology Laboratories will continue their important work on deepwater drilling research under the Safer Oil and Natural Gas Drilling Technology Research program addressed in this legislation. I commend the Chairman.

During the war. approximately 5.000 Cypriots were killed and close to 200.000 Greek Cypriots were forcibly removed from their homes. This anniversary also marks another year in which Cyprus is divided between north and south and between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities. However. despite 36 years of division in Cyprus. I remain hopeful about reaching a just and lasting settlement. Following his election in February 2008. President Demetris Christofias followed through on his commitment to make the solution of the Cyprus problem his top priority. In September of that year. he embarked on fullfledged negotiations with Mehmet Talat. who was at the time the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community. I am encouraged that these negotiations are continuing under the new Turkish Cypriot leader Dervis Eroglu. The ongoing talks aim at reaching a comprehensive settlement for the Cyprus problem with the goal of achieving the unification of Cyprus based on a bizonal. bicommunal federation and political equality. as set out in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The agreement should also lead to a single sovereignty. single citizenship and single international personality for Cyprus. The House of Representatives has voiced its strong support for comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue. On October 9. 2007. the House passed House Resolution 405. which expressed its support for the immediate implementation of the U.N.-brokered July 8. 2006 agreement as the way forward to prepare for new comprehensive negotiations leading to the reunification of Cyprus within a bizonal. bicommunal federation. In addition. the resolution called upon the United States Government to fully support the immediate implementation this agreement in its entirety. There are still many difficult issues that need to be resolved before a comprehensive agreement to the Cyprus problem can be achieved. Turkey. which continues to deploy 43.000 troops in Cyprus. is critical to reaching such an agreement. I urge Turkey to work constructively with the Cypriots in support of a negotiated settlement and the peaceful reunification of the island.",

Judge Sotomayors nomination to the highest court in the land is historic in several respects. Clearly. becoming the first Hispanic to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court is an important milestone. Our country is well served when these barriers fall and we are able to put forward qualified candidates who reflect the diversity of our citizenry. But what also makes Judge Sotomayors nomination so significant is the extent of her judicial experience and her overall qualifications. Judge Sotomayor has more Federal judicial experience than any jurist nominated to the Court in the last 100 years. and has more overall judicial experience than any nominee in the last 70 years. She is the first Supreme Court nominee to have sat on both a Federal trial court and an appellate court. and would be the only current justice with trial court experience. Altogether. she has been a Federal judge for over 17 years. including 6 years on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and 11 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In addition to serving on the bench. Judge Sotomayor has a distinguished record as a prosecutor and an attorney in private practice. Considering the depth of Judge Sotomayors experience. it is not surprising that after a thorough review of her record the American Bar Association unanimously gave her their highest rating. The ABA found that she was \"well qualified\" to serve as a justice based on her integrity. competence. and judicial temperament. Judge Sotomayors testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee also demonstrated her adherence to mainstream jurisprudence and commitment to objectively making decisions based on the facts of each case and the applicable legal precedent. I strongly believe Judge Sotomayor has the qualifications. experience. and impartiality necessary to be an excellent justice of the Supreme Court. and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.

I view the Supreme Court as a body charged with impartially deciding what the law means as it is applied to a specific . case. I believe Judge Sotomayor views the Supreme Court as more of a policymaking body where laws are shaped based on the personal views of the justices.

I found her answers thoughtful. her intellect keen. and that Judge Sotomayor possessed the requisite reverenceand patiencefor the process outlined in article H. section 2 of the Constitution. I watched the hearings intently. I studied Judge Sotomayors words. What struck me about the Judiciary Committees hearings was the dearth of inquiry into her judicial record. Indeed. her record is certainly substantial. the most substantial record I have seen in some time. But. instead of delving into her many opinions. or questioning her on Supreme Court jurisprudence. Judge Sotomayor was asked the same few questions over and over. needlessly. The tendency to grandstand is hardly a partisan thing. The Senates ability to question a nominee is a precious gift from our Founding Fathersa check on the Judiciary and on the Executive. While the President may nominate. the advice and consent of the Senate is required for confirmation. But. In this particular instance. partisan trifles took the place of constitutional probing. Statements were taken out of context. while volumes of Judge Sotomayors judicial record went unquestioned. and likely unread. Unfortunately. by not probing. the Senate shirks its responsibilities. Judge Sotomayors story is similar to my own story. Much like my own journey from the southern coalfields of Raleigh County to the U.S. Senate. Judge Sotomayor overcame tremendous adversity through determination and hard work. Judge Sotomayor will be confirmed by the Senate. That is a good thing. I hope that we as a body will reflect on the nomination and confirmation processes as envisioned in the Constitution. and ask ourselves whether we can do a better job in living up to the spirit of the law in the future.",

The proposed site for this center will be at the junction of State Highway 140 and State Highway 49. located in Mariposa just outside the Arch Rock entrance to Yosemite National Park. A visitor center at this location will not only provide Yosemite National Park with an opportunity to enhance their visitor services. it will be a tourist destination for travelers in the gateway community of Mariposa as well. This noncontroversial bill enjoys a broad array of local support including the Mariposa County Board of Supervisors. Chamber of Commerce. Economic Development Corporation. and County Tourism Bureau. in addition to the current Superintendent of Yosemite National Park and the Yosemite Fund. Additionally. this authorizing legislation is PAYGO neutral and does not authorize direct spending. Madam Speaker. I am eager to lend my support to a project that will benefit the local economy of Mariposa by providing tourism opportunities as well as enhancing the visitor experience at Yosemite National Park. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation as it moves through Congress.",

This experience of patriotism and civic consciousness is a time to reflect on the bravery and commitment of those who have answered the call to serve and our responsibilities to uphold the ideals for which they fought. In Congress. this is a time to recommit ourselves to caring for those who served our country and their families. They have fulfilled their obligations to the American people. and we must fulfill our obligations to them. Thats why I am pleased Congress has provided historic increases of 60 percent since 2007 for health care and other services for our veterans. In fiscal year 2010. Congress increased funding by $15.3 billion over last years level and $747 million above the administrations request. Congress and President Obama also passed a law to fund veterans medical care one year in advance to ensure timely and uninterrupted funding for veterans health care system. To support our active duty personnel. I supported a 3.4 percent military pay increase. a $3 billion increase in funding for Defense Health Programs. and a $3.46 billion increase for equipment in the field. While I am pleased Congress is providing robust funding to care for our military and veterans. much work remains to be done such as ensuring increased resources for PTSD and other mental health issues. resolving the continued backlogs of veterans claims. and concurrent receipt. The courage of our military and our veterans is an inspiration to us all. and we thank them all for their service and sacrifice to protect our freedoms. The thoughts and prayers of our entire nation are with the men and women serving today. those who have bravely served. and the families of those whose ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten.

There is simply no way that we can maintain this type of spending without destroying our Nation. We know what happens to individuals that bury themselves in debt. We know what happens to companies and institutions that fail to maintain balanced books. And we know what happens to nations that spend this irresponsibly. We need only look overseas to the effects of such disastrous fiscal policies. But for some reason. a reason that wholly escapes [ENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 156. Pt. 7 me. the current administration and the majority in Congress continue to move forward with their ruinous plans. There is no reasonable national policy that can be implemented that assumes a national debt increasing by 18 percent in just 16 months.

Flotilla 81 was the fifth Auxiliary unit formed in the United States and was made up of volunteering yachtsmen who had summer homes in Ocean City. Their first meeting was held at the Ocean City Yacht Club on June 1. 1940. As the United States was thrust into World War II. the Coast Guard Auxiliary was reorganized in 1941 to include only civilians and civilian vessels. During World War II. the flotilla from Ocean City engaged in offshore rescues and conducted observation patrols along the New Jersey coastline on a near daily basis. with 8 months of daily coverage in 1942a mission which was unmatched by any other flotilla in the United States at that time. Even during the famous Hurricane of 1945. the Ocean City Flotilla played a major role in the rescue and preservation of lives and property by providing nearly 4.000 manhours of service in a 3day period. After the war. the flotilla and the auxiliary went through an evolution. As changes in membership and activity caused other auxiliary flotillas to be deactivated. other auxiliaries began to fill a need for public education and vessel safety examinations. As the mission of the Coast Guard has been expanded over the years. the importance of the auxiliary has grown. Congress is adding more responsibilities and the Coast Guard is increasing the training opportunities and duties for the auxiliary. and Flotilla 81 is leading the way. From important safety patrols and operational support to Coast Guard missions. to educational briefings on boating safety and vessel safety checks. Flotilla 81 is providing a vital service to the region. and serves as an example to the country. With an honorable and distinguished history. and a dedicated and enthusiastic membership today. it is my honor and pleasure to recognize the 70th Anniversary of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 81 of Ocean City.

He would eventually say. okay. okay. Ill let you in on the secret how you do it. First. you accept $10 million. which is pretty funny. because nobody just gets themselves $10 million unless youre a special person or something. And then he said. you just dont pay taxes.

I used TurboTax. Its not my fault. TurboTax did that. I didnt do it.\" And then that saves you penalty and interest. So there ought to be a number of things. Rangel Rule perhaps. but TurboTax Rule.

The designation of wilderness in Idaho is long overdue. as it has been nearly thirty years since the late Senator Frank Church created the River of No Return Wilderness. I applaud the Senator for having the patience and perseverance to develop the compromises he has made with numerous ranchers. county officials. sportsman groups and conservation groups. The years of effort he put into creating this legislation are a testament to just how special these lands are. It is assured that Idahoans will be enjoying these unspoiled vistas and areas for generations to come. There are numerous individuals in Idaho to congratulate for their hard work. I wont name them all. but Fred Grant. Chad Gibson. Brenda Richards and Craig Gherke put a lot of effort into this process. In addition. John Hoehne and Layne Bangerter of Senator CRAPOs staff did tremendous staff work on the ground in Idaho. If they and so many others didnt commit themselves to the Owyhee initiative. there would have been nothing to work with here in D.C. Finally. I saw first hand here in Washington how this legislation could not have been completed without the efforts of Peter Fischer on Senator CRAPOs staff. David Brooks on Senator BINGAMANs staff. and Marcia Argust with the Campaign for Americas Wildemess. Their commitment and belief in the product developed in Idaho made it possible for this legislation to move forward.

The legislation expands the authority of the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General to allow it to ban corporate executives from doing business with Medicare if their companies were convicted of fraud. It also gives the inspector general the ability to exclude parent companies that may be committing fraud through shell companies. This important bill will close two loopholes in current law so that criminal offenders who defraud our Nations seniors will have to pay for their crimes. Mr. Speaker. for every dollar put into the pockets of criminals. a dollar is taken out of the system to provide muchneeded care to millions of Medicare patients. including two of our Nations most vulnerable populationsseniors and the disabled. This morning. my subcommittee held a hearing on Medicare fraud in which we talked about the many important provisions of the new health care law that will assist CMS. the OIG. and the Justice Department in identifying abusive suppliers and fraudulent billing practices. In that hearing. we heard from the inspector general about how this bill will help fight fraud by closing two remaining gaps. The first gap allows an executive who has left the company being charged with fraud by the time of conviction to continue to participate in Federal health programs. This shortfall willingly permits these criminals to move from one company to another and continue to steal from Medicare seniors and taxpayers. H.R. 6130 would give the OIG the authority to ban these executives from doing business with Medicare. The second gap allows companies that engage in fraud who have set up shell companies to insulate themselves from liability and get off scotfree. Once these shell organizations dissolve. there is no real penalty to the parent company. So H.R. 6130 would give the OIG the authority to ban these parent companies from doing business with Medicare. Mr. Speaker. all forms of fraud undermine the integrity of our public health system. and I applaud my colleagues from the Ways and Means Committeeparticularly Mr. STARKfor working on this important legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to support H.R. 6130. a commonsense solution to combating fraud in Medicare. This legislation will provide the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General with tools to properly combat Medicare fraud. First. it will close an important loophole in current law and give the Office of the Inspector General additional authority to fight fraud. Under current law. for example. if an executive leaves a company before the company is convicted of Medicare fraud. that executive cannot be barred from participating in Federal health programs. Under current law. an executive intent on defrauding Medicare could simply move from one company to another and continue to inequitably use American taxpayers money. Second. this law will prevent companies from hiding behind corporate shells. Some companies use shell companies to protect the parent company from any liability. If the company is caught participating in fraud. the shell could be dissolved. leaving the parent company fully intact. Under this bill. the Office of Inspector General can exclude parent companies when such punishment is merited. I am glad that we are continuing to find ways to combat fraud in Medicare because we know that health care costs are out of control. And I might say. I am sure every Member had the same experiences that I did when we were home over this recent 3week work period in which people were coming up asking all sorts of questions about the health care reform bill. and we really do not know the answers to it because HHS is basically going to be writing these regulations.

As you heard from Mr. PALLONE. the bill will help our brave men and women September 22. 2010 CONGRI who serve as medics in Afghanistan and Iraq to transition into EMT jobs when they return. The act authorizes grants for States that have a shortage of EMTs to create a fasttrack program for vets who received and completed military emergency medical training to become emergency responders. The funds authorized in this bill can be used to provide coursework and training. and reimbursement for the cost of coursework. and any certification fees. Obviously. the bill is a winwin for the country and our vets. Its passage will enhance the surge capacities of local medical facilities and provide jobs for our vets. especially during this critical economic downturn. It is worth noting that the unemployment rate last year for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 18 to 24 years old was 21.1 percent. Let me repeat that. Our returning vets unemployment rate was 21.1 percent unemployment. which is significantly higher than the 16.6 percent rate for nonveterans of the same age. Presently. military medics who wish to become first responders must restart their training from scratch. fulfilling the same entry level criteria as people with no prior training or experience. These duplicative efforts waste time. money. and talent. At the same time. many hospitals and emergency medical services throughout the country operate at or near capacity. and a terrorist attack or natural disaster would result in a surge of patients that would overwhelm medical facilities. Correcting this requires having the largest possible pool of experienced medical personnel on hand. With military medics recent experience administering trauma care in Afghanistan and Iraq. these vets are ideally suited to respond to largescale medical emergencies. They are ideal first responders. making life or death decisions amid a backdrop of chaos and confusion. Their work at the scenes of IED attacks. suicide bombings. and firefights prepares them for this. In conclusion. the GAO study that",

There are plenty of studies out there. and theres also a lot of anecdotal evidence that there are really severe shortages across our health workforce. and this is an area to which I brought particular attention. looking at where these shortages are. in trying to think not just how we look at the traditional pipelines to bring people into these positions. but how we think outside of the box at some of the nontraditional sources where we can find the expertise and the experience to bring that through the pipeline and to fill these shortages. H.R. 3199 proposes a very innovative way to meet the needs that we have across the country for emergency medical technicians. It recognizes that military medics who are returning have acquired very valuable experience during their service. which positions them extremely well to meet those needs and to fill those positions. It also recognizes that theres obstacles. that theres significant costs sometimes associated with the training that goes with certification. that it can be difficult in terms of getting that done in a timely fashion. What this bill does is address those issues. It would award grants to States to begin to streamline the licensing process. provide some resources to assist with the costs of training. and do other things to basically expedite this process of getting these experienced people into these jobs where we need them.

Since becoming a Member of this House 6 years ago. nothing has been more important to her than the enactment of this legislation to provide compensation for those of her constituents who suffered unspeakable acts of horror during World War II. Mr. Speaker. the people of Guam. as you heard. were subject to the severest and most Inhumane public treatmenttorture as well as death at the hands of the Japaneseand they have waited much too long for this compensation. The Guam War Claims Review Commission rightly found that Guams residents were inequitably treated under the Guam Meritorious Claims Act and subsequent Federal laws meant to address World War II personal injury claims. This commission. which was established pursuant to legislation sponsored by our former colleague from Guam. Robert Underwood. recommended that Congress enact legislation providing for additional compensation to Guams residents. thus. the bill we are discussing today. The struggle for fair compensation for the people of Guam has been ongoing now for more than 60 years. Sadly. many of the Chamorros who suffered these atrocities. as Ms. BORDALLO has said. have passed away. but we must not let their sufferinglargely due to the steadfast loyalty to the United Statesbe in vain. Passage of this is long overdue. and by doing so today. we will honor their memories and provide compensation to these brave Americans.

There is muttering and talking to the Parliamentarian and he says yes. indeed there is supposed to be a copy of the bill on the floor. So he comes back a couple of minutes later and says. Ive been wandering around the Chamber and Im having trouble finding it. Is it north. south. east or west or something like that. Pretty soon the Speaker starts laughing and we go back and forth about four times in a row. Finally he says. Ive come up to the podium. and the place where you say there is a copy of the bill there isnt because the Clerk is still trying to stick 300 pages of amendments in this bill. So here we are passing a bill that doesnt even exist. And the funny thing wasI guess it wasnt funnythe public was paying attention. They understood that we passed a massive tax increase on energy thats affecting very many small people who have to pay that power bill. Everybody who flips a light switch is going to get taxed. along with a massive amount of red tape. And it was done. they thought. in the secret and in the dark of night. But the public was paying attention. and. in my opinion. that started a lot of that Tea Party movement. that very event that we actually were standing here on the floor for.",

I was shocked when I came here and saw that its full speed ahead with the majority party. I think thats why. when we took over the House in the 104th Congress. we had open rules.

We invented the tissue business and femcare products. We have some tremendous paper products. . 2150 But we have some problems.

And the list goes on: armaments. power generation. oil and petrochemicals. telecommunications. civil aviation. shipping. machinery. automobiles. information technology. iron. steel. They have some very strategic plans underway to target everything we manufacture for extinction to take the jobs away. And let me detail how they did it in paper. The government would purchase raw materials in Brazil. at government expense ship it over to China. ship it from the port on trucks up to the paper mill. make the paper. And then again at government expense. after the government allows slavelike wages to be paid. the government then pays for the paper to be shipped back to the port. shipped over off of Oakland. and then dumped into the United States of America below our cost of production.

I rise with my colleague Senator COLLINS. to file this vital amendment to correct disparities among the Small Business Administrations. SBA. small business contracting programs and thus create a more equitable method for Federal agencies to fairly allocate Federal procurement dollars to small business contractors across the nation. This targeted amendment reflects a proposed rule promulgated last year. March 2008. by the Department of Defense. DOD. the Government Services Administration. GSA. and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA. which requires the Federal Acquisitions Regulations. FAR. clearly reflect the SBAs interpretation of the Small Business Act and the SBAs analysis of its own regulations and provide an equal playing field for small business firms who participate in the Federal contracting marketplace. The SBAs own counsel asserts that parity legislation must be adopted because Federal agencies \" must be afforded some discretion in determining which small business program to utilize.\" Parties agree that small business should be treated uniformly. Our amendment would provide Federal agencies with the necessary flexibility to satisfy their Governmentwide statutory small business contracting goals. It would provide these agencies with the ability to achieve their goaling requirements equally through an award to a small business. a historically underutilized business zone. HUBZone. small business concern. a servicedisabled veteranowned small business. SDVOSB. firm. or a small business participating in the 8(a) Business Development Program. Of course this list should also include the Womens Procurement Program once it finally becomes fully implemented by the SBA. For years. it has been unclear to the acquisition community what. if any. is the true order of preference when determining which small business contracting program is at the top of the agencys priority list. This amendment will make clear to purchasing agencies that contracting officers may award contracts to HUBZone. SDVOSB. 8(a) firms with equal deference to each program. This amendment represents the essence of true paritywhere each program has an equal chance of being selected for an award. And during these difficult economic times. it is imperative that small business contractors possess an equal opportunity to compete for Federal contracts on the same playing field with each other.

    "speech": "Madam President. the bill we passed contains provisions that I support and others that I oppose. I want to indicate why I voted aye. In the end. I think it is critical for Congress to increase the FDICs borrowing authority to reduce a costly special assessment that the FDIC intends to impose on distressed banks. and therefore I supported the bill. Over the last 2 years the FDIC has had to take over 41 different failed depository institutions and in the process has depleted its insurance fund. At its current level. the FDIC is required by law to increase its insurance premiums on banks to recapitalize the fund. However. increasing banks costs now would only worsen the current recession. Congress can reduce the size of this assessment by 50 percent if it increases the FDICs borrowing authority from $30 billion to $100 billion. Doing so will help banks hold onto capital that they can use to absorb future losses and make it through these difficult economic conditions. Unfortunately. this bill would increase the FDICs borrowing authority at the same time that it would expand the HOPE for Homeowners Programa $300 billion program designed to allow up to 400.000 borrowers to refinance into an FHAbacked loan. The FHA mortgage program has exploded with the decline of the subprime industry as borrowers have flocked to the Government program. FHA loans are attractive due to the high loan limitsup to $729.250 in high cost areasand only a 3.5percent downpayment requirement. According to Inside Mortgage Finance. the FHAs market e jumped to nearly a third of all mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2008 from about 2 percent in early 2006. At the same time. FHA mortgage defaults have increased sharply and are diminishing the FHAs reserve fund. Roughly 7.5 percent of FHA loans were seriously delinquent at the end of February. up from 6.2 percent a year earlier. The FHAs reserve fund fell to about 3 percent of its mortgage portfolio in fiscal year 2008. down from 6.4 percent in the previous year. By law. the reserve fund must remain above 2 percent. Recently. HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that he did not know whether the FHA would be able to continue to pay its obligations. Many believe that Congress will have to inject additional funding into the FHA.",

When Demetrios first joined my staff more than 4 years ago. he came with a chorus of support and an impressive set of skills and experience. This week. he leaves the Senate for his next challenge with an even larger group of supporters and another impressive list of accomplishments. Demetrios was at the center of the largest expansion and reform of trade adjustment assistance since its creation four decades ago. He was critical to our granting permanent normal trade relations to Vietnam. and instrumental in keeping U.S.-China economic ties on track in challenging times. Demetrios helped me and the Senate extend trade preference programs to the worlds poorest nations. and worked to lay the groundwork for the important pending trade agreements that I hope that the Senate will consider in the coming months. He did all of this with an unwavering commitment to this country. and an unassailable reputation for fairness and openness to supporters and opponents alike. And as many of my colleagues and their staff will always remember. Demetrios never failed to bring a little bit of fun and a good sense of humor to even the hardest job. But what I will remember most about Demetrios is his commitment to the people that our economic policies affect. In Montana. Demetrios made a point to know the ranchers in Molt. the seed potato farmers in Manhattan. and the wheat farmers in Three Forks. Demetrioss intelligence and experience helped guide me and the Senate through the letter of our trade laws.

Demetrios is well known to all of us on the Finance Committee. For 4 years. he has very ably served Chairman BAucus--most recently as the Democratic chief international trade counsel. So he has played a central role in all of the committees efforts on trade policy during this time. Not only is Demetrios a very sharp trade lawyer and policy adviser. he is also a skilled negotiator. That will serve him well in his new position. I am grateful for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship that Demetrios brought to the Finance Committee. and I am sorry to see him depart. His energy and good nature will certainly be missed. At the same time. I am comforted by the fact that our Nation will continue to benefit from Demetrios commitment to public service. He assumes a very important portfolio at the Office of the United States Trade Representative. as a trade Ambassador to Asia and Africa. and also with responsibility for the trade and development portfolio. as well as for labor and the environment. I therefore look forward to engaging Demetrios in efforts to open up new market opportunities for U.S. exporters in the Asian region. I also look forward to working with him on a reform of our unilateral trade preference programs. We must address these key trade priorities in the 111th Congress. so I expect that well continue to see Demetrios on a regular basis for some time to come. In closing.

This special recognition started 25 years ago to highlight and raise awareness of this devastating disease. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in the U.S. other than skin cancer. In 2009. it is estimated that in the United States there will be 192.370 new cases and 40.170 deaths from breast cancer. Sadly. just in my District in San Bernardino County. California the breast cancer incidence was reported to be 116.6 cases per 100.000 females during the period of 2001 to 2005. This is why we need to continue all efforts to raise awareness. not just during October but throughout the year. As a husband. father. grandfather. and as a sonthe wonderful women in my life continue to be my driving force behind trying to make a difference in this fight against breast cancer. My efforts and passion date back to my public service in the California State Legislature. Through the leadership of Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN. I helped passed the reauthorization for the Breast Cancer Stamp. which to this date has raised over $55 million dollars for research on breast cancer. These efforts coupled with the month long activities of many organizations on behalf of Breast Cancer Awareness Month are necessary to ensure that all men and women across America have the tools to overcome breast cancer. While we recognize October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. we must also keep in mind that breast cancer is prevalent in our society and any healthcare reform must address this problem. This is why passing healthcare reform that includes a ban on denying coverage based on preexisting conditions is extremely important. Millions of Americans combating breast cancer must not be denied coverage based on their condition at a time when these individuals need coverage the most. We must ensure that access to adequate testing for breast cancer and patient education is readily available. I congratulate all individuals and organizations that will hold events this month. and urge every American to do their part to observe Breast Cancer Awareness Month.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to congratulate the citizens of the Borough of Somerville. county of Somerset. New Jersey. as they celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the incorporation of their municipality. Although the Borough of Somerville was not incorporated until April 16. 1909. its roots lie much deeper in American history. The town of Somerville was settled in 1683 by Dutch and English immigrants as part of Bridgewater Township. The town unwaveringly aided in the fight for the independence of our Nation. including housing General George Washington from December 1778 to June 1779 while the Continental Army was stationed at Camp Middlebrook. Until the 1840s. Somerville was a sparsely populated agricultural community. However. with the completion of the rail line in the 1840s and the development of water power in the 1850s. Somerville rapidly developed. From the abundant red clay from which Somerville was built. brick making became one of the earliest industries. Today. Somerville is an essential hub in central New Jersey. and the seat of county government. the Somerset Board of Chosen Freeholders. Its bustling yet quaint Main Street boasts numerous boutique specialty shops and a large variety of dining options. The borough also hosts many local recreational. cultural. and historical activities. including the annual Tour of Somerville bike race. the oldest bicycle race in the United States. and both the home of the historic Wallace House and Old Dutch Parsonage. Somerville has truly become a premiere destination for visitors. The Borough of Somerville continues to grow and prosper. Currently. the borough is in the process of completing a large redevelopment project to include a new shopping center. town homes. and many other amenities on the grounds of the former borough landfill. The project is centered around the Somerville train station and envisioned as a transit village redevelopment. Madam Speaker. for 100 years. Somerville has been a center for local commerce. not only for the citizens of Somerville. but for all of New Jersey. Somerville is truly a unique and special part of New Jersey. and I ask you. Madam Speaker. and my colleagues to congratulate all residents of Somerville on.their special centennial celebration.",

Texas. a Historian and SeminoleNegro Indian descendent of the John Horse Band. and commemorate the distinguished service and loyalty of the SeminoleNegro Indian Scouts to the United States Army. Following the Civil War. the Army was called into west Texas to defend settlements and travelers against retaliation raids from displaced Apache and Comanche Indians. However. they lacked the ability to track down and stop them. The Army needed experienced Indian fighters who knew the rugged terrain and were as skilled as their opponents at surviving and fighting in the desert borderlands. Thus. in 1870 the fearless SeminoleNegro Indians were recruited from Mexico as U.S. Army scouts. They were highly regarded and praised by their commanders for being excellent trackers. hunters and marksmen. and experts at handtohand combat. During twentysix expeditions they engaged in twelve battles without losing a single scout. and their bravery earned four scouts the Congressional Medal of Honor. Therefore Madam Speaker it is my great pleasure to rise and announce in honor of these esteemed persons that the greater Washington. DC chapter of the 9th and 10th Horse Calvary Association. in partnership with the Army Freedom Team Salute and St. Elizabeths Hospital of Washington.

This bill would establish a grant program within the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance to states for the rehabilitation of publiclyowned dams that fail to meet minimum safety standards.

These dams pose an unacceptable level of risk to the public and should be rehabilitated expeditiously. I cosponsored similar legislation in the 110th Congress. however. I am advised that it was not considered by the Committee on Environment and Public Works due to concerns over language in the bill which would have required that dam repair work funded under the act adhere to DavisBacon locally prevailing wage requirements.

This is the 25th anniversary of Public Service Recognition Week. which always takes place the first full week of May. It is a time set aside each year to honor the men and women who serve America as Federal. State. and local government employees. and commend their dedication to serving others.

Public servants teach our children. protect our homes and communities. secure our public water systems and critical infrastructure. preserve our natural resources. and defend the principles of liberty and freedom that we hold dear. The men and women who serve in the armed forces. and the civilian employees who support their missions. are prime examples of public service. They embody the spirit of service. characterized by a willingness to defend this nation. Despite the many hardships of serving through long conflicts. these men and women serve with bravery and unwavering devotion. They have sacrificed their lives so that we might continue to be free. President Obama has called for action to \"encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations.\" While Public Service Recognition Week provides the opportunity to honor and celebrate the works of federal employees. it also serves as an opportunity for all Americans to explore the various careers in public service. Through job fairs. agency sponsored events. and special exhibits. Public Service Recognition Week allows the American public to gain a deeper appreciation of the challenging and rewarding work available in the government.

If the Budget Resolution is applied over the sixyear period from fiscal years 2010 to 2015. the Resolution assumes a base allocation of $324 billion for highway. highway safety. and transit programs. including $312 billion of contract authority. Importantly. this allocation restores $82 billion over the sixyear period of highway contract authority that had been cut from the Congressional Budget Office baseline. which assumed fiscal year 2009 rescissions would recur in all future years. In addition. the Resolution establishes a Reserve Fund to allow this base allocation of $324 billion to be adjusted upward as necessary to accommodate higher funding levels to the extent they can be supported by the Highway Trust Fund. The Resolution also assumes the Airport Improvement Program is funded at $4.0 billion in FY 2010. $4.1 billion in FY 2011. and $4.2 billion in FY 2012. consistent with H.R. 915. the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2009. as ordered reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on March 5. 2009. This is an increase of $840 million over the baseline funding level for this program over the threeyear period from FY 20102012. The Resolution rejects the Office of Management and Budgets proposal to change how programs funded by contract authority are treated for budget scoring purposes. This proposal. had it been adopted. would have converted the mandatory contract authority that currently funds our highway. highway safety. transit and airport grant programs to a simple authorization of appropriations for budget scoring purposes. I am pleased that the Budget Resolution continues to recognize the unique nature of trustfunded programs by rejecting this illadvised proposal.",

As a Vietnam veteran. I understand the sacrifices our troops are making and they are never far from my mind in the work I do here. I specifically want to highlight the section in the bill under consideration today regarding the Combat Air Force restructure plan and thank the Chairman for his work with me on this provision to delay the early retirement of F15s from Tyndall Air Force Base. I also want to acknowledge and thank the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff for their incredible dedication and willingness to resolve this tough issue with me. This six month delay of the Combat Air Force restructure plan stipulated in H.R. 3326 represents a tremendous legislative victory for Bay County and is the result of a years worth of efforts by our community. Working together. we have put Tyndall in a strategic position to be a key component of the Air Forces next generation fighter infrastructure. It has been made clear from the very highest levels of the Air Force. from the Chief and Secretary. that Tyndall is a national jewel that plays. and will continue to play. a valuable role in our countrys defense. I also want to thank the people of Bay County. particularly the Bay Defense Alliance. who have been partners with me as we worked together to protect the economic interest of our community and security interests of our country. It is no secret from the halls of Congress to the halls of the Pentagon that the community supporting Tyndall Air Force Base is top notch. Additionally. I look forward to the results of the reporting requirements in this bill that will help us all better understand the Air Forces fighter requirements and the impact that the drawdown would have on our nations combat air forces and the communities that support them.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise to oppose yet another increase in war and defense spending. I have never voted for a Defense Appropriations bill. I will not start today. Throwing more money toward a war in Iraq that should never have been started and a war in Afghanistan that should be over diminishes our ability to address the real issues impacting families. War spending already swallows over 50 percent of our discretionary budget. This bill will add $11 billion to an already bloated Defense budget. as President Obama eyes billions more for a troop increase in Afghanistan. There are good things in this bill. I helped write provisions that will extend COBRA subsidies and prevent paycuts to Medicare physicians. The bill also extends unemployment benefits at a time when Americans are struggling to find jobs. While I support these provisions. I cannot support a bill where the good provisions are dwarfed by the $636.3 billion outlay for defense. The right priorities for Congress are addressed in another bill we will consider today. the Jobs for Main Street Act . This legislation would put people to work rebuilding our country. It would invest in building schools. improving our transit systems. and upgrading our water infrastructure. It would prevent the layoffs of teachers. police. and firefighters. The Jobs for Main Street Act also would provide better protections for laidoff workers than the provisions in the Defense bill. It would extend emergency unemployment insurance benefits for an additional six months. and allow millions to maintain health care by expanding the COBRA subsidy to 15 months and extending the eligibility period to June 30th. This is the type of escalation our country needs. Congress should not be giving more money to the Pentagon to wage war. We should be focused on creating jobs. providing health care for all Americans. and improving our education system. That is why I am voting for the Jobs for Main Street Act and against the wasteful Defense Appropriations bill.",

I am pleased that this bill recognizes the incredible sacrifice made by our troops and their families. It provides an increase in military pay. firstclass medical care. and expanded support and counseling for military families enduring the burdens of war. But the sacrifices made for national security should not be for our troops and their families to bear alone. When the country commits to fighting a war. it must also commit to paying for it. All additional funding necessary for stability in Afghanistan and Pakistan must be paid for today. rather than added to Americas mounting debt. That is why I joined my colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 4130. a bill that would establish a temporary surtax to pay for the war in Afghanistan. Madam Speaker. I am also pleased that HR. 3326 increases oversight of the Department of Defense to reign in waste. fraud. and abuse.

Finally. in addition to critical spending for our national defense. this package contains key items to help Americans during our economic downturn.

Madam Speaker. I have been clear in my respectful disagreement with the Presidents decision to escalate the United States military presence in Afghanistan. as well as my belief that the situation in Afghanistan will not be solved with a military solution. This bill does not include additional funding for the proposed troop deployments. and I am hopeful Congress will hold an honest debate and upordown vote on the issue of a military escalation prior to obligating federal resources. The direct costs of two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have reached nearly $1 trillion. and the indirect costs to our national security. our economy. and to our brave men and women in uniform are immeasurable. We further cannot afford to squander our resources on costly coldwar era weapons that in many cases are outdated and truthfully inappropriate for reducing the real threats facing our nation. The fact is. as we work to reform our nations healthcare and education systems. invest in housing and infrastructure. and put Americans back to work. sending more than 50 percent of the federal discretionary budget to the Pentagon represents a clear and unacceptable tradeoff.

Greenways are linear corridors of open space that can be used for conservation or recreation. They may include stream corridors. abandoned railroad rights of way. scenic highways like Route 52 in Wilmington. greenbelts around cities or towns and riverfront walks like we see today along the Christina River. A greenway is capable of providing individuals and families an opportunity to experience the outdoors in a safe and enjoyable fashion while also giving them good exercise and educational opportunities close to home. Programs supported by Delaware Greenways. such as No Child Left Inside. help children at a very early age understand the importance of exercise and provide them with a handson opportunity to learn about nature and our community. Trail Days provide families with experiences they will cherish for generations. Many of the projects Delaware Greenways either initiated or supported have had great success. Examples include: Blue Ball Greenway and Barn restoration. East Coast Greenways. Railtotrail. Northern Delaware Greenway. Junction & Breakwater Trail. and the Hockessin and Mill Creek Greenway. Each of these projects has helped connect communities and provide thousands of families with a remarkable opportunity to experience the outdoors.

The other is a piece called \"The Chrysler Power Grab.\" It was carried in the Arizona Republic on May 6 of this year and was written by the finest columnist in Arizona. His name is Bob Robb. In this column. he notes the irony of the fact that the United States has been bailing out two American companiesChrysler and General Motorsfor the purpose of saving American jobs. when in point of fact it looks as though a lot of the results of this action are going to be to transfer jobs to other countries and ironically to compete with companies that may be owned abroad. such as Toyota. but have a lot of American workers. He talks about the fact that Fiat. an Italian company. is hard to distinguish from Toyota. a Japanese company. but we are apparently saving the jobs for Fiat but not those for Toyota. In any event. I think these are two interesting columns. and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the RECORD.",

When we start looking backward instead of forward. we want to be careful what we ask for because we just might get it. and it might be more than we bargained for. There have been a lot of mistakes the United States has made. a lot we are not very proud of. and my colleague mentioned a couple of those. There were certainly things in the last Democratic administration for which. had some of the officials there had it to do over again. I am sure they would do over. There were things the Republican administration that succeeded the Clinton administration undoubtedly disagreed with. but it seems to me that President Bush has acquitted himself very well as a former President. not criticizing the administration he succeeded. and certainly not suggesting those disagreements should take the form of political trials or even criminal trials. It would be very unseemly for that to occur with respect to the Bush administration now that we have a new Obama administration. But people who served previously in the Clinton administration. obviously those who served in the Congress and knew something about what went on. would certainly have to be prepared to defend themselves under these circumstances as well. It is just an unseemly way. it seems to meand I agree with my colleague from Tennesseefor the U.S. Government to be conducting its business. So I commend my colleague.

We especially honor those peace officers who have been tragically killed in the line of duty while protecting our communities and safeguarding our democracy. Over 25 years ago. I served as a county executive in Jefferson County. KY. which includes my hometown of Louisville. I got to work with the countys police force and witnessed up close their dedication and their professionalism. In Jefferson County. we pioneered new techniques for tracking down abducted children that met with much successenough success that other jurisdictions adopted these techniques. eventually leading to Congressional establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Decades later. peace officers in Louisville are still proud to protect and serve. even with their lives in the balance. And those we have lost are not forgotten. I was moved to read in my hometown paper recently an article about a memorial ceremony in Louisville coinciding with National Police Week. Fellow officers and family members of fallen officers gathered to remember them and thank them for their service. Police forces across Kentucky reverently marked National Police Week as well. At a service in Richmond. Gov. Steve Beshear watched 120 police cadets march at the State Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. while flags were presented to family members of those lost in the performance of their duties. This Friday in Covington. officers will honor their fallen brothers at the northern Kentucky law enforcement memorial. This Senate has the deepest admiration and respect for police officers in every community in the Nation. We recognize their work is both an honorable job and a dangerous one. They bravely risk their lives for ours. and America is grateful. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the full articles about the recent ceremonies in both Louisville and Richmond.",

These are true American heroes. and their actions were in the proudest traditions of our Armed Forces in general. and of our Special Operations forces in particular. On April 6. 2008. this teams mission was to capture or kill several very highranking members of the HezbeIslami Gulbuddin. HIG. militant group. The insurgents were in their stronghold. a village perched in Nuristans Shok Valley that is normally accessible only by pack mule. During a harrowing. nearly 7hour battle on a mountainside. this team and a few dozen Afghan commandos they had trained took fire from all directions. Outnumbered. the Green Berets fought on even after half of them were woundedand managed to kill an estimated 150 to 200 enemy fighters. For their heroism in battle. 10 members of Operational Detachment Alpha 3336 from the 3rd Special Forces Group received the Silver Star. one of the highest awards for valor in the U.S. Military. This was the highest number of such awards for a single engagement since the Vietnam war. The men who earned these Silver Stars were CPT Kyle Walton. SFC Scott Ford. SSG Luis Morales. SSG Seth Howard. SSG Ronald Shurer. SSG John Walding. SSG Dillon Behr. SGT David Sanders. SGT Matthew Williams. and SPC Michael Carter. I will ask to have printed in the RECORD a copy of their Silver Star citations. I will also ask to have printed in the RECORD a copy of a Washington Post report describing the battle on that Afghan mountainside. Mr. President. as I mentioned earlier. it was our privilege to honor these heroic Green Berets. who were joined at the lunch by SSG Robert Gutierrez. Jr.. an Air Force special tactics combat controller who targeted airstrikes during the mission. For his actions. he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with \"V\" device for valor.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am pleased to cosponsor H. Res. 607. which commemorates the fortieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Apollo 11s successful mission was. certainly a \"giant leap for mankind.\" that should be a source of pride for all Americans. One of my favorite quotes regarding the moon landing was penned by philosopher Ayn Rand in 1969: \"Think of what was required to achieve that mission: think of the unpitying effort. the merciless discipline. the courage. the responsibility of relying on ones judgment. the days. nights and years of unswerving dedication to a goal. the tension of the unbroken maintenance of a full. clear mental focus. and the honesty. It took the highest. sustained acts of virtue to create in reality what had only been dreamt of for millennia.\" Rands words not only apply to the Apollo 11 mission but to all of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). As a representative of the Gulf Coast of Texas. which is home to many of NASAs most significant triumphs. I have had the opportunity to meet many NASA employees. I have always been impressed by their professionalism and dedication to their mission. In conclusion. I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon by supporting H. Res. 607.",

Next week. we have other things we need to do. including the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I spoke with the Republican leader on a number of occasions on that issue. To get to it next week. we need a consent agreement because the House will not act on it until probably Wednesday of next week or something like that. It does not give us enough time. and we need to start earlier. We will work on that and see what we can come up with. We have announced before that the 5 weeks after we get back from the Fourth of July recess will be very busy with a lot of work.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it was less than 3 weeks ago that the President announced his intentions to nominate Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. In announcing her nomination. the White House made much of the fact that the judge had the lengthiest judicial record in recent memory. Last week. in a departure from past practice. the Democratic leadership of the Judiciary Committee unilaterally scheduled her hearing without even notifying the ranking member. Because of this unwise and unfair approach. Judge Sotomayors hearing will begin just 3 weeks from today. As I understand it. her questionnaire is still incomplete. Among other deficiencies. she has not provided materials from 17 cases she handled as a prosecutor. nor has she provided materials from any appellate cases she handled. and she has not provided materials from over 100 speeches she has given. During the Roberts and Alito hearings. our Democratic friends repeatedly told us it was more important to do it right than to do it quick. Now that there is a Democratic President. it appears the attitude is to just do it. They want the shortest confirmation process in recent memory for a nominee with the longest judicial record in recent memory. There is clearly a double standard at play hereone that undermines our ability to fulfill one of the Senates most important and solemn responsibilities.",

Today is the last day serving on that committee staff of Dr. Robert Keleher. I rise to recognize him briefly. He is retiring after many years of valuable service in the Congress. Congressman Jim Saxton. when he was chairman. persuaded Bob to join the committee staff back In 1996. as chief macroeconomist after an already distinguished career. Bobs insightful mind. high standard. and extensive knowledge of economics made him a critical component of the staff for many years. Before joining the committee staff. Bobs career. including serving as the senior macroeconomist of President Reagans Council of Economic Advisers in 1985 and 1986. The head of Macro and International Economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. and as a special monetary and economic adviser to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson. I think under anybodys standard. that is a very successful career as an economist. 55. Pt. 15 July 31. 2009 Bobs contribution to the committee was broad based and valuable. In particular. his early and prolific work on the issue of Inflation targeting represents almost the entire body of congressional analysis in this area from 1997 to 2006. During his career. Bob also conducted research applying the classical principles of economics to tax policy. His research emphasized the important effects that marginal tax rates have on economic behavior. in particular the positive effects that reducing personal marginal rates have on creating incentives for healthy economic growth. We would be wise to take Bobs research findings to heart. Yet a persons work career is not the only thing that defines him. Bobs work was first rate. relevant. and valuable to members of the committee. But Bobs character as a man. his judgement. and integrity only add to the reasons he will be missed. Mr. President. I know my colleagues on the committee. from both the Senate and the House. join me in extending a heartfelt thanks to Bob for his years of service and in congratulating him upon his retirement. Thank you. Bob. We wish you and your family the best. You have earned it. Godspeed. Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

Praxis Strategy Group of Grand Forks has received SBIR awards nine times. including grants from the USDA to develop strategic processes like the High Performance Community Initiative and the Enterprise Homesteading Program that help communities. especially small communities. attract entrepreneurs. develop dynamic economies. and market themselves. While I am happy with the Senate reauthorization. I am concerned about some of the provisions in the House version we are trying to reconcile it with. First. the House bill opens participation in SBIR to companies that are majorityowned by venture capital firms. I have nothing against venture capital companies. but the small businesses that they own have already shown they can successfully attract capital in the private market. SBIR was intended to help small businesses without the connections available to do that. I think the House bill is trying to fix something that isnt broken. Second. given the longterm success of SBIR and STTR. I think it only makes sense to increase the share of agency funds set aside for small business as the Senates bill gradually does. American business has changed dramatically since SBIR was created. Since 1978. the share of scientists and engineers working for small businesses has. as I said. increased from 6 to 38 percent. Funding for SBIR and STTR needs to increase to reflect that reality. I am concerned that the House bill keeps their allocations where they have been for 27 years. despite the successful track record of the programs. Given the figures I have quoted previously. increasing the setaside from 2.5 to 3.5 percent Is the very least we should do. Small business is the core of our countrys economy. and we have here a program that has a strong track record of encouraging growth and innovation in that area.

    "speech": "The problems that one terrorist caused for Alexandria could be duplicated in any city or town to which detainees from Guantanamo are sent. Although the administration hasnt given us any details on which cities or towns they might choose. we can imagine what they could look forward to. based on Alexandrias experience with Moussaoui. So here is what a community would have to experience: heavily armed agents patrolling local neighborhoods. rooftop snipers. streets locked down and access to local businesses cut off. identification checks and bombsmelling dogs checking cars. millions of dollars in cost and strained local resources. That is what you get when you have a terrorist in your hometown. Kentuckians dont want to live under these conditions. I doubt any other American would either. especially if we consider that any community that becomes a home to these detainees could have to endure these conditions for literally years. given the possible length of terror trials. Some of the other locations that have been mentioned as possible destinations for the terrorists at Guantanamo include facilities in South Carolina and Kansas. One local official in South Carolina responded to the possibility by saying he didnt have the police resources to deal with an influx of terrorists from Guantanamo. An official in Kansas said Guantanamo detainees would significantly tax his police resources. The administration claims that closing Guantanamo and transferring some detainees to U.S soil would make the American people safer. It is hard to understand that statement. But based on the experience of Alexandria. it is easy to see why many Americans are skeptical. The administration has said that when it comes to Guantanamo. its highest priority Is the safety of the American people. But safety is our top concern. The administration should rethink its plan to transfer terrorists to American communities. I yield the floor.",

Too many in our country are burdened by significant credit card debt. Not enough has been done to protect consumers and ensure they are able to properly manage their credit burden.

    "speech": "Madam President. with respect to the last debate. lets be clear that the underlying bill keeps the threedecadesold agreement that. has implemented the Hyde amendment to separate Federal funds from private funds when it comes to reproductive health care. The NelsonHatch amendment is unnecessary. It is discriminatory against women. Women are the only group of people who are told how to use their own private motey. That is unfair. On another matter. with respect to the McCain motion. let me explain a little bit about Medicare Advantage and how it works. Essentially. the Medicare Advantage Programs are insurance companies. They are insurance companies that have their own officers. directors. their own marketing plans and their own administrative costs and they are concerned about the rate of return on investment. for their stockholders. These are simple. garden variety. ordinary insurance companies. In this case. they are insurance companies that get general revenue from payroll taxes and premiums. They are basically insurance companies that give benefits to senior citizens. These insurance companies are overpaid. There is not much disagreement that they are overpaid. How are they paid? Well. believe it or not. these insurance companiesMedicare Advantage plansare paid according to the amount Congress sets in statute. That is their payment rate. what Congress sets in statute. The problem is. by doing so. these preset rates overstate the actual cost of providing care by 30 percent. We pay more than it costs to provide care by about 30 percent. in many cases. These overpayments also clearly promote inefficiencies in Medicare. Also. these payments have not been proven to increase the quality of care seniors receive. In the estimate I saw. about half the Medicare Advantage plans have care coordination and half dont. Half are no better than ordinary feeforservice plans. Because of this broken. irrational payment system. some plans receive more than $200 per enrollee per month and others receive about $36 per enrollee per month. Again. the payment rates are set by statute. relating to fee for service in the area. It is broken. It doesnt make sense. It causes great dislocations and differences in the payment rates. Frankly. under this broken system. all beneficiaries are not receiving the same care. I believe all beneficiaries should be able to have access to the best care. not just those who happen to live in States with high payment rates.",

It. should always be the centerpiece of our work here. We should never single out one group of people as targets. We should treat people the same. ft has been very clearly stated that the NelsonHatch amendment. like the Stupak amendment in the House. singles out an area of reproductive health care that only impacts one group. and that is women. It says to women that they cant use their own private funds to buy coverage for the full range of reproductive health procedures. It doesnt say that to a man. It doesnt say to men: You cant use your own funds to cover the cost of a pharmaceutical product that you may want for your reproductive health. It doesnt say that they cant use their own private funds for a surgical procedure they may choose that is in the arsenal that they may choose for their own reproductive rights. So we say to the men of this country: Look. we are not going to single out any procedure or any pharmaceutical product you may want to use for your reproductive health care. We are saying. if a private insurer offers it. you have the right to buy it. We are singling out women. Again. let me say this as clearly as I can.

Currently. there are nearly 11 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage. which is about one out of every four seniors in the United States. In my home State of Idaho. that is about 60.000 people or 27 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries in the State. Medicare Advantage is an extremely popular program. In fact. it is probably the most popular and fastest growing part of Medicare. A 2007 study reported high overall satisfaction with the Medicare Advantage Program. Eightyfour percent of the respondents said they were happy with their coverage. and 75 percent would recommend Medicare Advantage to their friends or family members. But despite the popularity of the program. the massive cuts in the Reid bill will result in most seniors losing benefits or coverage or both under Medicare Advantage.

We must not let the issue of reproductive choice overshadow all of the things this bill gets right. For over three decades. the Hyde amendment. which prohibits the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape. incest. or if the life of the mother is at risk. has been the law of this land. Abortion should play no role in this health care debate.

I wish to make sure we ensure. through this health care legislation. the consensus we have had as part of our public policy for many years nowthat taxpayer dollars dont pay for abortions. I believe we can and should and will get this right by the end of this debate. The second reason I support this is. I believe it is important to respect the conscience of taxpayers. both women and men across the country. who dont want taxpayer dollars going to support abortions. If there is one or maybe two areas where both sides can agreepeople who are prolife and prochoiceit is on these basic principles: No. 1. we dont want to take actions to increase the number of abortions in America. I think that is the prevailing view across the divide of this issue. No. 2. we also have to do more to help those women who are pregnant. and I dont believe we are doing enough.

The average couple pays $90 per year just so insurers can reap greater profits under Medicare. The McCain amendment is a raid on the Medicare trust fund. MA overpayments take 18 months off the life of the Part A trust fund. And according to MedPAC. there is no evidence of greater quality of care. In fact. MedPAC told Congress this year that \"only some\" MA plans are of high quality.

    "speech": "The other thing that I really want to stress. and I havent tonight. and you did touch upon it also. is new ways of doing things. I mean one of the things that President Obama did in this economic recovery package is that he actually put in pots of money that would be used to try to change the way we do things with health care. So theres a pot of money for prevention programs. theres a pot of money for wellness programs. There are going to be pilot programs through grants for what we call comparative effectiveness. where you would actually look at certain operations or certain procedures or the use of certain drugs to determine whether they are even effective from an economic point of view. It may cost you more. but are you really getting anything for your money. In addition to that. theres a major initiativeI think its $20 billionfor health information technology to upgrade doctors and hospital offices so that records and other things are done electronically. Its not just a question of covering everyone or reducing costs. but its a question of doing things differently. because if a person can go to a general practitioner on a regular basis and get a checkup. then its a preventive measure that prevents them being hospitalized and costing more money to the government or to the system later. I mean these really havent been played out much in this economic recovery package. Most of the talk has been about infrastructure and transportation and all that. There are major changes envisioned in the way we look at health care that the President has taken the leadership on. and the Congress. too. since we passed this bill.",

    "speech": "I appreciate what youre saying. I think that in fact when we had the health care summit. in maybe a little different context President Obama actually said. Look. we do need additional money if were going to have health care reform and provide people quality health care and cover everyone. because a lot of that is going to have to be upfront. In other words. if you talk about new ways of doing things. whether its health information technology or preventive care. whatever. a lot of times you do need money upfront to pay for some of it. But then in the long run you do actually save money. So I agree with you that the better quality care is ultimately more important. But It can over the longterm save money. I use the example with one of my community health centers where I went. An incredible part of the building was devoted to keeping the medical records. I cant say exactly whether it was a third of the building or 25 percent of the building. But I looked at where they stored all these handwritten or typed records because they didnt have them on a computer. and I said. Gee. if we could just getI dont know how much it will cost so Ill pick a number100.000 dollars to put all these records into the computer. youd now have all this space available that youre not really utilizing right now. So maybe upfront its going to cost you $100.000. but in the long run youre saving money. I think you can use the primary care doctors. I use the example of my staff person who goes to the emergency room because he cant get a primary care physician. Primary care physicians say we dont have enough of a reimbursement rate. If you gave us a higher reimbursement rate under Medicare. there would be more primary care physicians. I dont know if that is necessarily true. but assuming its true. it is going to cost you more money upfront. But. in the long run. if the person goes to the doctor when they have strep throat rather than going to the emergency room. do you save money. But its oftentimes hard to actually put a dollar figure on how prevention saves you money.",

I think he was about 7 or 8. kind of a quiet boy. brought in by his grandmother. And he was there for a cold or something. I dealt with his cold or ear infection. Then his grandmother started talking about some behavioral stuff he was having. We talked about it for a few minutes. and I didnt have much to offer. It was like about 2 months later I was reading an article about Tourettes syndrome. And I thought. Thats what that little boy had. Well. the clinic I worked at had a wall about as big as the wall behind the Speaker here tonight that was all handwritten medical records. One of my nurses aids and Iwe did it on Saturday because we were slow enough when we worked on Saturday. we could do thiswe began systematically going through every one of those handwritten charts to see if we could find that little boy because I was going to call his family and say. Hey. I think I figured what you were talking about with this little boy. The reality is in Tourettes syndrome a lot of time they are underdiagnosed and. unfortunately for the family. it takes a while to sort it out sometimes. We never did find that chart even though we systematically went through every handwritten chart. Well. if we had had a computer system we would have been able to pull up the names of appointments seen in the last period of time or probably could have pulled it up by approximate birth date. Theres so many tools that a good health information technology system gives you for the benefit of patients. E 2145 Efficiency of doctors. more prompt payment of doctors. less mistakes. but ultimately it is for the benefit of patients. and I think that is what you were talking about. looking ahead to doing things differently. doing things better.

And I thought about that and felt badly about that. and then I thought later. well. of course I assumed she is going to bounce back from that. get healed up. and I am going to see her again. On her birthday she always does something special like cross the Arkansas River on a bridge. She always does a very special thing. And when you talk to her. she talks about how she loves growing old. She has loved growing old at age 111. And I think in a way that is what we aspire to through this health care reform. We want everyone to say. whether they are young with young children who benefit from our health care system. or people who go through the very frail years. that throughout they can say that I have loved growing old. Now. maybe we wont live to be 111. but if we all do this right. we will increase the chances of more people being able to have those kinds of long. long years.

It is the Congresss budget when we get through with it. So the 2008 budget that shows the increase over 2007 fairly substantially is the Congresss budget. You are not seeing George Bushs budget. you are seeing the Democratcontrolled Congresss budget in 2008. Now their President has proposed. the Democratic Partys President has proposed a 2009 budget that goes off the charts. It is kind of interesting because we hear. \"I will reduce the budget by 50 percent.\" So lets see. if you raise the budget 300 percent and you reduce it 150 percent. you have reduced it 50 percent.

But what we have before us today is not just about Haiti. its about jobs in the United States. And. unfortunately. theres a provision here within the bill that will hurt jobs here in the United States. This legislation will allow for dutyfree access to yarns and fabrics produced in other Third World countries. and Haiti will simply be more of a location for transshipment than other nations. Bad trade deals like this one have devastated my district in western North Carolina and devastated manufacturing in the United States. Counties in my district have unemployment rates of up to 16 percent. some that my colleagues here can relate to in their regions of the country. but certainly devastating in western North Carolina. And its a time when our people need jobs. Our families are hurting. And this bill is simply giving away some of those jobs. In a time when we should help small businesses. this is hurting them. specifically in my district. In the past. Haiti has had tremendous success producing apparel using U.S. yarns and fabrics. We should be strengthening that partnership. not turning Haiti into a stoppingoff point for more transshipment of goods from Asia and around the globe. Our government should represent its people and the best interests of its people. Unfortunately. this Congress is not. this leadership is not. and unfortunately. this bill with this provision is not. Charity is one thing. but giving away our jobs is a completely different matter. With that. I would oppose this bill.",

I believe that our trade policy can play a key role in rehabilitating the Haitian economy. As such. I rise in support of my friend Congressman CHARLES RANGELS timely legislation. The Haiti Economic Lift Program. HELP. Act of 2010. which will extend trade preference programs. expand market access for Haitian goods. and ensure fundamental worker labor rights for Haitian workers. Expanding trade with Haiti is an important step in creating economic stability and sustainability. The HELP Act will enhance and strengthen our trading relationship. where 78.2 percent of Haitian exports are directed to the United States. by extending trade preference programs such as the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act and the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act through September 30. 2020. Both laws are credited with increasing Haitian apparel exports to the United States from $420 million to over $512 million and creating impressive economic growth from 2007 to 2009. It is imperative we help foster burgeoning industries within Haiti that will ultimately attract investment and provide jobs during and after their reconstruction efforts. The HELP Act expands the list of products that can be shipped dutyfree. It has been noted that new jobs in Haiti creates multiplier effects which supports families and others who are in need. Mr. Speaker. as a long supporter of worker rights. I am pleased that todays legislation will continue the International Labor Organizations labor monitoring program to ensure that fundamental core labor rights of their workers are followed by factories benefiting from the HELP Act. The United States and its citizens. which have had a long tradition of helping allies in their time of need. have given unprecedented amounts of foreign aid and donations to the people of Haiti in the weeks after the earthquake. Todays legislation extends the reach of this aid by increasing trade between the countries. which will ultimately provide jobs and a better future for Haitians.

Flood insurance in a hurricaneprone State is not merely a necessity. it is a requirement for those homeowners with mortgages. For nearly 1 month. prospective homeowners in my congressional district of south Florida have been in limbo. Unable to secure the required flood insurance. these individuals and families have been unable to close on their homes. Their frustration is palpable. New buyers in the housing market are needed to help my congressional district recover from this economic downturn. At a time when the Federal Government is increasing incentives for homeownership. it is utterly bizarre that Congress would fail to extend a program that is required for many mortgages to be finalized. The National Flood Insurance Program is a necessity. and its extension should not be subject to partisan politics. This bill extends the program until the end of September. but it must be extended for several years so that homeowners can buy and sell their properties without worries.

Today we acknowledge the continued success of the Congressional Award Program and seek its reauthorization contingent with a few amendments. This program enriches Americas youth by instilling four principle areas in the contestants life. The four program areas include voluntary community service. personal development. physical fitness. and expedition and exploration. Performance of these activities strengthens the mind. body. and soul of the youth. By providing service to others and the greater community at large. developing personal interests. social or employment skills. improving quality of life through physical fitness activities. and by undertaking an outdoor. wilderness or venture experience (historical. cultural or environmental). the participating youth are well rounded. I have relentlessly sought better education and jobs for our youth in this great nation. because they fuel the future of the country. As a member of the board of the Congressional Award Program I also believe that in order to truly produce a well rounded society. we should be supporting all aspects of life. Education is a very important factor in a youths life. and the four program areas of the Congressional Award Program also work to shape the knowledge acquired through that education to mold successful youths. This reauthorization act will strengthen the programs leadership amending the appointments provisions such as to revise requirements for appointment and reappointment of members of the Congressional Award Board. especially the limitation of service on the Board to two consecutive terms. This act exempts a member from the twoterm limit during a period of service as Board Chairman. permits reappointment of such individual to an additional full term after termination of such Chairmanship. requires a Board members term to begin on October 1 of the even numbered year. with onehalf of the Board positions having terms which begin in each even numbered year. and changes from calendar to fiscal year the annual period for which the Director is required to ensure that the Boards liabilities do not exceed its assets.

Fathers Day has an especially significant meaning to the people of Spokane. Washington. This past Sunday. the city of Spokane celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of Fathers Day. a national tradition that began in 1909 by a local Spokane woman. Sonora Smart Dodd. Looking for a way to recognize her father and those like him. Sonora Dodd publicly recognized her father in 1909. a Civil War veteran who raised six children on his own after the death of his wife. From there. the city of Spokane established the first celebration of Fathers Day at the local YMCA in 1910. and in the years following the celebration spread around the Nation. The resolution that we are considering today is a way to demonstrate our appreciation to fathers everywhere and to recognize the critical role they play in our lives. Research in the field confirms that children whose fathers play a significant role in their lives are much more likely to lead productive and healthy lives. Moreover. children with involved fathers are much more likely to have close. enduring relationships.

Last month CBO issued its report on the effects of the Recovery Act in the fourth quarter. In that report.

It is in the right place here. but I oppose this amendment. First. the amendment seeks to extend a stopgap measure for the payments of doctors under Medicare. but we should not prolong stopgap measures. We should pass a shortterm stopgap. and then we should make meaningful payment reform for the payment of doctors under Medicare. That is what doctors want. That is what would be very much in the best interests of seniors. and that is the responsible way to govern. Second. the Grassley amendment takes its offsets away from the underlying health care bill. that is. the bill we are trying to pass in this next several weeks. Thus. it would undercut health care reform. We need the savings we included in the health care bill. especially the health reform bill. We should not be robbing the health care bill of its offsets. For those reasons. I oppose the Grassley amendment.",

It replaces the provisions that are not fully offset with fully offset provisions. and it adds an additional 3 months for the physician update through the end of 2010. This amendment draws additional funds from the Medicare improvement fund to ensure these provisions are fully offset. My friend from Montana said that is not the place to take the money from. but his substitute amendment takes money from the very same fund. I take a little bit more. yes. but I dont think a few billion in funding needed here will make much of a difference when it comes to the $2.5 trillion cost of health care reform. as was suggested earlier. So I dont see that as a valid argument for not paying for these Medicare provisions. Going back to the situation at hand. the 30day extension that passed last night only prevents payment cuts until the end of March. Physicians and Medicare beneficiaries need to have certainty and be ensured access to care. This is the fiscally responsible way to pay for these important Medicare provisions.

It contains all of the extensions in the Baucus substitute. but rather than adding over $100 billion in cost to the deficit and debt. which the Baucus substitute does. my amendment pays for the spending in this bill by rescinding unspent stimulus funding. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have stated repeatedly that CBO considers money spent on extending unemployment benefits to be one of the best kinds of stimulus because the people who receive it are likely to immediately spend it. So lets redirect money from an ineffective stimulus bill in which some of the funding wont be spent until fiscal year 2013 or beyond. Lets stimulate the economy now and prevent a massive increase in the debt at the same time. I am having a hard time understanding why some Senators believe stimulus funding is so sacred. Was the stimulus brought down from the mountaintop. by Moses? If that is the case. why did the majority raid stimulus money to pay for an extension of cash for clunkers? I will be the first to admit that neither side of the aisle has clean hands when it comes to outofcontrol spending. We cant control what was done in the past. but we can control what happens today. It is time to take a standa stand for our children and grandchildren so they wont have to pay back trillions more in debt. I am tired of China holding the mortgage on our country.

I appreciate their attitude very much and their openness to this suggestion. This is a fairly straightforward amendment. What it is trying to do is to mirror the resources of the Federal Government and to make sure that theyre in sync with the needs of local transit systems. This actually developed out of a homeland security working group dialogue that I had In my congressional district. I represent the west and northwest suburbs of Chicago and a wide range of commuters. Weve got bus lines and rail lines in the Chicago area. and there is a certain level of vulnerability. So last March I invited some of the leadership of the public transit systems and some of the security agencies to really offer ideas. and this is one of the Ideas that they had. They said. Look. we have needs at the local level. and there are resources at the Federal Government. but sometimes those two things arent really in sync. So what this is. it says simply that the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security will hold hearings. if this amendment is passed. and those hearings are really about the subject of whether current allowable uses of grant funds are sufficient to meet the daily security needs and the transit security needs of these local agencies. Then after that happens. after this conversation happens and these hearings. to come back to Congress and to report. I think that this is one of these areas where theres a great deal of common ground. There is uncertainty sometimes at the State and local level about how Federal funds fit into their agenda. We all know that we. in the Congress. are trying to help. And this is a structured way to have that conversation. because when it comes down to it. theres nearly 12 million Americans that are riding on passenger trains each day. and thats six times as many that fly in our skies.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. I rise to oppose the rule on the legislation in consideration of H.R. 626. Having run a business. I understand how important it is to look out for workers and to be supportive. especially in these difficult economic times. when families are making tough choices with regard to how they spend their money and their time. I believe this debate should be focused on whether Washington should be granting additional fringe benefits to public sector employees in a period when private sector workers in hardhit areas. like western New York where I come from. are struggling to hang on to their jobs. This is why I offered a simple amendment that said that legislation would not take effect until the national unemployment rate is down to 4 percent and no State has an unemployment rate greater than 7 percent. I regret that the House will not have the opportunity to consider this amendment. because I think it provides a commonsense way to address the timing of this measure. Take an area of. my district like Niagara County where tens of thousands of jobs are tied to the auto industry. The unemployment rate there is nearly 11 percent. a figure that was reported before General Motors and Chrysler began their restructuring. which we already know will lead to more job losses. We also know that these workers who are able to hang on will have to accept significantly reduced compensation packages in order to stay employed. These are tough times. regardless of what industry youre in. But think about these auto workers. the farmers. the retail workers who are being forced to do more with less just to keep their jobs and to keep their heads above water. Think about them when Washington turns around and proposes more generous fringe benefits for public sector employees. It sends the wrong message at the wrong time. and its just another example of how Washington continues to find ways to spend money it doesnt have. Again. Im disappointed that the House will not have the opportunity to consider my amendment.",

And the first person killed in Afghanistan was from my district. a civilian along side of the military. and so for the FBI. the CIA. the DIA. the DEA. the ATF they deserve basically the same thing. Secondly. I was the ranking member on Children. Youth and Family years ago. And Dr. Brazelton. the leading child pediatrician. came in and pointed at the initial moment of birthand I have five children and 13 grandchildren and soon to have two moreat the initial moment of birth. when the mother breathes on the baby. the bonding process begins. It begins. Those early days. weeks are absolutely positively critical. And so. for me. on a family issue. and a family value issue. I think thats really important. The last thing is I just want to remind my colleagues that one of the leading people in this Congress. one of my heroes. two of the people that I looked up to more than anybody. one. Congressman Henry Hyde and former Congressman Dan Coats. who later went on to be a Senator. both supported parental leave. Let me read to you what Henry Hyde said. The words of Henry Hyde. during the debate on family leave. and it was not paid family leave. so there was a difference just as important. He reminded us that \"the family supplies the moral glue that holds society together. and It is a central institution that stands between us and social disintegration.\" And so. one. the military gets 6 weeks. Two. that bonding process is when the baby comes out. you want the mother to be there. It is critically important. And. thirdly. one of the giants from the beginning of this Hall that ever served. Congressman Henry Hyde. led the effort and made the most passionate case on why family leave should have been passed years ago.

    "speech": "626. once enacted. will. in fact. change that. While the 12 weeks of unpaid leave. as authorized by the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993. has helped millions of families during some of the most precious moments or. in some cases. the most challenging times of their lives. most Federal employees cannot afford to take unpaid leave. This often forces these employees to choose between spending more time with their newborn child or maintaining an income to support their families. which is a difficult decision that Federal workers will hopefully not have to make after the passage of this Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act. The United States of America. and in particular. the Federal Government. is supposed to be a world leader in this area. Yet. for years. we have been followers. Im sure you will agree with me when I say that it is high time for us to catch up with the rest of world and provide our dedicated employees with paid parental leave of this limited time. Providing Federal employees with paid parental leave will increase worker morale and improve productivity by creating a more family friendly environment for Federal employees. Further. providing 20 days. or 4 work weeks. of paid leave to our dedicated Federal employees should not be described as an overgenerous or excessive fringe benefit. but rather. as a necessary benefit to help strengthen American families and promote the healthy development of our children. We also need to recognize that the Federal Government is the largest employer in the United States. and its policies in this area do set a tone for the country. No employee should have to choose between caring for a newborn child or their paycheck. This is especially true during an economic downturn. Therefore. Madam Chairman. Id like to once again reiterate my support for H.R. 626. the Federal Employee Paid Parental Leave Act of 2009. and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this measure.

The fear of being sued by opportunistic trial lawyers is pervasive In the practice of medicine. Our system wastes billions on defensive medicine that should be going to patient care. Thats why real medical liability reform is needed. In fact. CBO estimates that as much as $54 billion can be saved by the Federal Government alone. It is totally unacceptable that this money is being spent in the courtroom instead of the operating room. At the same time. the majority has promised the American people that their health care bill will lower costs. yet the bill before us today. Mr. Speaker. contains no medical liability reforms. And why not? The truth comes from one of the Democrats own. no less than former DNC Chair and physician Howard Dean. who said last August. The reason that tort reform is not in the bill is because the people that wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. and that is the plain and simple truth. Mr. Speaker. the Republican motion to recommit adds real meaningful medical liability and reform and uses its $54 billion in savings to create a fund that will protect seniors. especially those in rural areas. from the steep cuts to Medicare in the Democrats reform package.

Democratic leaders in the House passed by the narrowest of margins a massive bill with a simple goal: to vastly expand the Federal Governments role in the health care decisions of every American. This bill is strongly opposed by most Americans. which is why one out of seven Democrats voted against it. These Democrats have gotten the message that Americans are fed up with all the spending and all the debt and that they do not support a socalled health care reform that raises premiums. raises taxes. and slashes Medicare. Americans dont want a 2.000page. trilliondollar government experiment in health care. They want commonsense reforms that increase access and lower costs. Soon. Senate Democrats will propose their version of a health care bill. We dont yet know all the details. but we do know that at its core. this bill would also lead to higher premiums. higher taxes. and massive cuts to Medicare to fund new government programs. This is not the reform the American people were looking for. This is not the reform they were told they could expect. Americans feel as though they have been taken for a ride in this debate. I dont blame them. It is time we listen to the American people. At a time of doubledigit unemployment and record deficits and debt. the views of ordinary Americans should not be cast aside.",

During this trip. the Secretary outlined for me his ambitious plan to end homelessness among veterans and impressed upon me how this is one of his top priorities for the VA. The fiscal year 2010 MILCONVA bill before us provides a significant amount of resources to help him accomplish that goal. including over $500 million for direct homeless programs. However. after returning from the August recess. I began to look into other efforts the VA could undertake to further address this issue. As many of you know. the VA has 153 hospitals. many on expansive campuses which include numerous buildings. some used and others sitting empty. The amendment I have just offered would add $50 million to the VAs minor construction account specifically for the VA to renovate unused. empty buildings sitting on VA campuses for the purpose of providing housing with supportive services for homeless veterans. In todays economic climate. many of the community organizations and nonprofits that run homeless shelters for vets cannot come up with the capital needed to renovate unused VA buildings. This amendment would allow the VA to make those renovations and then pursue publicprivate ventures that address the problem of homelessness among vets. The amendment Is fully offset and does not exceed the subcommittees allocation for budget authority or outlays. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. President.

We are falling behind. We dont graduate enough nurses now to take care of the anticipated needs. and we have to change that. Sadly. in many instances we have been poaching nursing talent from other poor nations around the world. Filipino nurses in Chicago play a major role at many hospitals. particularly innercity hospitals. and nurses from other parts of the world. Many times. the Philippines. for example. generates more medical professionals and expects they will serve overseas. but some places in Africa lose their best medical professionals to higher and more predictable pay in places such as the United States. England. France. and Germany. So we have to reach a point where we are graduating more nursing students each year. Last year in Illinois. 2.000 qualified nursing applicants were turned down because we didnt have the capacity in our nursing schools. We dont have enough nursing faculty. enough clinical opportunities. We need to really focus on that. So in addition to lauding the nursing professionI certainly echo my colleague in that regardwe also need to think ahead to make sure we have more nurses when we need them. and that day is going to be fast upon us.

I appreciate the Senator raising the issue because it is an important question. I have raised with my colleague and the former chairman. Senator SHELBY. a package of amendments. technical or others. where we think there is agreement. although he will have to take a look at them to make that determination. not as a final managers amendment but to try and clear out those amendments we think can be adopted without taking up time for votes on individual amendments. I invite any Member who has amendments. including my colleague from Tennessee. to give us the amendments he or she has or to show them to Senator SHELBY. and we will try to accept them where we can. If there is some problem we cant resolve. then we need to provide the time between now and the conclusion of the bill to consider them. I will do my best to see that happens. Let me take advantage of the question to make a plea to my colleagues. Obviously. there is not an unlimited amount of time to debate this bill. We have other matters we are all painfully aware of that have to come up before we adjourn for the year. My hope is Members will provide the time and come forward and we will get short time agreements for some amendments. maybe a bit longer for others that are a bit more substantive and require more debate. But we need to move on this. We have submitted. several days ago. a package of what I thought would qualify as a managers amendment. We need to get some answers on that so we can try to accommodate provisions to this bill that are good contributions offered by Republicans and Democratsin some cases bothso we can actually add to the product of this legislation. I appreciate my colleagues suggestion. If we can see them. we will try to agree to all of them. If there is any problem. we will let him know and then thin out that list so we can get to them.",

Chairman Bernanke came before that committee. I asked him: Will you tell the committee. me. and the American people which large financial institutions received trillions of dollars of zero or near zero interest loans? I thought that was a reasonable question. Mr. Bernanke said: No. I will not do that. I will not release that information. On that day. I introduced legislation to compel him to release the information. This amendment. if passed. on December 1. 2010. would. in fact. contain that information. It is a major step forward. Secondly. many Americans are beginning to catch onand some Senators have referred to that todayto the immense power of the Fed. People are demanding transparency at the Fed. People want to know what happens behind closed doors when some of the leaders of the largest financial institutions sit down with the Fed and. lo and behold. programs are developed which benefit those very same large financial institutions. Wouldnt it be nice. wouldnt it be great if small businesses in Vermont could end up with zero interest loans? They cant. But somehow or another. some of the largest financial institutions in this country manage to do that. and we dont know how this process goes on. Passage of the Sanders amendment is a step forward. I congratulate all those people from both political parties. with very different political ideologies. for coming forward. for pushing this issue forward. This is not the end. This is a beginning. As Senator DODD said a moment ago. this is historic. We are beginning to lift the veil of secrecy on what is perhaps the most important agency in the government.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am pleased to introduce the Liberty Amendment. which repeals the 16th Amendment. thus paving the way for real change in the way government collects and spends the peoples hardearned money. The Liberty Amendment also explicitly forbids the Federal government from performing any action not explicitly authorized by the United States Constitution. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 155. Pt. 9 The 16th Amendment gives the Federal government a direct claim on the lives of American citizens by enabling Congress to levy a direct income tax on individuals. Until the passage of the 16th amendment. the Supreme Court had consistently held that Congress had no power to impose an income tax. Income taxes are responsible for the transformation of the Federal government from one of limited powers into a vast leviathan whose tentacles reach into almost every aspect of American life. Thanks to the income tax. today the Federal government routinely invades our privacy. and penalizes our every endeavor. The Founding Fathers realized that \"the power to tax is the power to destroy.\" which is why they did not give the Federal government the power to impose an income tax. Needless to say. the Founders would be horrified to know that Americans today give more than a third of their income to the Federal government. Income taxes not only diminish liberty. they retard economic growth by discouraging work and production. Our current tax system also forces Americans to waste valuable time and money on compliance with an evermore complex tax code. The increased interest in flattax and national sales tax proposals. as well as the increasing number of small businesses that question the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) \"withholding\" system provides further proof that America is tired of the labyrinthine tax code. Americans are also increasingly fed up with an IRS that continues to ride roughshod over their civil liberties. despite recent \"protaxpayer\" reforms. Madam Speaker. America survived and prospered for 140 years without an income tax. and with a Federal government that generally adhered to strictly constitutional functions. operating with modest excise revenues. The income tax opened the door to the era (and errors) of Big Government. I hope my colleagues will help close that door by cosponsoring the Liberty Amendment.",

We are suffering in the wake of eight years of historic fiscal irresponsibility. But difficult times call for difficult decisions. We cannot climb out of the current economic crisis without returning to fiscal sanity to restore consumer and investor confidence.

The funding would be directed toward important needs including medical care. education. vocational training. legal assistance. protection against trafficking. and civil participation. Senator BOXER has introduced similar legislation. S. 229. in the Senate. Although women are guaranteed equal rights in the Afghan constitution. they continue to face challenges including intimidation. discrimination. targeted violence. and efforts to restrict their legal rights. In March the parliament of Afghanistan approved the Shiite Personal Status Law which was signed by President Karzai. According to the -United Nations. one provision of the law would have the effect of legalizing marital rape by mandating that a wife cannot refuse sex to her husband unless she is ill. In addition. the law would forbid women from working or receiving education without their husbands permission. restrict their ability to leave the house without a male relative. and aims to strip women of their rights as mothers by granting child custody only to men. President Karzai has ordered that the law be reviewed. and has said that changes will be made to any articles which contradict Afghanistans Constitution and Islamic Sharia. I believe that the United States has an obligation to ensure that women and girls have the opportunities that they were denied under the Taliban. It is imperative that we provide the support needed to ensure that the rights of women are protected in the new Afghanistan.",

On June 19. 2010. the Novi Lady Wildcats sealed a 21 victory over Plymouth. marking the 4th Division 1 State Championship under the Head Coach Brian OLeary since 2005. After having amassed a division record of 811 and sharing the Kensington Lake Athletic Associations Central Division title with the Northville Mustangs. the Lady Wildcats headed in to district play with overall regular season tally of 1422. Novi dimmed the Knights of Walled Lake Northern 10 before crushing the Farmington Falcons 50 in the district semifinal. The Cats eliminated the North Farmington Raiders to win the District 9 crown. Moving on to regional matchups. Novi got past Frasers Ramblers by a score of 21. The Lady Wildcats defense would prove impenetrable against both Troy and Rochester Adams as the Green and White eked out identical 10 scores against the opposition in regional final and state semifinal matches. setting the stage for a Wildcat showdown. Facing their KLAA rival Plymouth Wildcats in the final match of the season. the Novi Wildcats buried a 12 yard penalty kick midway through overtime giving Novi the right to raise high the Division 1 State Championship trophy. Madam Speaker. with a season record of 2122 and having earned an astounding 4th state title in the last 6 years. the 2010 Novi Lady Wildcats deserve to be recognized for their determination. achievement. spirit and effort. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Wildcats for obtaining this spectacular title and in honoring their devotion to our community and country.",

Such was the case of Chief Justice Rehnquist. who did not have such experience. But because they were nominated by a Republican. it was a big advantage not to have judicial experience. Now a Democrat sends a nominee down and all of a sudden not having judicial experience is a liability. That is some flexibility. as far as I am concerned. I met with the nominee.

Senator BURRIS. in asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in just a few moments on the nomination of Gary Feinerman to be U.S. district court judge for the Northern District of Illinois. Gary Feinerman is one of the brightest lights in the Chicago legal community. He is a partner at one of Chicagos oldest and largest law firms. Sidley Austin. where he specializes in litigation and appellate work. Before that. he served as Illinois solicitor general and represented our State in many very valuable and important appeals. He won five \"Best Brief\" awards from the National Association of Attorneys General. and he has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. as well as the Illinois Supreme Court. Earlier in his career. Mr. Feinerman worked at the Chicago law firm of Mayer Brown and in the Justice Departments Office of Policy Development. He served as law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and for Seventh Circuit Judge Joel Flaum. He is a leader in the Chicago legal community. He is the president of the Appellate Lawyers Association of our State and serves on Chicagos Constitutional Rights Foundation and the Midwest chapter of the AntiDefamation League. He has also had a very active pro bono practice. which speaks well of his commitment as a professional. Mr. Feinermans academic record is also impressive. He graduated from Yale and Stanford Law School. where he finished second in his class. Not surprisingly. he received the highest possible rating of \"wellqualified\" from the American Bar Association for this commitment. We currently have sixsixvacancies in the Northern District of Illinois. We need to fill them quickly so that we dont slow down the process of justice. I hope the Senate will confirm Gary Feinerman today and move very quickly to Justice Sharon Coleman. who is also on the calendar.

He was adamant that the Presiding Officer should always be respectful of the speakers. while maintaining strict adherence to the rules of the Senate. Senator ROBERT C. BYRD was a patriot who cared for and loved this country. the United States of America. He worked hard for the people of West Virginia. who showed their support for him election after election. Senator ROBERT C. BYRD was a spiritual man. Each week a number of Senators got together for a morning prayer breakfast. Senator BYRD was a regular participant when he was well. His favorite hymn was \"Old Rugged Cross.\" I enjoyed singing it with him many times. We shared a love for music and the arts. His fiddle playing was legendary. He loved his family. He loved his children and grandchildren. He loved his dogs. Closest always was his wife Erma who was always by his side until her death in 2006. They spent many wonderful years together. and now they are together again. My thoughts and prayers are with the Byrd family. Senator BYRD. we love you and we miss you. Thank you very much.

Borough of Califon. NJ Recipient: Borough of Califon. 39 Academy Street. Califon. NJ 07830 The funding would be used for reconstruction of the storm water conveyance system to reduce flooding. meet storm water management standards. and to enhance storm water quality in the Borough of Califon. New Jersey. Much of the historic core of the Borough of Califon was developed during the midlate 19th century. Drainage systems were constructed to collect and deliver stormwater to waterpower sites. Considerable segments of the original drainage infrastructure remain and are antiquated. The current drainage ways are susceptible to frequent flooding. During flooding events. recharge to groundwater is reduced. suspended solids and floatables bypass normal catchments. and septic systems are inundated. The quality of receiving waters is degraded. A reoccurring flooding problem exists along an unnamed tributary which traverses a natural. wooded area between Academy Street and Main St. Severe flooding occurs as flows overtop the existing channel and then sheet overland along Railroad Avenue and Main Street. Flooding along the area reoccurs on a regular basis and results in the degradation of water quality of the downstream receiving watercourses. In general. the problem is inadequate capacity of the conveyance system of open channels. pipes and culverts. Reconstruction of the system is needed to reduce flooding. meet current stormwater management standards and to enhance stormwater quality. This project is consistent with environmental criteria established by the State of New Jersey to improve stormwater systems and water quality. Since the stormwater from the area of this project enters the South Branch of the Raritan River. which flows directly through the center of the Borough of Califon. the benefits of this project are far reaching.",

June 27. 2009. the members of Fourth Baptist Church are celebrating their 150th anniversary. and I would like to take a moment to highlight the rich history of this church and its contribution to our community. Fourth Baptist Church. the first black Baptist church in the Church Hill community in Richmond. began in 1859 as a regular assembly of slaves for prayer. The group met regularly on Chimborazo Hill until the outbreak of the Civil War. when the white congregation of the Leigh Street Baptist Church granted permission for the slaves to hold their services in the church basement. In 1865 the Reverend Scott Gwathmey. one of the groups prayer leaders. gained permission for the group to meet in a Union barracks on Chimborazo Hill. There. on December 2. 1865. the Fourth Baptist Church was formally organized. with Reverend Gwathmey serving as the first pastor. The barracks were eventually demolished. but the congregation salvaged lumber from the debris and constructed their own church building. In 1875 this church was replaced by another one of frame. on the northern side of Church Hill. near what was to be the site of the present church. The present building was completed in 1884. three months after the former church was destroyed by fire. The church has grown considerably from these humble beginnings. Major expansion was conducted under the direction of current Pastor Emeritus. Dr. Robert L. Taylor. Dr. Taylor served as Pastor of Fourth Baptist for 34 years. He was responsible for instituting many of the programs that still exist at the church. and oversaw the building of the addition to the church building now known as Taylor Hall. Fourth Baptist has vibrant Mens and Womens programs that enlighten and assist the young people as they participate in the Boy Scouts. Girl Scouts. and the Youth Usher programs. Fourth Baptist also participates with the Baptist General Convention of Virginia to conduct outreach ministries throughout Greater Richmond and the Commonwealth of Virginia. I would like to congratulate Chairman of the Board of Deacons Gerard A. Dabney. Interim Pastor Dr. Marion Tapscott. and the entire congregation of Fourth Street Baptist on the occasion of their 150th anniversary. I would to wish them another 150 years of service to their community.",

Upon settling in Milton. Mr. McKenzie began a new career in the automotive industry. His first day on the job. he sold a brand new Mercury sedan for $3.000. From there. he built a family owned automotive business that still stands to this day. For over 40 years. McKenzie Pontiac GMC Buick has provided for the automotive needs of the people of Northwest Florida. Billing themselves as a hometown dealership. their motto of \"We will treat you like family\" was a promise and not just a slogan. Mr. McKenzie was not only a businessman. but a dedicated family man.

I was familiar with the successful Duck Stamp Program but had never heard of the Junior Duck Stamp. JDS. Program. Now. 15 years later. this is the third reauthorization of this program. I am very happy to say that it is one of this countrys oldest and most successful youthfocused conservation programs in the Federal Government. and over the years. JDS has expanded to all 50 States. the District of Columbia. and the U.S. Territories. For those of you who dont know about the JDS Program. it is a conservationfocused science and arts curriculum for gradeschool and highschool students. It is an art contest centered around studies that teach the fundamentals of waterfowl anatomy and environmental science. Students submit their artwork depicting waterfowl in natural habitat settings to a State or territory contest. Winners from these contests are submitted for the national contest. Just as in Duck Stamps. the winning artwork at the national JDS contest is used to create a Junior Duck Stamp for the following year. The stamps are sold by the U.S. Postal Service and consignees for $5 per stamp. Proceeds from the sale of the stamps support conservation education and are used for awards and scholarships for the students. teachers. and schools that participate in the program. I must commend the JDS administrators and coordinators at the national. State. and local levels. the teachers and schools that support the JDS program. and the students who participate each year in the contest for the success of the Junior Duck Stamp Program. Your dedication and hard work have made this program a premier wildlife conservation education tool. and I am proud to be associated with it. Mr. Speaker.

Under current law. Congress appropriates money each year to be spent on projects to acquire. enhance. protect and restore wetlands in Canada. Mexico and the United States. In fact. this remarkable program. which is now celebrating its 20th anniversary. has funded over 1.600 projects to conserve more than 20 million acres of wetlands and associated uplands across North America. This conservation has helped ensure improved waterfowl hunting across North America. Since 1989. this landmark law has required that each Federal dollar spent on a conservation project be matched by nonfederal money. However. due to the irreplaceable nature of the breeding waterfowl habitat in Canada. a decision was made not to require matching funds from Canadian sources. Therefore. projects in Canada have been matched by conservation dollars from the United States. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. the North American Wetlands Council has approved conservation projects in Canada worth nearly $70 million during its current 5year funding cycle which began in 2007. Under law. this means that $70 million in private matching funds must be provided. Under my legislation. the North American Wetlands Conservation Act would be amended to allow up to 50 percent of the nonfederal share of projects in Canada to be paid for by Canadian conservation supporters. My legislation will allow and encourage our Canadian conservation partners to fund a greater number of important wetland preservation projects north of the border. The authorization of appropriations for the North American Wetlands Conservation Act does not expire until September 30. 2012. We simply cannot wait to make this change because the nonmatching share imbalance will continue to grow and must be paid before the authorization expires. The language of this legislation has been fully vetted and been endorsed by all interested parties including the Fish and Wildlife Service. the member of the North American Wetlands Conservation Council which includes Ducks Unlimited. as well as the National Audubon Society and the American Bird Conservancy.

He was deployed to New York City with the National Guard to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11. 2001.

The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at augmenting the support services available to family caregivers of wounded veterans. improving VA services to women veterans. preventing veteran homelessness. and increasing mental health care access to veterans. This historic bill achieves so many necessary and important goals. First. it provides immediate support for veteran caregivers by creating a program to offer caregiver training. access to mental health counseling. and 24hour respite care in the veterans home. Family caregivers sacrifice so much of their own lives in order to care for our nations heroes. It is so important that we give them every supportive service they need so they do not become overwhelmed by the daily realities of caring for a wounded veteran. Second. this bill seeks to build a VA health care system respectful of the unique medical needs of women veterans. For the first time. VA will be authorized to provide health care for newbom infants of women veterans. Our women veterans deserve private health care that is respectful of their unique medical needs.

His kindness and concern is evident to all who know him. Father Coughlins prayers before this Chamber are relevant. beautiful and timeless. I have no doubt his wordscaptured in the RECORD as a permanent part of the history of the Housewill be quoted long after all of us presently serving are gone. I was cochairman of the bipartisan chaplain search committee commissioned by Speaker Dennis Hastert 10 years ago. Unfortunately. a process begun with the best of intentions by the Speaker and all participants. ended up in partisan acrimony and finger pointing with each party believing the other was motivated by intentions highly unworthy of the task at handfinding a Chaplain for the House. Gods hand must surely have guided Speaker Hastert as he jettisoned the failed selection process andin consultation with church leaders in his home State of Illinoispicked Father Coughlin to serve as our Chaplain. Father Coughlin was a parish priest. and we are blessed he accepted the assignment of the U.S. House of Representatives to be his new parish. He has served us all in a pure ecumenical spirit. He has been a faithful friend. counselor and minister to us all. I feel privileged to know Father Coughlin and extend my deepest congratulations to him on the twin milestones of 50 years in the priesthood and 10 years as Chaplain of the House. God bless you. Father Coughlin. Thank you for your wonderful ministry.",

I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1116. recognizing and supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. which actually took place the week of March 8. Now. while Multiple Sclerosis Week occurred last month. it is never the wrong time to draw attention to this important health issue and to reaffirm our commitment to combating MS. Multiple sclerosis affects an estimated 400.000 people in the United States and 2V2 million people worldwide. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder where the immune system incorrectly attacks healthy nerve fibers of the central nervous system. Symptoms that people with MS experience include blurred vision and blindness. tremors. extreme fatigue and paralysis. However. the exact causes of MS are unknown. and there is no known cure for this disease. But what we all know is that it can affect men and women of all ages. and it does affect each person differently. Many of us have our own personal stories of loved ones whove been diagnosed with MS. We will hear some of those stories today. Ive gotten to know some wonderful constituent advocates from my district to learn of their personal stories over the years through the MS Society chapter which I represent in my district. and I know that many of my colleagues have benefited from interactions with their local chapters and the members who have shared their stories with them. So I want to commend my colleague. Representative LEE. for introducing this resolution. I also recognize Representative CARNAHAN and Representative BURGESS for their leadership on the Congressional Multiple Sclerosis Caucus. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

That is one of the reasons the past several years we have been able to fight for and obtain funding through the Department of Defense congressionally directed research program. We also have worked with addressing the issue in terms of creating the national registry. so we can help track this difficult disease that has eluded a cure for so long. I am proud to serve as cochair of the Congressional MS Caucus along with my colleague here today. MICHAEL BURGESS. He has been a good partner in promoting this. The MS Caucus is a bipartisan group of a 127 Members of this House actively engaged in discussions about access to quality health care. raising awareness. promoting education. and increasing MS research. I want to urge my colleagues here today to not just support this resolution. but if youre not already a member of the MS Caucus. I urge you to join us. I urge you to connect with your local chapters to help support the people that are living and suffering with MS. but also to help find that cure. to move research forward. This year marks the fifth annual MS Awareness Week. The week was created by the MS Coalition and the National MS Society to raise national awareness about MS. I especially want to thank St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National MS Society for their unwavering dedication. for their help for people back in my home city. and for their support of my work here in the Congress. Im grateful for their hard work to provide support and assistance for those living with and affected by MS. This spring. in fact. more than 8.000 Missourians took part in the Walk MS event across the State. raising awareness and funds to help those living with MS every day. for the challenges they face from this disease. Today. I want to again urge my colleagues to support this resolution to help create a world free of MS.",

She was my friend. my mentor. and one of my predecessors as the national president of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. Dr. Height was passionate about justice and equality. Everything she did. every position she held. and every policy she advocated served her lifes mission. which was to eliminate barriers to success for women and blacks. while inspiring the next generation. Even though Presidents and other world leaders sought her counsel. she always took the time to advise and encourage young women. including myself. While we mourn her loss. I am not sad. She lived a great life. We often talk about life is not the longevity. but it is the breadth. and she had a great life. So we celebrate her life today. a great humanitarian who leaves a legacy of strong and caring women. That is why I am honored to introduce this resolution celebrating Dr. Heights life and recognizing her work. Dr. Height served as president of the National Council of Negro Women for four decades. stepping down from the position in 1997. In her position with the Council. which. by the way. connected nearly 4 million women worldwide. she tackled issues that affected all families. including child care for working mothers. health and nutrition. and providing adequate housing for families in need. She served as the national president of Delta Sigma Theta from 1947 to 1957. Widely recognized as one of the founding members of the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Height was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. and in 2004 she received the Congressional Gold Medal. Dr. Height fought for equal rights for both women and blacks and was active in such causes as securing voting rights. equal employment opportunities and desegregation of public schools. Marching alongside Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr.. she advocated womens rights during the civil rights struggle. Dr. Height was instrumental in the fight for equal pay for women and organized numerous programs to help women achieve equal rights and independence. Dr. Height was a tenacious and zealous civil rights activist. social worker. advocate. educator. organizer. mentor and friend. She was my friend.

I appreciate his working closely with me and with Senator GRAHAM. and I believe that the changes in this bill put our military commissions framework on a solid footing so that our nation will be ready to proceed with the trials of terrorist detainees by military commission. In the same vein. I am pleased to cosponsor Senator LEVINs amendment No. 1710. which deals with the protection of classified information used in military commissions. This amendment is based on extensive meetings between our staffs and the professional prosecutors who wish to ensure that classified information receives the fullest possible protection in the course of these trials. The amendment Is based in large part on the Classified Information Procedures Act. CIPA. which includes protections for the use of classified information in trials. Based on 20 years of experience with CIPA. and with 3 years of experience with the Military Commissions Act. the protections contained in this amendment are what the professional prosecutors believe they need to ensure that classified information is not improperly disclosed and to allow trials to proceed more efficiently by providing military judges with an extensive body of law based on CIPA upon which to base their decisions. Avoiding the unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a key to ensuring the protection of our national interests. and so I am pleased to advocate the adoption of this amendment. I note that the Departments of Defense and Justice concur with the language contained in this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.",

Under the civilian Classified Information Procedures Act. there is a robust body of cases. Military rule of evidence 505(b) is not used very often in courtsmartial.

I understand this is a bit complicatedthere are parochial interests involveduntil we understand the dilemma we are in here. In the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill. we included language that grants a 5year waiver to the Berry amendment for the procurement of flameresistant rayon. the material used to make military uniforms. There are 3 years left on the waiver. The Isakson amendment permanently extends this waiver and will end all efforts to produce a domestic material to make military uniforms. I respectfully oppose the amendment. We are currently procuring the material from Europe. There is no source of domestic rayon. Neither Congress nor DOD has ever issued a determination or finding that the domestic market lacks sufficient products that could perform the functions desired by DOD. This amendment unfairly excludes. in my opinion. U.S. manufacturers from competing for DOD procurements and improperly limits competition since the domestic market contains products such as flameresistant cotton. Nomex. and nylon which can fulfill DODs needs. DODs decision to procure flameresistant fabric from foreign suppliers without even examining whether domestic manufacturers could meet the agencys need with other products violates DODs statutory mandate to use performance rather than material specifications and to seek free and fair open competition whenever practical. Instead of affirmatively extending a waiver that has 3 years remaining. we should continue to let the technologies and fabrics develop and reassess where we are In 1 or 2 years. I think that is the wise thing to do. and I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.",

The reason for waivers is when we find that there is no domestic product equal to or better than a product that has a component overseas. in the interest of our men and women in the military. we give the waiver so it doesnt keep usso we do not prohibit ourselves from having the best material possible. If an American domestic manufacturer produces an alternative fiber or fabric which meets or exceeds the fireresistant paraaramid rayon that is now being used. the Berry waiver will no longer apply because there will be a domestically produced U.S. product that is superior or equal to that particular product of rayon. So I would respectfully submit to the Senators from Virginia and South Carolina that the argument that there is a prohibitionthat this would keep people from making an investment in R&D to produce something better is the reverse. It actually will accelerate the need for them to make the R&D investment to try and produce something better in the United States. if they can. One last point. The U.S. military did 24 different evaluations after the initial move into Iraq when we had so many burn injuries. It determined this fabric has to be the best for our men and women aviators. men and women in the Marine Corps. men and women in the Army in combat. and it has performed well in Afghanistan and Iraq ever since. So I would submit the R&D argument is actually accelerated with the extension of the waiver. and the proof of the product is in the pudding which we have seen with the safety of our troops and our men and women in harms way.",

There is currently a waiver to the Berry amendment in place which allows companies to import the fireresistant rayon from foreign countries. Let me be very clear. The jobs that go with the manufacture of these uniforms for the Army and Marines are U.S. jobs. All of these uniforms are made in the United States. But this fabric is used by TenCate. Incorporated. to make its Defender M fabric to produce fireresistant uniforms for both the Army and the Marines. The material is not made in the United States due to EPA standards. This is a classic example of where EPA standards can be too stringent to allow U.S. manufacturers to operate. And. the reason is. it is cost prohibitive to do so. The current waiver. which includes a 5year sunset clause. was included in the 2008 Defense authorization bill after a tremendous effort by my colleague. Senator ISAKSON. and obviously is set to expire. The Armys PEO Soldier expressed very strongly that FR rayon is the superior fabric based upon key selection criteria. The criteria were cost. comfort. durability. and length of time before receiving thirddegree burns. We have had some very serious situations. obviously. that have occurred with burns in both Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why the Army and the Marines like this uniform. We buy 115.000 new FR uniforms every month. This uniform is superior because of the fact that we have been able to import this fabric with the Berry amendment waiver. It is. in my opinion. imperative that we continue for the competition. The uniforms are still competitively bid. So it is not like we are taking anybody out of the marketplace.

The information they have is that the number of individuals who have been successfully prosecuted. convicted. and incarcerated as a result of military commissions numbers in the handfulperhaps even fewer than five. By contrast. just since January 1 of this year. more than 30 individuals have been charged with terrorism. successfully prosecuted. and sentenced to Federal prisonmore than 30 convicted or sentenced just this year. There are 355 inmates in Federal prison now who have been successfully charged. prosecuted. convicted. and are now serving lengthy sentences as a result of their history or connection with international or domestic terrorism. I dont want to get into a discussion right now on whether military commissions are a good or bad idea. but what has proven triedandtrue in terms of actually putting terrorists behind bars. where they belong. has been the expertise and the experience and the capability of the U.S. Department of Justice.

There is a lot of highquality prosecutorial work and a lot of patriotism in the Department of Justice. and there is a reason we should allow the professionals to sort out case by case which is the better venue for the trial. whether a military commission. however new and untested in this modern era. or the triedandtrue model of the U.S. Federal prosecutor.

Id contend. would be shocked to know what little oversight actually exists over tobacco productsthe fuel driving the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Today I want to tell you about a new. despicable product being sold in 3 cities around the country. including my hometown of Columbus. Ohio. Reynolds America is currently using my constituents in Columbus as guinea pigs and testing a smokeless tobacco product that looks like a mint. How is a child supposed to tell the difference between a mint that freshens your breath and one that gives you cancer? According to an article in a suburban Columbus newspaper. many high school students are using smokeless tobacco during school hours. The American Lung Association has confirmed with school janitors that they are finding smokeless tobacco pouches in the trashconfirming that kids are using smokeless tobacco in class. These new forms of tobacco will only make it easier for children to get access to tobacco products and become lifelong addicts. They wont even have to dispose of the evidence. What we need is for Congress to finally pass into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This legislation would finally give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate deadly tobacco products. Among other items in this bill. the FDA would be granted authority to regulate these appalling new smokeless. dissolvable tobacco products that are now hitting the market in Columbus. Chairman WAXMAN stated the other day that he intends to move this legislation \"very. very soon.\" I thank him for his leadership and urge this chamber to do just that so we can reduce the addiction. disease. and death caused by these products.",

Yet when we have an opportunity. as we do in the Senate. to deal with that. too many of my colleagues race away. We cannot do that any longer.

Once again. in case some of my colleagues missed it. let me read what the Congressional Budget Office said about this legislation. They said. \"Whether premiums would increase or decrease as a result (of this legislation) is difficult to determine. but in either case. the magnitude of the effects is likely to be quite small.\" So this bill has no point.

First. there is no evidence that the exemption has increased health insurance prices or profits or that it has contributed to higher market concentration. Second. the effort to repeal McCarranFerguson is based on the belief that it allows individual insurers to collude on prices and policy coverage. State laws prohibit insurers from bidrigging. pricefixing and market allocation to restrain competition. State insurance regulators actively enforce the prohibition in these areas. and this legislation would only add another layer of Federal regulation and litigation to an industry that operates under a robust and wellestablished State regulatory regime.

Madam Speaker. last week I was shocked to learn that in the middle of the great recession. which was caused by the deregulation. handsoff policies of the prior administration. and during this time when families across my district and across the Nation are struggling with rising unemployment and while health insurance companies have recently announced that last year was their best year on record as far as profits are concerned. $12 billion last year in profits for the insurance industry. and while thats the case. they are announcing plans to raise insurance premiums by 40 percent in some markets. During this time of hurt and pain and also making money by the insurance industry off these people who are hurting and in pain. we are considering today removing the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for over 60 years. And its time for this protection and immunity from antitrust law and this anticompetitive behavior. its time for it to come to an end. This insurance industry which delivers health care to the people has been broken for a long time. We all know it. and its time to change it. And this is a good place to change it. It will help with competition if we pass this law today. That will happen only if we start applying anticompetitive. antitrust legislation to the insurance industry. Theres simply no reason why they should continue to benefit from it. Dont listen as the health insurance industry tries to tell you that they cant live under the antitrust laws. Every other industry does. Its high time that they do too. Consumers will benefit. the economy will benefit. and health Insurance insurers who want to compete honestly will too. Lets give struggling American families an honest health insurance market by enacting this important bill.",

And heres the rub: As was mentioned by the gentleman from Wisconsin. it is the small companies which depend on the availability of information the most. Smaller companies simply do not have a sufficiently large volume of information to price their products efficiently. So its for this reason that it is of the utmost importance that insurers have the ability to share historical data. Now. am I just saying this? No. In this record. a Congressional Research Service report raises the possibility that were such data not available to small insurance companies. we might see the ironic outcome of further concentration in the insurance industry. Again. not my conclusion. the conclusion of the Congressional Research report done most recently. So. yesterday I did approach the Rules Committee to ask my amendment. the Brooks amendment. as I call it. be restored to the health insurance antitrust bill. And even though it was approved unanimously by my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. my request was inexplicably rejected by the Rules Committee. This is not the way. I would say. Madam Speaker. that this body should do business. Lets respect the integrity of the institution and the work that has been done in the duly established committee process.

An original cosponsor of this legislation. I believe that our health insurance companies need to be held to the competitive standard our free market demands. For too long. these companies have told our constituents what they will insure and what they will be paid. Just recently. 80.000 Iowans were told that their insurance rates would jump by an average of 18 percent. with many facing increases of as much as 25 percent. These same individuals have seen their rates increase by 101h percent each year since 2005. I insist that light be shed on the pricing of health care costs and that consumers have access to how their premiums and copays are determined. I would particularly like this information for my constituents whose premium increase is twice what it was in Iowans in the Third District are struggling to make ends meet. They deserve to know how a company can spend as much as perhaps $200 million on a new headquarters and turn around and double their premium increases from 2009 to 2010 and then claim these two things have nothing to do with one another.

The other side of the aisle has already talked about the fact that they want to have greater competition in this area of health insurance. and I am assuming insurance across the board. But what this will do. as the gentleman and others have already said on the floor. is basically say to the new entrants. to the small companies who want to get into this marketplace. to be able to compete against the large entrenched companies that are already there. you are pushed out. you are locked out. So is that what we want to do with this legislation? That will be the impact. Let me conclude then. In a letter to Speaker PELOSI. the National Association of State Insurance Commissioners says the following: \"The business of insurance. while exempted from Federal antitrust law. is still subject to State antitrust enforcement actions.\" That is important. \"In fact. even if the McCarranFerguson antitrust exemptions were repealed. the State action doctrine exempting them would continue to apply. The most likely result of this repeal would therefore not be increased competition. but a series of lawsuits testing the limits of the State action doctrine. with associated litigation costs being passed along to the consumers in the form of higher premiums.\" The conclusion. Madam Speaker. is more litigation. more harmful consolidation. and more increase to the cost to the consumer. all things that we should be working to oppose.
