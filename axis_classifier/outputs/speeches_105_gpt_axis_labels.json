    "speech": "Mr. President. this is not an exhaustive list of all the earmarks the conferees endorsed. As with previously submitted conference agreements. the conferees explicitly state in the report that they endorse all the provisions of the Senate and House reports on the bill. unless they are explicitly contradicted or addressed in the conference report. So there are a lot more earmarks that the conferees intend that the agencies will adhere to in allocating appropriated funds. Again. Mr. President. I hesitate to say that all of these earmarks and setasides are wasteful. or unnecessary. I want to stress that these projects may very well have merit and may very well be worthy of inclusion in this bill. But the process the Congress established for itself. which involves both authorization and appropriation of spending items. is routinely ignored in the appropriations bills. These unauthorized and locality specific earmarks and addons have bypassed the normal agency review process and have bypassed the authorization process. They have simply been included in the appropriations bill because a small segment of the Senate or House. those who serve on Appropriations Committee. decided to include them. Mr. President. the American people deserve to know how their money is spent. and why. Millions of dollars will be spent for the projects on the attached list. and I doubt that most Senators know why these projects were chosen for earmarks or setasides. The American people certainly dont have access to that information. I intend to send a letter to the President asking that he consider using his lineitem veto authority to eliminate these spending items from this bill. That is why we gave him a lineitem vetoto eliminate wasteful. unnecessary. and lowpriority spending. He has already demonstrated his willingness to use the lineitem veto. and I hope he continues to exercise that authority when clearly necessary. Mr. President. as I said. I support the majority of the provisions of this bill. and I intend to vote for it. I am thankful. however. that a mechanism now exists that could. if utilized. eliminate the earmarks and setasides in this bill to which I must object.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to mention one issue of concern in the conference report on appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is in regard to report language on the Particulate Matter Research Program. I agree that we need more research on the sources and the health effects of particulate matter and strongly support this bills appropriation of funds for new research. However. I would like to make it clear. for the record. that I do not agree with the conference report language that says that \"we do not yet have available sufficient facts necessary to proceed with future regulations for a new particulate matter standard.\" The EPA standards are based on the best available science regarding the health effects of exposure to particulate matter. Some argue that we should not proceed until we have scientific proof of the exact relationship between exposures to particulate matter. and health effects. If we applied that principle in the late 1970s. we would not be enjoying the benefits of our current standards which have led to. for example. air pollution from carbon monoxide being reduced by 28 percent. from sulphur dioxide 41 percent. and from lead 98 percent.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to present the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation and related agencies appropriations bill. This bill is very similar to the transportation appropriations bill that the Senate approved 98 to 1 on July 30. It provides the highest level of funding for Federalaid highways in history22.9 billion. Thats slightly less than the amount we had included in the Senate bill because. in conference. we agreed to fund some other House priorities. but its still a record level. The actual distribution of those funds among the States will depend on reauthorization of ISTEAthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991which has provided authorization for Federal surface transportation programs for the past 6 years and which expired at the end of fiscal year 1997. But this increase of almost $3 billion over fiscal year 1997 will almost certainly mean more Federal highway spending for each State. The conference report also includes $300 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System as proposed by the Senate. This is a downpayment toward meeting the Federal Governments commitment to completing that System. The bill includes $4.7 billion for transit grants. including $200 million for Washington Metro. I ask unanimous consent that a table which shows the distribution of these funds under current law be printed in the RECORD.",

I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. Senator SHELBY. for completing his first bill as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. I commend the chairman for bringing the Senate a balanced bill. As all members know. transportation spending was a priority area within the bipartisan budget agreement. With passage of this bill. we begin to increase funding for our Nations infrastructure as we promised during negotiations on the balanced budget agreement. The conference agreement provides $13.1 billion budget authority [BA] and $13.5 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the Department of Transportation. including Federalaid highways. mass transit. aviation activities. the U.S. Coast Guard. and transportation safety agencies. When outlays from prioryear budget authority and other adjustments are taken into account. the bill totals $13.1 billion in budget authority and $37.9 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1998. The reported bill is $0.1 billion In budget authority below the subcommittees revised section 302(b) allocation. and at the subcommittees allocation for outlays. The spending is less than $0.1 billion in budget authority below the Presidents fiscal year 1998 budget request for the subcommittee. and $0.4 billion In outlays above the Presidents request. Mr. President. it is my pleasure to serve on the subcommittee and to be a part of the Conference Committee. I support the conference agreement. and I urge its adoption. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to oppose the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation conference report. Due to a provision added in conference. the Treasury Department will be forced to reduce the Amtrak tax refund by $200 million. This conference report violates the budget agreement. amends the recently enacted tax bill. and unnecessarily straps Amtrak as it is facing a possible strike in the next few weeks. Mr. President. as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a strong Amtrak supporter. I find this action by the Appropriations Committee to be outrageous. As my colleagues in the Senate know. one of my top priorities has been to create a dedicated source of capital funding for Amtrak. Congress has voted time and time again that capital funding is critical to Amtraks survival. For that reason. a tax provision was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to provide Amtrak with a tax refund of $2.3 billion for capital expenses. The bottom line is Amtrak desperately needs capital. According to GAO. Amtrak must have the capital funding that was provided in the Taxpayer Relief Act as well as what is provided through the normal appropriations process. Without both Amtrak faces bankruptcy. The language the conferees included in the fiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation conference report would undermine the efforts Congress has already taken to give Amtrak the capital funding it needs to survive. Mr. President. I fully intend to reverse this provision as soon as the next opportunity arises. It is a clear violation of the spirit and intent of the budget agreement and of the tax bill signed into law in August. If this is not reversed. I believe this provision may be the final straw that finally breaks the financial back of Amtrak.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today eight of the largest gun manufacturers voluntarily agreed to include safety locks with every handgun they sell. I rise today to commend the President and the gun industry for their historic efforts. This agreement addresses a very serious problem. Every year. many hundreds of children die from accidental shootings and thousands more try to take their own lives with guns. Encouraging parents to use safety locks will not save all of these young lives. to be sure. but it will save many of them. It will make a difference. This deal. however. would not have been possible without the public outcry over these tragedies and the growing momentum for bipartisan child safety lock legislation. Our measure. which lost by a single vote in the Judiciary Committee this summer. requires the sale of a safety lock with every handgun. Mr. President. in my opinion voluntary action is always better than Government regulation. For that reason. when we entered into negotiations with gun manufacturers. we asked them to take this dramatic step on their own initiative. Today we are very pleased that most of the Industry has responded so that 80 percent of all handguns manufactured in the United States will now be sold with child safety locks. But we will continue to push until the half million more handguns. including those manufactured abroad. are also covered. We will also continue to encourage voluntary compliance. but until we have the support of the entire industry. we will move to enact our legislation. It should be easier now because most of the industry is already on board. Mr. President. todays announcement is an important step for safety and a victory for families and children everywhere.

Mr. GILMAN and the bills sponsor. Mr. LANTOS. and their staff for preparing this important measure. In the aftermath of the Holocaust. survivors struggled to rebuild their lives. Holocaust victims in Western countries generally received some monetary compensation from Germany. albeit very limited compensation. Those victims whose homelands fell behind the Iron Curtain after World War II did not receive even this slight measure of justice. Other issues related to the Holocaust era. including the disposition of assets such as real or financial property. art work. and insurance policy proceeds went unresolved for all of these individuals. as well as for religious communities. Mr. Speaker. a belated measure of justice for Holocaust victims is within reach. Much has been achieved. including unprecedented settlements between Holocaust survivors. Swiss Banks. and European insurance companies. Building on this momentum. the State Department and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum will convene the Washington Conference on Holocaustera Assets next month to address issues of Naziconfiscated assets. including art. insurance. communal property. libraries and archives. as well as Holocaust education. research and remembrance. Conference participants will include government officials from over 40 countries. historians. experts. and representatives of major NGOs including the survivor community. This resolution could not be considered at a more opportune moment. The resolution calls on countries to return expropriated properties to Holocaust victims or their heirs without arbitrary discrimination. It calls for the opening of archives relating to the Nazi era and for the continued prosecution of Naziera war criminals. It calls on Germany to provide just reparations to all Holocaust victims without delay and without the use of unreasonable eligibility criteria. Of equal importance. this resolution calls on all countries to encourage education on the history of the Holocaust and the consequences of the failure to respect human rights. Mr. Speaker. we should pass this resolution as a demonstration of Congress support for the U.S. Governments efforts to achieve justice for Holocaust victims and their families.

They rallied behind the pitching tandem of brothers James and Ben Hutton to begin a comeback in the fifth inning and to take the lead in the sixth inning. A pair of convincing runs in the ninth inning sealed their 9 to 4 victory. giving their coach and Edwardsville their first national championship. After the game. pitcher James Hutton said. \"The whole team responded tonight. This is a team win. and it will always be a team win. The pitcher gets more of the glory. but I dont deserve more than anyone else on the team.\" Congratulations to Edwardsville.",

Then their businesses go belly up. They default on their loans. the banks fail. and then the foreign banks dial 911 to Uncle Sam for more money. The International Monetary Fund then calls Uncle Sam and says: \"If you dont make these countries and these foreign banks any more loans. they wont buy your products.\" Beam me up. Mr. Speaker. When American taxpayers are subsidizing foreign economies and they are denying American products. we need a proctologist to give us some counseling.",

There is no need for a shutdown. for even if an agreement cannot be reached before the current spending bills run out. Republicans are ready to sign on to another temporary spending bill to allow the government to continue without interruption while we work out the remaining differences.

The crisis is starkly illustrated by the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study which found that only Cyprus and South Africa have 12th graders who knew significantly less about math and science than United States students. The major cause of poor United States performance is that our public schools have a near monopoly on education and secondary education. stifling students academic development. To counter this dilemma. Americans across this Nation are seeking much greater freedom of school choice. And here is where Forstmann and Walton come in. Last year. through the Washington Scholarship Fund. they awarded over 1.000 scholarships to poor children in Washington. D.C.. but they had requests for 7.500. In response to this great demand. the amazing Forstmann/Walton team has pledged $100 million of their own money and plan to raise an additional $100 million to provide around 35.000 scholarships to help poor children attend schools of their choice all across this country. Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton are creating the future of American education.

Many people who voted for the Hyde resolution voted for it. many people who voted for the Democratic amendment voted for it because they wanted an inquiry. but they thought the Republican Hyde resolution was a formula for an openended. politicized fishing expedition. and at least this would make it fairer. So they voted for the Democratic amendment. and then. when it failed. they voted against the Hyde resolution. Some of us. however. thought and think there is no impeachable offense described in the Starr Report. Even if you assume the President did everything it alleges he did. there is no impeachable offense. He should be punished in some other way for things he did that are not good things to do. but there was no impeachable offense. We voted for the Democratic amendment as an amendment to make a bad bill. a bad resolution. a better bill. but. had the amendment passed. we still would have voted against the bill because. although it would have mitigated the damages in the bill. it made it much damaging to the country. it was still calling for an unnecessary inquiry.

In Committee there was a provision added that would have allowed Members of Congress and their staffs to be reimbursed for legal costs in cases where they were the prevailing party against the Federal Government. unless a court found that the Governments case was \"substantially justified or that other special circumstances would make an award unjust.\" Under this provision. the burden of proof would be placed on Government prosecutors who would not only have to prove that there was probable cause a crime had been committed. but also that they were substantially justified in bringing the case to trial. It was my intention to vote for an amendment to completely strike the committee language from the bill. Unfortunately. the Congress was not given an opportunity to vote on such an amendment. Instead the Congress considered the Hyde amendment. This amendment took a questionable approach to a handful of cases involving Congress and sought to apply it to all cases prosecuted by the Government. This would open the Government up to a flood of litigation every time it lost a case. regardless of the circumstances. It was a bad idea for cases involving Congress and its an exponentially worse when its extended to everyone else. The fact is that if this provision were to become law. the Department of Justice would choose not to pursue difficult. but legitimate. criminal cases such as those involving rape and child molestation.",

Three of my constituents. Christian Robin. Maria Groh. and Anna Goodman. came to Washington. DC. to celebrate this important occasion. Why is September 26 important to AustrianAmericans? On September 26. 1945. at the meeting of all Federal Provincial Governors. the United States insisted that Austria remain a united nation. Had it not been for the United States. Austria would have been divided between the East and West. This year also marks an important anniversary for AustrianAmericans. Fifty years ago. the United States initiated the Marshall plan. Through this plan. many wartorn European nations were able to rebuild after World War II. The Marshall plan enabled these nations to fend off the looming Communist threat. AustrianAmericans work hard to make their communities a better place to live in by sharing what they have and helping others in need. In a sense. we can say that our aid in postwar reconstruction has come full circle. We are now receiving the benefits of the generosity that our Nation showed to another country in their time of need. Mr. Speaker. many great AustrianAmericans have contributed to our way of life. I want to take a moment and reflect on some famous AustrianAmericans: Joseph Pulitzer. Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and Earl Warren. Estee Lauder. Fred Astair. and Arnold Schwarzenegger. These individuals have made many contributions to our society. Of course. there are countless other AustrianAmericans who have contributed greatly in the areas of literature. science. economics. medicine. and entertainment. Austria and America have an inextricable bond which has been created not only through the Marshall plan but also through those Austrians who have chosen to make the United States their home. Though they may have been born and raised in another country. they have joined the melting pot that is our country. making our Nation even stronger by the addition of their experiences and hopes and dreams for America. We must take the time to learn and appreciate other heritages and cultures. I would like to commend AustrianAmericans for making their culture accessible to all of us through their many different activities throughout the United States.",

Martino. the man who had founded AAMCO Transmissions in the mid1950s. decided to create another franchise system for quality production auto painting and body repair. He opened a pilot center in Wilmington. DE. and despite critics who proclaimed \"you could never franchise paint and collision repair.\" today. on the 25th anniversary of MAACO Auto Painting and Bodyworks. there are 500 MAACO franchise centers in 48 of the United States. and in Canada. Mexico. and Puerto Rico. Next week. MAACO will celebrate the culmination of its 25 years in business at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego. CA. and at the same time. observe that in this its 25th year. MAACO has also achieved the painting and repair of its 10 millionth vehicle. while opening its 500th center in North America. Tony Martino. founder and still CEO of the chain today. has always believed that with a strong operating manual and a strong system. and. in the case of MAACO. by offering the public a quality paint and body repair service at reasonable prices. you can be successful. Since 1972. MAACO has built a $335 million franchise system and has made hundreds of men and women successful owners of a small business that has become part of the economic engine of America. As MAACO observes its 25th anniversary. it has proven that MAACO is more than a business to its hundreds of independent MAACO operators.",

At the current rate. the worlds population will double from 5.8 to 11 billion people during our lifetime. Excluding China. 21 million women of childbearing age in the developing world are added each yearequal to the total number of women of childbearing age in California. Texas. New York. and Florida combined. Population Awareness Week calls attention to our voluntary family planning program. President Nixon launched the U.S. international family planning program in 1969. The program improves the health of mothers and their children by increasing the time between births while reducing unintended pregnancies and abortions. After 30 years. the program helped reduce the average number of children in the developing world from six to four. Modern contraceptive use climbed from 10 to 35 percent. As contraceptive use in countries such as Russia rose from 19 to 24 percent. abortion rates fell from 109 per 1.000 women to 76. It is clear that family planning reduces unintended pregnancies and abortions in many countries. In sum. the Population Council estimates that without family planning programs. there would have been 500 million more people in the world todayalmost twice the population of the United States. The single greatest way to reduce infant mortality is to increase the time between pregnancies. Family planning also helps to reduce abortion. Family planning saves lives and creates greater opportunities for the health. education. and economic future of children. I want to commend the leaders behind World Population Awareness Week. especially Werner Fornos of the Population Institute. The institute is one of the leading forces in bringing the attention of the Congress to key issues of population. family planning. and the environment.",

By reaching the World Series in record time. the Florida Marlins is the youngest franchise ever to win the World Series and has thus assured itself a place in history. Before this reason. the Florida Marlins had never been in the playoffs. Throughout the 1997 division series. however. they never trailed in games won. They initiated their quest by overpowering the San Francisco Giants and then went on to win the National League Championship Series by upsetting the Atlanta Braves. Then. in a dramatic. extrainning. seventh game. they defeated the Cleveland Indians to become the 1997 World Series champions. Within 5 years. the Florida Marlins attained a monumental goal that has historically taken championship teams decades to accomplish. The 25 players who achieved this feat are: Kurt Abbott. Moises Alou. Antonio Alfonseca. Alex Arias. Bobby Bonilla. Kevin Brown. John Cangelosi. Jeff Conine. Dennis Cook. Craig Counsell. Darren Daulton. Jim Eisenreich. Alex Fernandez. Cliff Floyd. Felix Heredia. Livan Hernandez. Charles Johnson. A Leiter. and Greg Zaun. The Marlins victory was a victory for all Floridians. In a community as diverse as ours. people from different backgrounds have united in their admiration and pride for our baseball team.

ASEANs emphasis on cooperation and the nonviolent settlement of disputes has fostered peace among its members in a region of the world which has long been wrought with instability and conflict. It is now difficult to visualize armed strife between ASEAN nations. Since its inception in 1967. ASEAN has grown to become an influential political and economic grouping composed of nine member nations. By tempting the longstanding rivalries among its members. ASEAN helps to foster a stable and secure environment conducive to economic growth and the political development of Southeast Asian nations. Its efforts to promote the economic. social. and cultural development of the region through cooperative programs. to safeguard the political and economic stability of the region. and to serve as a forum for the resolution of intraregional differences has made ASEAN a model of regional integration. The United States has important strategic. economic. and political interests at stake in Southeast Asia. Maintaining stability remains an overriding U.S. security interest in the region. Instability would not only threaten significant U.S. economic interests. but could also undermine important U.S. political relationships. ASEANs Regional Forum [ARF]. the regions only security consultative platform. is a key partner of the United States in maintaining regional stability.",

Mr. HOLLINGS. for their excellent work on the fiscal year 1998 Commerce. Justice. State. and judiciary appropriations bill. They and their staffs have put together an excellent bill and should be commended for their leadership. Let me take a brief moment to explain my intentions regarding amendment 1004. Its purpose is twofold. First. it makes $100.000 available for a grant to Roberts County. SD. It is clear from my discussions with law enforcement personnel in rural areas of South Dakota that few greater priorities exist than to ensure that South Dakotans have immediate access to emergency services when necessary. Unfortunately. many rural counties in South Dakota do not have the resources to purchase equipment for a 911 system to provide this capability. It is my intention that these funds be used for the purchase of that equipment and any other functions that must necessarily take place for the establishment of a 911 system in Roberts County. It is my further hope that in coming years Congress and the Department of Justice will continue to address the urgent need for assistance in the purchase of equipment to provide 911 services. The second purpose of the section is to provide $900.000 to the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation [DCI]. The DCI requires an immediate upgrade of computer and telecommunications equipment in its field offices. new equipment for its forensics lab. and new radio equipment to address problems in law enforcement radio transmissions. These funds will be of significant assistance in the provision of this equipment for the DCI. and I am pleased that I have been able to work with the committee to meet this need. Once again.

The Committee directs the NMFS to use as many available FTEs as are needed to ensure the full and timely implementation of the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The MagnusonStevens Act was reauthorized in the 104th Congress after a long and difficult process of negotiation and compromise. It includes many new provisions to improve the conservation and management of this Nations fishery resources. I appreciate the tremendous task the NMFS faces in fully implementing all of the new provisions and requirements we placed on the NMFS and share the committees desire to see adequate FTEs allocated to this important task. I am also concerned. however. about the very real need for FTEs to implement the requirements of the Endangered Species Act [ESA]. particularly in the Pacific Northwest. With several salmon species already listed under the ESA and an elaborate recovery plant currently being implemented with a critical decision point rapidly approaching. with habitat conservation plans being negotiated with public utility districts in central Washington. and additional ESA listings likely coming in the future. the NMFS is in desperate need of both resources and personnel to meet its obligations. I appreciate the committees willingness to fund NMFS efforts in these areas at or above the Presidents requested levels. These funds will go along way toward salmon recovery efforts throughout the entire Pacific coast. I would like to emphasize the need for adequate FTEs to be provided to this important effort. While the committee has correctly directed FTEs to the implementation of the MagnusonStevens Act. this allocation should not come at the expense of the agencys ability to undertake salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Both of these responsibilities of the NMFS are vitally important to Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. I urge the NMFS to meet the real need for FTEs in both of these areas.",

TIIAP is a highly competitive. meritbased. grant program that provides seed money for innovative. practical technology projects across the United States. TIIAP grants help our communities utilize the information technologies that play an increasingly important role in the world economy. Without access to advanced telecommunications services that deliver education. healthcare. social services. and news. individuals and sometimes entire communities are relegated to secondclass economic status. Rural and low income regions that already face difficult economic hurdles are pushed even farther behind because they lack the resources to join the information revolution. The Federal assistance provided by TIIAP has already helped many of these areas transition into the information economy. In my home State of Nebraska. TIIAP has helped the city of Crete purchase computers to build an access center where adults are taught computer skills and are given assistance to apply those skills to new jobs. Through the Nebraska Network for Children and Families. a TIIAP grant provides funding for the Ideas Network.

State Appropriations Subcommittee for including $1.675.000 for the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology [EPSCoT] in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations request. This program model is based on the successful National Science Foundations Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR]. EPSCoR has a strong track record in helping to promote quality research in States. like West Virginia. that are traditionally under represented in Federal research and development funding. EPSCoT is intended to promote similar activities for technology transfer. This is a wise investment with bipartisan support. Senator BURNS and I have discussed this concept and its potential. and we have sought the comments of leaders in our states and regions. Technology plays a vital role in economic growth. According to the Congressional Research Service. experts widely believe that technological progress is responsible for up to onehalf of the growth of the U.S. economy and is one principal driving force in longterm economic expansion and increases in our Nations standard of living. Given this compelling point. it is essential to ensure that technology is successfully transferred to business and industry in every region. including those regions which historically are under served. Our Nation will not thrive if some regions are left behind in the key sectors of R&D or technology transfer. The National Science Foundations EPSCoR program has considerably helped States enhance their capacity for research and development. The Department of Commerce is now looking to use this successful model for technology transfer. It is important to note that this initiative has been debated and considered for quite some time. Commerce officials have worked closely with Governors and U.S. Innovation Partnership. As a longstanding advocate for EPSCoR. I am enthusiastic about the potential for this new Commerce initiative. EPSCoT. to effectively build partnerships at the State level and promote technological advances that will lead to longterm growth in regions of our country that traditionally have been left behind. I am confident that West Virginia and other States can benefit enormously by such a targeted incentive program. This appropriations is a good start in the right direction on technology transfer.",

I thought it might be appropriate to bring the matter to the attention of the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina.

Mayor Hogan informs me that after recently receiving a letter from the director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance concerning the application process for fiscal year 1997 funds. and while filling out the fiscal year 1997 application. village officials discovered that 1996 funds had been available to them. They had never been notified. A Bureau official then told them that some requests for applications had been sent to incorrect addresses. Village officials contacted the supervisor of the nearby Town of Owego. who remembered receiving the application notice meant for the village. However. the application deadline passed 9 months ago. The village lost out on $10.840 through no fault of its own. Mr. President. $10.840 may not seem to be a large sum these days. but for the Village of Owego it is. It constitutes threequarters of 1 percent of the village tax base. If threequarters of 1 percent of the total Federal receipts for 1998 were at stake. we would be talking about $11.7 billion. and that would have our attention.

I will not. however. see fit to Impede further movement toward a balanced budget. The budget agreement Is a product of compromise which Is the hallmark of our great democracy. I cannot help but remember 1993. when the Democrats. without the support of a single Re. publican. passed the budget plan which cut the deticit and provided a solid framework for the economic expansion we currently enjoy. While we would have appreciated some Republican support. I recognize the need to move past malevolent politics and engage constructively with my colleagues In a biparbsan effort to solve a national problem. We have i backward.

I also have serious reservations about a proposal to index the capital gains lax cut which has the potenflat to empty the U.S. Treasury. Soon after this we will have to work through the reconciliation process to ensure that we move In a lair and equitable way to accomplish our purpose ot a balanced budget.

I want to point out that this Budget will bring American families significant tax relief for the first time in 16 years. Weve tinkered around with the Tax Code in the past. But that was mostly just redistributing who pays the tax. This Budget will lead to tax cutsSO5 biliion over 5 years. This will be tax relief on capital gains that provides incentives for economic growth. We will have relief from the death tax. We will have relief from the high costs of college education. And most Importantly. we will have tax relief for families with children. Further. this agreement preserves Medicare. There are no cuts In Medicare in this budget. Medicare spending continues to grow. All we are trying to do Is to slow the growth in Medicare spending to ensure thaI It will be available not lust for our current elderly citizens. but luture generations as well. It does that while continuing to increase spending on each beneficiary in each of the 5 years. Federal spending per beneficiary which Is $5.480 this year will rise to over $6.900 in the year 2002. Total spending on Medicare also rises from $209 billion this year to $280 billion in 2002. This budget estimates taxpayers will save $115 billion through these efforts to control the growth of Medicare spending. Im glad that the President has decided to support this Budget which will preserve Medicare for the future. I do want to note that while this package. that the President supports. saves $115 billion. It Is almost identical in savings to the $118 billion in savings over 5 years that would have been achieved had the President decided not to veto the Balanced Budget Act In I applaud the President for now agreeing to preserve Medicare by now supporting virtually the same Medicare preservation package he dedded just 2 years ago.

Mr. Chairman. we believe that the $711 million allocated for the building of new prisons and Jails in the committee budget could be put to better use by stressing the treatment and prevention programs. The CDC budget increases our investment in more local community prevention programs. such as mentoring. parental training. truancy prevention. gang intervention. and comprehensive educational services for atrisk youth. so fewer of our children will become involved in the juvenile justice system in the first place. and fewer crimes. fewer victims. and a decrease in taxpayer money spent on prisons will be the direct result. The CBC budget also includes an increase In the budget for the Legal Services Corporation. which will allow equal access to justice for all Americans. not just those who can independently afford it. The CBC alternative also addresses understaffing at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. which requires Increased Federal funding to eliminate its backlog in order to make employment opportunities accessIble to countless more American men and women who lose those opportunities because of illegal discrimination.

Export controls on encryption and on other products serve a clearly defined purposeto protect our nations security. The Intelligence Committee believes that the effects on U.S. national security must be the paramount concern when considering any proposed change to encryption export policy. and the Committee will seek referral of any legislation regarding encryption export policy under its jurisdiction established under Senate Resolution 400. With our ongoing investigation into the possible technology transfers to China. the Vice Chairman and I are also concerned that any effort to change U.S. export policy on encryption be consistent with the export policy review included in our investigation. Export restrictions on encryption products assist the Intelligence Community in its signals intelligence mission. By collecting and analyzing signals intelligence. U.S. intelligence agencies seek to understand the policies. intentions. and plans of foreign state and nonstate actors. Signals intelligence plays an important role in the formation of American foreign and defense policy. It is also a significant factor in the U.S. efforts to protect its citizens and armed forces against terrorism. the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. narcotics trafficking. international crime and other threats to our nations security. While the Committee recognizes the commercial interest in easing or removing export restrictions. it believes the safety of our citizens and armed forces should be the predominant concern when considering U.S. policy towards the export of any product.

I am convinced that the best approach during this session is to deal with these matters in separate bills. Let me say again. that in order to pass legislation on both of these issues during this Congress. we must recognize that there are significant differences between these important and complex policy issues. Digital signature and certificate authority have appeared in various proposals in association with encryption. However. these matters need to be considered separately because they raise different questions and complications. A digital signature is a technical method for authenticating the identity of a sender or author. As its name implies. it is a digital version of a persons written signature. Encryption is a means to ensure confidentiality. It is a set of algorithms used to scramble and unscramble text in order to keep unauthorized persons from reading your computer data and messages. It is a technology that protects medical. business. and individual files from invasion. Again. encryption for confidentiality. and digital signatures for authentication and related certificate authorities. are not the same issue. Dealing with encryption and digital signatures in one piece of legislation could lead to the demise of such a weighted bill. Consequently. I am prepared and committed to moving separate bills dealing with these issues during this session. I urge my colleagues to support this dual track approach as my colleagues have recommended. I share the belief that this is the best chance for legislation to be passed in both of these areas during the 105th Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I introduce legislation to authorize the Interior Department to enter into an agreement with the nonprofit Gateway Visitor Center Corporation for the construction and operation of the Gateway Visitor Center in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. This legislation is needed because the Visitor Center will provide some services which are beyond the scope of existing National Park Service statutory authority at the Park. As a result. I am advised that construction may not begin until this bill is enacted. I have worked with the National Park Service and the Gateway Visitor Center Corporation to develop this bill and note that similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen JON Fox and ROBERT BORSKI. The bill also has the strong support of Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell. The Gateway Visitor Center is part of the revitalization of Independence Mall and is critical to creating an outstanding visitor experience. It will serve as the gateway into the Park and will orient visitors as to the rich history of the National Historical Park. the city of Philadelphia. and the region as a whole. I was pleased to assist in obtaining funds in the TEA21 Act for the road and infrastructure improvements necessary for the redevelopment of the Independence Mall and would note that the Senate FY99 Interior Appropriations bill also includes funding for this project. The legislation is necessary because. in addition to its role as the Parks primary visitor center. the Gateway Visitor Center will be permitted to charge fees. conduct events. and sell merchandise. tickets. and food to visitors to the Center. These activities will allow the Gateway Visitor Center to meet its parkwide. citywide and regional missions while defraying the operating and management expenses of the Center. The Gateway Visitor Center holds enormous potential for Independence National Historical Park and the greater Philadelphia region as a whole. and I urge my colleague to support this legislation.* By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself. and Mr. DAMATO):",

Jr. Post Office Building.\" Jerry Ambros life was one dedicated to serving the people of New York. A Brooklyn native. he was educated in the New York City public schools and was graduated from New York University. After a twoyear stint in the United States Army. he began working for the Town of Huntington. New York. He went on to serve on the Suffolk County Board of Supervisors and was elected Town Supervisor of Huntington for four terms. First elected to Congress in 1974. in the wake of President Nixons resignation. Jerry Ambro was a leader among leaders. He served as the chairman of the 82member New Members Caucus. a reformminded group that instituted campaign finance reform and new procedures for selecting committee chairmen. The Caucus aided in deposing three committee and subcommittee chairmen. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment. he fought to protect the environment. He prevented the Long Island Lighting Company from converting from oil to coal and he preserved wetlands in Massapequa. As Town Supervisor. he enacted one of the first municipal bans on DDT. Following his years in Congress. he went on to serve ably as the Washington lobbyist for thenGovernor Hugh L. Carey. He died in 1993 from complications from diabetes. I am pleased to introduce this bill today to name a post office after such a distinguished New Yorker. Congressman GARY L. ACKERMAN has introduced a similar measure in the House. That it has the support of the entire New York delegation demonstrates how widely admired Jerry Ambro was. I urge the swift passage of this legislation. Mr. President.

The very fact of the stamp will help to raise the consciousness of women to go for a mammogram. and the voluntary funding mechanism is most important. We have already gotten some considerable distance on breast cancer simply by raising the consciousness of women to go and get a mammogram. We now see rates falling. including rates for AfricanAmerican women which were rising steadily before. But. Mr. Speaker. we have got to move on to the next important plateaus. and those are prevention and research. We have a whole set of notions about how we may go at prevention. but none of them has been proven. We are told about lifestyle and environmental factors. We are told to do aerobics. We are told that diet has an effect. that alcohol consumption. that obesity. that chemical hazards and radiation have an effect. but nobody knows because the research is yet to be done. With this research at the National Institutes of Health and in the Department of Defense. we would look to such areas as the contribution to breast cancer made by the environment. by hormones. by genes. We would look at areas still to be uncovered. such as the role of accessibility and delivery of medical care to underserved populations. We would look at gene therapy and vaccines and chemotherapeutics. We would look at the susceptibility of various groups of women and why. Until we do that. we will not be able to conquer this disease. We have gone very far with cervical cancer because of research.

The stamp is a tribute to those who have survived breast cancer and those who have not. More likely than not. each one of us. if we havent already. will come face to face with the tragedy of breast cancerthrough a mother. daughter. wife. grandmother. niece. aunt. or neighbor. Every time a book of stamps is purchased at the post office. people will be reminded of the urgency for early detection of breast cancer in order to save millions of womens lives. Unfortunately. increasing public awareness and educating women about the importance of early detection and diagnosis is not enough. We must do more. According to the National Cancer Institute. Nassau and Suffolk Counties rank first and fourth respectively. in breast cancer mortality rates among the 116 largest counties in the United States. Research is a valuable and indispensable instrument in trying to understand this devastating disease. Right now on Long Island. the National Cancer Institute is conducting a $15 million study examining the environmental effects that may be factors in breast cancer in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Yet. we must do more. H.R. 1585 builds upon the success of the Breast Cancer Awareness Stamp. by authorizing a 2year demonstration project to offer the public a new way to fund research for breast cancer by raising money through specially designed U.S. postage stamps. The stamps will be offered for purchase as an alternative to regular firstclass postage. Seventy percent of the funds raised by this bill will be directed to the National Institute of Health and the remainder to the Department of Defense solely for the purpose of breast cancer research. Mr. Speaker. too many of our mothers. daughters. and sisters have been afflicted with this destructive disease. We must do more. and I urge my colleagues to vote today to stamp out breast cancer forever.",

Breast cancer is an especially horrific disease that attacks one out of eight women in the United States. With these numbers. almost no family in the United States is immune from this disease that kills thousands each year. Too many of our mothers. sisters. and daughters each year suffer from the ravages of this disease. Nearly 45.000 women will die this year from breast cancer alone. with more than 180.000 new cases diagnosed. In Texas. 2.800 women will die. and we will add 11.500 new breast cancer cases to the rolls. We have made progress in recent years. in early detection. diagnosis. and treatment. But we are too far from adequate treatment and too far from a cure. We need to make cancer research. and breast cancer research in particular. a priority. This bill would provide an innovative. new source of badly needed funding for breast cancer research for a 2year demonstration period. The Postal Service would create a new postage rate for firstclass mail as an alternative to the regular rate. and customers would have the choice of buying either. The Postal Service would distribute 70 percent of the revenues raised to the National Institutes of Health and 30 percent to the Department of Defense breast cancer research program. These moneys will not displace any other funding. I support this effort and urge passage of the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act. My hometown of San Antonio is a growing cancer research center. where doctors and researchers work with brave. valiant women to improve treatment and further our understanding of breast cancer.

It is a distinction that this body makes all the time in favor of the most vulnerable and the least likely to take advantage of Federal fund opportunities. These are the women who are most likely to have been tracked into lowwage jobs. We can untrack them and undo that discrimination by allotting a very small portion of these funds for them. Why go to that trouble? Why not use what is already in the bill? The reason is that there is no question but that these funds. like most Federal funds. are likely to go disproportionately to the besteducated and the most conscious. those who understand their rights and the availability of funds. Those happen not to be displaced homemakers. single pregnant women. or single parents. This body has a vested interest in the Mink amendment because these are the women most likely to cost the government the most. because these are the women most likely to be dependent and the women least armed with education and experience. We make distinctions of this kind all the time. and ought to continue to make them. Constantly. Mr. Chairman. I see Federal opportunities getting to people who would get them anyway. We need to make it impossible to spend a certain amount of this money. this small amount. except for the most vulnerable. Nothing guarantees that except the Mink amendment.

The whole notion of setaside is the same way of saying we hold harmless at the same rates that we had already. 10.5 percent for these programs. These programs have proven themselves effective. For instance. in 1996. there was a GAO study entitled \"Employment Training: Successful Projects Share Common Strategy.\" stating that these programs are very effective indeed in moving people from welfare to work.

In this way. Mr. Chairman. this bill actually protects the funds going into programs for women. The Mink amendment. however. would mandate that States set aside funds for local areas to maintain genderbased programs even where they might not be needed. For example. Washington State is due to receive more than $19 million for vocational educational spending under title II and title III of the Carl D. Perkins Act. 90 percent of which will go directly to the local level.

ESTEBANs legislative achievements stand out because they address the concerns of average Americans who dont have the clout in Washington to make themselves heard. When concems were raised that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would degrade the quality of life on the Mexican/American border and take jobs from lowerincome working Americans. ESTEBAN worked hard to find a solution. He sponsored an innovative proposal that led to the creation of the North American Development Bank (NADBank). a binational institution that provides loans to improve the environment along the border and to create jobs for Americans adversely affected by NAFTA. ESTEBAN has long devoted himself to measures that would strengthen environmental protections. He led the fight to address the problem of groundwater pollution in the San Gabriel Basin and worked to craft a widely supported agreement to clean it up. He worked to close to toxic chemical dump in West Covina. And. he has been the champion of legislation to recycle used oil. tires. and batteries. When he led the effort for the World Cup commemorative coin. ESTEBAN obtained an additional public benefit by ensuring that ten percent of the proceeds be set aside for scholarships for Latino students. And. when he was a member of the Banking Committee. he sponsored the TruthInSavings legislation that give consumers the right to information in readable language about banks interest rates. yields. and fees. ESTEBAN also has a strong record on international human rights. He sponsored the Cuban Humanitarian Trade Act. which recognizes the failure of U.S. policy toward Cuba and would exempt food. medicine. and medical supplies from the Cuban trade embargo. ESTEBANs efforts in Congress have been guided by firm principles and compassion. It has been a privilege to serve with him and I wish him and his family all the best as he begins this new phase in his life.",

In the last five years. first time teen (1217) heroin use has risen a mind boggling 875%. and according to latest DEA seizure and street buy data. 75% of that heroin now comes from Colombia. So while the Administration slept. the Colombian narcotraffickers shifted gears and took over the former Asian dominated U.S. heroin market with cheaper. purer and more deadly South American heroin. The Washington Times outlined the recent U.S. move towards South American heroin in its edition yesterday in a extensive and comprehensive piece called \"Cocaine Cartels Take on New ProductHeroin\". The article notes this Colombian heroin on the streets of the U.S. approaches (according to DEA) 70% to 80% purity. while the average of other heroin is only 39% purity. Our DEA. FBI and Customs Service agree that the best place to fight drugs is at the source. and in this case. its the high Colombian Andes fields of opium poppy. which the native people call the \"devils flower\". Sadly. the Times piece also notes that in nearby Prince Georges county here in the Washington area. we have witnessed 42 persons who died last year form heroin overdoses. Whats happening abroad. also has consequences here at home. From the front lines in the high Colombian Andes the news isnt any better. The CNP without high performance helicopters needed to reach the opium poppy fields with enough troops to secure the area for later aerial eradication is seeing more and more poppy. In 1997. according to some Colombian sources we may have had a 1/3 increase in Colombian opium growth. and at best we are only eradicating 1/3 of the small but ever growing and valuable poppy crop. All this means hard times and more overdose deaths in our communities from deadly Colombian heroin. Mr. Speaker. I request that the Washington Times article dated 10/12/98 I referenced be included at this point in the RECORD: [From the Washington Times. Oct. 12. 1998]",

This country was founded on the principles of freedom of religion. and in over 200 years of history we have not only survived but thrived. This resolutions calls for the President to assert the concern of the United States Government against such discrimination. to emphasize that the United States regards the human rights practices of the German Government as a significant factor in the relationship between the two countries. and to encourage other governments to appeal to the Government of Germany in efforts to protect the rights of foreign citizens and members of minority religious groups in Germany. Germany is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. and the Helsinki accords. and is therefore obliged to refrain from religious discrimination and to foster a climate of tolerance. It is important for the Congress to make its views known with regards to human rights by our adversaries. but especially by our allies. Religious freedom should be a basic right of all people regardless of their faith or nationality.

But to pass this legislation to single out this kind of religious persecution in the face of what we know is happening all over the world turns our back on people who are in prison tonight. turns our back on people who are in slave camps tonight. turns our back on people whose lives have been given up over the issue of taxation.

We are simply using many. many examples whereby minority religions. again this is much broader than Scientology. are persecuted in Germany. We are asking for them to reaffirm a position. simply to reaffirm their position which their Constitution states. and that is that they endorse religious tolerance in the country of Germany. Yes. they are an ally. and yes we treasure that relationship. but we ought to be able to go to them and tell them the things which trouble us.

I find the language in this resolution quite strong. particularly when it talks about a German fostering an atmosphere of intolerance toward certain minority religious groups. Then it goes on to say the resolution expresses concerns that artists from the United States. members of minority religious groups. continue to experience German Government discrimination. Now. I fail to see how the German government is somehow behind these boycotts of certain movies.

While that concept has come to mean many things to different people. this resolution. by highlighting the principles of political freedom. human rights. and the free market. establishes the appropriate framework for the involvement of our Nation. I believe our Government should strongly encourage our talented academic community and our private sector. the most productive in the world. to actively participate in this trade exposition. The amendment we made In committee made it clear that the Governments role is solely one of encouraging efforts in the private sector to participate. and no government funds would be spent. Accordingly. I urge our colleagues to fully support this resolution.",

I know that one of the first questions I asked was how is the United States participating in Hannover 2000. and what is the United States role going to be? If we are a world power and we are an economic power. then we have to be fully involved in these significant economic events. Let me also urge each Member to go back and talk to your State Department of Development or Commerce. or whatever it is. to find out the balance of trade with Germany and the European nations and they will find out that one of the fastest growing areas. both in investment and in exports that is selling United States goods to another nation is in Germany. So. once again. this is an excellent opportunity. as the people from both sides of the aisle have pointed out. to showcase our products to the world. not just Germany where it is being held. of course. but to the world. So if I had my way. I would actually have us participating more than we probably are in terms of taxpayers possibly being involved as well. but the important thing is that the private sector fully be involved. that we send a message that the United States is fully committed. and that we encourage the fullest amount of U.S. participation.",

As the gentleman from Nebraska indicated. I am Chairman of the Congressional Study Group on Germany for 1997. I am proud to rise in support of this resolution. The resolution provides an important congressional endorsement of Expo 2000 and. as an original cosponsor. I am hopeful that my colleagues will support this resolution. The Expo. to be held in Hannover. Germany. will provide an important opportunity for the international community to discuss solutions to problems we will be facing in the 21st century. including global climate change. sources of energy. population growth. and development. Given Americas leading position in the development of technology and our problemsolving capabilities. I applaud the Presidents announcement of American participation in the Expo 2000. This resolution will provide another voice of support to American academic and private sector involvement in the Expo. Given the dramatic progress this Congress has made in balancing the budget and promoting fiscal responsibility. I think it is important to note that no Federal funds will be used to support American participation in this Expo. While this was the clear intention of the resolution when introduced. I applaud the gentleman from New York for introducing an amendment in the committee process that makes this absolutely clear. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to all of the Bundestag colleagues I have gotten to know over the past year.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise against the FoxSkaggs amendment. The committees recommendation for energy conservation is over $630 million. This is an increase of 14 percent above the 1996 level. By comparison. the other Department of Energy programs in the bill. fossil energy research. Strategic Petroleum Reserve operations and the Naval Petroleum Reserve operations have been decreased by 34 percent since 1996. The General Accounting Office has been monitoring the use of funds in the Energy Conservation Program and reports that there is more than $265 million in funding appropriated in prior years for energy conservation programs that is yet to be spent by DOE. That is on top of the $630 million recommended by the committee for fiscal year 1999. I know there are those who say that fossil energy research is bad. but energy conservation and energy efficiency research is good. Let me remind my colleagues that traditional fossil fuels will continue to account for the vast majority of our energy needs for the foreseeable future. Improved technology for extracting and using fossil fuels will do more to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions than most of the programs funded under the energy conservation account. The advanced turbine system program has great potential for improving efficiency and lowering emissions. The portion of this program that has traditionally been funded in the energy conservation account receives great support. however. the portion traditionally funded in the fossil energy account does not. That just does not make sense. Again. we have that old false argument: fossil is bad. conservation is good. The fossil energy research program. the Strategic Petroleum Reserve operation and the Naval Petroleum Reserve operation have all tightened their belts. They are focused. they have streamlined their operations and substantially reduced their appropriations requirements over the past 3 years. On the other hand. the energy conservationists have displayed an attitude that \"we want to continue to do everything we have done in the past. and any new programs that require more funding.\" That attitude is unacceptable. Mr. Chairman. the committee has done the responsible job of providing funding for energy conservation programs. The proposed offsets to increase energy conservation funding are totally unacceptable. and I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" and defeat this amendment.",

That is a serious consideration. and we are in a more competitive economic environment. which makes efficiency of the essence. These conservation programs take a sensible approach to addressing those needs. They do not mandate any actions. they underwrite efforts that create new methods to save energy. help get those methods put into practice. and particularly important. help poor Americans take advantage of these methods. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to do what they have done in the past and restore funding for these important programs. Let me commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fox). particularly.

However wellintentioned. the gentlemens turbine research offset is unfortunate. In 1992. the Federal Government entered into a commitment with the Nations gas turbine developers to develop a new generation of turbine. It would break through the temperature barriers that limit todays turbines. it would be more efficient. it would be more economical. and it would be much cleaner. so clean that it could be placed in the most environmentally constrained regions of the country. Together. government and industry took the risk. and it is about to yield terrific results. The United States is on the verge of having turbine technology that no competitor can touch. In the coming year. the first prototypes will be assembled. In the year 2000 they will be tested. fulfilling the governments 1992 commitment. By 2001. the United States will be building and using a turbine that will be superior to any other in the world. Once that is done. our Nation will have a large share of what is expected to be a huge and growing market for advanced turbine technologies. As the program has progressed. the developers who moved forward have been expected to pick up larger and larger shares of the costs. As the concepts have matured. industrys costsharing has exceeded 60 percent. Although industry now provides the major funding. our governments commitment must be honored. If Congress withdraws its support. U.S. leadership in this field will be jeopardized. It is possible the program can be completed without government backing. but no one knows how long that would take. and we would run the risk of having this program caught up. passed up by foreign competition. But if we honor our commitment. when the program is completed. we will have the best turbine in the market. Government support is still a critical part of this program.

Last week. the Asian Longhorn beetles were found infecting a dozen blocks in the Ravenswood neighborhood in Chicagos North Side in my congressional district.

Mr. Chairman. we in this country are dependent upon research and development in our fossil fuel program. We have a tremendous problem in this country in that we are dependent upon foreign oil. My colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . highlighted that a few moments ago. In the United States we purchase 6.8 billion barrels of oil per year. Half of that is imported. That situation is probably only going to get worse with the recent discovery of oil in the Caspian Sea. We should not be reducing research and development into our fossil fuel program. we should be increasing it. We now have the technology to convert coal and waste coal into liquid fuels. however. that needs to be perfected. As was mentioned many times during the debate on the last amendment. we have between 300 and 500 million years of coal reserves right here in the United States. That is more In coal reserves than the rest world has in oil reserves. I ask my colleagues to think about that. Mr. Chairman. if we are going to be dependent upon our coal reserves. we need to invest in research and development so we can perfect technologies that we already know and so we can be looking into the next century to find alternative uses for the huge coal deposits that we have in this country. LI 1630 I am very proud to represent northeastern Pennsylvania. where we have the largest anthracite coal deposit in North America. arguably the largest deposit in the world. It is a high Btu. low sulfur fuel that we cannot continue to turn our backs on by reducing the investment in research and development in fossil fuels.

I commend the Senator for being attentive to the needs of his State. It is exactly what he should be doing. I have been there myself.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that will help ensure that States live up to their responsibility to give full faith and credit to protective orders issued In other States. In the 1994 Crime Act. as part of the Violence Against Women Act. Congress passed a provision requiring States to enforce the protection orders issued in sister States. What this means. Mr. President. is that If a woman has secured a protective order against her husband In New Jersey. and then goes to Pennsylvania to stay with her parents and her husband follows her. Pennsylvania is obligated to enforce the Now Jersey protective order. This is common sense. it will protect the lives and wellbeing of countless threatened women. and is the law. However. for some reason States have been disregarding their legal obligation to enforce these orders. Mr. President. It seems that the only way to get the States to live up to this obligation is to threaten some of their Federal funding. Accordingly. the bill I am introducing today allows the Attorney General to withhold I0 percent of all formula Byrno grant crime fighting funds given to a State if it is failing to enforce outofState protective orders. Although I believe that these funds are an important crime prevention and crime fighting tool. It has become clear that there must be some merhanism to ensure that States live up o their responsibilities to victims of domestic abuse. Mr. President. violence against women Is one of our countrys most heinous and pressing crimes. Every 12 seconds a woman Is battered. About 10 times more women are victimized annually by domestic violence than are diagnosed with breast oaucer. Those figures reflect only reported crimesthe actual incidence rates are even higher. According to the FBI. domestic vielence is the single most common source of injury among women ages 10 to 44. more common than auto accidents. muggings. and rape by a stranger combined. Protective orders are an important device in combating domestic violence. and protecting women who have already been battered from further harm. But they are only effective if they are enforced. So. Mr. President. I hope my colleagues ill support the bill. and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Rcoito.",

April 25. the Senate passed by voice vote the Senior Citizens Items Equity Protection Act which will enable the Department of Housing and Urban Development to protect seniors against aggressive and unethical practices by firms who charge senior homeowners exorbitant fees for obtaining a home equity conversion mortgage. I was not able en that day to voice my support for this legislation. and I want to do so today. I commend Senator DAMAIo and the other cosponsors of this legislation for their swift and timely action on this Important piece of legislation. I also want to thank Secretary Cuomo for bringing the problem which this legislation addresses to our attent4on. The FHA home equity conversion mortgage program. implemented In 1989. has given 20.000 senior homeowners the opportunity to turn the valuable equity in their homes into direct cash payments. This borrowed equity can be used to satisfy any number of needs. and in the case of seniors. esalating medical costs colliding with fixedincomes often make additional financial resources a necesity. Seniors who obtain reverse mortgages have median Incomes of only $10.400. The ability of lowincome seniors to access their home equity and increase their incomes Is essential for enabling many seniors to continue living in their own homes. This legislation is necessary to protect vulnerable seniors who have been unscrupulously targeted by certain estate planning services who charge fees of 6 to 10 percent of the cost of the reverse mortgage loan. Many homeowners are simply unaware that the process of receiving a reverse mortgage through the Department of Housing and Urban Development Is actually free. HUD recently revealed that soniors have been bilked for thousands of dollars by unregulated companies that have taken a Federal program intended to serve one of our most vulnerable populations and used it for exploitation and financial gain. . 5 2 will provide important safeguards for seniors by requiring that the mortgagor receives fuil disclosure of any costs pertaining to the origination of a reverse mortgage. Additionally. the Secretary of HUJD will be empowered to Impose restrictions and prohibit firms from charging excessive fees. Again. I would like to extend my am precation to Senator DAMAO and the rest of my colleagues for their swift action that will ensure senior homeowners will be no longer be victimized by exploltive reverse mortgage tacties.",

I have sought recognition to thank Chairman BOND for his inclusion of funding within the Economic Development Initiatives account for three important projects in Pittsburgh. WilkesBarre. and Philadelphia. Pennsylvania that I requested. The conference report also includes $2 million for the City of Pittsburgh to redevelop the LTV site in Hazelwood. Pennsylvania. These funds can be used by the city to clean up and prepare the site for eventual reuse. One possibility being contemplated in the area is an effort to attract the Sun Oil Company to build a new coke facility which create hundreds of new jobs. I am pleased that we have been able to increase the level of funding in the bill from $750.000 to $1 million for the downtown revitalization project in WilkesBarre which is also a top priority for Mayor Tom McGroarty and Congressman PAUL KANJORSKI. I am also pleased that the conference report includes $50.000 for a project in Central and South Philadelphia. which is plagued with an average annual family income of $7.600. a 45 percent unemployment rate. and a 50 percent high school dropout rate. These funds are intended to provide initial resources for the development of a job training and business center to generate employment in this section of Philadelphia. The renewal project is spearheaded by Universal Community Homes. a notforprofit community development corporation which has a strong presence in the city. and which has received grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for housing and other initiatives which are geared toward improving the quality of life for lowincome families. In January of this year. I had the opportunity to visit Universal Community Homes to tour their facilities. More importantly. I met with individuals who directly benefit from the programs and services delivered by Universal Community Homes. Members of the media and community leaders were also present to bring to my attention that the South Central Philadelphia sections of the city are in critical need of a job training and business center.

I would ask my friend Senator MACK for a clarification of the provision included in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 which will grant residents a voluntary option to choose a flat rent. Several clarifying provisions have been added to the legislation to protect residents and reduce the administrative burden of such a choice on housing authorities. First. residents will be protected from being coerced into making a choice of rents which is adverse to their interest. Second. in the case of a financial hardship. residents are granted the right to an immediate change to the Brooke Amendment rent. which caps rent at no greater than thirty percent of income. Mr. President. the Act also specifically provides that no additional administrative burden be placed on housing authorities that already administer flat rent or ceiling rent systems. If an agencys present system allows the family the opportunity to annually request a change from an incomebased system to a flat or ceiling rent system. or viceversa. the fact that rent is initially determined by an existing computer system which automatically selects the lower rent should not be considered contrary to the requirements of the Act.

I would like to ask Senator MACK his view of the provisions of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 that relate to the renewal of expiring tenantbased Section 8 contracts. I am greatly heartened by the inclusion of specific terms for the renewal of expiring Section 8 tenantbased contracts. The renewal terms included in the Act will ensure that housing authorities continue to receive full funding to maintain effective Section 8 assisted housing programs. The Acts renewal provision will address a number of problems which have arisenincluding a very serious potential threat to affordable housing in my home State of New Yorkas a result of HUDs attempt to revise its method of funding renewals. Under the renewal terms of Section 556 of the Act. housing authorities will be ensured that they receive full funding to maintain their current obligations and continue to reissue turnover vouchers. without any attrition or loss of assistance. Housing authorities in New York will be able to continue to assist thousands of new families each yearparticularly the homeless and victims of domestic violence. Without the changes included in this legislation. the New York City Housing Authority alone could have suffered a loss of over 7.000 vouchers over the next few years. This potential catastrophe has been averted. To be more specific. Section 556 establishes a baseline for maintaining current Section 8 obligations. This baseline is to be calculated by taking into account the number of families which were actually under lease as of October 1. 1997 plus any incremental units or additional units authorized by HUD after that date. It is the explicit intent of the authors of this legislation that the units approved by HUD pursuant to its April 1. 1998 Notice shall be included in the definition of \"additional families authorized.\" Finally. HUD shall apply an inflation factor to the baseline which takes into account local factors such as actual increases in local market rents.

In addition. housing authorities with urgent or serious crime needs are protected and will be assured an equitable amount of funding. Mr. President. the intent of these provisions is to provide more certain funding for agencies with clear needs for funds and to assure that both current funding recipients and other agencies with urgent or serious crime problems are appropriately assisted by the program.

There is a need to act since the construction deadline for the project expired in January of 1996 and FERC has terminated the license. Unless Congress acts. the town of Telluride will lose its investment in this project. and we do not want that to happen. H.R. 2217 would reinstate the license and extend the construction deadline by 6 years. According to the town of Telluride. the sponsor of the project. construction has not commenced because of delays in obtaining a special use permit from the U.S. Forest Service. and a dredge and fill permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Because of that. Telluride lacks the power of sales for the contract. I feel very strongly that this is something that we have to proceed with. As I stated during the consideration of similar legislation that we have dealt with over a period of time. the lack of a power sales contract is the main reason for the construction of hydroelectric projects. and the fact that they have not been able to commence in a timely manner. It is very difficult for a hydroelectric project sponsor to secure financing until such time as they are granted a license and the construction deadline begins to run. Mr. Speaker.

Our children are being constantly nibbled away at with the threat of drugs. drugs in our communities. drugs in our neighborhoods. drugs in our schools. And we have constantly tried to wage this war. Unfortunately. it has been a war that has not been coordinated over the years. a war that policy does not always meet the appropriations. and a war where the public hears a little bit but sees little. It is time for this Congress and this Nation to move forward to lay out a plan to win the war on drugs by the year 2002. to give the American people a solid plan to do this. to coordinate a policy and appropriations so the money goes to the place and gets the job done the quickest and the best. We must raise the level of awareness that there is a serious drug epidemic in our society. This winning the war on drugs resolution takes the initial step to do that by listing the unfortunate facts about drug usage. the associated costs borne by the American taxpayers through drugrelated crime and violence as well as higher medical bills. I am pleased to see that just today the Congress has even pulled the President to the table and spurred him to propose a crime initiative that at its roots claims to target illegal drugs and money laundering. key aspects of the Speakers Task Force for a Drug Free America agenda. This is a step in the right direction. National leaders need to come together. National leaders need to be engaged on this national problem. The resolution also designates the second week of September as Drug Free America Blue Ribbon Campaign Week so every American can join together to protest illegal drugs by wearing a straight blue ribbon. Finally and most importantly for this body. it declares the House commitment to win the war on drugs by deterring demand. stopping supply and increasing accountability. Mr. Speaker.

There are nearly 20.000 drugrelated deaths in our country every year. Vice President AL GORE estimates that the annual societal cost of drugs in our country exceeds $60 billion. Yet the administrations war on drugs is to treat the wounded. spending more than $15 billion on domestic treatment. prevention. and law enforcement. while spending less than $1 billion on the source and transit zone operations where the drugs are grown and transported to American streets and school yards. Clearly. we should not cut the successful demandside programs. rather we should increase the supplyside efforts to a level which is respectable. at a very minimum.

Overall. drug use among 12- to 17yearolds is up 78 percent since 1992. and marijuana use is up 141 percent. America has experienced an explosion in drug use during the last 6 years. And study after study shows shocking levels that were unimaginable just a short decade ago. But these are not just statistics. They are numbers with broken homes and broken lives and destroyed futures. In the last 5 years. we have lost the war on drugs. And I am saddened by the lack of leadership from President Clinton. He has repeatedly sent the wrong message. In his first year. he cut funding for the drug czars office. He reduced funding for drug interdiction. And Federal prosecutions have dropped under this presidency. Keeping drugs out of kids hands is simply not a priority of this President. We are losing too many children to drugs.

My bill. the Family Tax Relief Act of 1997. would provide a $500 per child family tax credit to every middleclass family with children under age 18. The Family Tax Relief Act of 1997 will cut the income tax burden of a family of four earning $30.000 per year 51 percent. and the tax burden of a family earnIng $40.000 by 30 percent. Families earning $75.000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent. The credit is for truly middleclass famillesphaseouts begin to cut or eliminate the credit for families making over $75.000. Fifty million children. from 28 million American families. are eligible for the credit. The credit eliminates the total tax burden for families making less than $23.000. In the last Congress this family tax credit was a part of the Balanced Budget Act that was vetoed by the President. The American people sent us to Washington with a clear mandatereduce the crushing weight of taxes on everyday middleclass American households and cut spending. But one key thing has been left outmiddleclass tax relief. That Is why I am Introducing this legislation today.

They have grown to become leaders in their unions. respected members of their churches and capable and loving parents. State Road Elementary began humbly as a small school. But it grew with the neighborhood. It fit in with the neighborhoods character. State Road Elementary Is located In a neighborhood where family values are strong. These are families that work hard at their jobs. support one another. look out for one another and stand up for what is right. State Road Elementary prepared children to be active and upstanding members of their community. For threequarters of a century. this Parma neighborhood has sent its daughters and sons to start their education at State Road Elementary. I see no reason not to think that another four generations of families will be able to count on State Road Elementary for a healthy start and a head start for their children.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am joining three other Members in introducing a bill to give the President and Congress new. effectiveand constitutional--powers to weed out wasteful Government spending. This bipartisan approach. the \"Expedited Rescissions Act of 1997.\" is being cosponsored by the gentlewoman from New Jersey. MARGE ROUKEMA. the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. JOHN M. SPRATr. JR.. and CHARLES W. STENHOLM. a longtime leader in the fight for a balanced budget. I am very pleased to have their support for this measure. We all know that sometimes a large appropriations bill includes an item that could never pass if it had been considered on its own. Being able to cut that kind of unnecessary spending out of a bill is essential to be prudent in how we spend taxpayer money. to get the Federal budget under control. and to restore public faith in Congress. The lineitem veto was supposed to be a way to deal with that. But while the diagnosis was right. the proposed remedy went too farfurther than the Constitution permits. Thats why its been struck down in court. Our bill is a better prescription--one that will work and that will pass constitutional muster. Under our bill. whenever the President wants to cut a particular spending item In an appropriations bill. he would be able to require Congress to reconsider and vote separately on rescinding that item. under tight deadlines and without amendment. So. like the lineitem veto act. our bill would let the President throw a bright spotlight onto spending items and have Congress vote on them separately. up or down. without changes and in full public view. Since the wasteful spending were trying to get at is the kind of project that would never pass on its own. this process will be a completely reliable an effective way to block that kind of waste ot taxpayer money. Our legislation is patterned after. but stronger than. the enhancedrescission authority passed by the House in 1993. Unlike the 1993 bill. our approach does not let the Appropriations Committee come up with its alternative way to rescind the same amount of money that would be cut by the Presidents proposed rescission. Our legislation requires that the actual rescission proposed by the Presidentthat one. without any amendment. and with no alternative to itbe voted on by the Congress.",

As my colleagues know. the United States has led the world in agricultural production. We have the best producers in the world. We can compete on a level playing field with anyone. any producer. anywhere in the world. Right now things are not very good on the northern plains. We have dry conditions. we have trade imbalances. market failures. and it has created a lot of problems for producers on the northern plains. This bill does not address all those problems. but it does deal with one. and that is the insurance program for our drought conditions. But we cannot continue to compete unless we have research and an investment in research. because it is research that increases the productivity of our farms and ranches. it is how we lower costs. and it is how we increase yields. Frankly it is how we feed America and it is how we feed the world and it is why Americans enjoy the highest living standard in the world. When the last Congress asked U.S. farmers to compete in the world markets. we said that we would help them manage risk with a better insurance program and assure our commitment to an effective crop insurance program. This bill delivers on that promise. We also said that we would invest in research so that we could assure our longterm competitiveness. This conference report delivers on that promise as well. Mr. Speaker. my State leads in agricultural research. At Montana State University. we have research with regard to different grains. At our Agricultural Research Station at Sidney. we are dealing with pest management. At Fort Keogh. we are dealing with increased production for people in the livestock industry. It is research that has increased our production. it is research that will improve our environment. and it is research that will deliver on our standard of living for all Americans.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this Member rises in reluctant support of the conference report for S. 1150. the Agricultural Research Bill. This Member is voting for the conference report because of the urgent need for crop insurance and the importance of agricultural research. However. this Member is strongly opposed to the provision in the bill that reinstates food stamp benefits for legal immigrants. Two years ago. we finally passed major legislation that ended welfare as we knew it. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 contained a provision that barred most legal immigrants from the Food Stamp program. and we need to remember that immigrants are sponsored by American citizens who have agreed to take financial responsibility for their needs during the naturalization process. Too many sponsors have failed in their responsibility. This Member is strongly opposed to the reinstatement of food stamps for legal immigrants that was added to the bill during conference. However. the need to approve crop insurance funding has reached a critical point. Funding is necessary so that our nations farmers have in place a safety net to protect them against the natural disasters which are a constant threat. Allowing crops insurance coverage to lapse would make too many producers vulnerable to the uncertainties cause by weather. The farm bill enacted in 1996 creates more freedom and opportunities for farmers. but it is important for crop insurance to remain in place as a viable option. It is also critically important to reauthorize the agricultural research program. Funding for research offers a longterm and farsighted approach to supporting producers and improving our nations food supply. Clearly. the success of agriculture in the future depends on the research we support now.

The Agriculture Research. Extension and Education Reform Act will give stability to crop insurance programs. boost spending on agricultural research for the first time in 10 years. and provide an additional $100 million for economic development in rural areas. By doing so. the bill will bring jobs to East Texas and improve longterm productivity and profitability for East Texas farmers and ranchers. As government subsidies for agriculture come to an end. crop insurance has become one of the last barriers against financial ruin for farm families. The 1996 farm bill guaranteed crop insurance to our agricultural producers. but without this bill. farmers across the nation face the prospect of crop insurance cancellations as early as this month. In East Texas. there are agricultural producers facing drought conditions in some counties and floods in others. and we cannot deny them the crop insurance they have been promised. I share the relief of every crop producer in East Texas tonight as we pass this bill and ensure the continuation of crop insurance. Equally important is the research component of this bill. providing $600 million over five years in mandatory spending on agricultural research. including funds for the Texas A&M University System across Texas. We have a long history of agricultural research in this country. and it has led to the most productive and most efficient agricultural industry in the world. Continuation of this commitment is vital for Americas farmers and ranchers as agricultural subsidies disappear and global markets become more competitive.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. thank you for the opportunity to speak on this crucial issue. I strongly oppose the rule striking reauthorizing food stamps for legal immigrants in the United States. The rule that has been recommended would set up a ridiculous procedure which gives Republican opponents two extraordinary procedural mechanisms to kill the bill. Under this absurd procedure. the House will not even be allowed to debate the bipartisan conference report. even though the conference report has already been filed and has already been approved by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the Senate. I vote to reauthorize food stamps for those who need them. We must restore food stamps to our 900.000 legal immigrants including farmworkers. Food stamp recipients are refugees. the elderly. disabled Vietnam veterans and children who are facing food and nutritional deficiencies in larger and larger numbers. This year. approximately 600.000 U.S. citizen children with immigrant parents will have less food on their tables because of these cuts. Since food stamp access has been cut. a widening hunger crisis has emerged that private charities and State and local governments have not been able to handle. There simply have not been enough resources to feed all the hungry. Catholic Charities USA. Second Harvest and the U.S. Conference of Mayors have all reported major increases in request for emergency food assistance while food pantries are going empty and are turning people away. In my home State of Texas. 124.000 legal immigrants lost food stamps. 13.090 of these who lost food stamps are childrenl! The State itself is only able to cover approximately 15.000 people under a State program for elderly and disabled during this biennium. The elimination of food stamp benefits for adults without children is calculated to create a mass of people who are desperate to take any job. no matter how poor the wages and conditions. It will serve to intimidate all lower paid workers. a valuable and crucial section of the American workforce. President Clinton singled out these welfare provisions as particularly unfair. and has since. asked for $2 billion to restore benefits to about 730.000 immigrants. Striking this rule would deny almost a million people. old and young. and those contributing as a valuable force to our Nations economy.

I also want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for his efforts. as well. Madam Chairman. the bill before us today. the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act. is important to our Nations children for two major reasons. First. our legislation says that Federal incentive payments to the States for child support should be based on good performance. The better a State does at collecting child support for our children. the more they will get in incentive payments. Regrettably. our current system does not base payments on how well the State actually performs at child support collection. It is time we changed this. and we are doing it in a bipartisan and careful manner. working with child advocates. with the administration and experts from the States and local communities. Second. our bill will help States develop better computer systems that can accurately and efficiently manage State child support programs. These computers play a vital role in helping States collect child support for children. Many States. 32. in fact. have not met the deadlines Congress set in 1988 and there are plenty of reasons why. Partly. in 1988 no one had any idea about how the world of computers would look a decade later. The personal computer on my desk today is as powerful as many statewide computer systems were back in 1988. These things have changed dramatically in the last 10 years. and States rightfully want some flexibility in how those requirements are enforced.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 3130. legislation that will improve child support collection efforts and at the same time save many States from facing a draconian penalty. H.R. 3130 builds on the child support provisions that were included in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act that completely revamped our welfare system. Our new welfare laws ensure that children receive the support that they are due on time and in full by achieving three major goals: By establishing uniform State tracking procedures. by taking strong measures to establish paternity. and funding and ensuring tough child support enforcement. Our new welfare laws enable States to track deadbeat dads who flee across State lines. States will now have directories of new hires with information used to establish paternity. modify and enforce support orders and reduce fraud. and at the same time State information is now being transmitted to the Federal Parent Locator Service for data matched with other States. Cracking down on deadbeat dads has been a priority. Our commitment is strengthened even further through the legislation we are voting on today. We need to recognize under a 1988 law. States face the termination of almost all of their welfare funding if they fail to meet certain deadlines. including October 31 of this year. to implement automated data processing systems for child support collections. This devastating penalty will occur in at least 16 States under current law. including my home State of Pennsylvania. if this legislation is not passed. Let us recognize. H.R. 3130 in no way lets States off the hook. Too often in the past Congress has enacted laws that threaten to penalize States for failing to meet Federal requirements. but backed down when it came time to follow through. Today we are not doing that. This bill strikes the right balance by penalizing States that miss the deadline for establishing effective computer systems while ensuring that these penalties are legitimate and balanced and do not hurt the very children we are trying to help. In my view. the bipartisan Child Support Performance and Incentive Act before us today protects children by improving child support payment requirements and at the same time protects States by creating an alternative penalty system.",

The measure would provide incentive payments to States based on five criteria of performance: establishing paternity. establishing child support orders. collecting current child support. collecting past due child support. and administrating costeffective child support enforcement systems. In other words. the bill clearly encourages States to take all the necessary steps to make sure both parents share in the financial responsibility of supporting the children that are their children. The legislation also revises the penalty on States that have not met the Federal deadline for having a computerized child support system. Establishing. tracking and enforcing child support orders is much more difficult when State caseworkers have to go back again. find out where the files are. go through file boxes to find those files. We have come into the computer age. There is no reason why the child support enforcement system should not be in the computer system. The bill therefore requires States to pay a modest penalty for failing to meet a 10year old automation requirement. I should point out that the Federal Government paid States a 90 percent match to fulfill this mandate. The original deadline elapsed 22 years ago. So I do not think the bill requires States to meet an unreasonable. timetable. Madam Chairman. better child support enforcement means fewer families on welfare. an improved standard of living. I have worked on this situation for years. I know that it is very difficult to get it on the front burner of peoples lives. but I am telling my colleagues. this bill will help children. and it is a very good bill.",

Now we have to go back and teach parental responsibility. The problem that we have. we have got so many of these young adults that are having kids. some of them kids themselves who are having children who have never even lived in a home where there was a male figure. It is disgraceful where this country has gone with the disintegration of the American family. I might say that the next piece of the puzzle in welfare reform is to reverse this trend and go back to the real principles. When we say family values. it should be more than just a political cliche. It should have some real meat to it and something that we all believe in and let us put the emphasis on the family. I compliment the gentleman from Maryland for those remarks.",

I went to the State of North Dakota and evaluated their efforts to bring the new system of child support collection on line. I was terribly concerned that passage of this measure might somehow signal that quickly bringing more rigorous child enforced collection procedures on line would be set back by this legislation. I became convinced of the contrary. North Dakota is making great strides toward meeting the new standards. However. we are not going to meet the deadline. Collections are increasing. We are on track to have an optimal system on line by this summer. If we do not pass this bill. North Dakota will be substantially financially penalized. The resources put into bringing us on line and upgrading our systems will be diverted into dealing with the consequences of the existing penalty. In other words. existing law is not serving a constructive purpose. This law will serve the constructive purpose of encouraging States. like the one I represent. to step up child support collection and to bring these new systems on line as quickly as possible. I commend the State employees in North Dakota that are working so hard to get us there and appreciate very much the Committee on Ways and Means bringing this bill forward.",

This bill builds upon the historic welfare reform legislation that became law two years ago and is proof positive of Republicans long standing commitment to welfare reform. As Chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee. two years ago I worked in tandem with Mr. SHAW. the Chairman of the Ways and Means. Human Resources Subcommittee to deliver a sweeping welfare reform packagea package that truly empowers people to lead more successful and more fulfilling lives. As Republicans. we know that we must attack hopelessness and poverty on several fronts. That is why. the work of our Committee coupled with the efforts of Mr. SHAWS. represented a comprehensive approach to the war on poverty. We poured more money into child care. toughened up the child protection grant. created real work requirements to spur more people to work. and gave States and locals greater flexibility to successfully run their child nutrition programs and State welfare programs. The phenomenal and unexpected rapid decline in the welfare roles points to the success of our approach. However. Republicans commitment to protecting children and improving the welfare system did not end in 1996. We have continued to monitor the implementation of welfare reform to make sure that it is successfully implemented. That is why since the passage of the Welfare reform law. you have seen dramatic improvements in the areas child protection. adoption and foster care signed into law. The bill we have before us today is just another step to making sure we continue to give States and local governments what they need to get struggling families back on their feet.

I am pleased the House of Representative is acting quickly on this legislation which strikes the right balance between encouraging states to modernize their child support systems without penalizing the very children the law is designed to help. While we want to ensure that states have the most efficient mechanism in place to collect and distribute child support payments to families in neet. we must also make certain that the penalties for failure to meet the federal deadlines are not so extreme as to jeopardize funding intended for those same children. My own state of Illinois did not meet the deadline established by the 1988 Family Support Act and if this legislation is not approved today. Illinois will be forced to forfeit $650 million in federal funding for child support services. Child support programs provide vital assistance in locating parents. establishing paternity and collecting child support payments and a large penalty. such as the one facing Illinois. is extreme and serves only to hurt those we seek to help. The bill before us would still impose a penalty of almost $3 million on Illinois but by reducing the penalty and restoring funding for these programs. we can be certain efforts in Illinois will continue to ensure that more deadbeat parents are located and made accountable. After all. collecting financial support from parents is what this effort is all about. As the father of eight children. I find it personally repugnant that so many parents are unwilling to face their responsibility voluntarily and the federal government is forced to continually address the issue of child support enforcement.

Why have we forced this unfunded mandate down on the States and. in effect. have raised taxes on the people In the States without them really realizing it?

That is the purpose of this account. This account leverages far more money into the pockets of workers than it costs us in the first place. and that is why it should not be diminished one dime.",

Yet you will cut that off. In the wage and hour. they look at DavisBacon. You are always complaining about DavisBacon and how unfair it is. What this division does is look at DavisBacon. It says where wages are fair and where they are not biased. but what you want to do is you want to talk out of one side of your mouth about cutting back on DavisBacon and yet you want to cut out the money from the Wage and Hour Division that looks at that that will make it fair. This is a direct assault on American working families. It is nothing less than that. Truly. you should be ashamed of coming to the floor with this kind of an effort.

This move by the new British Government demonstrates the further Isolation of the United States from cooperative world efforts which seek to address common problems. The United Kingdom has left its longtime ally. the United States. alone among the industrial nations of the world. as a nonmember of UNESCO. My colleagues may remember that 12 years ago. Great Britain joined with its longtime ally. the United States. and quit the Parisbased U.N. body in a protest orchestrated by the Reagan administration. The decision to quit UNESCO. in this Representatives opinion. reflected the then Reagan and Thatcher governments scom for multilaterallsm and for consensus building. Building upon their distrust of the United Nations. lobbied by such groups as the Heritage Foundation. the Reagan administratlon set In motion a policy of what I call schoolyard diplomacy: You play by my rules or I take my ball home. U.S. supporters of this withdrawal. explained that this move was based upon allegations of inefficiency and Third World bias. Their strategy was to bring about UNESCO reform by denying the organization U.S. dues funding and participation. Those of my colleagues who have followed UNESCO progress know that a brilliant and In. novative new Director General. Federico Mayor brought about the reforms which formed the premise for the withdrawal. You also know that the U.S. response was to remain outside of UNESCO. In spite of the profound changes enacted. The current reason given by the Clinton administration for continuing to remain outside of UNESCO is that \"we dont have the money.\" No world leader believes this contention. The world understands. instead. that the United States has lost its will to participate in the activities which link our educational. scientilic and cultural leaders in common purpose with those o1 the UNESCO members.

I know every dollar counts. and that local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder the everincreasing burden of services the Federal Government no longer provides. That is why I support a moneysaving program for local and State governments. and why I now oppose the TreasuryPostal appropriation. The cooperative purchasing program. which Congress passed into law in 1994. at section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. was designed to allow local and State governments. school districts and public hospitals. to purchase goods and services at a super discount off the Federal rate. saving local taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Unfortunately. some have moved to take this particular program out of the conference report. Here is how the cooperative purchasing program is supposed to work. A school district has to purchase computers. chalkboards. and basic furniture. Thanks to the cooperative purchasing program. the school district could buy the supplies and services it needed directly from vendors at the discounted prices the GSA negotiated. The GSA. as we know. is a procurement agency for the government. These GSAnegotiated prices are often the lowest anywhere. allowing local taxpayers an opportunity to save money. Unfortunately. certain industry groups that benefit from government inefficiency would like nothing more than to have the law repealed. So the pharmaceutical industry wants to see the program repealed. because cooperative purchasing would entitle public hospitals and AIDS clinics to significant discounts on lifesaving drugs. The medical equipment industry is also mobilizing against the discounts. Mr. Speaker. we have a way to reduce the cost of government. It is called the cooperative purchasing program. Today the House will keep this idea and the program alive by rejecting the conference committee report. Let us tell our constituents we want to keep local taxes low and we reject the repeal of the cooperative purchasing program.",

I join with my friend. the gentleman from Ohio in being very disappointed and expressing our disappointment in the fact that this bill has come back from conference that repeals the cooperative purchasing program. which was a program established under Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act in the 103rd Congress. This act allows local governments to buy at a discount items off the GSA schedule that the Federal Government buys and at prices the Federal Government currently pays. This provision could have saved local governments. State and local governments tens of millions. perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Instead of passing this cost down to State and local taxpayers. the Senate. without holding one hearing. has decided to repeal this provision. I am particularly disappointed that the Group 70 schedule. a schedule with over 1.200 vendors. where over 90 percent of the vendors who applied to get on that schedule can get on. was discarded. This is going to cost State and local governments millions of dollars. perhaps billions of dollars over the next decade as they go to acquisitions of information technology. computers. and very complex procedures that take a lot of time to go out with a request for proposal. responses to the proposals. best and final. If they had been allowed to purchase under the Cooperative Purchasing Act. they could have purchased right off the GAOs schedule. could have defined exactly what they wanted. and it would have compressed the acquisition time in a significant manner. and literally would have saved millions of dollars. So I am very disappointed. as is the National Governors Association. the National Association of Counties. the National League of Cities. the Conference of Mayors. and other State and local government organizations who have worked with this Congress over the last couple of years to try to help them bring savings to their taxpayers. as we are trying to do here at the Federal level.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is unfortunate that the most felicity about this bill has been because our pay raise. our COLA increases. are tied to the salaries in this bill. because in actuality that is less of the amount of dollars than we are increasing the IRS. We as Republicans are going around the country right now criticizing the IRS. while we are increasing their dollars here. There are many reasons why we are doing it. but nevertheless. it is rather an inconsistent message. Furthermore. many Republicans went around the country criticizing the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco. and Firearms. and many gun owners around this country have been concerned about their abuses and civil rights abuses. yet we are not only not eliminating ATF. we are increasing ATF. I have great problems with this. as well as with the pay increase. and Members need to know that that is what is tied to this bill. The second major concern I have is the process. It was not that we were not aware that this bill had us tied to the pay increase. it was that there was no rule vote. so we could not object to the rule. The rule. because we could not object to a rule. it meant that we were not allowed to offer any amendment to stop the pay raise. Therefore. the only thing we could do the first time was to vote against this bill the first time it went through. We could not do a motion to recommit or a motion to instruct conferees. because that is left to the minority leadership. so we had a procedural vote. Once again. because it is a conference report. we cannot have a vote in this Congress on the pay raise. I think that is unfortunate. There are a lot of Members. and I realize it is the will of this House. the majority of the Members favor a pay increase. but in fact this is another backdoor way to do it through. and it is unfortunate we did not have a straightforward vote.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would briefly like to respond to a couple of the other things that the gentleman from Indiana spoke about on the IRS. I am very pleased with what we did here with the IRS. There are three increases that are in here for. as the gentleman from Indiana spoke about. Yes. it is an increase for IRS. $377 million of that increase is for Y2K. that is the Year 2000 Compliance. to make sure that the computers are able to handle the shift to the new millennium. I do not think there is anybody that believes that we should have the whole system crash and the IRS not be able to function after the year 2000. That is what this money is in there for. We have funded that completely. There is also $325 million for technology investment. what we used to call the tax system modernization where. we know. money was unfortunately frittered away in past years. So we have gone to a new system where now the money that we put aside for that is going to be fenced. We will not allow one dime of that to be spent until the committees. both the House and Senate. have seen the architectural plan for the spending of that money. There again. I think this is wise management and prudent spending. Finally. for another initiative that this body has said is extraordinarily important. the $138 million for the earned income tax compliance initiative. We heard during the debate recently on the budget about the tremendous abuse of the earned income tax credit. We put in $138 million to enhance compliance and to cut down on the fraud and abuse of the earned income tax credit. For all of those reasons. I think that the money that we have appropriated here. the increased money for the Internal Revenue Service. which. by the way. Is still $204 million below the Presidents request. that that money that is in here is well spent. It has been carefully thought out. It has been worked out very carefully not only with the Internal Revenue Service. but also with the minority side. with the Senate. and I think that we have a very good handle on that money.",

But the fact of the matter is. this effort makes that happen. This is an important initiative. ONDCP. which is the organization that General McCaffrey heads up. as all of you know. the most decorated soldier in America. General McCaffrey heads up the ONDCP. He has organized an effort across the Government to make sure that we maximize our effort to make our communities safe. We provide for monies to go on television. We know that there is nothing that impacts young people in America like television. What this bill does is provide funds so that we can communicate with young people with reference to staying off drugs. as I said earlier. just saying no. That is a critically important effort.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important amendment. As an advocate for Womens Choice I strongly support Representative DEGETrEs amendment. Representative DEGEs amendment will strike the language in the Commerce Justice State Appropriations bill which would prohibit Federal funds from being used for abortions in prison. Abortion is a legal health care option for American women. and has been for over 20 years. Because Federal prisoners are totally dependent on health care services provided by the Bureau of Prisons. the ban. in effect will prevent these women from seeking the needed reproductive health care that should be every womans rightthe right to choose an abortion. We know that most women who enter prison are poor. Many of them are victims of physical and sexual abuse. and some of them are pregnant before entering prison. An unwanted pregnancy is a difficult issue in even the most supportive environs. However. limited prenatal care. isolation from family and friends and the certain custody loss of the infant upon birth present circumstances which only serve to worsen an already very dire situation. In 1993. Congress lifted the funding restrictions that since 1987 had prohibited the use of federal funds to provide abortion services to women in federal prisons except during instances of rape and life endangerment. Women who seek abortions in prison must receive medical. religious. and/or social counseling sessions for women seeking abortion. There must be written documentation of these counseling sessions. and any staff member who morally or religiously objects to abortion need not participate in the prisoners decisionmaking process. There was a 75 percent growth in the number of women in Federal prisons over the last decade. Currently. the growth rate for women is twice that of men in prison. Yet. the rate of infection of HIV and AIDS in women exceeds the rate of infection for men in prison. and pregnant women are of course at risk of passing on this disease to their unborn children. This ban on federal funds for women in prison is another direct assault on the right to choose. This ban is just one more step in the long line of rollbacks on womens reproductive freedoms. We must stop this assault on reproductive rights.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the Degette amendment. which would strike language banning the use of federal funds for abortion services for women in federal prisons. Women in prison have committed criminal activity. and through our judicial system we certainly need to seek appropriate responses to illegal actions. Women in prison are being punished for the crime that they committed. However. this is a separate issue from that which we are addressing. Today we discuss civil liberties and rights which are protected for all in America. and remain so even when an individual is incarcerated. Abortion is a legal health care option for women in America. Since women in prison are completely dependent on the federal Bureau of Prisons for all of their health care services. the ban on the use of federal funds is a cruel policy that traps women by denying them all reproductive decisionmaking. The ban is unconstitutional because freedom of choice is a right that has been protected under our constitution for twentyfive years. Furthermore. the great majority of women who enter our federal prison system are impoverished and often isolated from family. friends and resources. We are dealing with very complex histories that often. tragically. include drug abuse. homelessness. and physical and sexual abuse. Many women are pregnant upon entering the prison system. To deny basic reproductive choice would only make worse the crises faced by the women and the federal prison system. The ban on the use of federal funds is a deliberate attack by the antichoice movement to ultimately derail all reproductive options. As we begin chipping away basic reproductive services for women. I ask you. what is next? Denial of OBGYN examinations and mammograms for women inmates? Who is next? Women in the military. women who work for the government. or all women who are insured by the Federal Employees Health Benefits plan? Limiting choice for incarcerated women puts other populations at great risk. This dangerous. slipperyslope erodes the right to choose. little by little. It is my undying belief that freedom of access must be unconditionally kept intact. therefore. I strongly urge my colleagues to protect this constitutional right for women in America and vote \"Yes\" on the Degette amendment.",

The Midwest HIDTA program has been extremely helpful to cracking down on drug trafficking in my rural state by coordinating federal. state and local law enforcement efforts to combat methamphetamine trafficking.

Iowa. Missouri. Nebraska and Kansas. The amendment will also add North Dakota to the Midwest HIDTA program which is crucial to tightening law enforcements grip on meth traffickers in the area.

This appropriations bill provides $84 million for construction of an annex to the Rogers Courthouse in Denver. The General Services Administration has included this project high on its list of priorities. at the recommendation of the Administrative Offices of the Courts. GSA and the AOC have provided me with detailed information on the costs of this courthouse and assured me repeatedly that these costs are prudent. practical and necessary to meet the future judicial needs of Colorado. I have also been assured that the renovated courthouse will be functional. but not extravagant. I have demanded this of every project on the list and will continue to work to ensure that this standard is applied to all new construction. Members of the Federal bench in Colorado have expressed gratitude that I have included construction money for the Rogers Courthouse. I am of course happy to help meet the needs of our federal legal system. especially in Colorado. In addition to the Rogers Courthouse. this bill contains fourteen other projects totaling almost $500 million. I believe that if Congress is going to pass laws. wed better provide sufficient attorneys and judges to enforce those laws and adequate facilities in which those laws may be administered. I am aware of the growing federal caseload in other parts of Colorado. For example. the City of Grand Junction is experiencing rapid growth. and with that comes a need for more government attorneys and judges. Being from the West Slope. I appreciate the time and expense required to travel to Denver. Traveling 5 or 8 hours to get to a federal court can be a burden to all parties in federal lawsuits. While I am happy to accommodate the wish of the federal bench in Colorado to provide this money.

The Synagogue has been rebuilt. The community Is much larger and men and women now sit together during services. The state of Israel has gone from being a dream to a reality However. much has stayed the same. as bar and bat mitzvahs. weddings and holidays still bring the community together. People continue to join together in faith to celebrate the great milestones of life. And so. Mr. Speaker. I offer my most sin. cere congratulations to Congregation Ahavath Achim. One hundred years together as a community is an important milestone. I join the community In looking forward to the next 100 years",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in March. the House passed H.R. 672. On April 17. the Senate Judiciary Committee reported our companion bill. S. 506. The only substantive difference between the two bills is that S. 506 provides that the reasonable costs of a ratemaking proceeding conducted by a copyright arbitration royalty panel will be split 5050 between the parties who would receive royalties from the royalty rate adopted in the proceeding and the parties who would pay the royalty rate so adopted. H.R. 672 provides that the costs shall be borne by the parties in direct proportion to their share of the distribution. The Copyright Office believes that the House version provides the copyright arbitration royalty panels with greater flexibility in certain circumstances. It is for this reason that the Senate is taking up the House version of the bill. Last year. when the House considered and passed a similar bill. H.R. 1861. it included another section clarifying that the distribution of phonorecords prior to 1978 did not constitute action divesting copyright for the musical composition. This section was intended to clarify the Copyright Law of 1909 on an issue that has become a matter of increasing litigation in a number of Federal Circuits since the Ninth Circuit decision in the ZZ Top case. I was disappointed last year that the Senate did not proceed to consider and pass that bill. We now have that opportunity. The amendment to H.R. 672 adds back into the bill clarifications. which Chairman Hatch and I have cosponsored as part of another measure this year. This improvement will clarify an esoteric but increasingly important point of copyright law under the 1909 Act with respect to copyrights of musical compositions created more than 20 years ago.

Puerto Ricans have valiantly and honorably served in the U.S. Armed Forces and have been involved in every major armed conflict. starting with World War I. Many Puerto Ricans have sacrificed their lives to preserve the goals of the United States. Currently there are 146.000 war veterans residing in Puerto Rico. The number of Puerto Rican men and women serving in the Armed Forces has exceeded the number of soldiers serving from many larger States. The Korean War in particular highlights the noteworthy sacrifices of the people of Puerto Rico. In per capita terms. Puerto Rico ranks second in the Nation with respect to the number of men and women who died in that war. Moreover. the 65th Infantry Regiment. composed entirely of Puerto Ricans. was the most highly decorated regiment in the world. receiving the Presidential Unit Citation. the Meritorious Unit Commendation. two Republic of Korea Presidential Citations. and the Bravery Gold Medal of Greece. Clearly. Puerto Rico has made critical contributions with the blood and sweat of its own to defend democracy and freedom throughout the world. The Puerto Ricans have been diligent in serving the Nation when called. Should not the U.S. Congress be diligent in granting their earned right to selfdetermination? I urge Members to support H.R. 856.",

You would think that the White House would have learned its lesson from the recent race for Governor in Virginia.

I believe Members of Congress should go through the same humiliating exercise.

If the Republicans want to protect the integrity of the voting process in precincts around the country. we should start with the voting process here in Congress.

H.R. 715. is one that I introduced. which now has 65 cosponsors. divided almost equally between Republicans and Democrats. As USA Today said. \"As long as campus courts operate in secret. students committing crimes get a privacy right denied to the rest of adults.\" That is what this bill Is all about. It is about opening up the records of crimes being committed at campuses. A college or university that does not have a crime problem should have no objections to this bill. But parents and students should be allowed to know if certain colleges are lax about law enforcement. Many colleges prefer to discipline student criminals in secret campus courts. They use a warped interpretation of Federal privacy laws to treat these crimes as private academic records that may not be released to the public. No one has any business knowing about a students grades or financial aid records. but it is wrong. however. when the definition of privacy is used to protect rapists and murderers. USA Today summed it up best by concluding \"It is a sad state of affairs when an act of Congress is necessary for the Education Department to protect students safety.\" I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 715. a bipartisan bill that will change the definition of privacy to exclude campus criminal activity.",

The 83 percent increase in stolen cars at Newark Airport means that 83 percent more New Jersey families traveling via Newark Airport are dealing with the possibility that their car will be stolen. Beyond the personal trauma and the hassles of getting their lives back in order. these families will have to bear significant costs.

As a member of that subcommittee. I can assure my colleagues that I will strongly support the \"1800CARFIND\" bill. It sets up a national system to track stolen cars more efficiently. and the bill will return the cars to their rightful owners more quickly. It will provide lower insurance premiums for our families. The rise in car thefts at Newark Airport and the other of our Nations airports is a serious matter. it is a national concern. and it requires a national solution.

It Is incredible that the President. who is fully aware of the impending crisis in Social Security. would propose to hike taxes on the products that American families and businesses use to plan for their own retirements. Millions of American families use this very life insurance product to save for retirement. adding to the supplemental Social Security check that they might receive.

The McDermott amendment continues to fund this project. a project that environmentalists hate. that industry loathes. that private property owners fear. and that very frankly local Forest Service and BLM employees say cannot be implemented. When I go home. and even in work back here. I have had so many Forest Service people say. \"Please dont run this over the top of us. Please dont implement this ICBEMP.\" as they call it. Why do we want to continue to fund a project that is unacceptably overdue. over budget and cannot be implemented? The land managers themselves tell us. \"Please dont implement this. It wont work.\" The problem with this program is that what started out to be a study now will end up to be a superagency. imposing itself over a number of States and imposing restrictions on State water rights and private property rights. It also will lead to a paralysis of analysis in terms of getting our forest plans out. What we can do in this case is to oppose the McDermott amendment. By opposing the McDermott amendment. we empower the local Forest Service and the BLM managers to again use the science and information gathered during this very intensive and extensive multistate project and multiyear project to create customfit solutions instead of forcing them to accept a onesizefitsall Federal fiat that cannot be implemented at all. Do we really want to support an amendment that will lead to more litigation and more gridlock and no improvement in land management? I do not think so. Or do we want results and better managed lands and local solutions? I think we do. It is better for our land and our communities. The McDermott amendment is bad policy and it is bad for the health of our land. I urge the opposition of the McDermott amendment. Please vote \"no.\"",

No less than 4 weeks ago. in the northern part of my district. there was a Habitat Conservation Plan that was agreed to by all the parties. It includes essentially all of the Columbia River north of Wenatchee and including all the tributaries on up to the Canadian border. That is a locally developed plan. I am just suggesting to you that that ought to be a model that we ought to pursue. not only on the river. I hope is done downstream. but also as a model that we can pursue. Because the one thing that we have. I think that you will agree with me. I hope you do. and that is this: One size does not fit all in as diverse an area as we have in the West. There has to be a new way to look at it. The HCP that was agreed to by the PUDs in the northern part of our district. frankly. can be a model. not only on the river. but also in the forested areas. I would hope that defeating the gentlemans amendment would lead to that because this is where the county commissioners are. This is exactly where the county commissioners are in their rejection of the onesizefitsall. That is why I think that with that HCP as a guide. which I say was signed no more than 4 or 5 weeks ago. this could be an opportunity for us.

This Congress has also passed the largest tax decrease in 16 years of $95 billion. While much progress has been made. some still subscribe to the failed budget policies of the past.

This budget proposal assumes the Committee on Veterans Affairs will achieve 5year savings totaling $10.4 billion. of which $10 billion is to be achieved by prohibiting serviceconnected disability compensation for tobaccorelated illnesses. Who are we kidding. here? As all of our colleagues know. and as the Committee on the Budget certainly knows. Congress has already spent the savings associated with this provision. Is there a single Member of this body who does not understand that shortly before the Memorial Day break. Congress included a provision to prohibit serviceconnected disability compensation for tobaccorelated illnesses in H.R. 2400. the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. and the savings associated with that provision have already been spent. to partially pay for the spending authorized by H.R. 2400? As the chairman of the Committee on the Budget knows. the transportation bill is now awaiting the Presidents signature. It will become law within a matter of days. My question to the chairman of the Committee on the Budget is simple and direct: Will he commit to crediting the Committee on Veterans Affairs with achieving this savings directed by House Concurrent Resolution 284. if it reports legislation to prohibit serviceconnected disability compensation for tobaccorelated illnesses? If not. what other veterans benefits does the gentleman from Ohio. the chairman of the Committee on the Budget. want this committee to reduce or eliminate? The Committee on Veterans Affairs has always fulfilled its duty to be responsible and meet the reconciliation targets established for it. Since 1986. in fact. reductions in veterans programs and benefits have resulted in savings to the Federal Government of over $12 billion. That is $12 billion in veterans benefits savings over 13 years. It is irresponsible to call on veterans to give up another $10.4 billion in benefits this year. Americas veterans have already given enough. I cannot and I will not support this antiveteran budget being proposed by the Committee on the Budget.

I introduced this bill in November with my colleagues. Congressman JAY JOHNSON and Congressman TOM LANTOS. Under current law. states are required to report information on missing children to the FBI so that data can be entered into the National Crime Information Centers (NCIC) Missing Person File. However. states are not required to report information to the NCICs Unidentified Person File when they recover an unidentified body. Unfortunately. a logical and complete crossreferencing of the Missing Person File and the Unidentified Person File simply does not exist.***STRPGFIT*** Every week. unidentified deceased children are found. yet their families may never know and may never stop their difficult search. The families are denied the sense of closure to their tragic loss. at least knowing that their child was no longer missing. In late December. the body of GiGi Arnett Harris was found in a morgue. where it had lain unidentified for two years. Stories like that of Ms. Harris would not occur if Jennifers Law is enacted. Jennifers Law would correct this problem by requiring that states report to the NCIC information on unidentified persons that they find in their jurisdiction. It would also require that the FBI modernize the Missing Persons File and the Unidentified Persons File to make the lists compatible for crossreferencing. Its time to bring comfort to families of missing children in their suffering. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this very important legislation.",

Missing person files are already sent to the FBI and. as we all know. two heads. or two agencies in this case. are better than one when it comes to finding missing and abducted kids. In my congressional district alone. 68 missing children have been reported since 1994.

A lot of politicians and editorial writers cry that the sky is falling because of the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation. The Actuaries show that with a variety of reasonable changes. Medicare will be there for our children and grandchildren. The memo shows that with reasonable controls on hospitals and doctor inflation and very small tax changes. we can easily solve Medicares financial problems between now and 2022. and solve more than half the 19982072 problem. For example. a three year freeze on hospital payment inflation would cut the shortterm problem in half and the 75 year budget shortfall by onequarter. A freeze is doable. because the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) reports that at current rates. in 2003 hospital Medicare payment profits are likely to be about 15%-far more than we should be paying. As another alternative. if we donated half the tobacco settlement to the Medicare Trust Fund and saved the next decades budget surpluses for Medicare. we would keep the Hospital Trust Fund solvent way past 2020. We dont need tax increases. If we just save the pending surpluses for Medicare. instead of dribbling them away. we can solve Medicares problems over the next twenty years. A proposal to hold Hospital Trust Fund spending to the growth in the Medicare population plus the per capita growth in Gross Domestic Product. would solve half the longterm financial problems of the Trust Fund. Holding health inflation to this level will be tough. unless private sector health inflation is held to similar levelsbut we should try. The fat and waste in the health care system is extraordinary. and we should make this our goal.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the \"Metropolitan Washington Regional Transportation Act\" with my colleague. Senator CHUCK ROBB. to address the traffic congestion problems within the metropolitan Washington D.C. region. We now have the second longest average commuting time in the nation. According to the Greater Washington Board of Trade. this increased commuting time and congestion costs each man. woman. and child in the region more than $800 per year in lost time. wasted fuel. and environmental damage. Long commutes and traffic congestion have also become quality of life issues to area residents. robbing many families of the one commodity Washingtonians never seem to have enough oftime. Some drivers facing a longer commute have even become a safety hazard as they race recklessly to cut a precious few minutes form their daily commute. Last years tragedies on 195 and the George Washington Parkway are still fresh on everyones mind. For those who lack cars. the distance between employment opportunities and affordable housing has grown more and more difficult to traverse. Our economic prosperity and quality of life hinge on improving our congestion problem. Unfortunately. as we look to the future the traffic situation only grows worse. Even with increase in federal funds Virginia will receive under legislation reauthorizing federal surface transportation programs. this region will still fall seriously short of meeting the growing demand for transportation improvements. For the period of 1990 through 2020. this region can expect both a 43 percent increase in population and 43 percent increase in employment. This growth and increased dependency on the automobile is expected to increase by 79 percent the number of vehicle miles traveled in the region by 2020. The Board of Trade estimates that transportation spending is expected to fall short of the regions transportation needs by more than $500 million annually. Any solution to current and future congestion demands strategic investment in both our road and mass transit system. It demands better land use and planning decisions and better interjurisdictional cooperation. And it also demands that this region",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I commend to my colleagues the attached oped printed in the Los Angeles Times on May 17. 1998. concerning U.S.-Chile relations. One of the worst acts of state sponsored terrorism took place right here in Washington. D.C. on September 21. 1976. A bomb was placed under the car of Orlando Letelier. a Chilean exile and former Chilean chancellor under the democratically elected government of Slavador Allende. While driving to work that morning. the bomb was detonated as the car wound around Sheridan Circle. killing Letelier and his American assistant. Ronnie Karpen Moffitt and seriously wounding her husband. Michael Moffitt. With the help of the FBI. several people were brought to trial for the crime. but it was always believed that Gen. Augusto Pinochet. who seized power in Chile in a bloody coup in 1973 and isincredulouslynow a sitting member of the Chilean Senate. had directed the assassination. There was not enough evidence at the time. however. to directly link him to the crime. More evidence has come to light since then. and other nations have launched investigations of statesponsored killings directed by the Chilean secret police. Argentina. Spain and Italy for example are investigating past crimes. and Spain in particular is looking into whether Pinochet was directly involved in the Letelier assassination and other killings. Spain has asked the United States for cooperation in this investigation. and regrettably that assistance has not always been forthcoming. Along with my colleague Mr. CONYERS of Michigan. I have written the Administration urging their complete and total cooperation with the Spanish investigation. As the following article points out. there is mounting evidence that Pinochet was directly involved in the killing of Orlando Letelier and Ronnie Karpan Moffitt. I urge the Administration to strongly consider reopening its own investigation of those murders as well as fully cooperate with the Spanish investigation. Neither Congress nor the Administration should forego the opportunity to send a strong and clear message that we will not tolerate terrorism on our soil. And our developing relationship with the new government of Chile should not shield Pinochet from responsibility if it is proven that he was responsible for the assassination of innocent civilians.",

A blanket exemption of this sort would lead to widespread extinction of large portions of the Pacific salmon fishery Industry. Such a categorlcal exemption.\" as is in this hill. \"grants a license to kill this Nations valuable aquatic resources.\" They go on to say that this is hidden ostensibly in the name of flood control. Mr. Chairman. I want to tell my colleagues that this license to kill will kill jobs In my State. It will kill jobs on the West Coast of this country. It is a bad bill. It is hiding the Endangered Species Act under this emergency. It is not a flood control bill. Vote \"no\" on H.RM 478.",

This bill is probably the most commonsense solution and needed piece of legislation that I have encountered in the 105th Congress. Earlier this year. several States experienced severe flooding. Including my State. the State of Nevada. Many peoples lives and futures were put in jeopardy or lost because levees did not hold. The underlying question behind this Is why. The reason is clear. Several of the levees were not adequately maintained or repaired to properly contain the water because of these very same governmental regulations. HR. 478 applies commonsense solutions to the Endangered Species Act when the act affects flood control projects. Let me state that the current law only allows the waiver of the ESA after a disaster happens. 1.R. 478 amends the law to allow maintenance activities on flood control facilities to take place before a disaster strikes. not afterward. Mr. Chalrman. human life cannot be balanced against the life of a beetle or any other nonhuman species.",

I can tell my colleagues that when the Mississippi River floods. the wildlife head to our levees. If we are going to talk about truly protecting wildlife. then I think the best way to do that Is to have a levee that Is structurally sound. wellmaintained and able to withstand the extraordinary floods that we have had in the past few years. Cur levee boards. our drainage districts that work on a daily basis to maintain these levees. who touch and see and feel and who actually have some experience with the levees. oppose the Behlert amendment and support H.R. 478. These folks have to face the daily threat of the Department of Interior and the SPA swooping down on them because they disturbed wildlife while doing some sort of general maintenance work. all in the name of endangered species. If we cannot do preventative maintenance. then the levees fail and we do not protect anything. As a matter of fact. our Department of Conservation every 2 years has to spend 31 million to put the wildlife habitat back together. If the levees were intact. that would not be the ease. That is Just taxpayer dollars. If we cannot do preventative maintenance. the levees will fall. we will not protect anything. we will not save the communities. the people in those communities or the birds. the fish and the beetles.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the health of the national forests in Colorado and the economies of rural communities are at risk from current national forest management practices. Severe threats from fire. insects and disease endanger the forests and the health. happiness and wellbeing of the citizens of Colorado. While properly utilized timber harvests can effectively contribute to restoring the health of forests. timber programs on the national forests have been almost completely eliminated in Colorado. Many scientists believe that Colorado has more. and older. trees now than at any time in recorded history. The health and capacity of Colorados forests is directly related to the volume of timber harvested. Without proper management. thinning or prescribed burns. timber inventory accumulates to the point where growth is impeded. and stands become susceptible to wildfires. beetle infestations and disease. The proper harvests add valuable and essential resources to the economy while reducing the potential for catastrophic fires by eliminating dangerously high levels of fuels. Mr. Speaker. the motivation of the Forest Service these days seems to be driven not by what is best for the forest. but by what group protests the loudest. Meanwhile. timber budgets and timber sales decline and administrative costs escalate. Directing funds away from timber budgets negates forest management plans. undermines public input into the process. and harms the forest ecosystem. Such impediments to the Forest Service mission have resulted in a de facto policy of reduced use. increased risk of wildfires. and deteriorating forest health. Better national forest timber management programs are essential to the proper stewardship of the national forests in Colorado and to the health. condition and structure of the environment. Accordingly. I have urged my colleagues in the Colorado delegation and the Chief of the U.S. Forest Service to support proper timber management tools to ensure better forest health in Colorado. Mr. Speaker. the Colorado State Senate has spent considerable time evaluating the impact of our national forests on the Colorado economy.

That night. the squadron detached from Admiral Halseys Task Group 38.1. avoided a typhoon. and steamed towards the Japanese mainland. The alert sailors of the squadron identified radar contacts that turned out to be a fourship Japanese convoy. The squadron commander maneuvered his destroyers on various courses and attacked the convoy with gunfire and torpedoes. At the conclusion of the daring surface engagement. two enemy ships had been sunk. one probably sunk. and one damaged. United States forces suffered neither damage nor casualties. The nine destroyers of the squadron were: U.S.S. DeHaven. U.S.S. Mansfield. U.S.S. Swenson. U.S.S. Collett. U.S.S. Maddox. U.S.S. Blue. U.S.S. Brush. U.S.S. Taussig. and U.S.S. Moore.

After much careful work with Senator D*AMATO. the Treasury Department. and the Justice Department. as well as our colleagues in the other body. we have crafted a bill that I believe will lead to much improved coordination in fighting money laundering. I want to thank everyone involved for their hard work on this legislation. The bill will hit the criminals where they feel it the most--in their pocketbooks. By implementing a strategy on a national level. hundreds of communities across our country will no longer be held hostage by these criminal enterprises. As you know. money laundering involves disguising financial assets so they can be used without detection of the illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering. the criminal transforms the monetary proceeds derived from the criminal activity into funds with an apparently legal source. Money laundering provides the resources from drug dealers. terrorists. arms dealers. and other criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. Today. experts estimate that money laundering has grown into a $500 billion problem worldwide. The Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury. in consultation with the Attorney General and other relevant agencies. to coordinate and implement a national strategy to address the exploitation of our Nations payment systems to facilitate money laundering and related financial crimes. I look forward to the delivery of this first strategy next February. and believe it will be a valuable document not only for law enforcement agencies. but also for Congress as we look to react to the increasingly inventive ways criminals take advantage of our financial system. I hope this legislation will be the beginning of a serious effort by Congress to impact the growing threat of money laundering not only to our Nation. but worldwide.",

Since these programs are paid for by U.S. taxpayers. the Senate Appropriations Committee identified potential mechanisms in its report accompanying the fiscal year 1999 Foreign Operation Appropriations bill to ensure that procurement processes by borrowing or recipient nations are transparent. nonbiased and open. One of the mechanisms identified by the committee is independent third party procurement monitoring. An independent third party procurement monitor provides an independent review and assessment of government procurement projects by auditing and certifying that the procurement process is nonbiased. open. transparent and fair. Importantly. independent third party monitoring provides technical assistance and training in country to improve the quality of the procurement process. thereby making the procurement process more effective. The program also verifies that the contractual. technical. economic and financial obligations of the supplier are fully discharged. I encourage the Administration to support the use of programs such as independent thirdparty procurement monitoring which have proven their value in reducing costs by deterring corruption and fraud. ensuring the quality of the goods and services provided. stimulating competition and free trade. as well as enabling U.S. business to compete more successfully.",

This yearly review has earned worldwide respect as the most authoritative compilation of analyses. data. and thoughtprovoking information on refugees. The 1997 World Refugee Survey. released yesterday is especially troubling. The Committee finds that many countries which were once considered safe havens for refugees and asylum seekers are beginning to turn their backs on persons fleeing persecution. The report estimates that the number of refugees and asylumseekers decreased last year to about 14.5 million worldwide. But this apparent decrease is misleading. The Committee attributes it in part to the higher barriers to asylum erected in many countries last year. including the United States. In addition. some countries have begun to forcibly repatriate refugees back to their home countries. even if conditions in those countries have not improved. For example. Thailand has recently begun to forcibly return Burmese refugees to their persecutors in Burma. There is some good news. Several countries. including Guatemala. Haiti. Mozambique. and Cambodia. have improved their human rights situations. so that some refugees have been able to return to their homes. Sadly. the overall message of the report is that basic longstanding international principles of asylum and refugee protection are in trouble. As this report points out. the United States bears a share of responsibility for this problem. The summary exclusion provisions of last years immigration law. and the continued detention of asylumseekers sets a poor example for other countries which look to the United States for guidance on asylum and refugee protection.

His resolution is a fitting tribute not only to the wall itself. but to the 58.196 American men and women who gave their lives for this country in Southeast Asia or who are still missing nearly 20 years after the conclusion of the war. The memorial. the names of Americans killed and missing engraved in its marble edifice. is an eery reminder of the sacrifice made by so many young men and women for a cause many here at home disputed. Nearly 9 million Americans served in Vietnam. Their valor in war was too often greeted with disrespect upon their return home. That is why the Vietnam Veterans Memorial plays such an important role in honoring the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers who served in an unpopular war at a tumultuous time in American history. While the memorials design was at first controversial. it has become an important aspect of the National Mall in Washington. DC. visited by tens of thousands of tourists every year. For those whose loved ones perished in Vietnam. it is an opportunity to see firsthand. that their friends or relatives will be revered and remembered for a long time to come. For those who were not touched personally by the war. the memorial is a chance to understand and experience Vietnam. And for all Americans. the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a lesson about the dangers of war and the bravery. character. and patriotism of the men and women of our Armed Forces. On this. the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Senator HAGELS resolution is a timely and appropriate way to honor all those who served in Vietnam. I am proud.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to add to the statement I offered last week when I introduced S. 758. the Lobbying Disclosure Technical Amendments Act of 1997. In my statement. I noted that a similar piece of legislation that Congressmen CHARLES CANADY and BARNEY FRANK sponsored last year and moved through the House of Representatives. was unable to gain passage in the Senate because of a provision that some Members of the Senate found problematic. I emphasized that the bill I have introduced omits that provision. Although that revision is. in my view. the key difference between the bill I have introduced and last years version. I should also point out a second change. S. 758 omits a provision that would alter the language in those sections of the Lobbying Disclosure Act (the \"LDA\") requiring LDA registrants to identify certain foreign entities that have an interest in the outcome of their lobbying activities. As it stands now. the LDA provides that registrants need to identify foreign entities that have a direct interest in their lobbying. The provision in last years Housepassed bill and which is not included in S. 758 would have added the word \"significant\" to that phrase. Under that provision. registrants would have to disclose foreign subsidiaries only if they have a significant direct interest in the lobbying. In my view. changing direct interest to significant direct interest would be counterproductive. especially since the provision in question does not define what the word \"significant\" means in this context. At what point does a direct interest become a significant direct interest? If foreign entities have a direct interest in the lobbying of a registrant. but the registrant insists that interest is not significant. how can we judge that contention? In the absence of clear answers to those questions. I believe the provision I have omitted could weaken the LDA. By introducing an element of vagueness into the acts language. it could undercut the acts ability to fulfill the informationgathering function that we had in mind when we passed it. As I emphasized in my initial statement. my purpose in introducing this technical amendments bill is to make the LDA even more useful than it is now. I do not want to do anything to weaken the act. and S. 758 is shaped in accordance with that guiding principle.e",

The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress can bestow on someone for acts and dedication to a cause that exceeds even the highest standards. This bill honors Mother Teresa for her lifelong devotion to the sick and the needy in the most impoverished areas of the world. It also recognizes her work to build and sustain the Missionaries of Charities in 25 countries. Under her direction and following her example of selflessness. over 3.000 members of the Missionaries of Charities stand ready to continue her work. Mr. President. Mother Teresa has already been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is time for Congress itself to honor Mother Teresa and I commend Senator BROWNBACK for initiating this legislation. I offer my personal thanks and congratulations to my colleague.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to ArcWork of Fresno. In partnership with the Fresno Chamber of Commerce. ArcWork employs people with developmental disabilities at jobs which enhance the business environment and the community. The ArcWork project was the vision of Larry Willey. vice president of marketing for the Fresno Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Willey was aware that one of the priorities of Fresno Mayor Jim Patterson was to keep Fresno Clean and Green. In response. it was proposed that individual businesses and the Fresno Chamber of Commerce could sponsor various areas and pay ArcWork employees to keep them clean. Since then. the concept of community and corporate involvement to take care of the cities beautification has expanded greatly. Parks were recently added to the list for the beautification process. and various city agencies and groups have become involved in the program. The collaboration of resources has been so effective. the city of Fresno has been able to redirect its workers to more demanding projects. The result: ArcWork crews are now capable of picking up an increasing number of general city tasks. The advent of the ArcWork program has been a winwin for everyone involved. Businesses have found the services to be cost effective. helping to create a cleaner environment throughout Fresno. ArcWork also has allowed business to gain recognition for the positive contributions made to the program. Municipalities have benefited by the increased partnerships that have been forged between the Fresno Chamber of Commerce and the business community. helping to create employment opportunities for the developmentally disabled. Most importantly. though. are the benefits that the ArcWork program has given to those with developmental disabilities who want to work and increase their selfsufficiency. Mr. Speaker. I admire the success of the ArcWork program. Working together. the city of Fresno. the Fresno Chamber of Commerce. private organizations. and local businesses have found a beneficial way to solve some of the challenges facing our city in a positive and effective manner. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to ArcWork. a program that serves as a model of local grassroots involvement throughout the Nation.",

Mr. Speaker. to the American people and to the taxpayers of this country. it is very important that this House go on record as saying we are here to protect the taxpayers. even for this sum.

The difference between the recess we were on and the sessions that we are now having is not visible to the naked eye. Thus. we get this resolution. and it is the Model U.N.

If there is anything that we hear our constituents talk about. it is lack of access to health care and good health care. Just coming in from the Rayburn Room discussing with constituents who work with home health care agencies. the type of agencies that I have been familiar with or had familiarity with through the illness of my father. to come to find out that these agencies are being required to get $50.000 bonds. which they do not disagree with but they cannot get the bonds. and so people who are homebound are not getting health care. that individuals who require home visits once a month to take blood tests are now cutting those services. These are the kinds of issues that we should be discussing: greater accessibility to patient care with respect to choice of physicians. making sure that individuals can be enrolled under these managed care programs. separating out the dollar from the care. making sure that the dollar is not the only thing that is considered when we have to take care of people in their times of illness. This is a silly. silly rule and we should really be applauding the fact that the White House health care task force under the leadership of Hillary Clinton allowed us to think about what kind of health services we want. what kind of health system. whether we wanted to have a system that was similar to the one in Canada. whether we wanted to have universal access. whether we wanted to have a combined. No. we did not resolve it. but we did discuss it. and we realize that there are problems with the system we have now. Those individuals who worked on this worked in good faith. Frankly. I think that we do well to spend more time dealing with the patient bill of rights than wasting the peoples time dealing with such silliness about who is paying what and not allowing us to focus on these very important issues.

Every year the California Department of Education recognizes schools from across the State that have established a successful track record. Of the 5.000 elementary schools in California. only 200 receive the California Distinguished School award. I am pleased to report that this year four of those schools are in my district. While Hamilton. Paradise Canyon. Thomas Edison and Ralph Waldo Emerson Elementary Schools each serve different school districts. one thing remains the same. They are all finding innovative ways to meet the needs of local students. The Distinguished School Award does not come easily. Schools must first submit to a rigorous application process. endless meetings with State and local officials. and have parents. teachers and even students consulted by a nominating committee. This process encourages schools to develop innovative curricula and increases local involvement. When it comes to success stories in education. I am proud to be able to look no further than my own district.",

The Lower Valley Housing Corporation of El Paso has helped more than 300 families in my district. These are families with an average annual income of $13.000 or less. and it helps them to acquire their first homes through a private and public construction financing program. Working with the USDAs Rural Development Fund. families prequalify for financing without down payments by agreeing to provide sweat equity. Each family is required to work on the construction of their homes and also their neighbors by providing at least 65 percent of the labor. Because of these doityourself contributions. these homes cost only onethird of what the normal construction costs would be. The result is a move away from an expensive apartment rental to the pride of home ownership where families have equity and affordable payments as low as $300 a month for a $42.000 home. This program is a model for the Nation. Families build strong communities. celebrate homebuilding skills and gain the pride of home ownership. 13430\ufffd",

There are six committees in Congress that have access to that number. three in the House. three in the other body: The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. the Committee on Appropriations. and the Committee on National Security. Those committees are set up to receive this information. they are cleared for top secret. and they have the ability to absorb It and to do with it whatever Is necessary in our democratic process. The classified records are available to be looked at. The gentleman from Michigan objects to that because you are then bound by an oath of secrecy. Well. then do not go look at it. but you have got six committees in this Congress to get that information. Why do we keep it secret? It is a mistake to think that the intelligence budgets of these agencies is a static thing. There are bumps. Sometimes it goes up. sometimes it goes down. What does that signify? It means we may be working on an expensive new weapons system. and that information ought not to be made available to those who wish us harm. There is no urgency. there is no need for this to be made public other than to tell the rest of the world or give them a hint as to what we are doing and perhaps even why we are doing it. The amount of money is overseen by six congressional committees bipartisanly. It is available to anybody who has a burning need to know by going and reviewing the classified annex.

In todays world there is no rational reason why the American public should be denied information about how much the United States Government is spending on intelligence activities.

John Deutch. then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. said that same month. \"Disclosure of the annual amount appropriated for intelligence purposes will inform the public and will not in itself harm intelligence activities.\" The continued classification of the total amount spent annually on intelligence activity is not only unnecessary. but it is also ridiculous. U.S. intelligence spending is considered by many to be one of Washingtons worstkept secrets. Estimates of intelligence spending appear with some regularity in the press. By continuing to refuse to release the amount publicly. Congress is only serving to fuel suspicions that the government is hiding something.

I think the important thing to remember is the presumption should always be in favor of disclosure. As I listened to the arguments against. I do not hear anything to rebut that presumption. I think the American public wants to know as much as possible about what we do back here. Part of the reason why this institution has the confidence problem it has with this country is they figure we are keeping stuff from them. that we do not trust them to know what is going on back here. and they feel left out of the process. There should be a strong presumption in letting them into as much of the process as is humanly possible. If there is some special reason here why that cannot be done. fine. We can explain it and keep it secret. But no special reason has been offered during the course of this debate not to release the aggregate figure that we spend on intelligence in this country. There have been some camels nose under the tent arguments about how in the future we might authorize the release of something that would cause a problem. but that is not good enough. That does not rebut the presumption that this body should have to disclose whatever possible to the public. I urge support of the amendment.",

It is our culture. our rich and diverse culture. which makes New Mexico unique. Our art. our architecture. our cuisine. our literature. our dance. makes us what we are and. yes. our language. whether that be Tewa or English or Navajo or Spanish.

That does not mean that we do not respect their culture. that they should not be proud of who they are and that they should not be multilingual. because let us face it. folks. being able to speak more than one language is a strength. not a weakness. So we should be talking about English plus and not English only. This bill does not affect funding levels. There is a holdharmless clause for all States. and I am very pleased to say that I am working with the Committee on Appropriations to expand multilingual education funds for the elementary school level. What this bill is about is local control. It is about taking power from Washington and giving it back to local school boards to decide what is the best way to educate our children. It is about parental choice and parental consent. that no child should be in a program that their parents do not approve of just because somebody else says it is best for them. It is about making sure that there are no dead ends for our children who do not arrive at school able to speak English. There is no separate but equal. there are no side tracks. and there is no second class. That is what this bill is about. and that is why I am supporting it.",

Todays move makes perfect sense for a party that plays politics with virtually every issue. Well. I have news for my colleagues across the aisle.

By teaching core classes like math and science in a childs native language. while effectively teaching English. we can make sure that children do not fall behind in basic skills. But Republicans will slash funding. eliminate training. weaken programs. and then say that the programs do not work.

Studies in California have shown that only about 5 percent of English learning students a year can be classified as English proficient. so this bilingual education program is not doing the job it should be doing. Mastering the English language is the best formula for personal and professional success in America. The late Senator Hayakawa said: America is an open society. more open than any other in the world. People of every race. of every color. of every culture are welcomed here to create a new life for themselves and their families. And what do these people who enter into the American mainstream have In common? English. English. our shared. common language.

Public schools are great equalizers. the entities weve created to help socialize all children and give them the skills necessary to take advantage of the social and economic opportunities our country affords them. When schools fail to do their job. its our children who suffer. To fix them we certainly need more resources. particularly textbooks. for children and teachers. But we also need standards and merit pay for teachers. the end of social promotion. the setting of goals for children. and most importantly. holding parents. teachers and administrators accountable for the performance of our school system. And until we begin looking senously at these and other reforms. proposals like vouchers will continue to look attractive though. in my view. they are panaceas. if not anathema to public education itself. While each of us who have had children in public schools can measure success in our childrens development. one category of children who have been particularly hurt are those for whom English is not a primary languagechildren from nonEnglish speaking families or who otherwise have limited English proficiency. As I traveled across the State of California earlier this year. many parents told me of their dissatisfaction with Californias bilingual education system. Indeed. the debate and vote for our states Proposition 227. which required school districts to use immersion as the means of teaching English. demonstrated that many nonEnglish speaking parents wanted change. But. Mr. Chairman. I did not support Proposition 227 because it represented a \"onesizefitsall\" approach to a complex problemand as such it took away control over the education of our kids from our local school districts. where it belongs. Similarly. I must oppose the English Language Fluency Act. While I believe this legislation is well intentioned. it will have the same unfortunate result across the country as Proposition 227 did in California: it will restrict the flexibility of our local districts to impart the best education possible on all our kidsthe education that will prepare them to perform and succeed in our economy. Mainstreaming kids is the right goal. but the means should be left to the level of government with primary responsibility for education: local government. Mr. Chairman.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3892. \"The English Language Fluency Act\". This legislation \"block grants\" Federal bilingual education programs and eliminates numerous protections contained in current law. I view this bill as a significant setback on bilingual education. Several educational agencies and organizations also believe this bill would harm current Federallyfunded bilingual education programs. For example. the Council of the Great City Schools. the New York Board of Regents. and the New York State Board of Education all oppose this measure. Lets examine just what kind of negative impact this legislation would really have on bilingual education programs. H.R. 3892 removes existing enforcement and compliance standards. For example. current bilingual education agreements between the Education Departments Civil Rights office and local school districts would be eliminated. The bill also would limit the ability of these agencies to negotiate future agreements. Additionally. the bill eliminates Civil Rights Act protections that ensure that students who are learning English continue to achieve high academic standards. In fact. it would force students to leave transitional education programs after two years. regardless of their proficiency in English. Moreover. the bills total lack of attention to core subject matter. with all emphasis on English development only. is not sound education practice. In the case of New York State. the bill would reduce overall funding as well as funding for planning. administration. and interagency cooperation within the State due to a change in the allocation formula. At the same time. New York State would be required to taken on added responsibility for the managerment of the funds with sufficient monies to do SO. Perhaps most significantly. this legislation overrides the tradition of local control on public education matters. Local school districts and states with a large percentage of students who are learning to speak English should be able to make their own decisions on how best to educate their students. H.R. 3892 is a \"onesizefitsall\" approach to a complicated problem that requires autonomy and flexibility for local jurisdictions. Finally. we should not lose sight of the fact that this bill repeals the Emergency Immigrant Education program and undermines Title VII funds. from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. that have already been awarded to local school districts. This legislation is will hinder the advances made in bilingual education and I would urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3892.",

This bill instead restricts local school districts and jeopardizes successful bilingual education programs by cutting federal support for teacher training and virtually eliminating successful programs that currently help immigrant children. In fact. this bill even lowers academic standards and expectations for immigrant children by focusing exclusively on English language proficiency rather than math. science and history. H.R. 3892 jeopardizes these childrens futures by setting an arbitrary and unrealistic punitive twoyear federal mandate on their ability to master English.

In fact. this bill will make a number of changes to bilingual education that will harm children who need assistance the most. Language in the bill will require that all children have only two years of bilingual education regardless of their ability to master English. The bill will also violate the Civil Rights Act by voiding the current voluntary compliance agreements between schools. parents and the Department of Education. Office of Civil Rights.

NJ. a city I represent here in Congress. close to 40 percent of all students come from homes where English is not the primary language spoken. In the city of Elizabeth. portions of which I also represent. the immigrant population is thriving and the schools need a structured bilingual education program to keep students in school. I recognize that many bilingual programs need improvement. However. there are many effective bilingual programs in place across the country that really do improve the language skills of children who are not yet English proficient. A new program at the Benjamin Franklin School in my district was just awarded funds from the Department of Education. This program called \"Project TwoWay\" will engage both English proficient students and limited English proficient (LEP) students in classes that will be taught in Spanish and English enabling both types of students to be bilingual by the time they are in the fourth grade. The need is to not pare down these programs but instead take the ones that work and educate school districts on how to replicate them. However. like many other issues on the majoritys education agenda. this bill is not a remedy to the real problems that children face.

In fact. New York is working to improve its own program. as are many states. However. I am deeply concerned that H.R. 3892 will hurt many of the young people we want to help In particular. I believe that this legislation will place inflexible mandates on states and school districts. It will not allow children with limited English skills to excel in their other course work. And it will not guarantee that federal funds go to where they are most needed.

In addition. this bill would severely limit funds needed to prepare bilingual teachers. As the sponsor of the Americas Teacher Preparation Improvement Act. I do not believe we should reduce support.for our students. including those with limited English skills. All young people deserve a qualified teacher.

Further. the school would lose federal funding for their bilingual education program after 3 years. This does not prevent localities from using their own funds to continue such a programit just means that federal funds cannot be used. English proficiency is essential to immigrant success. English proficiency helps ones family. which in turn would help their neighborhood. which in turn would help their communmity. English proficiency is good for the overall wellbeing of our society. For more than 100 years it was the core of America as the melting pot. the melting pot that was the uniting hope and ideal of our nation. My support for this legislation stems from the experience of my family. My husband is the first member of his Dutch large family to be born in the United States. My grandparents emigrated from Italy.

While U.S. employment. particularly in the apparel industry. is plummeting. apparel imports from CaribbeanCentral America are surging.

And I am pleased that we were able to bring this forward. I am pleased that the other body has gone forward with it. I hope we will just vote this through. It is. as I said. narrow. technical. it leaves other copyright issues ahead of us. I suppose it is a sign that sometimes the law moves a little more slowly than technology that we are today passing a bill about phonorecords. When the phrase \"phonorecords\" first went into the law in 1909. there were not very many because they were too new. Now there are not very many because they are too old. So we have in this legislative history sort of gone through the life cycle of phonorecords. I should note that the 1909 act was passed in the same year as the birth of our colleague. the gentleman from Illinois. which is irrelevant but interesting.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 672. the Copyright Clarification Act. and particularly the Senate amendment thereto. In 1995. the Ninth Circuit issued a ruling in La Cienaga Music Corp. versus ZZ Top. which threatens the validity of copyright for musical works created prior to 1978. This decision poses a severe hardship for thousands of songwriters. many of whom I am proud to count as my constituents. What these composers and songwriters did was nothing more than to rely on an industry standard of many decades duration. which provides that the distribution of a phonorecord does not constitute publication of a musical work. This longtime understanding of copyright law has been ratified and reaffirmed by the Second Circuit over 20 years ago. American songwriters had every reason to consider this issue to be a matter of settled law. But the LaCienaga decision took that settled law and cast it on its head. threatening to thrust into the public domain hundreds of thousands of musical works which presently enjoy copyright protection. This posthoc penalty on copyright owners for failure to comply with copyright formalities. in reliance upon settled law. struck the members of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property and. I am happy to say. the members of the other body as well. as grossly unfair. We concluded that the Ninth Circuit had reached an anomalous and insupportable result which in the interest of fundamental fairness begged to be corrected. That is what the legislation before us would do. I commend this bill to my colleagues and urge its passage.",

This decision also threatens to undermine the national economy. It is estimated that copyright industries contribute up to $4 billion to our economy and. in addition. are one of our most valuable exports. The case of La Cienaga Music Co. v. ZZ Top. 53 F. 3d 950 (9th Cir. 1995). cert. denied. 116 S.Ct. 331 (1995) is unfortunate as it has jeopardized the private property rights for thousands of creative individuals who live within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit. I am advised that this court decision makes it impossible for certain affected individual creators to bring an infringement action within the Ninth Circuit. Hence. you may have a copyright. but you have no available remedies against piracy. Much of the credit for today belongs to House Judiciary Committee Chairman HYDE and Subcommittee Chairman COBLE for their diligence and attention to this issue. This is a bipartisan enterprise. and thanks for today also rests with Representative FRANK. This measure should be noncontroversial and speedily adopted by the House. As you know. this particular new language was contained in a much more comprehensive bill that I have sponsored along with Senate Judiciary Chairman HATCH. H.R. 1621.

The age of the Internet promises enormous benefits--instantaneous communication from one end of the planet to the other. paperless financial transactions. access to vast libraries of information at the touch of a button. But these benefits are not without a price: the same technology that facilitates unprecedented access has also fostered a new breed of sophisticated criminals. Todays Internet pirates can download perfect digital copies of copyrighted worksfrom movies to musical recordings to video gamesand distribute them to other Internet users without the knowledge or permission of the copyright holders. Software piracy carries enormous costs for our society. Last year. it cost copyright holders between $11 and 20 billion worldwide. with $2.3 billion lost in the United States alone. That. in turn. meant the loss of many thousands of American jobs. higher prices to honest software purchasers. and a billion dollars in lost tax revenues. Most people who commit these crimes do so for financial gain. But increasingly these crimes are being committed by computer hackers who obtain copyrighted software from lawful users and post it on electronic bulletin boards. free for the taking. The present copyright law can do little to either deter or punish these crimes. because under current law there can be no culpability unless the defendant was seeking commercial gain. H.R. 2265 corrects that problem by criminalizing computer theft of copyrighted works whether or not the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from his actions. I believe this measure will help preserve the creative incentive on which so much of our prosperityand the future of the Internet itselfdepend. I urge support for the bill.",

Daily business developments attest to the pressing need for content to fill the pages of our newest medium for entertainment and mass communications. But that content will simply not be available unless its creators can be assured that their intellectual property will be protected. The decision of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts in 1994 in U.S. v. LaMacchia. however. created a loophole which leaves copyright owners virtually defenseless against those who infringe copyright not for profit. but for the pure fun of it. as a top executive of the Recording Industry Association of America put it at the legislative hearing on H.R. 2265. We simply must make clear that there is no hacker defense to criminal copyright liability. Copyright owners exclusive rights of public performance. distribution. and reproduction must be protected no less from the grad student who thinks content on the Internet should be free than from the pirate who reaps a fortune from his counterfeiting operation. The end result is the same: the substantial loss of revenue to intellectual property owners. increasingly as technology makes it possible for more and more content to be moved over digital networks. In enacting H.R. 2265. we make clear that the computer theft of copyrighted works is subject to criminal penalties. and in so doing exercise our constitutional responsibility to protect copyright.

It builds on successful pilot projects. such as the one in Anaheim. CA. which identified a substantial number of individuals who are either in the United States illegally or who might otherwise be subject to deportation. The bill would require the Attorney General to detail INS employees to certain selected local government jails and prisons in order to identify prior to arraignment deportable criminal aliens or aliens unlawfully in the United States. The program will be focused on jurisdictions having high concentrations of aliens who are illegally in this country. It would have the benefit of providing better information to immigration authorities and local governments about the extent to which illegal and criminal aliens are in our criminal justice system and would provide immigration authorities with the information they need to remove those individuals who should not be in the United States at all. much less to remain here to commit crimes. I want there to be no mistake. this Nation has benefited tremendously from Immigration and from the contribution of the many millions of people who came here from other lands. In my own city of New York. immigrants are rebuilding old neighborhoods right now and contributing to a rebirth of our city. We should welcome and support them. and not confuse those many lawabiding immigrants with the few who would disregard our laws.

The enforcement of the immigration laws is the responsibility of the Federal Government.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa. This amendment. which purports to lower guarantee fees on student loans. would. in actuality. increase fees for borrowers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Under current law. student loan guarantee agencies participating in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) have the option of charging borrowers a guarantee fee of up to 1% for subsidized Stafford loans. unsubsidized Stafford loans. and PLUS loans. Amendment No. 3117 would eliminate the optional guarantee fee for subsidized Stafford loans. and it would reduce by 1% the guarantee fee on Direct subsidized loans administered by the Department of Education. The costs of this provision would be offset by obligating guarantee agencies to charge the full 1% guarantee fee on all unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans. The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA). which guarantees loans for borrowers within the Commonwealth. presently waives the guarantee fee for both subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans. as well as the fee for PLUS loans. In addition. PHEAA also waives all guarantee fees for borrowers in West Virginia and Delaware. the two states for which it has been designated by the states governor as the guarantee agency. Should Amendment No. 3117 become law. PHEAA would be compelled to begin charging a 1% fee on unsubsidized Stafford loans and PLUS loans. Consequently. total guarantee fees charged to student borrowers in Pennsylvania. West Virginia. and Delaware would actually increase. Consider that in FY1997. PHEAA guaranteed $651 million in unsubsidized Stafford loans for 172.000 students and $171 million in PLUS loans for 28.000 parents. None of those borrowers were charged a guarantee fee. However. if this amendment had been law. it would have cost those borrowers $8.22 million in total guarantee fees. Moreover. 20% of FFELP borrowers nationwide receive fee waivers or fee reductions from their guarantor. Consequently. Amendment No. 3117 would increase fees for borrowers in states other than just those serviced by PHEAA. As such. I must oppose this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to join me in doing SO.",

The bill itself provides incentives for them to make sure that the people wanting to be teachers have studied the things which they will teach. We do it by enticement and through assistance with loan programswith programswhereas this amendment would order it done.

If you hear an argument that somehow this is going to put our guaranty agencies at risk and jeopardize the banks. I point out that even under my amendment by cutting this tax by 25 percent on students. the guaranty agencies will get almost $4.6 billion over the next 5 years. more than enough to handle any contingency. So this basically is a tax cut for students. It is supported by a long list of colleges and student organizations. I think it is the least we can do for our studentsto give them a tax break. also.",

I also want to thank the gentleman from Illinois. . and the gentleman from New Jersey. . for providing leadership on such an important issue for the House to consider and for forwarding this timely piece of bipartisan legislation that I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of. Unfortunately. too many retired Americans today have misjudged their retirement savings needs and todays youth are following in their footsteps as well. These problems pose a significant risk to the future wellbeing of millions of soon to be retirees as well as the countless baby boomers who will retire after the turn of the century. Just as the longterm solvency of Social Security remains a vitally important issue that must be addressed by Congress very soon. so too must we also address the looming crisis in private retirement savings by reaching out to all Americans and informing them of this enormous problem. If we fail to do so. the impending retirement of the baby boomers will severely strain our already overburdened entitlement system. necessitating increased reliance on pension and other personal savings. The SAVER Act would do just that. Studies have shown that less than a third of all Americans have even tried to calculate how much they will need to have saved by retirement. and that less than 20 percent are very confident that they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout their retirement. By passing this legislation. we can help advance the publics knowledge and understanding of retirement savings and its critical importance to the future wellbeing of American workers. and provide for a periodic bipartisan national retirement savings summit. in conjunction with the White House. to elevate the issue of savings to national prominence. and initiate the development of a broadbased public education program to encourage and enhance individual commitment to a personal retirement savings strategy. 0l 1115 Highlighting this national problem is one of the best things this Congress can do. Enact the SAVER Act now. The retirement time bomb is ticking.",

I think the gentleman from Connecticut mentioned a salient point in regard to substantive legislation which is pending before the Congress. substantive issues. I think it is important to stress that what we have in this legislation certainly is basically a broadbased education for the country in general so that workers and employers and the public in general can better comprehend what the challenges are before us as we look to those golden years ahead of us. But also. it brings together in a very bipartisan fashion people from both sides of the aisle and brings also the private sector into being here. For instance. it would bring into action the American Savings Education Council. which is a partnership of over 200 private and public sector institutions. including organizations like IBM. American Express. the Employee Benefit Research Institute. many. many entities. and all in a nonpartisan atmosphere. So that I think. especially in a White House summit. that would be part and parcel of this legislation. We would be able to address ourselves perhaps more objectively and more dispassionately to some of the substantive issues which are before us here in Congress which would perhaps otherwise we may not be able to do. I would be the first to admit that there are important substantive issues.

I rise today in support of this important legislation that preserves States authority over a crucial area of their economic wellbeing while establishing greater competition in the banking industry. As a member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services in the House and in my previous experiences in the State senate. I have seen major changes in the financial and banking arena in the last few years. I have great concern about some changes because they allow large. outofState national banks to branch into almost any State. This may be good for the large. but many of us see it as a huge threat for many smaller Statechartered banks. the very same banks that make their livelihood in small towns making small loans to small businesses which. in my opinion. is the backbone of the Nation. The RiegleNeal Clarification Act corrects this imbalance by preserving the State charter as a viable option for banks that seek to branch across State lines. H.R. 1306 levels the playing field for small financial institutions and helps to maintain the dual banking system. which is an objective for many Members of this House. A vote for H.R. 1306 will be a vote for States rights. retaining State control over their economic direction. I urge my colleagues to vote for this important bill.",

The dual banking system in the United States has been vital to the development of the worlds strongest banking system. Statechartered banks are often the laboratory where new. innovative products are tested and perfected. Checking accounts. electronic funds transfers. and bank insurance sales were all introduced by Statechartered banks. However. the dual banking system has come under assault recently. The Clinton administration has tried on no less than five occasions to impose Federal examination fees. or taxes. on Statechartered banks. only to have them rejected overwhelmingly by the House Banking Committee. Now. there is opposition to this legislation which was introduced to ensure that the RiegleNeal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act will be implemented in a manner which meets its intended goal. which is to permit Statechartered banks to branch across State lines. This Member was intimately involved in the original RiegleNeal Act. and was concerned at that time that States rights were protected. Thats why this Member proposed and was joined by his distinguished colleague from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. in offering the opt out provision which was eventually included in that act. However. this Member most certainly does not agree with the argument. being made by groups ranking from the Consumer Federation of America to Consumers Union and the National Conference of State Legislatures. that the bill is an assault on States rights. This Member believes that this measure actually reinforces States rights by maintaining the viability of the State charter by ensuring parity with the national bank charter. Therefore.

An attractive State bank charter helps attract banking and business to a State. It helps produce jobs and revenue that help all citizens. This has been important to the success of Delaware and many other States. As we enter the age of interstate banking and branching it is necessary to ensure that State banks can compete fairly with national banks as more banking is done between States and across the Nation.

This bill will simply clarify the original intent of the RiegleNeal Interstate Branching and Efficiency Act of 1994 which I cosponsored. This law. which goes into effect June 1. needs this clarification to fully address the issue of various State banking regulations and how this would affect a bank headquartered in one State operating a branch in another. Mr. Speaker. we have heard almost unanimous testimony that the unfortunate and unintended consequences of our failure to make these clarifications will be the devaluation of State bank charters in favor of national charters and the gradual decline of the State banking system. I am a firm believer in the dual banking system of State and federally chartered institutions and I am certain that the innovation and tremendous strength enjoyed by the American financial marketplace is due in part to the dynamic created by these separate charters. It will be indeed unfortunate if a vibrant State bank is unwilling or unable to take advantage of interstate branching. Many State banks will simply not expand rather than compete with national banks in another State or convert to a national charter in order to grow. Therefore. Mr. Speaker.

Millions of people volunteer on a daily basis for one big reason: because they care.

I think with volunteers serving both from within and without their home State. a Federal. consistent law is certainly needed. If a State strongly disagrees with this. then that State. as he pointed out and as I would state today. has the option to opt out completely. Finally. No. 3. this bill is reasonable. It protects a volunteer. not the organization but the volunteer herself. who is serving within the scope of her duties with the organization. It protects him or her from the daytoday ordinary. simple negligence cases. It does not protect against willful negligence. willful conduct. gross negligence. a criminal act. drug use. alcohol. or in a situation where a vehicle is involved. As such.

If I may respond to the rather strident criticism of this bill by the gentleman from North Carolina . there is a practical reason why Federal preemption occurs here. Many of the disasters. such as the earthquakes in California. the forest fires. hurricanes in Florida attract volunteers from across State lines. The Red Cross. for example. would like to be able to train people to go in for disaster relief for people to train other volunteers. and it is important that they not have to concern themselves with a checkerboard of liability laws. In addition. there is a very small insurance market to cover volunteers. The cost of that insurance becomes prohibitive if it has to be complicated by a plethora of liability standards from State to State. So from a very practical point of view. and sometimes that is inconvenient. but from a very practical point of view. it is useful to have a Federal preemption in many cases so that volunteers who cross State lines to give and risk their lives many times are not troubled by having to comply with a checkerboard of laws and are able to get insurance from the organization that attracts them to protect them.",

It is my further understanding neither the bill nor the report language in any way implies that such conduct must rise to the level of a conviction or that it could be established under the usual criminal standard. proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Mr. Speaker. this homily that we would make to privatization today deserves some closer Inspection because the Federal Government is already spending vast amounts of money on service contracts. Unfortunately in many cases that money Is not being well spent. According to both the Office of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office contract administration is one of the highest risk activities which the government engages In. Examples abound. Senate hearings uncovered 27 billion a year in Medicare fraud. In 1995 25 billion in payments to defense contractors could not be matched to invoices. and in many cases the Department of Defense relies on contractors themselves to identify overpayments. At one Department of Energy site a contractor poured toxic waste on radioaetive wastes into the ground and stored more in leaky drums. Whether from outright theft. charges of unallowable costs. lack of top level management. attention to contract management or ineffective contract administration and auditing. the Federal Government is losing billions of dollars a year. and It seems to me that this bill puts the cart before the horse. If we are truly interested In more costeffective management. we should drastically improve contract management before moving to contract out billions more In services. Yet unfortunately the legislation does not speak to this. The legislation before us also seems to have a onesided approach which favors contractors at the expense of Flederal employees and the American public. Although it requires agencies to conduct inventories of services performed by Federal employees. no such inventory is required of work by contractors. The intent of this bill is to identify activities which might be privatlzed. yet we have no idea how much of the Federal governments activities are already being performed by the private sector or how big the contractor work force Is. Such an Inventory would also be useful in helping agencies control waste. fraud and abuse. Now. finally. Mr. Speaker. the bill will Inevitably and inappropriately politicize the outaourcing process. At the conclusion of a constitutional convention Benjamin Franklin was asked. \"What have you?\" And he answered: \"A republic. if you can keep it.\" And I say outsourcing and privatization Is a piecemeal dismantling of our republic.",

This is an opportunity to do just that. Mr. Speaker. I heard in testimony in our committee some of these young soldiers who were suffering from what is known as gulf war syndrome. Not just fatigue. Some had deformed limbs. some had scars on their bodies. very difficult anxiety that they are going through. I say this.

This bill removes the requirement for medical device manufacturers to keep a record of those people who receive pacemakers and heart valves. Why is that important? Because. if there is a defect in that lifesaving medical device. they cant find the patients. What results? Just a few years ago 300 Americans died. They had the BjorkShiley heart valve that was defective and they couldnt be found. Does it make sense for us to remove this responsibility of medical device manufacturers? Take a look on your desk at a letter from 27 different organizations representing patients across America who say it is only sensible to make certain that we track and keep track of those who are receiving these medical devices.

The Senators amendment strikes the agreement reached on these provisions among the bills sponsors. the FDA. and Senator KENNEDY. The FDA should have the discretion to decide when it makes sense to require device tracking or surveillance for a product. Current law requires tracking for certain product types and gives the FDA discretion to require tracking for other products. It is simply not necessary for every current and future device in the mandatory category to be subject to the tracking requirement. This provision allows FDA affirmatively to indicate which products in the mandatory category should be subject to tracking. FDA may use its discretion to add new products to the list of products which must be tracked. or put a product back on the list for tracking if evidence indicates the need. The FDA is overburdened. We want to free them up to do the things that need to be done.

This is the quote: U.S. Surgical is entering a new millennium in breast surgery by combining advanced stereotactic technology with minimal invasive surgery. Not biopsy. surgery. Unlike needle biopsies where small samples of the lesion are removed for pathological analysis. U.S. Surgical removes the entire specimen. That sounds like an operation to me. If the specimen proves to be cancerous but pathology reports the entire margin is clear. its up to the clinical judgment of the surgeon to decide to remove the additional tissue. or if the procedure can be considered complete. Translated. if you use this device and you take out the tumor. then it is the doctor who removes the tumor who makes the judgment whether he has to do any other surgery. That is not a biopsy needle. It continues. The U.S. Surgical system allows the surgeon to provide the benefits of the minimally invasive technique to breast surgery. Benefits to the patients Include reduced physical and emotional trauma as a woman undergoes only one versus two procedures. Minimal invasive breast surgery. a new standard of patient care offered only by United States Surgical Corporation. I rest my case on that. Mr. President. about advertising and promotion. I rest my case on exactly the words of that promotion. \"Minimal invasive breast surgery. a new standard of patient care offered only by United States Surgical Corporation.\" If there are Members in this body who want to say U.S. Surgical is not promoting it. that they are not associated with it. that they dont know anything about it.

This Advanced Breast Biopsy device. as it is called. does remove a larger amount of tissue than a conventional biopsy needle. Why? Why does it need to do that?

This needle allows clinicians to take a larger single sampling. rather than many. painful. smaller samples that could perhaps miss the tumor tissue. That is why this product was developed.

It is important for Members to understand that the agency can call. still call for a premarket action requiring full data on the safety and effectiveness whenever there is a technological difference arising. and I quote from the statute. \"that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness in the earlier approved device.\" This authority is premarket. In other words. the product is never cleared for marketing. It is never distributed before the agency has an opportunity to act. The authority is extremely broad. As soon as a product raises a question about safety and effectiveness. the agency can require the filing of a premarket authority. PMA. The agency retains full discretion to control the showing of safety and effectiveness. There are no words of limitation on that statutory authority. I point out that that authority has never been challenged successfully by a company in court. It was Senator KENNEDYS own committee. as chairman of the committee. his own committee report on safe medical devices in the 1990 Device Act that confirmed the breadth of this authority. and I quote from that report. However. notwithstanding data that may demonstrate comparable performance. the agency will not find the device substantially equivalent to a predicate device where the newer device raises different safety and effectiveness considerations than the predicate device.

The selection process requires the recipients to have pursued a course of study oriented toward public management at a graduate level. The final selection of interns is made by the head of the govemment. agency. or component within the Executive Office of the President in which the intern is to be employed. No more than 500 interns can be actively engaged at one time. However. interns who display exceptional aptitude and attitude may be granted competitive Civil Service status.

I had the distinct honor to have dinner with Mr. Wintley Phipps. who many Members know from his extraordinary singing during Mother Theresas visit a few weeks ago. Following that ceremony. I met with Mr. Phipps to discuss how we can ensure that some of our most underprivileged young people can participate in the amazing opportunities in the Information Age. He responded by assembling more than a dozen of the brightest minds in the AfricanAmerican community--educators. doctors. bankers. computer graphics specialists and others. They have developed what I believe is a brilliant plan to save those children most likely to be considered atrisk as well as reaching out to lower the recidivism rate in our prison populations. The group proposes. \"to build a national. faithbased. online academy that will facilitate and coordinate the training of as many as possible of Americas children at risk.\" This is a project which can be attained. Wintley Phipps and his associates idea is of such merit that I submit their statement into the RECORD and highly recommend studying it to all those either reading these printed words or viewing them on the THOMAS system.",

Because of this and for many other reasons. Mary A. Bunch has been named Grand Matriarch of the 1997 AfricanAmerican Heritage Celebration. Mrs. Bunch was bor in Florida in 1925 and knew at an early age that she wanted to serve people. While still young she was influenced by Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and Dr. Howard Thurman. two eminent educators who became her mentors. They encouraged her to pursue her education and after she graduated from the BrylinHaven Christian School for Girls in Florida. she moved to the Bronx. There she married Thomas Bunch. now deceased. and they had four children. She was active in her childrens education and worked in many areas with young girls. including the Girl Scouts. and also in the Salvation Army. In 1965. the Messiah Baptist Church was one of the first to host the Head Start Program and Mrs. Bunch was one of the first to work in it. She quickly rose to head teacher and was the first individual in Yonkers certified as a child development associate. someone qualified to teach with young children. She taught until her retirement 3 years ago. Even now she continues her good works at Rosary Hill with the incurably ill. with seniors at the Nepperhan Community Center. and at the Messiah Baptist Church School.",

Secretary Brown is a member of several organizations including the American Legion. Veterans of Foreign Wars. Jewish War Veterans. and many others. all which seek to fulfill the same purpose. providing for those that risked their lives to uphold democracy. Under Secretary Browns leadership. the benefits for veterans whom were prisoners of war has expanded. Secretary Brown also initiated the research on the causes of the mysterious Persian Gulf war illness. Adding to his accomplishments he hosted the first national summit for homeless veterans and established grants for those whom volunteer to house homeless veterans. In addition. under the leadership of Mr. Brown. the military healthcare system has expanded to fully cover the needs of our veterans. Mr. Speaker.

While I served there. even though we differed in great amounts. I think there was only one time we came to clash. when I thought I was being dealt with unfairly. but we have since resolved that with my friend. the gentleman from California . and the gentleman from South Carolina . a great chairman. and I think they have done just about everything they can do with a budget in a bipartisan way. But I would say. Mr. Chairman. this budget today. we are going to get American men and women killed. Men and women are going to die on the battlefield. They will not be trained and they are not equipped properly because of this budget. I am going to support this budget because I feel they have done everything they can with every ounce and every dollar that they can. Are they well equipped? No. Let me give my colleagues some examples. Before we trained to go to Vietnam and Desert Storm we had F16s to train us against Mig 29s. Mig 31s. SU27s. SU35s. We do not have those anymore. We do not have the dollars to invest in our adversary programs. They are gone. We have post Vietnam A4s and F5s to compete with. Captain OGrady. when we talk about training. Captain OGrady that was shot down in Bosnia. Mr. Chairman. he was not even trained in ACM. that is air combat maneuvering. because the money was not available to do that. That is a crime. We send our men and women to war and we do not even have the dollars to qualify them and train them. When we say the cold war is over. look what the threat is. The SU27 is far superior to our F14s and F15s. True. We do not have parity. Our last airplanes we bought. the F14 and 15. are 25 years old. The AA12 missile that the SU27 carries is far superior to our AMRAAM. That puts our kids behind the power curve and is going to mean their death.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 4 minutes. Mr. Chairman. it is difficult in times of peace. or what people perceive as a time of peace. to prepare for war. During the cold war and other times it was not difficult to point out to our people the perils we faced in a very hostile world. and so. therefore. it was not difficult to sustain a robust defense budget. In times of peace. people naturally ask. What is the threat? Why do we need a robust? We need it because. as someone said a long time ago. if we fail to prepare. we prepare to fail. I think it was Benjamin Franklin. History has shown that we continue to commit the same sins. After every war we always say. this is the end of conflict. The gentleman from Virginia referred to it in his remarks earlier today. Around the end of World War II. we disbanded in a headlong way the greatest military that the world has ever known. We came back home. and tried to get on with our Nations business. But we cannot control conflict. Who would have predicted Korea at the end of World War II? We were caught unprepared for Korea. We were. as the gentleman from California said. pushed all over the Korean peninsula. And. incidentally. we did not win in Korea. We had an armistice. We drew a line and tried to recoup and let it go at that. F] 1615 Then the same thing again. in Vietnam. It is not a matter of if we will have another war. it is just when it is going to be and where it is going to be. And our peril and the peril of all our citizens is great. I might say that I believe the primary duty of any central Federal Government is to do those things for people they cannot do for themselves or that local government cannot do. And national defense is the Federal Governments primary responsibility. If we are not strong and do not have a defense that can protect our freedoms they can be plundered away. I am reminded of the gospel according to Mark. when Jesus admonished the crowd. that \"no one can enter a strong mans house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man that indeed the house can be plundered.\"",

I really want to highlight and commend the gentleman from California and the gentleman from South Carolina for including in this committee bill a study of a proposal that I introduced to. expand the national mailorder pharmacy program to all Medicareeligible military retirees. This mailorder program would ensure the availability of an eligible pharmacy benefit for all eligible beneficiaries regardless of their geographic location. Unfortunately. the program today does not include the vast majority of our Nations Medicareeligible military retirees. That is why on June 3. I introduced legislation H.R. 1773 to expand the mailorder program to all our Nations Medicareeligible military retirees. This measure is supported by both the Air Force Sergeants Association and the Army Retirement Council. Mr. Chairman. one of the greatest hardships Medicareeligible military retirees face is the inability to obtain prescription drugs at reasonable prices. While Congress has authorized a mailorder pharmacy program and allowed retirees near designated base closure areas to participate. hundreds of thousands of other brave retired servicemen and women will be locked out unless action is taken. In 1993. Congress unanimously affirmed in the National Defense Authorization Act that members and former members of the uniformed services should have access under the health care delivery system of the uniformed services regardless of age. I could not agree more. The DOD has an implied moral commitment to provide this care to all military beneficiaries. Mr. Chairman. let us not just make this a study. let us make it a reality. By supporting the expansion of the mailorder program. we can send a clear message that the passage of time does not erase either the service that our military retirees gave nor our Governments obligation to their wellbeing.",

Now. we can say that we understand that when we deploy people in 40 nations of the world. when they are employed. it may not be the best living conditions. But when we have them in the United States. it is shameful. shameful for us not to provide decent living conditions for our young men and women in the services. My colleague. the gentleman from California was a marine. The Marine Corps is 40 years behind in modernizing their living facilities. their dormitories. their barracks. and their family housing.

Our domestic spending has increased while the defense budget has been steadily going down. to its lowest levels since the Korean war.

Perhaps because the cold war was like no other conflict in our Nations history. we have seemed slow to recognize our debt to those who made victory possible.

We lived with the threat of a nuclear war that could shatter the Earths environment and destroy civilization. We shouldered the awesome responsibilities of standardbearer for the Free World. We sent our military personnel to the far corners of the globe. During the cold war. dedicated Americans. in and out of uniform. rose to the longterm challenge of protecting their democratic institutions and the future of the Free World. Some 24 million soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines served around the world. More than 100.000 lost their lives fighting communism in Korea. Vietnam. and other foreign battlegrounds.

Professor Brittain has been a member of the faculty of the University of Connecticut law schools since 1977. For those two decades. he has been a constant presence in my State. a voice of conscience that is heard whenever the rights of individuals are at stake. John Brittain knows that the Nations promise of equality under the law must never be allowed to become mere words. That promise is the central tenet of American life. and it must be kept for the sake of all our future generations. So John Brittain has made it his cause to see that the promise is kepteven when it is difficult and even when it is uncomfortable. In 1989. Professor Brittain. among others. filed Sheff versus ONeill. the landmark case challenging the racial. economic. and educational segregation between Hartford and the surrounding schools districts as a denial of a students fundamental right to an equal education under the Connecticut Constitution.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to urge America Online [AOL] to be up front with its customers over the issue of informed consent for telemarketing purposes. An AOL subscriber myself. I was outraged when I learned the company planned to market its 8.5 million customers telephone numbers to scores of telemarketing hucksters. without informing them or getting their consent. Under a siege of protests. the Internet provider canceled that plan but instituted another that still breaks faith with its subscribers. Now it plans to allow its own employees to make the telemarketing calls. AOL still doesnt get it. Families sitting down to dinner do not want to be disturbed by unsolicited vendors. The company needs to make it clear to its customers up front what use it plans to make of their private information and then give them an easy option for protecting themselves from the unauthorized use of that data. And I emphasize \"easy.\" If youve ever tried to opt out of AOLs marketing gimmicks. you know how hard it is. Good luck in even finding the option on the companys Web site. What AOL should do is display a popup notification box informing subscribers of any new marketing schemes using customers phone numbers and other personal information. This notification box should contain a simple yes or no option for customers to inform AOL of their decision whether to allow the company to release their personal information. or to permit AOLs own employees to market other companies products to them. AOL also needs to call itself to a higher standard. Originally. it said it was collecting its subscribers phone numbers so it could call them if their account was tampered with or if their credit card was stolennot for telemarketing purposes. Its revised plan amounts to a baitandswitch tactic. This whole saga is another example of how an incredibly useful and powerful medium can abuse the public trust. With power must come responsibility. And if online companies arent willing to police themselves. Congress may very well do it for them. I have sponsored a bipartisan bill to safeguard the privacy of citizens Social Security numbers and other personal information by restricting their marketability by credit bureaus. departments of motor vehicles. and the Internet. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1813. the Personal Information Privacy Act.",

He is a cell biologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. which is in the Fourth Congressional District of Colorado. The Enrico Fermi Award recognizes extraordinary scientific research and is awarded through the U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. Mortimer Elkind was born in Brooklyn. NY. and earned his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda. MD. and the Donner Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. He also worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1969 to 1973. and then worked at Argonne National Laboratory until 1981. He was also Professor of Radiology at the University of Chicago. He is currently University Distinguished Professor at Colorado State Universitys Department of Radiological Health Sciences. Dr. Elkind worked conjunctively with another Fermi Award winner. Dr. Withers to research the response of normal and malignant cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively. their work established a scientific basis for radiation therapy for cancer. Their work produced the \"fractional hypothesis\" which demonstrated the value of spreading out the radiation dose treatment over time for the best effects. Dr. Elkinds work has significantly contributed to cancer treatment affecting almost 50 percent of cancer patients today in assisting them with care. This extraordinary work has tremendously impacted cancer research and I am proud of this service to the American people through his association with Colorado State University. The effects of cancer on our society are extremely devastating. so it is Dr. Elkinds kind of dedication to research and mankind that illuminates the human spirit in America.

This bill today. the Energy and Water appropriations bill. which has been so well crafted by the chairman. JOSEPH MCDADE and the ranking member Vic FAZIO. includes $160 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC]. This bill represents a cut below the Presidents request and is less than half the amount appropriated 15 years ago. If nonDefense discretionary programs had been reduced like this. we would have a balanced budget this year. It is important to note that since the ARC was created over 30 years ago. the economic condition in the Appalachian Region has significantly improved. Poverty rates have been cut in half. infant mortality has been reduced by twothirds. and good paying jobs have been created through infrastructure improvements. But our job is not done. Businesses are closing and others refusing to locate in northern Alabama due to the lack of a fourlane highway to connect the cities of Atlanta. Birmingham. and Memphis.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of full funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Federal support is necessary to ensure that broad access to the arts is possible for citizens of all economic backgrounds and all regions of the country. Today. arts agencies in all 50 states and 6 territories receive federal funding through the NEA to support the arts. Prior to the creation of the NEA. few state arts councils awarded grants. Arts funding in this country rests on the combined support of federal. state. and local public dollars. as well as private donations. Federal dollars are essential in leveraging other support. For example. in FY 1997. $99.5 million in federal dollars was matched with $280 million in state support and $675 million in local funding. Last week. the House Committee on Appropriations voted 3127 to provide funding for the NEA. Now. the Republican majority is seeking to undermine the work of the Committee. and set back arts in this country by passing a rule that will allow NEA funding to be zeroed out. Opponents of the NEA suggest there is little accountability at the agency. However. over the last several years. the NEA has made substantial changes to address Congressional concerns and also make it more responsive to the public. Recently. six Members of Congress were added to the NEA advisory body. a new NEA Chairman was unanimously approved by the Senate. and a new grant award program was established to provide for a more equal distribution of arts funds to underserved states. In addition. the NEA also implemented changes in its grant award program to improve accountability by prohibiting the shifting of funds from one project to another. The NEA has been responsive to concerns raised by Congress and the public. New attempts to cut funding to this agency are without merit. Given that last month the Supreme Court upheld the use by the NEA of \"general standards of decency\" in awarding grants. the current attacks on the NEA for funding controversial projects are unwarranted. Over the last three decades. the NEA has substantially increased arts activity in every state in this country. Federal support is needed to ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to discover and enrich their lives by experiencing the arts. I urge my colleagues to support full funding for the NEA.",

I rise today to make a few observations about the Secret Services position on a \"Protective Function Privilege\" that should exist between the President of the United States and his security detail. In his ruling denying the Secret Services request for a stay last week. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist stated \"in my view. the [Administration] * * * has not demonstrated that * enforcing subpoenas [in this case] * * would cause irreparable harm\". I beg to differ. Not only do I believe that there is irreparable harm here. but I also believe that the Secret Services legal theory stands on firm footing. Furthermore. this decision may cause the President of the United States to push away his \"protective envelope\". and as a result. make him more vulnerable to assassination. In this country. we have a profound respect for certain types of relationships. These important relationships are often protected by the law for several reasons. First. because of their value. Many of these relationships. like the doctorpatient. the attorneyclient. the priestpenitent and the spousal privilege. are important not only because they are woven from the very fabric of our society. but also because they represent relationships which are necessary for our social institutions to function effectively. It is a rationale well accepted by our courts. for instance. in the case of United States v. United Shoe Machine Corporation. where the court shared its thoughts on the worth of the attorneyclient privilege when it said \"the social good derived from the proper performance of the functions of lawyers acting on [behalf of] their clients is believed to outweigh the harm that may come from the suppression of the evidence in specific cases.\" 89 F.

Mr. President. I want to make clear that the amendment we propose absolutely would not exempt Indian tribal governments and Indian gaming from the purview of the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act. Rather. the amendment allows only the conduct of those games with the application of technologynot internet technologybut the application of television and satellitegenerated technology that we envisioned could be used for the conduct of bingo or games that are subject to a tribalstate compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The language on page eleven of Senator KYLs amendment makes it abundantly clear that each perscn placing or receiving or otherwise making a bet or wager must be physically loeated on Indian land and that class III games must be conducted consistent with a tribalstate compact and only in the state to which the compact applies. So we are not proposing to exempt Indian gaming from the internet gaming prohibitions outlined in Senator KYLs amendment. Secondly. I would want my colleague from Arizona to know that as we read it. there is an ambiguity in the amendment. States are authorized to enforce the provisions of this amendment. should it become law. for violations by a person. The term \"person\" includes \"any government\"-which must refer to tribal governments. because all other levels of government are specifically mentioned. Thus. while one section of the bill would restrict state authority to what is provided in tribal state compacts. another section of the bill gives states broad authority to enforce the act as It may relate to the conduct of tribal governments. Senator CRAIGs amendment would simply preserve the status quo and maintain the integrity of the pervasive fedieral regulatory scheme in which federal criminal laws are enforced by the United States on Indian landsa framework. which as I said last evening. has been in place for over one hundred years. I thank my colleague from Idaho and I wish to assure my colleague from Arizona that I look forward to continuing to work with him as this bill proceeds to conference to address these two matters that I have outlined.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Senator from Idaho wishes to close. Therefore. let me reiterate the key points that the Senator from New Jersey. and also the Senators from Wyoming and Nevada. have made. that is. that you cannot have any exceptions to a national prohibition on Internet gambling if you want the policy to work. because if anyone can do it. then the gambling can occur in the homes. in the privacy of the homes around this country by children. by problem gamblers. or by anyone else if there is any exception because the Internet reaches across interstate boundaries. It knows no boundaries. It reaches into any State. And no State can protect its citizens and protect its public policy of outlawing this activity.. I want to make it very clear that this activity is not being conducted legally today. In a letter written by the State attorneys general. including the attorney general of Idaho on this precise point. the attorneys general said. If Internet gaming is allowed to facilitate the remote placing of bets on an Indian gaming activity. the ultimate absurdity would result. The logical consequence of such a position is that any offreservation telephone. computer with a modum et cetera. would become a gambling device by which the consumer could communicate with the tribe for the purpose of gambling. And they specifically refer to the Coeur dAlene Tribe in Idaho. which is the tribe that the Senator from Idaho wants to permit to gamble. I urge a vote against the Craig amendment.",

I have a long history of being interested in and concerned about the rights and guarantees that we have given Indian tribes. We have one in my home -State that has been very industrious. They are really good entrepreneurs and good citizens. I enjoy working with them very much. But this is something beyond that. This would give them ability to get into Internet gambling in a way that it could go into every school and every home all across America. This is not about tribal rights on their reservation or within their tribal areas. This goes across America. To have a special carveout for Indian tribes on gambling. I think. is just a fundamental mistake. I understand why the Senator from Idaho feels he must do that. I understand that there have been some court actions about it. But I also think there is a fundamental principle here. And this violates that principle. They should not be given an opportunity that nobody else in America would have. It touches all Americans. I am always hesitant to rise in opposition to my friend and my coleader in the Republican Party. But I think in this instance he is just fundamentally wrong.

Sponsored by my colleague Representative GILCHREST. the legislation establishes a three year demonstration program of methods of manage nutria populations and to restore marshlands damaged by the destructive creature. Mr. President. Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is one of the real treasures and showplaces of our National Wildlife Refuge system. Established in the early 1930s to help preserve migratory waterfowl. the 20.000 acre refuge has become one of the chief wintering areas for Canada geese along the Atlantic Flyway. It is also home for the endangered Delmarva Fox Squirrel and more than 200 species of birds. As all who visit the refuge quickly discover. Blackwater is a very special place: a haven for fish and wildlife . a land of exceptional beauty. and a vital part of the natural heritage and quality of life that we enjoy in Maryland. Unfortunately the Refuge and surrounding wetlands are being threatened by the prolific and highly invasive nonindigenous species nutria which are destroying the tidal marshes and even displacing other native species. Over the past three decades. the population of nutria in Maryland has grow exponentially from about 150 to as many as 150.000a thousand fold increase. During that same period. Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge has lost more than 40 percent of its marshesapproximately 7.000 of 17.000 acres--due. in large part. to nutria. As nutria population densities continue to increase. so does the range of the creature and its associated ecological damage. In order to respond to this threat. the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. the University of Maryland and more than a dozen other partners have joined together to develop a plan to address march loss and control of nutria. The goal of this three year pilot program is to develop methods for intensive control of the nutria populations and to restore damaged marsh habitats. This legislation authorizes the Federal funds necessary to carry out the program. I urge adoption of the legislation.",

In 1968. Congress appropriated $5.9 million for this settlement. In 1972. Congress passed legislation to provide for the distribution of this award to the three Tribes. Twentyfive percent ($1.5 million) was set aside for lineal descendants who are not tribal members. Funds were distributed to the Devils Lake Sioux and the SissetonWahpeton Sioux in 1974. and a partial distribution was made to the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribe in 1979. However. because the original judgment did not include shares for the lineal descendants. the issue has been tied up in litigation and the lineal descendants share of the funds has remained undistributed since the passage of distribution legislation in 1972. Since that time. the interest on the fund has grown to nearly $15 million. The bill we have approved today will distribute 71.6005 percent of these funds to the lineal descendants. and 28.3995 percent to the Tribes. I say again. as I have said on numerous occasions. this situation has gone on long enough. Neither the Tribes nor the lineal descendants benefit from these funds being tied up in court. The Indian Affairs Committee has worked with the Tribes. the Department of the Interior. and representatives of the lineal descendants to craft the compromise embodied in this legislation. Mr. President. I am pleased by the passage of this legislation. which helps finalize a judgment made three decades ago. This legislation is a fair compromise. one that will help break the stalemate that has prevented the distribution of these judgment funds. I thank my colleagues for their support and assistance.",

The administration and this Congress have been starving the Forest Service. while giving them ever more and more expensive obligations. many of which have tremendous merit. If we look at the backlogs to meet the environmental guidelines of the Presidents forest plan in my region. it would sop up virtually the entire budget of the United States Forest Service. We are simply not funding many meritorious activities.

If we look at her augmenting those programs. it would take them up to 30 and 40 percent of the annual objective. again. programs that benefit the environment. that reinvest in our forests. We have been treating our forests like cash cows for much too long. and now people are unwilling to reinvest in the resource. That is pointed out by this issue of the KV Funds. The KV Funds are spent for meritorious purposes. reforestation and related environmentally beneficial activities consequent to timber sales. Everybody agrees that those are activities that should be carried out. But the problem here is that since we are starving the Forest Service in many other budgets. they are attributing an. I think. unusually high overhead to this program so that they can move their funds around. And they are very. very messy and unaccountable accounting practices which we have held hearings on.",

It says: Eliminating the KV overhead indirect costs will have substantial repercussions for the agency. The indirect nonproject costs of the agency cannot be eliminated and support accomplishment of program work. Costs such as rent. utilities unemployment comp. and program supervision are necessary costs to support KV accomplishments. According to the May 6. 1998. report on indirect charges in five funds. the KV Fund paid for $51.169.000 in fiscal year 1997. As mentioned above. if KV could not pay for these costs. the Forest Services appropriated funds would have to be responsible for them. This would result in less program accomplishment in reforestation. timber stand improvement. wildlife. watershed Improvements. and other appropriated resource areas.. In addition. the plain language of the National Forest System Appropriation excludes general administrative support to funds such as KV. Therefore. to charge appropriated funds would place the Forest Service in violation of its National Forest System Appropriations language on GA. and in violation of congressional intent. if not appropriation language on all other direct costs. So. I understand why we would like to preserve the funds. but we have to pay it somewhere. If we do not pay the indirect costs of the KV out of the KV Fund. then we will take money away from all of those other programs and things like timber stand reforestation improvement and wildlife. which the gentleman and I are both strong supporters of.

It is going here because the chief spends 4 percent of his time on KV Fund. so 4 percent of his salary. I mean. when we add them up. they do not add up to 100 percent.

This is one of those things where. once again. we have kind of bad fiscal policy here mixed with the environment. and it ends up with bad policy for everyone. And that is why the taxpayers organizations are supporting this amendment. that is why the environmental organizations are supporting this amendment. Because. in fact. if we can bring this back under the control of the Committee on Appropriations. if we can make these people go into the regular fund for administrative overhead. which is millions and millions and millions of dollars for the Forest Service. then we can have some accountability in this program. and we can go back to many of the areas in the gentlemans State. in my State and other Members States that have never been properly reforested. And the cry always is. there is not money to do this. Well. apparently the money has been diverted for a whole host of reasons. most of which most Members of Congress never knew about until the joint oversight hearing. where it was exposed in the GAO reports and the Inspectors General reports. And I am just dealing with one of these funds. This is true of a whole series of these funds where they have now determined this is somehow their Godgiven right. to go in there and dip into costs that they want to cover that the Congress has not approved.",

How can we say we are going to take 25 percent of these needed KV funds for reforestation and environmental investment and divert it arbitrarily for whatever purpose? Twentyfive percent is high in anybodys book. But for an ongoing. existing agency which does not have to go out and rent new space. does not have to go out and buy new vehicles. does not even have to hire new employees. because for many of them it is only part of their time. 25 percent seems very high to me and an arbitrary number.",

It is whatever the Secretary of Agriculture. who is one of our former colleagues. determines it be used for. And what the gentleman is saying is that he has no confidence in the Secretary of Agriculture. But aside from all that. this amendment takes out the ability to manage these funds. So suddenly we have a sizable chunk of money. probably $150 million or more. with no ability to manage it. It is just there. The Treasury will be happy. They will have the money. And instead of spending it on timber stand improvement. wildlife habitat management. inland fisheries habitat management. anadromous fisheries habitat. threatened. or endangered species. watershed improvements. instead of that. the money goes to the Treasury. Now. we recognize what the gentleman is saying. that this is a problem. We are trying to get it under control. We have reduced the amount that can be expended on indirect charges from 35 percent to 25 percent. The authorizing committee is addressing this problem and is trying to get it on budget where it belongs and eliminate the problems that have happened. We have to phase it out over a period of 3 years simply because there are a number of projects that are underway that need to be completed. We have tried very strenuously. and the gentleman from Washington is part of the subcommittee. to make accountability a part of our goal. I do not disagree with the gentleman from California.

The 1990 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act taught Congress a number of tough lessons. At the time. I took on the leader of my party. then President Bush. and. along with every other House Republican. opposed the 1990 bill because of its huge tax increases. The bill enacted the infamous luxury taxes on boats. automobiles and other goods in order to \"tax the rich.\" What I predicted at the time was confirmed when the U.S. boat and aircraft industries were hit hard economically as a result of these socalled \"tax the rich\" policies. The rich were not harmed. rather U.S. workers were out of jobs when consumers stopped buying goods subject to luxury taxes. While Congress has since worked to repeal these harmful luxury taxes. there are a few remaining tax inequities from that 1990 bill. The federal gas guzzler tax attempted to force better gas mileage from automobiles in the U.S. by overtaxing cars that exceeded government mandated fuel economy standards. Congress in 1986 provided an exemption from the gas guzzler tax for small automobile manufacturers. Those benefitting from this tax relief were the small coach builders who modify existing automobiles into limousines. Unfortunately. the 1990 tax bill repealed this small business exemption. thus subjecting the small coach builders again to the gas guzzler tax.",

It claims more victims than breast cancer. prostate cancer and AIDS combined. yet it receives little attention from Congress. the media and the medical community. It is time that Congress demonstrate its commitment to head injury patients and expand our efforts to treat and cure brain injuries. Each year. more than 2 million Americans are involved in an incident which results in head injury. Approximately 100.000 victims die and 500.000 will require hospitalization. Traumatic brain injury can strike anyone and leave devastating results. Trauma to the head can result in significant impairment to an individuals physical. psychosocial and cognitive functional abilities. TBI affects the victims whole family both emotionally and economically and often results in immense medical and rehabilitative expenses. The direct and indirect costs of TBI are $25 billion per year. In 1996. Congress passed the Traumatic Brain Injury Act which authorized the NIH to expand research studies and establish innovative programs regarding traumatic brain injury. We must now provide the NIH with sufficient funding so that exciting new research. such as regeneration. can reach the clinical stage and give victims and their families new hope. I urge my colleagues to support NIH brain injury funding so that we can help save Amercans from the devastation of Traumatic Brain Injury.",

Although Nick served honorably in World War II and narrowly escaped death. he rarely spoke of his service and kept the memories buried for many years. In June of 1944. as a Ranger scout with the Second Ranger Battalion. he scaled the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc on the Normandy coast of France to destroy enemy bunkers. He was one of 24 out of 120 who reached the top in a barrage of gunfire and grenades. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge and was taken prisoner. In December of 1944. he was lined up with his fellow prisoners in a column three men deep to be shot. but miraculously escaped a bullet in the massacre by the German guards. Covered with bodies. Nick lay still so the soldiers with bayonets did not notice him. The man on top of him was stabbed to death by a bayonet and Nicks leg was cut. He hid for several days before making his way back to friendly lines--one of only a handful who survived this massacre of American prisoners of war in Malmedy. Belgium. After the war. he returned as an Army sergeant to his life in Los Lentes. New Mexico where his family had lived since the 1600s. When jobs became scarce. he became the first of his family to leave this area. and he moved to National City. California. Here he established himself in the construction industry and became a leader in the community. He was especially active in the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was president of an Hispanic social organization in the 1970s. His was a wonderful life. He was a man who did his duty to his country. who contributed to his community. and who raised his family well. He is survived by Eloise. his wife of 56 years. and his children. Rosalie Ortega. George Baca. Robert Baca and Herman Baca. who is a prominent MexicanAmerican activist in San Diego Countyalong with 18 grandchildren and 11 great grandchildren.

I would like to recognize Fort Monmouth Army Base in my district. New Jerseys twelfth. which was \"home\" to the Signal Corps for 58 years of crucial advances in military communications. On June 21. 1860. the Signal Corps was born. the brainchild of Albert James Myer. an Army doctor who believed there should be a trained. professional military signal service. From its first use in New Mexico during a Navajo expedition. to its use during the Civil War. the Spanish American War. the two World Wars. the Korean and Vietnam Wars to the present day. the Signal Corps has provided necessary communication devices which have protected the lives of the men and women who have advanced the cause of freedom. Fort Monmouth was \"home\" to the Signal Corps School from 1917 to 1975. As the center for signal education. as well as major laboratory. Fort Monmouth played an important role in the major world conflicts of this time period. Early radiotelephones developed at Fort Monmouth were used in the European theater during World War I. The first Army radar was developed in 1938. This new technology. as well as the development of the tactical FM radio. were important communications devices which helped to lead the Allies to victory in World War II. These innovations are still used today. by military and nonmilitary. alike. Fort Monmouth has also made major contributions to the development of space communications. \"Project Diana\" in 1946 successfully bounced electronic signals off of the moon. a milestone on the road to space communication\" Solarpowered batteries. typewriters for space shuttles. and communications satellites were some of the other advances developed at Fort Monmouth. Though no longer home to the Signal School. Fort Monmouth continues to serve as an important technological logistics. and training center. Today. Fort Monmouth serves as home to CECOM. the Armys Communication and Electronic Command. I would like to thank the men and women of Fort Monmouth for their continuing dedication to the protection and promotion of freedom. I am confident that their important work will continue well into the next millennium.",

In my case. like my friend. the gentleman from Arkansas . I have a Laura and a Rachel. I also have a Jane. Emily. Elizabeth. and another possibly on the way. As we consider the issue before us. it is in the context. of course. of this growth in unmarried teens having pregnancies leaving us a legacy of single family homes. higher welfare costs. and extensive juvenile crime. Everyone agrees that something should be done. On one side some believe that easy access to contraceptives will make the problem go away. Others. including me. believe that the fundamental problem is the diminished role of the family. not the lack of pharmaceuticals. Families are the building blocks of our society and even the best clinician can never be the equal to a caring parent when a child begins to think about sex. That is why I support the ManzulloIstook amendment and why I oppose the Castle amendment. It sets forth a simple minimal standard when it comes to taxpayerfunded contraceptives for our children. that is. that parents must be at least notified before services are provided. As legal and moral guardians of our children. we as parents have a right to know. We require parental consent before giving immunization or providing surgery to minors. We must at least notify one parent before a child is given birth control. Parents. not clinic workers. must be able to help their children with such sensitive decisions. and parents deserve the opportunity to make their views known to the child before the child makes a life altering decision. This measure reaffirms and reinforces our central role as parents in the lives of our children. If this Congress believes that Government should strengthen families. not pull them apart. we will reinforce parental authority by supporting this amendment. One of the unintended consequences of this law. title X. birth control funding. is that the Federal Government becomes the widely recognized schoolmaster who our children then look to in making decisions about morality. That is the impropriety of our current situation and why I support the IstookManzullo amendment.",

In fact. studies show that 80 percent of teens who currently seek family planning advice at clinics would stop going if they had to ask their parents. Only 1 percent of those kids would stop sexual relations. This amendment would effectively increase the number of abortions. increase teen pregnancies. increase the spread of sexually transmitted disease and increase the spread of AIDS. Whether we are asking for parental consent or parental notification. the result is the same: Confidentiality is crushed and. with it. the intent of the program. How many times a day do we ask our teenagers to act responsibly? Let us give them the freedom to do as we ask. We can encourage our young people to consult their parents. we can ask parents to be there for their children. but we as a government simply cannot mandate these sorts of relationships. Mr. Chairman.

It is very clear that if you provide notification. the young people from dysfunctional families. the ones that cannot talk to their parents. are the very ones that will never get the services. I have heard the gentleman from Oklahoma say over and over again. he does not know of any cases being reported of sexual abuse by title X clinics. It is not very convincing to me that that is a fact. The fact that he does not know it means nothing to me. I do not know that I have the statistics available. but let me say that the laws of 50 States require that sexual abuse be reported and adding a Federal law to say the very same thing is not going to change whatever the result may be. I have also heard a number of Members out here quoting the statistics from 1970 on and suggesting that we are far worse off in terms of teen pregnancies and the like. No doubt. But where would we have been without title X clinics? We have gone through a sexual revolution in this country where all the old taboos in the 1960s went out the window. At least title X clinics were there to provide some guidance and some responsibility and prevented. I think. in many cases many. many unwanted. unplanned pregnancies that otherwise would have occurred and many cases of sexually transmitted diseases. We have heard over and over again this evening about a 14yearold girl who was sexually abused by her high school teacher. The fact of the matter is that that is the use of innuendo. in my judgment. in the worst possible way. This relationship began a year before the victim ever went to the title X clinic. There is not any question about that. The clinic did not know about this relationship. It did not cause it. If anything. it prevented the 14yearold from becoming pregnant.

It is tough for a sexually active teenager to talk about contraception with a parent. Even for a teen who has a close. supportive relationship with her parents. For an adolescent with abusive parents. it can be downright dangerous. Because they fear parental disapproval or punishment. many teenagers will only use confidential family planning services. When parental permission is required. these teenagers tend to delay or altogether avoid. reproductive health care at great danger to themselves rather than abstain from the sexual activity that leads to children bearing children. We all would like to believe that requiring parental consent will reduce teen sexual activity. Unfortunately there is no such evidence. We all agree that family participation is ideal and title X counselors are required to encourage teen clients to talk with their families about birth control.

Today. 82 percent of teen pregnancies are unintended. and over half of these pregnancies will end in abortion. Each year. the family planning services provided by title X clinics prevent 386.000 unintended teen pregnancies. avoiding 155.000 births and 183.000 abortions. Despite this progress. opponents of title X funding continue their attempts to dismantle the title X program. this time under the guise of protecting vulnerable teenagers. - The Istook amendment will not protect teenagers from sexual abuse. But it will ensure that more of the Nations most vulnerable teens wont use birth control. more will get pregnant. and more will have abortions. The Istook amendment places teens health at risk. Teens who are prevented from seeking family planning services at these clinics will no longer benefit from the other services these clinics provide. including screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. routine gynecological exams. and breast and cervical cancer screening. The castle substitute protects Americas youth. It encourages family participation in the decision of minors to seek family planning services.

And it requires these programs to counsel minors on how to resist and avoid coercive sexual relationships.

What we have is another attempt to do away with the title X program. which provides funding for family planning services. Services provided under title X reach out to many of Americas teenagers who are already at risk in their everyday lives. Family planning services are one way that these teenagers can receive guidance and education about issues confronting them about sex. reproductive health. contraception. and prevention of disease. By requiring teens to obtain parental consent in order to receive family planning services. and by mandating clinics to notify parents that their children are seeking such services. the Istook amendment will have the effect of decimating the entire family planning system in our country. The teens we need to be most concerned aboutthe teens we are trying to prevent from having unwanted pregnancies or contracting a sexually transmitted diseasewould become even more endangered if this parental mandate were to take effect. Perhaps many people are forgetting what it means to be an atrisk teen. Atrisk teens are not the children of many of us in this room today. Atrisk teens are not the children of parents they can talk to freely about many important issues and values that are affecting their everyday lives. Atrisk teens are more often trying to escape sexual or physical abuses within their own homeseven from their own parents. I encourage every teenager to talk with their parents about these very important issues and parents to talk responsibly with their children. That is why I am in support of a substitute amendment offered by my colleague. Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Castle substitute will require that title X programs encourage the involvement of parents when teens seek family planning services. Encouraging parental involvement is important. and in and ideal world. all teens would have parents they could feel comfortable talking to and be able to sort out what kind of activity is appropriate. But in the real world. we can not take away an opportunity for atrisk teens to receive essential services. by forcing a mandate upon them that will not work in the real world.

Mr. Speaker. which are nothing short of extraordinary. She is a 15yearold who has battled leukemia and still receives monthly chemotherapy to fight this terrible and life threatening disease. However. Mindy has not allowed her illness to stop her from caring about those around her. As a patient in a Pittsburgh Ronald McDonald House. Mindy was not permitted to visit the common television viewing room during a critical stage in her fight against leukemia because she couldnt risk infection while being exposed to others. While recuperating at her home in Altoona. Mindy made crafts and sold them to family and friends in order to purchase a new television set for the facility. Her concern for others who were sick and staying at the facility didnt stop there. and Mindy began a campaign to persuade local groups and businesses to donate more television sets to the Pittsburgh Ronald McDonald House. Her efforts have allowed 10 of the 15 bedrooms at the facility to have brand new television sets in them. Mindy Elvey had stated. \"I just wanted to do something nice.\" For her selfless determination Mindy Elvey is being honored tomorrow. along with other outstanding citizens from around the country. at the Seventh Annual \"Make A Difference Day.\" hosted by USA Weekend Magazine and the Points of Light Foundation.

The National Marrow Donor Program maintains a Registry of more than three million potential marrow donors and is facilitating more than onehundred transplants per month. Currently. the organizations operating funds come from the Health Resources and Services Administration. which is part of the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services. The coordinating center is located in Minneapolis. Minnesota. In 1990. a walkathon entitled \"Because I Care\" was held in Longview. Texas. in my Congressional district. to help two leukemia patients. Bryan Quinn and A Edwards. Stemming from that initial event has risen the \"Because I Care Campaign.\" a volunteer grassroots effort in support of the National Marrow Donor Program. It has since become an international campaign supporting the national programs global outreach. Thousands of people have been tissue typed. and millions more have become aware of the National Marrow Donor Program as a result of the \"Because I Care Campaign.\" The campaign is coordinated by a volunteer.

Because they are not confident they have the votes to defeat the NEA in a fair and open vote. The rule is a cynical attempt to prevent the elected representatives of the American people from even voting for or against abolishing a major Government agency. Instead. the rule permits the Ehlers amendment. which is nothing but a snare and a delusion. That amendment would abolish the NEA and instead distribute $600. on average. to every school district for the arts. $600 to all school districts. To what use could they put that? What is really at stake is the availability of art to the American people across the country. Before the NEA there were 58 orchestras in the country. Today there are more than 1.000. Before the NEA there were 37 professional dance companies. Now there are 300. Before the NEA. there were 1 million people who attended the theater each year. Today more than 55 million attend.

The underlying bill is an excellent example of doing more with less. We are going to save money by focusing our limited resource in priority areas. Even though this bill spends $100 million less than last years appropriation. it still provides important funding increases for our national parks. the National Forest System. and the National Wilderness Refuges. which many Americans and American children use. Especially important for my home State of Florida. this is a vehicle for the crucial Everglades restoration funds. These funds permit us to meet the Federal commitment in our ongoing effort to restore and preserve for future generations. especially our children. the unique river of grass. Another important provision is the extension of the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas exploration moratorium. which protects Floridas fragile coastline from oil slicks and pollution. Each year for the last 13 years Congress has passed this moratorium. and I am pleased that the committee has once again seen fit to include this commonsense measure.

The arts employ approximately 174.000 New Yorkers and attract millions of tourists annually. producing an estimated $13 billion in revenue.

And because there is this constant pressure by the nuclear lobby to constrict the timelines. to shorten all of the opportunities for public comment. this legislation. and S. 104. would certainly fit within the same categoryis not going to enjoy public confidence. Indeed. the very point that the Senator has made on many occasions on the floor is true. that the 1998 timeframe. which has been invoked by the proponents of S. 104 as if it were a date carved in stone. attested to by all of the deities. is. in fact. a deadline which the scientific community urged not to be placed in the legislation for the very reason the Senator inquired of the junior Senator from Nevada. the timeline was unrealistic. So. now. in effect they are using their argument of 1998 to. in effect. bootstrap their argument that 1998 will come and there will be no permanent resolution to it. and. therefore. we need this illconceived proposal that is before us.",

But then. as now. the nuclear utilities were urging the Congress to adopt interim storage. they then were called away from reactor storage. The statements were made during the floor debate that if this were. in fact. not done. that within the next 3 years. by 1983. nuclear utilities would have to close down and there would be brownouts. As the senior Senator from Nevada knows. that was 1980. In a sense. if you took the date off that legislation and inserted the words \"interim storage\" for \"AFR.\" it would be identical to the context of the debate. If the senior Senator from Nevada will fndulge me for a moment. this is what was said by the then chairman of the Energy Committee. Mr. Johnston. the distinguished Senator from Louisiana: Mr. President. this billReferring to the AFR legislationdeals comprehensively with the problem of civilian nuclear waste. It is an urgent problemBounds somewhat familiar. does it not? Mr. President. for this Nation. It is urgent. first. because we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of the fuel. and if we do not build what we call awayfromreactor storage and begin that soon. we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983.... I say to my friend from Nevada. that is. in essence. the debate that we heard in 1996. Just substitute a date and put it 3 or 4 years into the future. Those are the opening comments made by the chairman of the Energy Committee that we Just heard. This is the nuclear utility refrain. It has become kind of a mantra. their Holy Grail. and. in point of fact. as the senior Senator from Nevada well knows. that is simply not the case. That is scare tactics. that is hysteria.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am proud to introduce the Equal Remedies Act of 1997. for myself and 13 other sponsors. The purpose of our legislation is to end a glaring inequality in the current Federal antidiscrimination laws. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave women. religious minorities. and disabled persons the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment discrimination. but only up to specified monetary limits. By contrast. victims of such discrimination on the basis of race or national origin can recover damages without such limitations. The Equal Remedies Act of 1997 will end this double standard by removing the caps on damages for victims of intentional job discrimination on the basis of sex. religion. or disability. No one should be subject to secondclass remedies under our civil rights laws. Victims of .discrimination who suffer injuries deserve a full remedy for those injuries. without arbitrary limits. The caps serve no justifiable purpose. The standard of proof and the definition of intentional discrimination are identical under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the longstanding race discrimination statute. There is no reason to expect significantly more litigation. or significantly larger jury awards if the caps are removed. For the vast majority of victims of intentional discrimination. the caps do not affect the amount of damages. But. for othersvictims with the most serious injuries from Intentional discriminationthe caps are an unfair barrier to recovering full damages for their injuries. Employers who have committed the most outrageous acts of discrimination will no longer be shielded from full responsibility. The double standard in current law protects the worst lawbreakers and denies relief to those who have been harmed the most. By enacting the Equal Remedies Act of 1997. Congress will be affirming the basic principle of equal justice for all Americans. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation may be printed in the RECORD.",

Harold Stassen has an outstanding record of public and military service to America. There is no question that his unique contributions have left a lasting impression on not only the history of his home State and his country. but at an international level as well. In 1938. at the age of 31. Harold Stassen was elected Governor of Minnesota and remained our Nations youngest Governor until 1943. He then resigned to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy where he attained the rank of captain during World War II. He also won the Legion of Merit. three other decorations. and was awarded six major battle stars. Moreover. he was personally responsible for freeing thousands of American prisoners of war in Japan shortly before that countrys surrender. Although Mr. Stassen also served as a key adviser in a variety of influential posts throughout the Eisenhower administration. he will be best remembered for his service under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the Presidents personal request. Harold Stassen served on the American delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference that founded the United Nations. Indeed. he is now the only living American who drafted. negotiated. and signed the original U.N. Charter. Moreover. Mr. Stassen has maintained a dedicated. passionate interest in the United Nations since its foundingeducating the American public about the United Nations. and striving to make the organization more effective. Harold Stassen is celebrating his 90th birthday just 2 years after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. On April 13. numerous national and State officials. including former Vice President and United States Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale. will come to St. Paul. MN. to honor Mr. Stassen. As Harold Stassen commemorates this significant milestone it Is indeed an honor for me to join with his family. friends. and colleagues in conveying my warmest birthday wishes to this remarkable American and fellow Minnesotan who has such a proud and exceptional record of distinguished public service.*",

The responsibility of the United States in this conflict is to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. to minimize the danger to our troops and to diminish the suffering of the Iraqi people. The citizens of Iraq have suffered the most for Saddam Husseins activities. sadly. those same citizens now stand to suffer more.

Saddam Hussein has felt free to defy the international community. For far too long. he has menaced his own people and threatened his neighbors in the region.

All Americans should pray for the safe return of our men and women in uniform as they embark on this inherently dangerous but necessary. mission.

It is fitting. therefore. that we gather today to express the support of the American people for their service and for their mission. And we do this unreservedly. Saddam Hussein. the Iraqi dictator. has continued his provocation and intransigence in the face of international condemnation and warnings.

Time and time again we warned him that if he persisted on this course. that if he prevented the agreement of inspections. and that if he continued to snub the wishes of the international community. then the United States would let loose the awesome power of its military to force Iraqs compliance with U.N. resolutions. Our nation has sent a clear signal to the international community that Saddams kind of terrorism will not be tolerated. The careless manufacture of these weapons of mass destruction is an affront to all civilized societies. While the people of Iraq search for food. Saddam Hussein searches for a new palace to build for himself once again. These weeks are going to take another important step to changing that situation. Saddam Husseins days should be numbered and we must commit ourselves to the installation of a fair and democratic government in Iraq.

Ken Wourmhoudt. a licensed architect by trade. worked hard to keep an open dialog between the community and the skateboarders. He appreciated the childrens love of the sport and often spoke on their behalf. His passion for the skateboard parks began in 1978 when he designed Derby Park in Santa Cruz. He relied on the skateboarders experience to guide him through the design process. to build the best possible park for them. Derby Park is still enjoyed by many skateboarders throughout Santa Cruz and beyond. His love for the skateboard parks was only rivaled by his appreciation for the arts. His artistry showed in skate projects in communities such as Napa. Milpitas. and Pleasanton. This devotion went well beyond the skate parks. He served 8 years on the Santa Cruz County Cultural Council and two terms on the Santa Cruz City Arts Commission. He promoted public art on Pacific Avenue and helped with the installations. Ken traveled the country sharing his expertise and love of the skateboard parks. These visits helped other communities build parks and taught the communities successful new techniques to keep the lines of communication open with the community.

Instead of seeking congressional approval for this new education policy. the Department of Education has decided to ignore the Congress and move ahead with the development of these tests with the intent of administering the tests beginning in 1999. Even if one supports the Presidents standardized national testing program. which I dont. shouldnt this be debated and decided in the U.S. Congress and not by Presidential edict? This appropriations bill. if not amended to include Representative GOODLINGS language on national testing. leaves the door wide open for the Department of Education to continue work in this area. In addition to the fact that Congress has been bypassed in this policy decision. we need to look at the overall issue of national testing. In 1997. the Federal Government will spend roughly $540 million to test students. Do we really need another testing program? I think money could be better spent on the learning process and teacher training. National tests arent going to arm our students with the tools they need to gain a worldclass education. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Even if you support the concept of national testing. you should support the Goodling amendment and permit an open debate on the issue in the Congress instead of letting the",

Not just economically bypassed. but they were bypassed by the Federal road programs. Unlike my friend from Wisconsin whose district benefited from 90/10 interstate financing for the highway program. this area got nothing until just a few years ago. The highway that was replaced was one of the most dangerous highways in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. People were killed on that road. school buses were in accidents. and children on their way to school were endangered.

The road that I am speaking of is now a safe highway and has contributed to the economic development in this area. I want to remind my colleagues as well that this program is. in my view. one of the best intergovernmental programs that exists in the Nation. It begins at the local level.

In earlier decades trade was mainly among industrialized nations. and the focus of trade negotiations was on tariffs and later market access. But today economic competition is increasingly between industrialized and developing nations. often with centrally managed economies with dramatically lower wage and salary levels sustained by government intervention. These fundamental economic issues with China cannot be addressed through the annual MFN debate. they can be addressed directly through negotiations about Chinas accession to WTO. and they can be addressed as to other developing nations through comprehensive. hardheaded fast track legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to confront these key issues. persuade the media to shine the light on them and help the administration play a central role by addressing them as we take up fast track and Chinas WTO accession.

So today I speak for the American farmer. I speak for the rural Missourians who sell products abroad. United States should again extend normal trade status to China. Failure to do so will jeopardize American agricultural sales to that country that last year topped $3 billion. Overall. our country enjoys a substantial agricultural trade surplus with China of $21/2 billion. Moreover. agricultural exports to China stand to gross significantly in the coming years as income growth in China leads to continuing dietary improvement. Let us look at some of the sales statistics that we have. Nineteen hundred ninetysix. corn sales to China topped 90 million bushels. fertilizer. $1.1 billion. wheat. $426 million. cotton. $736 million. soy beans. $414 million. soybean meal. $116 million. soybean oil. $104 million. and poultry. $408 million. China is already a major market for American agricultural exports and has the potential to become an even bigger customer as the economy continues to grow.

We are getting a smaller export to China than we get to Belgium. They are not a major trading partner except for the oneway street. except for the $50 billionplus coming back to China. the trade surplus that they enjoy over us. the enormous sales throughout our WalMarts and KMarts with hundreds and hundreds of products. many of which are made by the Peoples Liberation Army. and what are we getting in return for that? Have we stopped any of the poison gas sales to Iran by China? Have we stopped any sales of ring magnets that are used to make ICBMs sold to Pakistan? Have we stopped the purchase of the missile destroyers that were purchased from Russia. that have one purpose. and that is to kill American sailors and destroy American ships on the high seas? My colleagues have spoken of the policy of engagement. but not one CEO. not one president. not one trade negotiator can point to a single case of technology transfer or military transfer that they have stopped by engaging with the Chinese. nor can any of them really point to any attempts that they have made to stop this amassing of military capability in China and the transferring of military capability to outlaw nations around the world.

It is bipartisan. it makes a difference. it is Congress at its best and its most exciting. Over the last 25 years. since President Nixon reversed our policy of isolating ourselves from China and the rest of the world. we have seen a safer and more prosperous world. It helped hasten the end of the cold war. it helps keep peace today on the Korean peninsula. where China is one of the few countries that actually exercises some control over the North Koreans. It has pointed toward more prosperity and freedom for the Chinese. Even the progress with American missionaries on the ground in China in the last half dozen years would have been unthinkable 20 or 30 years ago. Most important. it has planted seeds for a dynamic change in the future with access to Information and to markets. The reason it sounds to people today that we are talking about a multiplicity of countries is the fact that China. although large and with an ancient culture. is complex and it is not monolithic. We cannot treat it as such. The notion that somehow MFN will force a monolithic Chinese ancient society to change and accommodate us is misguided. It did not work during World War II. when there were over 1 million Japanese soldiers on Mainland China and we were giving them billions of dollars. The Chinese risked nuclear war and fought us to a draw in Korea. and tens of thousands of Americans needlessly died because we thought we could force China. It does not even work with a twobit dictator 90 miles away with Cuba today.

The total Air Force costs through 1995 for the recovery program of space launch capabilities is $12 billion. These are all costs that DOD will bear with no contribution by NASA. Since NASA now plans to use a number of the expendable launch vehicles that the Air Force has developed. I wonder how much of this $12 billion the Senator from Louisiana would like NASA to pay DOD of its share of the added costs that DOD has had to bear. In sum. Mr. President. this amendment has nothing to do with the Space Launched Recovery Program. It merely isand If it passes I predict it will come to bea very cleverly designed ploy to shift $700 million from the Department of Defense to NASAs space station. which has little or nothing to do with putting up the satellites that we need so desperately today. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is no secret. This will fund the space station. That is that intent of it. It funds the space station out of SDI money. and it does so because of the critical national security relationship between both the space station and the shuttle because the space station and the shuttle and the entire NASA program are. of course. in the NASA budget in HUD and Indpendent Agencies. There is nothing hidden about that agenda. It is right up front. Let me tell you. it is going to be very difficult under any circumstances to get that space station going. I am for it. This is a way to do it. a way consistent with the defense budget because it does have defense implications. I think our accounting is right for the $700 million. I think there are 15 of the 52 launches which are DOD related. I do not think they are already paid for. But that accounting problem is endless. Suffice it to say that we check our accounting with NASA. Maybe they are a party in interest here although the administration is officially against this. According to NASA that is the right way to account for it. But this is really bigger than the accounting because we are not bound by whatever accounting. The fact is there is a definite direct defense interest in NASA. and in the space station. It is a higher priority than a $700 million addon to SDI. By the way. in the past. I have never been for an SDI cut. Every amendment which I have put in here increases SDI. To be sure it cuts that astronomical figure which the President asks for every year. but if we had funded those. we would be so far down in the budget deficit that we would never get out.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have a brief statement to make for the purpose of explaining why I shall not be voting in favor of amendments to reduce SDI funding. whether for the purpose of transferring the funds to NASA. or simply not spending them at all. My opposition to SDI is unchanged. Like others here. I regard the $13 billion thus far spent on this program as largely wasted. Like others here. I am acutely aware of other priorities which are it. danger of failing for want of funds. and this includes the space station. which I support. In the past. I have supported efforts to move money out of SDI on the Senate floor. However. this year the Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to grossly underfund the small ICBM Program. I regard this missile as a basic element for strategic stability and as a building block for arms control. It is my hope that this will be corrected in conference. But if that is to happen. then the pot of money represented by SDIand for that matter. by garrison based rail mobile MXmust come to conference intact. If this money is reallocated here on the Senate floor to other priorities. it will not be available for bargaining among the conferees. Granted. there is no guarantee that conference will work out as I hope. But that is the risk we all take when we make decisions on votes that Involve our basic objectives and the strategies we think may lead to outcomes we think important. Therefore. In this vote and on others which would break apart the Senate Armed Services Committees strategic spending package. to the detriment of the small ICBM I shall vote in support of the package. Not because I support the package. On the contrary. Rather. because I want to protect the chance for a better allocation of resources in conference.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to join in supporting the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana and I want to commend him for offering this way of strengthening Americas space program. This amendment provides substantial funds for the SDI Program while recognizing the fact that that program. like many other vital defense activities. depends on access to space. It also is consistent with previous congressional action requiring the Pentagon to foot part of the bill for the Space Shuttle Program. Without a viable shuttle program. without the eventual space station. our national security would face dangerous risks. Space is an American frontier for security. for scientific research. and for commercial development. Thus. it is most appropriate for the defense budget to pay a fair share of the cost of restoring the shuttle to regular flight operations. The nondefense portion of the budget should not have to bear the whole burden. As the distinguished sponsor of this amendment has said. some 29 percent of the planned shuttle flights through 1993 are already assigned to military missions. and this amendment would assign $700 million because that figure is 28 percent of the shuttle recovery cost. That seems fair to me. Mr. President. this amendment also gives the Senate an opportunity to speak up for a strong space program. It lets us send a powerful signal to the Appropriations Committee that we want an expanded space and science program such as that recommended by the President. We do not want NASA to be victimized by opponents of the space station or other manned space flight programs. I have been deeply concerned. as have several of my colleagues. about the prospect of inadequate allocations under the Budget Act to the HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee of Appropriations. If that occurs. NASA and the National Science Foundation could be unjustifiably squeezed. and the space station could face cancellation. This amendment would reduce the pressure on those budget activities by requiring the Defense Department to pay a reasonable share of shuttle recovery costs. Mr. President. I believe that tile SDI Program permitted by this amendment would be robust and fully capable of exploring the many teclmnologies which must be studied before any decision can be made on possible deployment of a ballistic missile defense system. The issue Is not whether we favor a substantial SDI Program but whether we favor a strong space program.",

I strongly support H.R. 4060. Had I been present. I would have voted \"Yes.\" This bill contains $275.347.000 for the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP). which is based in my Congressional District near Cincinnati. Ohio. The former Femald Feed Materials Production Center. now the FEMP. was a Department of Energy facility that was part of the United States nuclear weapons production complex for nearly forty years from 1951 to 1988. The site is heavily contaminated with nuclear waste and other hazardous materials. and has been the focus of extensive cleanup efforts for several years. H.R. 4060 fully funds the Presidents request for the Fernald cleanup under the Defense Facilities Closure Account. The Closure Account is designed to ensure the accelerated cleanup of this site under budget and ahead of the original schedule. Accelerated cleanup will not only result in a considerable savings to the taxpayers but also help to protect public health. I would like to point to a disturbing study recently released by the Center for Disease Control that estimates a 1 to 12 percent increase in lung cancer deaths to residents in the Fernald study area as a result of exposure to radon gas emitted from the sites K65 Silos. The CDCs findings serve to emphasize the need to fully fund the Closure Account. which would ensure that the accelerated cleanup proceeds on schedule to safeguard the residents in the community from future radioactive exposure. Mr. Speaker. I believe this funding for the FEMP strongly serves the public interest. I commend Chairman LIVINGSTON. Ranking Member OBEY. Chairman MCDADE. and Ranking Member FAZIO as well as their colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee for including these vital funds in the bill.

Under construction for the past year and a half. the new stadium will provide a stateoftheart facility for the students who attend Lincoln High School. I will also provide a first class venue for the Western Pennsylvania tnterscholastic Athletic League to use for playoff games in baseball. football. and track and field bringing more and more people from outside Lawrence County into Eliwood City. In addition to having one of the premier football stadiums in western Pennsylvania the complex has added a sixlane regulation polyurethane running track as well as a new baseball field and concession stands. As a result of this renovation. Lincoln High School will finally be able to host track and field events. it Is Interesting to note that prior to the renovation the baseball stadiums lighting was passed down from storied Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. The Fourth Congressional District has been home to many great professional athletes. Tony Dorsett. Joe Namath. Ty Law. and George Blanda to name a few. It is my belief that with a firstclass facility like this. it may not be long before a new crop of future NFL stars come from Elwood City. Mr. Speaker. it Is once again with great pride that I rine and urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the people of ElIwood City on this fabulous evening. Additionally.

In the United States. armored cars are used everyday to transport millions of dollars in currenry. coins. food stamps. and other valuable property for both private entities and the Federal Government. The value of this cargo Is not in dispute. but the ability of those charged with the responsibility of transporting it is. The legitimacy of those who currently transport cargo by armored car across State lines. must be universally recognized by all States. H.R. 624 will go a long way in accomplishing this goal. This bill will accomplish several important functions for the armor car industry and its customers. who depend on the ability of armored cars and their attendants to function across the State lines. The bill requires that a criminal background check be conducted on an individual applying for a firearms license only when that person applies for his or her initial license. and it cladfies that it is the State that must conduct the initial criminal background check. and not some third party. Finally. this bill would establish that reciprocity be granted for both weapons licenses and any other permits or licenses required in a State. if the crew member has met all relevant requirements for working as an armored car crew member in the State in which he or she is primarily employed. Currently. only five States meet the eligibility requirements for reciprocity under the Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of 1993.

GHMSI will continue to exist under the same name and will be authorized to transact business as it hasunder all existing licenses and certificates of authority. With the exception of GHMSI. Blue Cross Blue Shield plans and all other commercial insurance companies around the country are State chartered corporations operating under State regulatory oversight. H.R. 497 will place GHMSI on an equal footing with other plans and health insurersenabling it to continue to provide comprehensive and affordable coverage to residents of the District of Columbia and the Washington Metropolitan area. while meeting the challenges of a changing health care marketplace. Of particular Importance to my Maryland constituents. H.R. 497 will facilitate the proposed merger of GHMSI with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland. A recent letter of intent announced the plan to combine the business operations of the two entities under a single holding company. This combination of business operations will provide a larger provider network--offedng greater portability and choice. broader product options. and Improved customer service to residents of the District of Columbia. northern Virginia. and Maryland who work In one area and reside In another. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill which will enable GHMSI to face the abundant challenges of the fastchanging health care marketplace and to compete and serve its customers on a fair and equal footing.",

And yet right now they are willing to continue to wheel and deal with a dictator for a few fast dollars. looking the other way when they realize it is a slave economy. And they say. yes. we realize that this trade continues to maintain Fidel Castro in power. and he will continue to degrade the Cuban people. and he has no free election. but if we can make a cheap dollar. then we are willing to do it. And to see these country leaders. knowing the rich history of the terrible situation for centuries they have endured. and have them not stand in solidarity with us in our struggle to help the Cuban people. that was a real tragedy.

I would want my colleagues of this body as well as this country to not have any mistake that I believe that this movie Is a landmark movie. a remarkable movie that profoundly affected me as well as my wife and our family as we watched it. Indeed I instructed my daughters to view this movie and I have had many discussions with friends and neighbors alike about the atrocities of the Holocaust that were made aware to us and made apparent to us through this movie. I feel terrible that my criticism of NBC for airing this movie has been misinterpreted as a criticism of \"Schindlers List\" or the millions of Jewish people who died senselessly during the Holocaust. To all those that I have offended I offer an apology. and I personally apologize for appearing insensitive to the worst atrocities known to human kind. As many of you know I am a practicing physician dealing with life and death issues almost every day. I have devoted most of my adult life to working with religious groups across the spectrum. Religious tolerance is the hallmark of my professional and personal life. However I continue to be disturbed by the new television program rating system recently implemented by the broadcast and cable television network. Mr. Speaker. I have been the leader on this issue since I arrived in Congress. As many of you will recall I offered an amendment on the floor of this House to the Telecommunication Reform Act of 1996. an amendment that would encourage parental responsibility for what their children watch on television. My amendment which passed the House would have accelerated new TV program blocking technologies that were coming to the marketplace. I did not support the V chip technologies because it was an abdication for parents responsibility for what their children watch. The bottom line is that parents need enough information to make good decisions for their children. Our children in our country are in trouble. and part of it is because of parental failure. We must have parental guidance. but we also must protect those children who have no parental guidance.",

October 10. 1998 marks the 87th anniversary of the founding of modern China. This is a very special day for Chinese people around the world. and especially in Taiwan where October 10 is celebrated as National Day in the Republic of China on Taiwan. Dr. Sun Yatsen is the father of modern China. and is widely regarded and revered both in mainland China and in Taiwan. On October 10. 1911. Dr. Suns Revolutionary Alliance succeeded in putting an end to imperial rule in China. a date which also marked the formal planting of the seeds of democracy which continue to flourish in Taiwan today. People often speculate as to the real reasons for the \"Taiwan Miracle\" and how Taiwan continues to defy the odds today. how this island nation continues to expand economically when nations all around her are at an economic standstill or contracting. and they speculate as to how Taiwan not only survives politically. but how she has evolved into such a strong democracy despite the pressures by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) to isolate her from the international community. While there is no easy answer to this question. Taiwan is a flourishing and successful society in every sense of the word. and is a source of optimism in an increasingly uncertain world. In this light. it gives me particularly great pleasure to wish everyone on Taiwan. and Chinese people around the world. a very special October 10 National Day.

Dick has helped establish Westvaco and the Fine Papers mill into fixtures of Wickliffe. Kentucky. Though not originally from Kentucky. Dick became a valued member of the Wickliffe community. raised his family there and continues to have close ties to Kentucky. In 1966. Dick joined Westvaco as the Assistant Public Relations Manager at the Fine Papers Division in Luke. Maryland. The next year. Westvaco announced that Wickliffe. Kentucky would be the site of a new $80 million mill. It was while assisting in the public relations details of this announcement that Dick began his long association with the community of Wickliffe. Later that year. Dick. his wife Malinda and their two daughters moved to Wickliffe. Dick became Public Relations Manager for Fine Papers in 1970. Dick held that job until 1988. During that time. he played an integral role as the Fine Papers mill became the bedrock of the Wickliffe community. After a brief stint during 1988 in the Kentucky State Government as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet for Economic Development. Dick returned to Westvaco as Regional Public Affairs Manager. a position he held until 1991. At that time he moved to Washington to become Westvacos Director of Public Affairs. a position he continues to hold today. Since the 1966 announcement that the plant would be built in Western Kentucky. Westvaco has spent more than half a billion dollars to create a stateoftheart papermaking facility in Wickliffe. Today. Westvaco employs over 750 men and women in Kentucky. and makes an annual contribution of $134 million to the local economy. The growth of the mill and the companys great relationship with the community are a legacy of Dicks career at Westvaco and his 24 years in Kentucky. Mr. President. I have worked closely with Dick on several issues of great importance to both Westvaco and my constituents in the Wickliffe area. His hard work and dedication have allowed Westvaco to become an important part of the Wickliffe community. I have enjoyed working with him. thank him for all his efforts on behalf of Westvaco and the people of the Wickliffe community. and wish him the best wherever his future endeavors may take him.*",

Bettie left the Senate to pursue other endeavors. only to return in 1985 to work for Senator Jack Danforth. She was hired as a Staff Assistant for Senator Danforths personal office and was later moved to the Senate Committee on Commerce. when he became Chair.

I am also including an article from the July 25 Baltimore Sun which describes Walters exceptional and inspiring life of service. I know I express the deep appreciation of his fellow Marylanders for his many decades of commitment and their best wishes in his latest and most significant assignment. I ask that these articles be inserted at this point in the RECORD. and I yield the floor.",

Mr. Chairman. the ratepayers of Louisiana have paid more than $134 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund only to see that money used for purposes other than those specified by the law which mandated the collections. For that reason. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished floor manager to propound a few questions on the bill before us. which I have cosponsored. As I understand the situation. one of the foremost improvements of the bill over current law are provisions which would ensure that monies collected from ratepayers will be used for the purposes for which they were intended under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act rather than being captured and used for other purposes because of discretionary spending limits imposed after the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted.

As is more fully explained in the committees report. the basic inequity arises from the fact that the current 1 mill fee assessed against nuclear generated electricity is treated as a mandatory receipt to the Federal Government. and all programmatic expenses are treated as discretionary spending. Now. as a result. spending for the waste program from the Nuclear Waste Fund is thus counted against various discretionary spending caps enacted after 1982 as a means of controlling overall Federal spending. As a result. while nearly $12 billion has been generated in fees and interest. only a little over $4.8 billion has been spent on the program.",

We are a Nation that has won wars and deterred others because of nuclear science. This technology is a cheap and efficient way to light our towns and cities. We have paid a price for this benefit. Over the last 50 years. our Nation has generated tens of thousands of tons of highly radioactive nuclear materials and waste. I cannot stress the importance of finding a permanent and viable solution to the disposal of these wastes. I have many fundamental problems with the bill before us that can be solved if the issue were given further consideration. This legislation allows for nuclear waste to be stored above ground in socalled interim storage facilities located in the State of Nevada. I am concerned that legal limitations to ensure that interim storage does not become permanent storage will be eroded. The bill does not adequately address public health and safety protections relating to transportation. interim storage. and permanent disposal of nuclear waste. My constituents in Baltimore. as customers of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. pay into their nuclear waste fund. which is designed to cover costs of both interim storage and the permanent repository. I worry that places a continuous burden on utilit1 customers around the country because this bill does not create a permanent repository. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

In 1996. the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board analyzed the issue of interim storage and concluded there is no urgent need. no urgent need. for centralized storage of commercial spent fuel. No need. no compelling necessity. no safety advantage to be achieved. That was 1996. Now the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board underwent a change in the composition of the chairmanship. So. in effect. there was an opportunity for a new board composed of new members to review whether or not they would agree with the position taken by the predecessors in 1996. In testimony on February 5. 1997. Dr. Gerard L. Cohen. the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. Dr. Cohen simply reaffirmed the position taken by his predecessors that there is no need. either for technical or safety reasons. to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility for the next few years. He further maintains that to maintain credibility of the site selection process. any decision with respect to interim storage should be deferred until a technological site suitability decision can be made about Yucca Mountain.

Why then are we going to send this highlevel nuclear waste from the East Coast. from around the country. across 40 States of this country. including places like the Mousetrap. which as Members can see through this map. runs right through the center of downtown Denver. and the location in which 8 years ago a torpedo fell off a truck completely shutting down the city for 8 hours? Why would we send this waste to an uncertified site only to have it be sent somewhere else? And why would we send it through c\"orridors like downtown metropolitan areas where millions of citizens could be at risk? It makes no sense. I do not understand where we are rushing to transport this nuclear waste until the site is certified. In addition. there is no national standard requiring emergency response training for communities along transportation routes so if there is an accident in the Mousetrap the local law enforcement officers know what to do. There is no requirement that these officials even be notified of the transport. For all of these reasons. this is a premature bill. it is a bad response to a very real problem that we have in this country.

My own State of Tennessee has a legacy of high level nuclear waste that is stored onsite. The nuclear weapons that were built in Oak Ridge helped this entire Nation win World War II and the Cold War. Now we have the opportunity through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 to establish a central storage facility in an underpopulated area that would be easier. safer and more economical to monitor. E 1800 I understand the concerns of my colleagues who oppose this bill. I know that no one wants a nuclear storage site in their backyard. but there is no magic wand that will make this waste go away. It is here. we have no choice but to deal with it. We need a solution to this growing problem. and the repository at the Yucca Mountain offers the best opportunity. The Southern Governors Association took steps in this direction earlier this month by passing a resolution in favor of H.R. 1270. Additionally. we cannot ignore the fact that consumers have paid into the Nuclear Waste Fund to store this waste. TVA alone has expended over $20 million in additional funds because DOE has failed to take this waste. We must assure the public of the safety of any repository. The nuclear industry has been storing fuel in 34 States for more than three decades. Though the industry is now safely managing used fuel. longterm onsite storage was never intended. A central storage facility to keep much of this waste is necessary. and the Yucca Mountain fits the requirement for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 1270 meets the publics need for a safe alternative for temporary used fuel storage at one site until a permanent storage facility is completed. This is a long overdue solution to a difficult issue. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

Mr. Chairman. 15 years ago. that is how long ago Congress originally passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. In 1992. Congress envisioned that the Department of Energy would be accepting spent fuel by 1998. That is less than two months away. Fifteen years ago. Ronald Reagan was two years into his first term. Tip ONeill was Chairman. typewriters. not computers were the norm. and the Soviet Union was still considered the evil empire. But perhaps most telling was the fact that 1992 was still a full two years before the Chicago Cubs would make it to postseason play. If you are a Cubs fan. you will know how long that really was. Mr. Chairman. unfortunately though. after billions of dollars and a decade and a half. we are only a few steps closer to opening a permanent repository than we were in 1982. This bill replaces the sluggish action that has plagued DOEs Nuclear Waste Program with specific achievable deadlines and ensures that another 15 years will not pass before the Federal Government lives up to its responsibility of accepting spent fuel. Mr. Chairman. we have spent billions of dollars looking into this issue. We have assessed from ratepayers. not taxpayers. but ratepayers. Every time somebody pays their utility bill. we are reaching into their pocket and we have taken billions of their dollars. What has the Federal Government been able to deliver for that billions of dollars? Absolutely nothing. The ratepayers. our constituents. Mr. Chairman. know that it is time for this Congress to take the bull by the horns and deliver the promise that it made in Mr. Chairman. we need to pass this bill. We need to fulfill the promise to the American people that this country will have a safe and sound nuclear waste policy. We cannot allow another 15 years to go by.

This fund was set up by the Congress in 1982 and requires the Department of Energy to set up a nuclear storage facility and begin accepting nuclear waste by 1998. However. out of the over $12 billion that have already been paid into the fund. only $4.8 billion have been spent on waste storage research and funding for storage facilities. Since the Department of Energy has not constructed a waste storage facility. the other $7 billion has been diverted into unrelated uses such as deficit reduction. This is the same type of problem we have with the Highway Trust Fund. Citizens constantly pay Into this fund. but they see nothing in return. If the Department of Energy had performed its required actions. we would not be debating this bill. An interim storage facility would already be in place and a permanent facility would be in the near future. If the Department of Energy had performed its required actions. then this money would have been used for its intended purpose. for managing the efficient disposal of nuclear waste.

This is a marketplace issue. It is an issue about the things. the way to hire employees and the way to keep employees. One of the botton line employment problems is always the portability of a retirement plan. The wisdom of this plan that my colleague from Kansas presents today is one that. would allow these two universities the opportunity to have a portability of a retirement plan. The way the law exists today Is that. someone would have to stay amplayed Iln a Job literally for the rest of their working career before they wore able to get back that retirement that they had saved all these years. The bottom line is the uarketplaco In academics does not work that. way. Professors come and go. Professors have new callings that perhaps they want to leave and have a sabbatical or write a book or teach at another university. I believe what we have got to do Is to recognize that the work that Is being (lone today through this hill would allow these two universities to attract and keep through their recruitment opportunities that they have the chance for a marketplace answer. and that Is why I am in full support of this bill that is before us today. and I hope that Members of the Congress are able to recognize that this would be good for these two Indian Nation universities to have.",

I am concerned because what we have In the United States Is uniformity with regard to retirement plans. Different retirement and Insurance programs could cruate undesirable Inequities in the compensation pro. grams when Federal employees move In and out of the system. That Is a major problem. and that does concern me. and that is one of the very reasons why the matter should have come before the committee. so that OPM could have an opportunity to give their side of this to figure out how this matter could be worked out as opposed to us trying to push it through without the proper deliberation. And I emphasize that. I want to go on and just emphasize some other things. What we are trying to do. what the bill. the intent of the bill. as I understand it. is to. one of the intentions Is to have certain demonstration projects. Well. demonstration projects under current law will allow the institutions to request that the professors jobs be reclassified at a higher grade. There are other ways to provide for Increased pay for instructors which does not violate civil service rules and could have been discussed if a hearing was held. OPM has expressed a willingness to work with the institutions to facilitate an alternative personnel system. and OPM Is very serious about this because they want to make sure that they have the uniformity that I talked about a little bit earlier. These institutions are funded entirely. and I emphasize that. entirely with Federal dollars and should be subject to the same civil service laws as other Federal agencies. Local employees do not support Mr. SNOWHAitERS proposal. as I stated a little bit earlier. The National Federation of Federal Employees objects to going forward with this bill as currently written and has submitted a letter documenting their objections. Mr. Chairman.

Because other countries are sending their students to our shores. we must provide our children with the best possible quality education. That Is why I rise in support of H.R. 4259. This bill does resolve some of the problems facing both of our two Indian or Native American colleges. Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence. Kansas. has some of the brightest students in the land. but for years Congress has required this institution to operate as a Federal bureaucracy Instead of a center for learning. This Is wrong. This bill will change that. and we need to be able to make sure we give the students at Haskell every opportunity and advantage they should have. And instead of making learning more difficult. we should pursue ways to help Native American Indians to achieve success In education. Every Native American tribe in Kansas. and I want to emphasize that. every Native American tribe in Kansas. supports this legislation. Over 50 tribes across this country also support It. In fact. there is not any opposition from a single tribe with this legislation. This legislation is not about union membership. as some of the Members from the opposite side of the aisle would like to suggest. This is about the rights of Native Americans and their rights to a quality education. Supporting this legislation supports improved education for Native American Indians.

I want to just quote from an internal memo from OPM with regard to this legislation because I think it is very important that the very institution. the Office of Personnel Management. whose job it Is to oversee this process. we need to know what they say about all this because I think that Is very. very important. and that is what basically this debate Is all about. OPM. and I quote. OPM was given authority to oversee personnel management demonstration projects by the Civil Service Reform Act. OPMs years of experience and expertise in the development. evaluation and oversight of such projects would not be used sufficiently if OPM were limited to a consuiting role at the discretion of the institutions presidents. It would be inappropriate to establish a demonstration project. and these are the people who have expertise in this. These are the folks. it is their job to do this. This Is what they are saying. It would be inappropriate to establish a demonstration project which could be made permanent as provided in Section 8 of the bill without the accountability provided by independent oversight. evaluation and scrutiny under the normal section 4703 procedures. The limited role provided to OPM by this bill would be Insufficient to assure adequate accountability through Independent oversight. and I emphasize that. independent oversight of these demonstration projects. particularly since Section 4(h)(2)(B)(ii) would allow continuation of any alternative system of employee benefits even If the demonstration project were terminated. That Is a major problem. The legislation does not require a serious evaluation of results of an alternative system prior to that system being made permanent. And so. Mr. Chairman. I tell my colleagues I understand the intent of the gentleman from Kansas and those who support this bill. but at the same time we have to keep some very important things in mind. Whether we like it or not. the institutions are supported solely with Federal funds. and that is very. very significant. and it Is not about a question. as the gentleman from Kansas",

Because I would submit it is the severe limits on hardmoney contributions. which are contributions by contributors directed to candidates. that are driving this problem. The Constitution allows. under the various court rulings. which I think are generally correct. people to contribute and express their point of view. It limits contributions right now to candidates. But they can still. under the Constitution. comment on issues. As my colleagues heard me quote from Buckley the line between issues and candidates. it is hard to distinguish. That is why the Court in order to preserve free speech. said that. in order to fall under the scope of regulation. they have to have words of express advocacy which are clearly related to the election or defeat of the candidate. What I think this bill is going to do is actually go against the result my colleague seeks to achieve and I frankly seek to achieve. which is that more of our money in campaigns should be centered from the candidate. not from groups out on the periphery that are getting as close to the line as they can without crossing it and influencing the election.",

Basically. what is happening here is the American public knows there is a campaign season. there is a beginning and there is an end and they know what goes on in between. There ought to be something we know who is saying it. They could call somebody a rotten SOB. They could call somebody good. They could call somebody evil. They could say all kinds of things about them. But as long as they do not have to say vote for or against them but they say everything but that. they can destroy them. And they as a consumer. as a voting person. they have no idea who has paid for all that. They do not even know who it is because they usually make up fake titles about what they are. They are always good citizens for something. but then all they do is talk about evil. So the campaign of the gentlewoman showed to America something that we in Congress were not even aware was going to happen. and that is that it is totally out of control. that we are going to have messages all over this country by people that are totally unaccountable.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I rise in opposition to the LaTouretteTraficant amendment. The amendment would gut the labor reforms in the Amtrak bill. leaving Amtrak with the onerous labor provisions that it has been saddled with for the last 26 years. Let me be clear about what current labor requirements entail. Amtrak must pay up to 6 years of full wages and benefits to any worker who is laid off due to a route elimination or frequency reduction to below three times per week. That is right. 6 years of severance pay. Even worse. any worker who is asked to move his or her job location more than 30 miles is eligible for the 6 years of benefits. So workers do not even have to be laid off in order to claim the 6 years of pay. In addition. there is currently a Federal law that prevents Amtrak from contracting out any work other than foods or beverage service if it will result in the layoff of a single employee in a bargaining unit. This prohibits Amtrak from gaining any of the savings that are possible through contracting out work. Mr. Chairman. the bill before us contains a compromise reform proposal on these two issues that was worked out in the last Congress with the full participation and support of organized labor. It is a fair compromise that allows labor and management to negotiate through the collective bargaining process the issues of labor protection and contracting out. Amtrak could agree to any terms on these issues. Federal law would not predetermine the outcome in any way. It is important to note that at the end of the bargaining process. if there were no agreement. labor would have the right to strike just as it would under any other railroad labor collective bargaining agreement. Mr. Chairman. we do not require airlines to pay laidoff employees for 6 years. We do not prevent the airlines from contracting out work. Why should we do that for Amtrak? I urge my colleagues to defeat the LaTourette amendment. pass the bill. and secure Amtraks future.",

When we have the head of management saying that if these protections are removed. they are going to have very little effect upon the total package. what more do we wish? Labor and management are on the same page. Why should we rip out that page? If we do not have this amendment. we will eliminate wage protections for displaced passenger rail employees which have been in place since 1930.

I want to come back to the fundamental issue here. what is driving this issue. what are the costs that are driving the Amtrak problem. Last year. Amtrak had a $322 million deficit. in 1996. How much of that was caused by labor protection? About $1 million. We cannot lay all of Amtraks problems at the feet of the working people who run the trains. Amtrak over 2 years laid off 2.000 people. It cost $2 million in labor protective costs. That does not break the back of Amtrak. Does labor protection provisions. a requirement to pay severance costs to the laidoff workers. prevent Amtrak from shutting off rail service? No. it does not. Ask the people in Idaho. Utah. Alabama. Massachusetts. Florida. Amtrak canceled routes in all those States last year because they knew that the labor protection cost was so small. there were so few employees involved. that the effect would be negligible on savings. so they shut the routes down. We cannot lay the problems of Amtrak at the feet of working men and women. Mr. Chairman. what does this amendment that Mr. LATOURETTE and Mr. TRAFICANT are offering do? It sets up a process by which the Railway Labor Act can function to resolve these problems. Amtrak and its labor workers can negotiate changes in labor protection and contracting out. If they fail to agree. they can go to a Presidential emergency board to ask it to make recommendations. If they still fail to agree. they can resort to usual selfhelp remedies.

I rise today to support the amendment by Mr. LATOURETrE and Mr. TRAFICANT. my colleagues from northern Ohio. and to honor the men and women who have built and operate the Amtrak railway system. More than 100 years ago. it was the railroads that formed the basic infrastructure of our countrythe infrastructure that enabled our economy to expand and prosper. Hundreds of thousands of dedicated workersmany of them immigrants working for low wagesgave their lives to build Americas railroads. Today. railroads employees use their skills to keep the railroads safeto move freight and passengers quickly and efficiently. When Amtrak was founded in 1971. the Federal Government made a compact with its workers. We made a pact to treat Amtrak workers fairly. to protect the incomes of Amtrak workers who gave up jobs in higherpaying freight railroad companies. The Government promised to compensate Amtrak employees who are displaced because of the process of restructuring. This Amtrak Reform Act abandons those commitments. It eliminates essential worker protections and places arbitrary time limits on the collective bargaining process. It would lead to greater labor strife in the Amtrak system because workers would have their contract rights canceled. It would demoralize Amtrak workers. forcing them to sacrifice so the system can obtain the Federal financing that was set aside in the Balanced Budget Act. This is blatantly unfair to the people who keep Amtrak running. And it violates the public interest of our Nation. The amendment by Mr. LATOURETrE and Mr. TRAFICANT is a fair and reasonable compromise. It balances the financial needs of Amtrak with the respect that we owe to Amtraks dedicated employees.

It has been proven that eliminating wage protection or contracting out will do little to improve the financial stability of the company. By eliminating this protection it will only prove to be helpful to Amtrak if the company is forced to lay off a large number of employees. This would be a cruel send off to many dedicated railway workers who have given the best years of their lives to help keep Amtrak going. The bill also threatens the safety of both employees and passengers from receiving the damages due to them and their families as a result of a rail accident. I represent an area of New Jersey that relies heavily on Amtrak service and Amtrak rails to provide needed public transportation to millions of people in one of the most congested areas of the country. Therefore. I cannot support this piece of legislation unless these negative provisions are taken out.

Seventysix new Members of Congress. We do not expect them to be retained to whatever was done by their predecessor in Congress. Second. in the aftermath of that legislation to which senior members of rail labor signed on. there has been an election as well and those two labor leaders were defeated and replaced by new leadership who has charted a new direction for their members and said that it is not a good deal. Third. the Quinn amendment is opposed by the AFLCIO. the Transportation Trades Department.

I think everybody on our side recognized the gentleman as a friend of labor. My problem with the Quinn amendment is this: It walls off freight labor. but it does nothing for the men and women who work for Amtrak. The fact of the matter is if the Quinn amendment passes we will not have a vote on the LaTourette amendment. What that means is that all of the labor provisions that are in place 254 days after the enactment of the bill. that are in place for all the men and women who work so hard for Amtrak. will blow up. That clearly will put the management at Amtrak. which issued a memorandum to itself saying that they should be careful not to give themselves no more than a 15 percent increase. while the wages of the Amtrak employees have continued to decline. The observation that I made in the Committee on Rules and that the gentleman from Minnesota made on the floor the other day is exactly right. The Quinn amendment is a good amendment. but it is half a loaf. We need the whole loaf to protect the good men and women that work for Amtrak.",

If we are really serious about keeping Amtrak running. if we are really serious about supporting the working people of Amtrak and getting people to work. we must vote \"no\" on this Quinn amendment. Mr. Chairman. when I served in the Florida House of Representatives we had a saying: \"Loving a bill to death.\" That is what is happening here.

While the Amtrak reform and privatization bill makes some vital improvements to the Nations passenger rail system. it also includes very dangerous provisions that will hurt Amtraks employees and passengers. It throws Amtrak employees into the same uncertainty that faces so many other American workers today. The bill ends race protections for displaced and downgraded Amtrak workers that have been in place since the 1980s. It does away with the law protecting Amtrak employees against being replaced by contract workers without the same guarantees of wages and benefits like health care. In my district. this provision in the bill would allow Amtrak to replace 706 workers at the Amtrak maintenance shop in Beech Grove. IN. with contract workers in other States. Taking away peoples jobs is not reform. Let us not balance Amtraks books by depriving people like the Beech Grove shop workers of their jobs. Mr. Chairman.

I have a unique approach today. Let us not represent special interests. Let us represent the American taxpayer. We heard it is not costing us anything. Let me put this in perspective. For every time someone got on an Amtrak passenger train last year. the taxpayer paid $25. $25. There were 20 million boardings. That is hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. So it does cost the taxpayer money. In fact. it has cost the taxpayer. since 1971. $19 billion to subsidize Amtrak. Testimony to our committee said that we could transport people by chauffeured limousine along some of these routes at a lower cost. Wlhy can we not make these changes? Because special interests say that if we eliminate a route. we must pay 6 years full wages and benefits. We have tried BandAids. We have tried bailing wire. We have tried masking tape.

It is a far better bill than the House originally passed. I was an original sponsor of the child tax credit. which is contained in this bill. I support the education tax credits and child health provisions. But I would remind my colleagues that the fundamental test of any democracy is to fund its activities through a tax system which is fair to each and every one of our citizens. Because this is. after all. a volunteer compliance tax system. We fought a revolution over the principle of fair taxes. This bill. I am sorry to say. fails that test. The most welloff 5 percent of families in the country who make over $110.000 will get seven times as much relief as all of the 60 percent of Americans who make less than $37.600. That is simply not fair. In fact. the wealthiest 1 percent of our citizens. who make more than $250.000 a year. will get more in tax relief than 80 percent of all Americans who make $60.000 or less. That is simply not fair. We can do better. Then If we take a look at the dollar relief in the bill. we see that the top 1 percent. whose average income is $650.000. will get a $16.000 tax break under this bill. But if you are in the middle bracket. if you are in the middle bracket. you will get about $3 a week and you lose half of that because of what it costs you to get a tax preparer.

It provides significant relief to working taxpayers and middle class taxpayers who are facing the highest tax burden in American history. Many of us who were elected in 1994 came to Congress pledged to reduce the tax burden on middle class taxpayers and people who work for a living. Today we stand on the brink finally of fulfilling that pledge. This will be the first tax cut for the middle class since 1981. and not a moment too soon. This is not as large a tax cut as many of us on the Republican side had originally argued for. but the net tax cut of $94 billion is more than the White House was originally willing to subscribe to. That we have it here today is a tribute to the persistence of a progrowth. antitax majority in this House which I am proud to be associated with. Our tax cut includes a child tax credit to provide tax relief to families with incomes as low as $18.000: tuition tax relief which makes college more affordable for a lot of middle class families. an expanded IRA to encourage retirement savings. a capital gains tax cut to stimulate growth and opportunity by providing more seed corn for the economy. and I think this is a tribute to the persistence of the gentleman from California as well. small business tax relief and also tax incentives for home ownership. Mr. Speaker. in summary. this tax package for working families in places like Erie. PA means restoring the American dream and making it a little more achievable. This is a big win for the middle class. Today we are going to hear from the left wing in Congress that this bill is inadequate. They do not want tax cuts. But watch your tax return.

The 1993 Deficit Reduction Act worked in both respects. promoting the dramatic deficit reduction that has been a major source of our sustained economic growth and providing a tax cut for low- and middleincome families through expansion of the ITC. and the predictions of economic doom from those who opposed the 1993 act came from many of the same people who voted for the 1981 legislation that led to the deep deficits of the 1980s. Time has proved them as wrong as to 1993 as it did for 1981. The tax bill now before us shows that today it does indeed take two to tango. but that does not mean the two partners have always been dancing in the same direction- Democrats have focused on responding to the pressures on middle- and lowincome families whose income stagnated amidst the general boom of the last 5 years. while many of the majority have been dancing too often to the tune of the very wealthy. and Democrats have been resisting proposals that would bust budget in later years while the majority has been pushing some of the same approaches that engendered the deficits of the 1980s. So we Democrats worked with President Clinton to target the child tax credit to middleincome families. to provide help for families with escalating costs to educate their kids after high school and to provide the child credit for hardworking families making $18 to $15.000 as well as those making $25 to $100.000.

Most important. this bill will leave $94 billion in the private sector. where working people will be able to keep more of their hardearned dollars and small business owners will have the chance to invest and create jobs. Today success is not a victory that can be solely claimed by the Congress or the President. It is instead a victory for the people of this country who sent their representatives to Congress to cut taxes. reduce the size of the bureaucracy. and return fiscal responsibility to the Federal Government.

During the last campaign Republicans campaigned all over this country and they said. the Democrats have been in charge for 40 years and we are not going to run this House like the Democrats did. The chairman of the Committee on Rules stood in this well when he was in the minority and said. when we get to be in charge. we will not have closed rules and we will not run this House like the Democrats. What you are doing here is wrong. You cannot defend it. It is absolutely wrong and we should be ashamed of this charade that is taking place in this House. This gentlewoman won fair and square. Every Member of this House received a certificate from the Secretary of State congratulating us for being elected to the peoples House. the United States Congress. They sent everybody a certificate. They sent the gentlewoman from California a certificate. Now you have sent back to California. to this same guy that gave this certificate to Ms. SANCHEZ. it says. you have to check on this some more because we cannot find anything here. Our witchhunt is over. It is time to stop this because It is not right.",

As a matter of fact. an editorial in todays Journal of Commerce describes which national farm organizations support and which oppose trade. The analysis: most farmers support international trade. If you had asked me this question l months ago. I would have readily agreed. But due to the problems in tile agricultural economy and resulting mood in the countryside. 1 am not so sure today. American farmers in rural communities are hurting. and trade 1 blamed for many of these problems. Farmers know that trade is the way to better prices and higher incomes. Many believe that trade has been a disaster for agriculture. While I disagree. I can certainly understand this feeling. Unfortunately. our government is a large part of the problem. Agriculture has been used as a weapon to achieve questionable foreign polIcy far too often. It. has not received the attention it deserves by this ad. ministration. In fact. It has been badly misused. often for political purposes. No wonder there Is such disconnect with the governments role In trade in rural America. The governments actions or inactions. as the case may be. affect farmers and ranchers perceptions of their future. I support H.R. 4647 because it will require the House and the Senate to approve an agriculturespecific embargo imposed by the President. We used to do this. and I am glad to see that we are on the way to doing that again. Congress must have a chance to analyze any proposed agriculture embargo in order to mitigate any unintentional consequences that do hurt farmers and ranchers. In closing.

The Selective Agricultural Embargo Act is an important first step in out cominitment to reign in embargoes and open markets for U.S. agricultuirAl products. Just last Friday. this Congress took a step to address the shortterm needs of farmers by passing a disaster relief bill. Now It is tine for Congress to help solve the longterm needs of producers by removing sanctions and opening agricultural markets. The Soviet grain embargo cost United States farmers $2.3 billion. The damage from that embargo left a lasting Imprint upon agriculture and scarred our industry In a way that few would have imagined. However. it appears that we have not yet learned our lesson. Wheat imports to North Korea. to Cuba. to Iran. and to Iraq have all doubled since 1995. just a few years ago. since then they have doubled. and now account for over 10 million tons of wheat. However. these growing markets are off limits to U.S. producers but not to Canadian and Australian farmers. In todays global economy. unilateral sanctions unfairly penalize U.S. producers. reward our competitors. and have little impact on changing behavior on targeted countries. The American farmer is tired of paying the price for this failed U.S. policy. Mr. Speaker. T urge passage of this Important measure.",

In addition. the bill authorizes a new research program at the National Heart. Lung. and Blood Institute to target heart attack. stroke. and other cardiovascular diseases in women. This program will advance research into cardiovascular disease. which is the leading cause of death in women. In the past. the medical community has focused on man In research. treatment and counseling for heart disease and stroke. Clearly. the need exists to study these diseases In women to prevent and treat them. My bill also reauthorizes several major programs at the CDC for prevention and education activities on womens health issues. These Include the National Center for Health Statistics. the National Program of Cancer Registries. the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and the Centers for Research and Demonstration of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. As Chairman of the Health and Environment Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee. I believe Congress must play an active role In promoting womens health research and prevention efforts. My bill reauthorizes a number of these critical womens health programs. and I urge all Members to join me in supporting passage of this important legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this Member rises to express his concerns about the inad. equacy of the emergency farm relief package in the conference report for H.R. 4101. This Member would like to begin by expressing his appreciation to the distinguished gentleman from New Mexico and the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio for their diligent work in crating this legisla. tion. Although this legislation Includes Important emergency aid provisions for farmers. Ihis Member believes that it is Inadequate to address the enormous needs of agricultural producers who are reeling from depressed commodity prices across the board. Most of the assistance available under this agriculture relief package Is targeted toward farmers who have suffered natural disaster and multiyear losses. As a result. it will offer little help to farmers in most agricultural states. such as Nebraska. who are harvesting good crops but encountering drastically lower pdces. Unfortunately. this Member does not believe that the $1.65 billion in the package for market loss assistance is adequate to compensate producers. Since it represents a 29 percent in. crease over the AMTA payment received by producers In FY98. it is a good first step. However. the 1996 Farm Act was based on the premise of expanding international markets for the commodities produced by our nations farmers. This clearly has not happened. Certainly. one 01 the root causes of the current low commodity prices is the recent economic downturn. Nobody could predict the Asian financial crisis or the contagion effect which Is stilt being felt. The U S. Department f Agricultures foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Is now forecasting that FY98 exports will be $2 3 billion lower than FY97 sales and $4.8 billion below the FY96 record of $59.8 billion. Also. because of the strength of our national economy relative to most other countries. the value of our currency relative to others now makes our exports less pricecompetitive in Asian markets than our competitor exporters like Canada. Australia. Brazil. or the nations of the European Union. Thus. there is not only a dramatically reduced agncultural export market In Asia. we are also getting a reduced portion of the remaining Asian import business. This Member continues to support the tIexbility offered by the 1996 Agriculture Market Transition Act and does not want to see a return to the policies of the past. Farmers certainly appreciate the freedom to plant what",

The fact of the matter is that if in fact we move to the UHF opportunity. broadcasting to Cuba would neither interfere with Cuban broadcasting nor United States stations. The Cuban Government would have no present jamming capacity on a UHF process. These broadcasts could occur at any time. And it is both technically feasible and cost effective to switch TV Marti to UHF. The fact of the matter is we have an opportunity for peaceful diplomacy to the people of Cuba. The same messages that we used to use in Radio Free Europe. Radio Liberty. those are the types of messages we want to send to TV Marti. We have never accepted another countrys jamming of our surrogate broadcasting to be a reason to stop that broadcasting. We should not do it in the case of Television Marti. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to give the President of the United States the opportunity to truly pursue his foreign policy goals. If he believes. as he said to me in that letter and has said time and time again. that it is in the national interests of the United States to do so. he should be given that opportunity.

We are seeing specific things almost on a weekly basis occurring in Cuba which show the problems that the Castro regime is having. Internal leadership in terms of fighting the regime. demonstrations where people are literally putting their lives at risk on a weekly basis at the present time. To stop what we are doing now. to make a Uturn. to make a 90degree turn in terms of the policies at the present time just does not make any sense at all. Let me focus in also on several specifics. One is the issue of the UHF ability which has not yet been tested. It is an ability in terms of having more people access to the station than exist today. but the message regardless is. I am sure that any of my colleagues who are supporting this amendment as they have spoken so eloquently already are not supportive of the Castro regime. are not supportive of his goals. are not supportive of his actions. but at the same time there is no question that changing the existence of both Radio and TV Marti would. in fact. support him in those goals. And I think the lesson of American foreign policy over this century has been not that we have looked at policies because they are easy. but because they are hard. It will not be easy. it has not been easy to change the Castro dictatorship. but I think that the specific things that we can see on the ground are proving that the dictatorships days are numbered. and I think this Congress in its greatest hours will be able to say that we were part of that in terms of the pressure that we have done through a variety of actions. including existence of Television Marti.",

I chair the subcommittee that oversees the State Department and we have held a hearing in which I have asked a number of questions that go right to the heart of this issue of these excess properties. I do believe that the Department of State should be more aggressive in the disposition of those properties that are either excessive or no longer needed. This provision is not necessary. however. because of the actions taken in the conference report for Commerce. Justice. and State Department appropriations for fiscal year 1997. in which the Department was directed to professionalize their asset management. The Department has set up a real estate advisory committee. bringing additional expertise on asset management. and the Department is committed to funding capital projects with assets from those sales. I would also point out. and I believe this very strongly. that changing the current law to have proceeds revert to the Treasury might act. however unwittingly. as a disincentive to the Department to dispose of those assets. So we would have an unintentional consequence as a result. Furthermore. the proceeds are used for facility maintenance. improvement. buildings and purchasing. This reduces the need for additional appropriations for this purpose. I appreciate again what the gentleman is attempting to do. and I would like to assure them that our subcommittee will be vigorous in its oversight.

The biggest piece of property that they sold. which was a $49 million piece of property in Singapore. they only sold because the Singapore government needed it for a road and actually condemned that land and compelled that sale. A $49 million piece of property in Singapore that our embassy did not need. A residence costing $92 million in Japan. which we are using as a residence for one of our mission members over there. Ninetytwo million. How do we say to the American people that we are housing some of our foreign operations people. that we are using a $92 million piece of property to house someone in the foreign ministry. yet we turn down requests for $10 million and $20 million here?

They are also trying to stop the 1996 campaign finance investigation process. Yesterday. the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight was in a meeting all day. 10 oclock to 6 oclock. Serious deliberations were interrupted by numerous nuisance votes to adjourn. Some people just want us to go home. They do not want the investigation to continue.

The major problem is there are so many other items that we ought to be considering and providing for in this bill that we do not because the 602(b) allocations were not adequate to fund the necessary things that we felt were important to our Nations security and also to the welfare and the care of those who serve in uniform. But because of the strong work done by all of those folks involved. we have a good bill. It provides the prioritized requirements of the Defense Department for all of the services. It makes a very strong statement on providing what is needed for quality of life for those who wear the uniform in defense of our Nation. Without going into a lot of detail. the bill is pretty much like it was when it passed the House before. with the exception that by the time we got to conference. our 602 allocation was reduced. so we had to reduce the number in the bill by over $600 million.

Critics point to a few controversial grants that the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has made. and I agree that some funding decisions may have been unwise. However. in recent years. the NEA has taken strides to eliminate controversy from the grant process by eliminating \"individual grants\" and \"subgrants.\" In fact. most of the funding from the agency is directed toward the cultural life and diversity of our countryto people of all ages. to people in our inner cities. in our suburbs. and in our rural communities. In Delaware. the NEA provides assistance to the Delaware Division of the Arts and the Delaware Humanities Forum so they may grant funding to the Delaware Symphony Orchestra. the Delaware Theater Company. Opera Delaware and many other community and school activities. When it comes to partnership between private. state. and Federal funding of the arts the NEA sets an outstanding example. According to the agency. one endowment dollar attracts twelve dollars or more from state and regional arts agencies as well as corporations. businesses and individuals. In fact. NEA funded programs generate economic activity through tourism. urban renewal and economic development throughout the nation. According to the NEA. nonprofit arts programs contribute an estimated $37 billion to the economy and are responsible for 1.3 million jobs. It is also important to note that most industrial countries have a national budget for the arts and humanities. The United Kingdom. Canada. the Netherlands. France. Germany and Sweden not only have national budgets for the arts. but in most cases. provide more funding for the arts than the United States. Federal support of the NEA opens the door to the arts for all Americans. sets a standard for private and public investment partnerships and generates economic development in our communities. In light of these facts. the Federal government can not neglect its responsibility in continued support of the arts. and I urge my colleagues to support the Johnson amendment to restore NEA funding.",

I know that the NEA would admit it has made mistakes in the past. but it has instituted a series of management reforms to ensure that those types of problems will not recur. Even given those problems. opponents of the NEA can point to only a handful of questionable grants out of hundreds of thousands that have been awarded during the 32year history of the NEA. After hearing real people and real artists discuss what the NEA has brought to them and to their communities. I know that the NEA is an incredible catalyst for bringing people together and expressing. in a creative fashion. the full range of the human experience. The National Endowment for the Arts is successfully working to bring arts to underserved communities. through after school youth programs that are introducing our young people to the power of creative expression as an alternative to violence. and through folk and traditional arts that remind us of our common bond and what it means to be an American. Moreover. the American public supports public funding for the arts. A Louis Harris poll indicates that. by a decisive 79 percent to 19 percent margin. a better than 3to1 majority of the American people is convinced that it is important that there should be federal. state. and local councils for the arts to develop new programs. research and provide financial assistance to worthy arts organizations.

This is a failure born of shortsightedness and is particularly troublesome given the challenges our Nation confronts in the next century. With regions around the world competing to develop the most efficient economies possible. we are holding ourselves back in this race by declining to support energy conservation. The Department of Energys renewable energy and efficiency programs have been extremely successful. These programs have saved American consumers billions. and I underscore the word billions. of dollars in utility bills. They have made housing more affordable for low and moderate income families. and these vital programs have helped communities nationwide reduce air pollution levels that burden local industry and threaten public health. The evidence is clear. energy efficiency is a wise investment. an investment with substantial return for consumers. business and the environment. Every dollar cut from energy efficiency programs represents a lost opportunity to make our buildings and motor vehicles more efficient and less costly for manufacturers and owners. These cuts in energy funding take dollars directly out of the pockets of our constituents. I believe that the American people want government that works. They want a government that saves money and improves our quality of life. The amendment before us will restore adequate funding for programs that achieve these important goals. Mr. Chairman. a wise man once said that those who fail to see the forest through the trees are doomed to get lost in the woods. We are lost indeed.

In the Army and in Oklahoma. we are very proud of Fort Sill and its contnbutlons to Oklahoma and to the Nation.

Even then. however. he was no stranger to Fort Sill since General Rigby is a native of neighboring Lawon. OK. In fact. General Rigby did his undergraduate schooling in Oklahoma. He then went on to build a distinguished record of milltary service that represents the absolute finest of that which we respect in our militarys leadership. Fort Sill has been blessed by General Rigbys strong and Inspiring leadership. His dedication to the highest standards have reverberated through every comer of this Important military facility. Regretfully. In the Army. the time always comes when Its time to move on. and the Army has found a new and challenging position for General Rigby in Washington. DC. The Lawton/Fort Sill community will sorely miss Randy and his remarkable wile Carol who have been such extraordinary good neighbors in both the personal and the professional sense. I would like to take this opportunity to wish Randy and Carol the very best for continued good success as they move on to their new assignment in the Nations Capitol.",

When those closest to Danny are asked what drives him the reply Is simple: He cares about his community. especially its children. In 1992. Sergeant Mastro created an antigang. antidrug billboard campaign directed at the youth of our community. Danny took this Innovative idea and made It a reality. He raised several thousand dollars In donations to pay for printing costs and was able to get local companies to donate over 100 billboards. The billboards pictured Sergeant Mastro with a local hockey and football star and the slogan \"Who Is Your Role Model Going to Be?\" it is my sincere hope that the children of Los Angeles will follow Dannys lead and choose people like him as their role models. Danny has played a vital role In numerous volunteer activities and community development programs. As part of an antigang unit. ho counseled atdsk youths teaching them to locus their energy away from violence toward more produclive and meaningful activities. He has galvanized support within the LAPD for several fund raising drives. He has also volunteered extensively in the Special Olympics. the Boy Scouts. and the local HeadStart Program.

Who benefits the most from a tax cut on capital gains. the rich or the middle class? The answer is. it depends on how we measure it.

I would suggest that if within 5 years we cannot fix the technical problems associated with broadcasting TV Marti to Cuba. then perhaps it is time to stop funding it. Also likewise with regard to the administrative problems associated with the program. administrative and managerial and programming problems. the gentleman made comparisons that it took 40.6 FTEs to produce a unit of broadcasting versus some much smaller. how much. with regard to radio. 8 for radio for other similar kinds of broadcasting.

I served on the Board of Supervisors for Santa Clara County for 14 years. We worked hard during times of declining county revenues to maintain vital services like health care for poor children. Every city and county needs an accurate Census that counts everybody in order to serve everybody. because each year Census data determines $180 billion in Federal spending. It helps determine money that goes into schools. transit systems. senior citizens centers. and health care facilities. People do not disappear when they are not counted. When there is an undercount. as there was in 1990. local taxpayers end up paying for Federal programs. That is why lawsuits were filed in California after the 1990 Census by both Democratic and Republican local officials. because an inaccurate census is not fair to local taxpayers. In 1990. the undercount in the State of California was estimated to be over 834.000 people. After the last Census we put our thinking caps on. The scientists came together and they came up with a scientific recommendation for a scientific count. I have heard a lot of discussion here today. but I think the American people are going to be able to figure out what is going on. Some people here are concerned that the people found through scientific methods might vote for Democrats. I do not know whether they will or not. but out in the real world. real local government officials of both parties want an accurate count that the scientists can provide us. so we can be fair to local taxpayers.

Mr. Chairman. this amendment does speak to the ability for us to implement both the selfsufficiency contracts that are the means by which tenants begin to outline the steps that they might take. voluntarily. with the housing authority. to return to selfsufficiency. It also speaks to the core issue of community work and community service that this House has been debating for the last several days. Mr. Chairman. housing authorities In America recelv from the Federal Government almost $3 billion a year to subsidize their operating expenses right now. Under the terms of lR. 2. the bill before this House. housing authorities would continue to receive neaxly 53 billion a year to subsidize their operating expenses. According to the Congressional Budget Office. who has looked at this. this is not an unfunded mandate. They do not characterize it that way. As a matter of fact. their review of the provision in this bill suggests that. through the management changes made In this bill. through the flexibility that inures to the housing authorities. there will be savings. savings. to the housing authorities in -xeess of $100 million annually. The Idea that we would ask the housing authorities to do a little bit more so that they would change their mission from simply being a place where people receive their housing to broaden their mission to include the assistance of helping people transform to selfsufficiency. Is a valid one. n \"TO It is a valid mission. It is an appropriate mission. We should be focusing on the core issues of poverty and not just on the symptoms of providing shelter. Because the issue of poverty is much broader than simply housing. although housing obviously is one of the core issues. I would say that to ask housing authorities to do this minimal additional program of implementing selfsufficiency contracts and implementing the community work program in return for the great flexibility that they would receive under this bill. where over two dozen programs are consolidated into two. an operating fund and a capital grant. is not unreasonable.

E 1145 I am on record in the past saying while I am a very strong supporter of the arts. I make personal contributions to different efforts around the country. I d6 believe that when we look at the limited resources that we have here In Washington. D.C. and the fact that priorities need to be established. I think it is a very justifiable debate to say that expending hardworking taxpayer dollars on the arts is in fact not the most responsible use of those dollars when we have a very strong economy and voluntary contributions. with tax deductibility. can in fact be expanded. But as far as this rule is concerned. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me that with this controversy we have without an authorization run by this structure that we have put into place saying that we should not have this measure protected in the appropriations bill but we will still. when it is struck out. have the opportunity for an upordown vote to be made with the Johnson amendment that will be made in order. So I think that the rhetoric is what has troubled me in saying that this is somehow Byzantine and extremely partisan when we are giving the debate an opportunity to be heard in the House. I do support this rule and the final bill as it comes forward.",

But I want to talk about a matter that involves part of our district in Tennessee. the Land Between the Lakes. because there is a legislative provision protected in the rule that makes little economic sense. is unfair to the people of the country and is punitive toward the Tennessee valley. LBL. Land Between the Lakes. is currently managed by the Tennessee Valley Authority with an annual budget of about $11 million. $4.5 million of that coming from user fees. It draws more than 2 million visitors each year and is the hub of our local economy. TVAs management. policies and employees performance at LBL has been under a thinly disguised attack by the House leadership for more than 2 years. notwithstanding the fact that virtually every objective person who has an interest in its future agrees that TVA is doing a good job of stewardship. The TVA Caucus. the National Wild Turkey Federation. the Tennessee Conservation League. and the Land Between the Lakes Association all say so. This record of sound management now depends on the outcome of a HouseSenate conference reconciling fiscal year 1999 energy and water appropriations. What is protected in this rule is the backup plan. what they characterize as a backup plan. It is part of the continued attack on TVA in general and in my judgment will ultimately imperil LBLs future as the national treasure as a wilderness area in the eastern United States it is. It sets in motion a transfer of LBLs management to the National Forest Service. Given the budget considerations that the Forest Service has in respect to the problems it has budgetarily outlined in the Public Lands Funding Initiative. I would hate to see LBL get lost in the Forest Service backlog. Let me just say this. Transferring LBL to the Forest Service or perhaps other Federal agencies in my judgment will not save the taxpayers of this country one single dime. This is not the way to go on LBL.",

Mr. President. it was Samuel Johnson who said in 1777 that knowledge that you will be hanged in a fortnight does wonders to concentrate your mind. In 1998. former Senate majority leader. George Mitchell. proved the truth of this aphorism by giving the Northern Ireland peace talks a Good Friday deadline. placing upon these negotiations the equivalent. if you will. of a sunset provision that left the parties with no alternative but finally to come up with a real solution.

Some years ago. it scarcely seemed possible to imagine a Northern Ireland in which children could grow up without fear of violence and bloodshed. Today. however. due to the extraordinary efforts of former Senator George Mitchell. this brighter future is not only imaginableit is very nearly here. That Senator Mitchell should possess such statesmanship and skill is. of course. no surprise to the people in my home State of Maine. Senator Mitchell is greatly admired in this country for his work on behalf of the citizens of Maine and indeed of all Americans. Today. however. the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Irelandand peaceloving people everywherealso owe Senator Mitchell a great debt for helping to steer these talks to their successful conclusion. I do not believe that we would be celebrating this agreement without his heroic efforts. It is my great hope that with his statesmanship and .steady hand. Senator Mitchell has now made it possible to achieve a real reconciliation in Northern Irelandand for the Irish people to go about building their future together. in cooperation rather than in conflict. I am very pleased that the Senate has passed overwhelmingly a resolution expressing our support for the Irish peace process and the brighter future represented by this truly historic agreement.

Our bill will give law enforcement the necessary tools to stop crimes against children. especially those initiated through the Internet and commercial online services.

In some of the most tragic instances. these criminals have convinced children to travel long distances to meet them. only to face horrendous abuse by their \"hosts.\" In response to the growing number of these crimes. Congress has and will surely continue to appropriate funds to allow collaboration among FBI and state and local law enforcement to develop effective means to prevent innocent children from being exploited. In the past. funds have been used to train officers to detect cybercrime. pursue sexual predators and establish child sexual exploitation cybersquads of state and local officers. But the responsibility of Congress is not only to provide necessary resources. We have an unfinished responsibility to give officers the legal tools they need to stop these crimes before they happen. In addition. Congress must send the unequivocal message to criminals who dare to prey on children that such crimes will not be tolerated.

I believe the year 1999. the bicentennial of Washingtons death. may be further consecrated. Therefore. I am introducing a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling upon the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee to issue a stamp which celebrates the leadership and courage possessed by Washington. The life of this great patriot is an extraordinary parable of nationalism and a belief in the power of a republican form of government. Upon emerging victorious in the Revolutionary War. General Washington laid aside the instruments of destruction to craft a young nation. Discarding any intimations of personal glory. Washington spurned the title of Monarch and instead chose to model the new country on the ancient principles of democracy. He was truly a \"First among Equals\". Washington was very much aware of the momentous nature of the first presidential term for our emerging democracy. He wrote. I walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent. We must. as a Nation. recognize the value of responsibility. Washington shouldered the responsibility of his two terms in office with grace and dignity. ever aware that he would be an example for countries around the world for time eternal. Through a heightened cognizance of the actions and beliefs of Washington. we can convey the true meaning of service to our Nation. I ask my colleagues what better way to honor such a man. than to devote a year to honoring his life. In this pursuit. it is fitting to request that a George Washington stamp be issued in 1999. Let us reflect upon the tradition of character of our Nation. inaugurated by our first President.

At the end of World War II. these members retained their military rank and compensation but returned to civilian duties as the NOAA Corps. Today. the corps numbers approximately 300 officers. The corps operates the NOAA Fleet. flies the agencys hurricane research planes. and conducts a variety of activities essential for managing the Nations natural resources. This bill seeks to maintain these services while improving the costeffectiveness of the program. Under this legislation. civilian service positions would be created equivalent to existing NOAA Corps positions. Those officers with less than 15 years service would be eligible for these new civilian positions. while those with more than 15 years of service would be retired. Retired officers would still have an opportunity to compete for additional NOAA positions. as determined by the Under Secretary. The entire corps retirement program would be transferred to the Department of the Navy under this proposal. Disestablishment of the corps has been recommended by the Vice Presidents National Performance Review. the Government Accounting Office. and the inspector general of the Department of Commerce. The GAO estimates that this bill would save $5 million over a 10year period. I am concerned that the NOAA Corps officers be treated fairly. and I understand that several of my colleagues have additional concerns about the Impacts of this legislation. I look forward to addressing these issues through the committee process. By Mr. FEINGOLD:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to introduce the After School Education and Safety Act of 1997. This bill creates after school enrichment programs for kindergarten. elementary. and secondary schoolaged students. Todays youth face far greater social risks than did their parents and grandparents. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent crimes between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.a time when they are not in school. My bill will help schools expand their capacity to address the needs of schoolaged children between these critical hours. Since juvenile crime peeks at the close of the schooldaywe need to give children a safe and supervised place where they can use those hours to their best advantage. Education is a key component of success. This bill seeks to increase the academic success of students while working to improve their intellectual. social. physical. and cultural skills. For older students. programs will be available to prepare them for work force participation. Schools receiving grants under the act must provide at least two of the following programs: Mentoring. academic assistance. recreational activities. or technology training. It is critical that we work with our Nations children during their school years to create strong foundations in academics. technology. and other fields which will carry them into adulthood. Schools will be able to work within their communities to design programs that meet the needs of the area. Activities authorized by the bill are to take place in a school building or another public facility designated by the school. Mr. President. the best investment we can make in this country is in our children. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and join me in making after school a safe time for our Nations children. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included in the RECORD.",

CNA is one of the Nations largest insurance companies. It employs over 20.000 people nationwide. 6.000 of whom live and work in Illinois. It has offices in more than 100 cities and is represented by nearly 80.000 independent insurance agents across the country. CNA has always prided itself on being an innovator In the insurance industry. When women began to enter the work force in the early 1900s. CNA was among the first to offer them accident and health coverage. CNA also met the concerns of farmers by developing a new product specifically tailored to their accident and health needs. CNA was one of the first companies to offer workers compensation coverage and was one of the first to provide retirement income annuities for senior citizens before the establishment of Social Security. CNA has also played a behindthescenes role in some of our Nations most memorable events. CNA insured Presidential candidates Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower against accidents during their campaigns in 1952 and insured President John F. Kennedys inaugural festivities. It also insured the Beatles 1965 Shea Stadium performance for the Ed Sullivan Show and the Apollo 16 astronauts 1972 flight to the moon. Mr. President. I ask to have printed in the RECORD a more detailed history of CNA that was recently prepared by the company and I would like to congratulate CNA for 100 years of insuring America. I hope that during the next 100 years. CNA continues its record of success and remains a leader in the insurance industry.",

Karen was an Albert Bradley third century professor in the sciences at Dartmouth College. who died of mercury poisoning on June 8 while working on the cutting edge of the scientific and academic communities. Karen. a research chemist of international reputation. spanned the fields of inorganic chemistry. biochemistry. and chemical toxicology. Sometime last year while working with dimethyl mercury. she came in contact with and received mercury poisoning during her studies of mercury toxicity. A dedicated member of the Dartmouth community. her work involved understanding how elevated levels of the elements known as heavy metals. which include chromium. lead. and arsenic. interfere with the processes of cell metabolism and the transfer of genetic information. Karen not only shaped the work inside her laboratory but in the classroom as well. Dr. Wetterhahn helped to develop curriculum in the life science area know as structural biology. which studies the structure of biologically active molecules such as DNA. RNA. and proteins to learn how they function. She was born in Plattsburgh. NY. in 1948 and graduated from St. Marys High School in Champlain. NY. Karen graduated magna cum laude at St. Lawrence University where she earned her bachelors degree. She received her doctorate from Columbia University in 1975. where she won the prestigious Hammett Award in chemistry. Karen was also a National Institutes of Health trainee at the Institute of Cancer Research. Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. also in 1975. One year later she joined the faculty of Dartmouth College. in Hanover. NH. Karen also had an instrumental role in making Dartmouths sciences and administration more representative of the changing faces in the college community. While in Hanover. she cofounded Dartmouths women in science project. which was aimed at increasing the number of women majoring and taking courses In the sciences. Mr. President. Dr. Wetterhahn worked to make the world a better place. and she will be truly missed by all of us who knew and worked with her. Researchers like the late Karen Wetterhahn are important to the future of New Hampshire and the future of this Nation.*",

Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller. in ongoing disaster recovery efforts in South Dakota. Early this year. residents of Minnesota. North Dakota. and South Dakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold temperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings. roads with only one lane cleared. homes without heat for days. hundreds of thousands of dead livestock. and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As if surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough. residents of the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother Nature had yet to inflict with a 500year flood. Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over 5.000 residents of Watertown. SD. to evacuate their homes and left over onethird of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The city of Bruce. SD was completely underwater when record low temperatures turned swollen streams into sheets of ice. At the height of the snowstorms in South Dakota. Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller drove snowplows at 3 to 4 miles per hour and in zero visibility to open roads for rescue and emergency medical crews. Wind gusts of 40 miles per hour dropped the temperature to nearly 70 degrees below zero as the medical crews followed Bob and Ron for 263 miles to rescue families without heat and stranded motorists from all over the county. While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction wrought by this years snowstorms and floods. I have been heartened to witness firsthand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their community to protect homes. farms. and entire towns from vicious winter weather and rising flood waters. The selfless actions of Bob Bellack and Ron Heumiller illustrate the resolve within South Dakotans to help our neighbors in times of trouble. Mr. President. there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair our impacted communities. Bob Bellack. Ron Heumiller. and the individuals at the McCook County Highway Department illustrate how the actions of a community can bring some relief to the victims of this natural disaster. and I ask you to join me in thanking them for their selfless efforts.*",

This vitamin could prevent six to nine cases of these birth defects per day. saving $245 million per year in the United States. On June 10. 1997. the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation released a new nationwide survey which shows that while more American women of childbearing age have heard of folic acid. the proportion of women. actually taking a multivitamin on a daily basis remains low. Only 32 percent of women ages 18 to 45 take a daily multivitamin containing folic acid. Awareness of folic acid jumped 14 percentages points over the 2year period. from 52 percent of women in 1995 to 66 percent in 1997. However. women under age 25 are the least likely to consume vitamins daily. with only 23 percent reporting that they do so. and this age group accounts for 39 percent of all births in the United States. It is because of these statistics that I encourage my colleagues to vote for S. 419. the Birth Defects Prevention Act of This legislation would establish a national birth defects surveillance. research. and prevention system. This system would include research projects for the prevention of neural tube defects. onehalf of which could be prevented if women of child bearing age consumed a small amount of folic acid daily. In addition. this legislation would set up public education programs to teach more women about the importance of folic acid to the health of their children. And so together with the March of Dimes I encourage my colleagues to pass this important legislation.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. mortgage insurance is and always has been a powerful tool for American home buyers. Of course. what it does is to reduce the risk of making a low down payment. longterm mortgage. by Insuring that the lender. or the investor in that mortgage. will be paid in the event the borrower defaults. With mortgage insurance. tens of millions of Americans have been able to afford a home. Without mortgage insurance. buyers would have to come up with a down payment of about 20 percent. and probably would be able to get only a shortterm mortgage. Before the advent of mortgage insurance. only about a third of Americans owned a home. Today more than twothirds do. As great as mortgage insurance is. the truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need. To the average buyer. it costs anywhere from $30 to $100 a month. Anyone who has a good payment record and at least 20 percent equity probably does not need mortgage insurance. But the truth is buyers who should not be paying for insurance are paying millions of dollars in premiums. Some buyers who know this. like our colleague. the gentleman from Utah",

I think it should be noted that the biggest and most reputable mortgage servicers in the country. including one headquartered in my State. are beginning to provide borrowers notices on PMI. Finally. a number of States already require or are considering requiring notices on PMI. For instance. the States of California and New York. which comprise 20 percent of the home mortgage market. require disclosure to borrowers on this kind of insurance.

This legislation will clarify what the responsibilities of market participants are concerning PMI. Without this legislation. in States which do not have State PMI laws. it will be the courts who will determine by judicial flat the legal liability of the mortgage industry participants on an ad hoc basis. This bill provides more certainty to the law concerning a borrowers rights and PMI and thus is intended to make litigation less likely. Mortgage market players have expressed some concern that the provision of the bill requiring the conditions for terminating PMI be reasonably related to the requirements for private mortgage insurance may precipitate unnecessary litigation.

Mr. Speaker. I am very concerned that House Resolution 607 would adversely affect new home buyers In Montana and throughout the country. As the bill Is currently written. it will drive new home buyers. with a low downpayment. to pay higher Interest rates and higher premiums for their private mortgage Insurance. Due to the bills automatic cancellation trigger of private mortgage Insurance at the 75 percent loan to value ratio. the available pool of insurance funds will shift the risk to lenders which In turn will raise Interest rates for low downpayment mortgages. In addition. the bill would increase the premiums significantly for new homeowners who would be required to purchase private mortgage Insurance below the 75 percent loan to value ratio. In addition to the automatic trigger provisions. I am also concerned with the bills section (h) which Is so loosely worded that It exposes the mortgage industry and lender to frivolous class action lawsuits that will benefit only a handful of trial lawyers. without commensurate benefit to borrowers. As a result. the increased cost of these lawsuits would be passed on to home buyers In the form of higher costs for mortgages. Finally. Mr. Speaker. this bill has gone from a simple disclosure bill to one that attempts to micro manage the daytoday business transactions of the mortgage market. This is done by making the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. a bureaucratic agency that cannot manage its own affairs. responsible for regulating of the mortgage insurance industry.

I run across a story that I feel stands out. These shining individuals are what I like to call Hoosier Heroes. These Heroes are an inspiration to me. and by sharing their stories I hope they can not only be an inspiration to my colleagues today. but as well as the American people. Mr. Speaker. Terri Towner of Pendleton. Indiana. is a Hoosier Hero. Her dedication to the Senior Citizens of Madison County provides us with a role model that we all can strive to model. Terri is a volunteer for PetAPal. a volunteer organization that incorporates animals to bring smiles to the faces of Senior Citizens by parading animals in costumes. Jo Rehm. coordinator of the PetAPal program. described Terri as \"a dedicated and faithful volunteer to the Senior Citizens.\" She continued by adding that Terri \"simply enjoys helping others.\" Sharron Towner. her mother. feels that her dedication to helping Senior Citizens stems from her strong relationship with her grandparents. and thats why Terri really appreciates what Senior Citizens have to offer. When not volunteering her time. Terri enjoys playing the trumpet in the East Side Church of God band and is an active member in Sunday school. Youth Pastor Andy Odle described Terri as. \"a very responsible. talented. intelligent young lady.\" After high school. Terri plans on attending Purdue University to study prelaw. She hopes to be able to utilize her education to become involved in laws pertaining to Senior Citizens. This is testimony from people that have seen the difference that one person can make. This is just one example. of one person who has made a significant difference on the lives of others. Dedication. faithfulness. responsibility. these are examples of the values and beliefs that sometimes go unnoticed. Mr. Speaker. this is the foundation for the American spirit. Doing the right thing. Helping others and demonstrating the qualities that make us \"good\" people. These are the qualities that Terri Towner has learned. and this is why she is a Hoosier Hero.

Another increase in the minimum wage will have a negative impact on jobs. especially jobs for teenagers. Increases in the minimum wage lead employers to cut back on work hours and training. Unfortunately. lowskilled teenage workers will be the first to be affected. Combining the cutback of hours and training with the loss of job opportunities. this means that many youths are prevented from reaching the first rung on the ladder of success.

Chestnut and John Gibson. On Friday afternoon Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson embodied all that it means to be an American hero. They were ordinary people who went to extraordinary lengths to protect and defend freedom not just for Members of the large congressional family. but also for all Americans. These two brave officers literally laid down their lives so that others could live. and for that dedication of courage we are eternally grateful. Every day in the peoples House we are surrounded by the protection of the United States Capitol Police. In serving our country. the men and women of the police force touch all of us who visit and work in the Capitol. They become our friends. they become our colleagues. and of course they are our protectors. J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson epitomize this dedication of service and commitment to all that we value as good in this world. Mr. Speaker. I considered J.J. a friend. as did countless Members and staff. My office is very near where he stands. and we had shared a few words the night before he died as we Members left the Capitol very close to midnight. and we talked about how the next day would be a little easier. and we did not know that that would be his very last night. Nor did I know that the next afternoon. the first shot that I heard from behind my closed door was the shot that took J.J.s life.

On Friday. Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson showed that the reputation of the Capitol Police for dedicated professionalism is fully earned and richly deserved. These two men were part of a police force that operates at once like a friendly small town police department and a crack security force. It is hard to pull that off. but they do it every day. Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson were devoted men who were part of a splendid force. In FY 1997 there were 286 reported crimes on the Capitol grounds. and the Capitol Police made arrests in 252 of them. What a record. The Capitol Police patrol part of the Capitol Hill community as well. In the first 5 months of this year. these dedicated officers made 413 arrests in the community. up from 258 for the entire previous year. Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson did not expect to lose their lives. but they clearly were prepared to do so. They knew that they were part of a department that protects the highestprofile accessible building in the Nation. They knew that this duty put them in harms way. They were prepared to pay the price for this temple of democracy and all who visit or work here. and tragically they did. There are no words that fit that price.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the United States is currently negotiating a new bilateral aviation agreement with Japan. It is vitally important that the United States press for the broadest possible agreement that would open up nonstop service to Tokyo from Houston. TX. Priority must be given first to providing service to those major U.S. cities. including Houston. that have no nonstop service to Tokyo at all currently. There is ample traffic to support daily nonstop service between Houston and Tokyo. In addition. more competition is needed between new United States gateways and Japan rather than additional increased service from existing United States -Japan service points. Why does Houston deserve nonstop service? Houston is the fourth largest city in the Nation and is a huge market which is currently unserved by nonstop service to Japan. The addition of nonstop air service will result in substantial economic benefit to Houston as it would increase annual output by over $800 million. provide over 5.600 new jobs. and increase incomes in Houston by $170 million. Here are more facts to back up this argument. Houston is the largest city in the United States without nonstop service to Tokyo. Houston is also the second largest United States metropolitan area in terms of Asian population that does not have single plane service to Asia. Houston is the second largest international traffic gateway without single plane service to Asia. Two hundred seventythree Houston firms currently trade goods and services with Japan. Nearly 540 other Houston companies do business with East Asia as a whole. including Japan. Japanese companies have almost 90 subsidiaries in Houston as well as the largest concentration of Japanese specialty chemical companies outside of Japan. That is also in Houston. Houston is the Nations second leading city for international business. I am proud to have joined the gentleman from Texas . the chairman. and my other Houston colleagues in a letter to the President earlier this year on this issue. As negotiations continue with Japan. consideration should be given to the fact that new service between unserved United States cities and Japan is more competitive and more preferable than additional service from cities that already have service to Japan.",

They extended a 2.5 cent per gallon gasoline tax increase. they raised the taxes on Social Security. Before 1993 we were faced not only with the broken promises of a balanced budget but with the discussion about how high to raise taxes and which taxes should be raised first. That has changed too. In 1997 we passed the first tax cut in 16 years. and I know we want to talk about where else we are going here on paying off the debt. but I think we should look at the fact that we have a balanced budget for the first time in 30 years. lower taxes for the first time in 16 years. and also restored Medicare in a very different way than they did in 1993.",

This red line shows how fast spending was going. up again before 1995. and after 1995 we can see the red lines going up at a slower rate. Well. if the red line is going up at the slower rate. the blue line shows how fast revenue is growing up. Well. if revenue and spending was going up at the same rate. the deficit remained. But we now have a good economy. so the blue line starts going up a little faster. At the same time the red line is going up slower. Spending is going up slower. Revenue is going up faster. That gets us to a balanced budget ahead of schedule. and that is exactly what has happened. But not only is the budget balanced at this point. we can see what is going to happen next: With the spending going up at a slower rate than the rate of revenue growth. we are going to start running a surplus.

My suggestion would be that we simply put negotiable Treasury bonds into the Social Security trust fund so when the money is needed to make good on the Social Security checks for our senior citizens. we simply cash the negotiable or sell the negotiable instrument that is in there.

Let me go one step further. As this plan is put into place. I think it is very significant that we recognize that we will stop using the Social Security trust fund money to mask the true size of the deficit.

We are not certainly calling for that under this act. We do not even talk about privatizing Social Security. But some of our future generations may decide instead of buying these nonnegotiable Treasury bills. they would rather have a chance to have some investments in mutual funds. So maybe the government no longer is the arbiter of what is the best investment for families. Maybe we are able to turn away from the government and say let the private sector determine. and yet preserve some security. I wanted to be very careful and state carefully for seniors that are listening tonight. we are not talking about privatizing your Social Security system. We are talking about preserving and protecting. What we are talking about is 30 years from now when we pay off the huge debt that this Congress has run up for the past 40 years. we are talking about making for the first time meaningful financial reform of our government so that we expect from our government the same we expect from our families. I will tell you and I will claim as I have done in my district. if a family bounces checks the way we bounced our budget. they would be arrested and charged with theft and a crime.",

If there is any business owner in America today that set up a pension fund for his employees or her employees and then did not put the money in the pension fund. put in nonnegotiable instruments owned by the company. or IOUs. as USA Today calls it. as well as several others. that business owner would be locked up in jail. Also it would be illegal. What is being done in the trust fund and private sector would not be permitted. That is why it is so important to get the National Debt Repayment Act and Social Security Preservation Act put into place to preserve Social Security for our seniors. When you talk about privatizing or the thought of young people doing something different on that. let me be clear where I stand on that. Before we begin that discussion. as far as I am concerned. I want to make sure the money that is supposed to be in the trust fund to preserve Social Security for our seniors today is put back into that trust fund. That leads us back to this bill. We capped the growth of Government spending at a rate slower than the rate of revenue growth. and it is very clear on this chart what happens. When spending is going up slower than the revenue growth. we create this surplus. That is where we get the money to put back into the Social Security that has been taken out and spent on other government programs for the last 15 or 20 years before we got here to stop this thing. I think one of the important directives we have gotten from the American people when they changed control of the House of Representatives in 1994 was to balance the budget. restore the Social Security trust fund. and let us start lowering taxes.

Ninetyeight percent of the U.S. foreign trade travels by ship. Half of Americans live within 50 miles of the coastline.

The international focus on ocean resources presents a very good opportunity for us to make substantive improvements to the U.S. oceans programs.

We usually look at natural disasters and base closures as sort of the two major reasons that we need economic relief. I happen to represent the city of Monterrey. CA. which at one time was the largest sardine port in the world. certainly well known by the writings of John Steinbeck in \"Cannery Row.\" Sardines disappeared. They are coming back in small numbers now. But they are mostly a bycatch rather than the main catch. But that was in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Everybody has agreed that the reason they disappeared is that they were just overfished. It shut down an entire industry. entire community. It was before we knew about disaster relief. I think what we are seeing with the impact of the pfiesteria infection on the Maryland shores is that we have got to have a much better awareness of what is happening to animals. to fish. and to marine life. because we are really dependent on it. We may not be totally dependent on it for food stocks. but we are dependent on it for economic survival in our communities. for recreation. for tourism. for restaurants. and. essentially. if the ocean is not healthy. then our communities cannot be healthy.

I strongly support efforts to focus attention on these bodies of water. which comprise nearly threequarters of the Earths surface.

During the past 3 years. the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation.

In fact. we have been successful in convincing the appropriators that accurate charts are essential to the maritime community and that adequate funding is necessary.

On July 11. Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois. who is a political appointee running the Office of Legislative Affairs. and who frankly is very unlikely to have access to the classified information. the sensitive information on which Chairman THOMPSON based his opening statement about the influence of Chinese money in American Government on. this individual. this Assistant Attorney General. sent a letter asserting that the chairmans statement did not represent the views of the executive branch. Now. this is important for the following reason. Recall that when Chairman THOMPSON began the Governmental Affairs hearings. he announced that the committee had sensitive information implicating the Chinese Government for its efforts to involve itself illegally and improperly in American political campaigns. Some people in the media and in the minority questioned whether Chairman THOMPSON could legitimately make that claim. His response could only be that it had been cleared with the FBI. of the Department of Justice. and the CIA. He could not go any further because information was classified and highly sensitive. So he was in effect defenseless. Mr. President. to further explain his position. But he had to rely upon peoples reliance upon his statements. Then comes this letter from the Justice Department casting doubt on Chairman THOMPSONs assertions saying. no. they had not cleared the content of his statement.

One of the things I will always remember about WALTER is just how incredibly strongwilled he was in a body of very strongwilled people. How else can you explain a man who. at not a terribly young age. invested the time and energy he did in two campaigns. including one while he was seriously injured. in the hospital. Yet one of the unique things about WALTER was. while he was so strongwilled. he was so incredibly selfless. WALTER invested his will in a search for the truth. The other thing I will remember about WALTER is his quiet strength. In a place where there is a lot of noise and hyperbole. WALTER lived as an example of the power of knowledge. a belief in the power of conviction. in the power of belief. That is the way he went about conducting his business. He did so in a way that set a very powerful example for all of us. The other thing I will remember about WALTER is his incredible peace. his incredible stillness. to me a reflection of a very rich spiritual life and a tremendous sense of selfknowledge. I think some of us were even a little envious. WALTER knew who he was. he knew what he believed. and he simply came here to do it. WALTERS untimely passing is our loss. Above all. WALTER was a great teacher. We were just starting to learn from WALTER.

In his year in the Congress of the United States of America. he added immeasurably to the lives of those with whom he served. His thoughtfulness. his eagerness to engage in dialogue on both sides of the aisle. and his commitment to the idea that wellmeaning people can reason together was an inspiration and should be a model for all us. I met WALTER CAPPS during the freshman orientation of the 105th Congresss new Members. He was thrilled to be here. Walter was a brave man. He had run for Congress once and lost. and had the courage to run again. He was delighted to be a Member of the Congress of the United States of America. He was gracious. incredibly gracious as he introduced each and every one of us to his wife. Lois. Most importantly. WALTER CAPPS was a man who understood governance. He understood he was part of making our democratic system work. He came to Washington to make democracy work. He wanted it to work for the country that he loved and respected. In his year here he only enhanced that democractic system he loved so much. Most importantly. WALTER CAPPS understood the relationship between this great country and religion. He understood that that wall between the U.S. Government and our houses of worship had to be an incredibly strong wall. That should be universally understood in this body. and if WALTER CAPPS had reminded here. he would have been able to explain to every Member in this body that they should not mix government and religion. So that is one of the reasons. of the many reasons that I feel so badly that WALTER has left us. because he could have led us in that dialog. In a way it is fitting that WALTER CAPPS left us as he did. rushing back to the Capitol to serve his constituents. My thoughts are with his wife. Lois. and with his children. I hope they will find comfort in the fact that this wonderful man had such an impact on this body in 1 year.",

I guess we are all in shock. considering that yesterday at this time our colleague was en route to this very room. and today he is not with us. I do not know what we all have to say. except to reflect on the fact that we serve in an institution that he campaigned to be here in a style which is remarkable. because he comes here with such unusual gifts that this institution needs. He has a doctorate. There are not many Members of Congress that have doctorates. He has written 14 books. Not many Members have written any. He was an incredible human being with just a family that is the envy of everyone. And I guess as the son of a politician. I rise sort of for Lisa and for Todd and Laura. who are his kids. who no longer have a father. and for Lois. his wife. who is just a remarkable woman. I think his life teaches that we have to take a look at this institution. at the way we treat one another. the way we treat our radical schedule. and remember that he represented on this battlefield of this floor. a peacemaker. We need more peacemakers. And we need to make sure that WALTER CAPPS. who was a gift to this institution. shall not die in vain. that in his memory this institution will better itself and that we will be more civil. that we will better treat our schedule and people who serve in public office. Because. Mr. Speaker. he is the one who did not have to serve. He had a career in education. He chose to come here. and that is the kind of people we like to attract to this institution. But if we keep treating ourselves the way we have been. people like WALTER CAPPS will not come to the U.S. Congress. Let us not let him die in vain. Let us remember him. and to Lisa. Todd. Laura and Lois. I am very. very sorry.",

I am very proud to have entered the Congress with WALTER CAPPS and to have served on the Committee on Science with him. The Committee on Science is meeting as we are here today. It is meeting about a subject that WALTER cared deeply about. and that is science education. Science education is something that we shared a great and common interest in and WALTER sat right next to me on the Committee on Science. and I will go back to committee this morning and he will not be there. But I will always remember his wonderful commitment and intellect. the caring that has been talked about this morning. There are so many common themes and words that we are hearing from colleagues this morning about our friend. WALTER CAPPS. His sense of humor. His strength. His quietness. His caring. His dedication. He is a gentleman who worked very. very hard on behalf of his constituents and cared and was so proud of his wonderful family.

Very few of us have the opportunity to make a difference in the world. WALTER CAPPS was such a person. Whenever I saw him. he shared a great appreciation for the best our Nation had to offer. He was a lover of the principles of democracy. He cared deeply for the people he represented. I heard of WALTERS accomplishment as a scholar. teacher. writer. and thinker long before he came to Congress. When he came here in January of this year. I wanted to meet him because I knew he would add something different to this body. I knew that he was not a seasoned politician. but a deeply caring and sharing citizen of his community. I knew that WALTER loved ideas and that somehow his ideas would shape the laws we make and the destiny of our democracy. Mr. Speaker. on several occasions I had an opportunity to talk with WALTER on the floor. in the cloakroom. walking across the lawn. Just last Thursday we had an opportunity to talk. and he was so pleased to introduce me to the grandson of Cesar Chavez. WALTER CAPPS was the personification of the best of human kind. and I think we all can learn from his example. He was our colleague. He was my friend. He was my brother. To Lois. his wife. and to his family. we mourn with you. And as Members. we are more than lucky we are blessed we had an opportunity to know him. We will miss WALTER.",

Mr. WALTER CAPPS. a distinguished literary man. a professor of religion. but more than that. a man who would take the issues of this Congress. listen to them thoroughly. and then let his conscience and the wellbeing of the American citizens determine how he would cast his vote. Mr. Speaker. I sat with him last Thursday as we discussed the Loretta Sanchez case out in Californias 46th. How worried and troubled he was that an election that could be won by some 900 votes could be simply thrown aside and castigated and. more than that. the Congresswoman duly elected be chastised and harassed after having won an election in his beautiful home State of California. Mr. Speaker. I sponsored the Wilma Rudolph Congressional Gold Medal legislation last week. and I think my legislation might have been the last one that Mr. WALTER CAPPS was able to cosponsor. I am proud to have him as a cosponsor. I want his wife. Lois. and his family to know that all of us will remember WALTER as we carry out our congressional duties. that this Congress will be a better Congress because WALTER served here. So. Mr. Speaker.

He was a professor of theology. and he was very. very strong in his faith. yet he did not preach to others. He was an academician. but not in the ivory tower sense. He had a wonderful and very witty sense of humor. He was humble. When my colleague just mentioned that he had written 14 books. with his great sense of humor and his humbleness he might have turned to me as a member of the Committee on Science and said. \"Roemer. have you even read 14 books?\" He was somebody who always sought out other peoples opinions and listened to those opinions to form his own view. Yet that was not a view that was a weak view. it was a resolute view and an informed view. Finally. Mr. Speaker. I would say as I come from the Committee on Science. where I shared that committee with Professor and Congressman CAPPS. he worked and was dedicated to issues such as science and education. Well. now where he rests he can work on issues that he cares maybe even more deeply about. That is personal faith and world peace. May God bless you.",

I want to engage the gentleman in a colloquy regarding the Centers for Disease Control AIDS prevention funds. Let me first say that I believe we should all have compassion for the victims of AIDS. I support continued funding for AIDS treatment prevention and care. However. it seems to me that the Federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first and treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal. even though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound response. I believe the focus should be changed to personal responsibility on the part of those infected. I am specifically concerned about the viability of groups such as PFOX. the Parents and Friends of Exgays. PFOX is a national organization that reaches out to men and women who want to leave the gay lifestyle. PFOXs ultimate message is that homosexuals have options. No one has to be gay and enter Its subculture. instead. they can be heterosexual or live a life of abstinence. My question relates to the eligibility for CDC prevention funds.

This debate is about whether or not to improve education by creating competition. It is about empowering parents to make the best choice with their hardearned dollars to spend on their kids education. What do we want for our kids? We want them to have a life better than ours. Let us give them every opportunity. The liberal Democrats. and by the way they are not all liberals anymore. thank God. their way has been to tax people to death and then give the money back. This is exactly what the substitute that they are offering says: Tax people to death. then give them money back with strings attached and basically tell them how to use that money. Our way Is to let parents make that decision on how and where their kids will be educated. private or public schools. Let us not forget that those parents are paying public property taxes to support public schools anyway. Let us give poor and middleclass families the same opportunity to send their kids to the school of their choice just as our wealthy President. President Clinton. has the option to send his child to a private school. This is not about rich versus poor. this is about the future of education in this country. And let us make parents. rich. poor or middle class. let us give them all the same choice that just the rich people have now.",

We should leave up to the State and local governments to decide how they want to fund public education. I think we all agree with that. But let me put again back in perspective my concern about this. I will talk about my public sector experience. not when I was in the private sector as a banker. When I was a staffer on the Hill and I made $25.000 a year. I would not have as much disposable income like the staffers on the Hill to do that to set aside. But now as a Member of Congress making $133.000 a year. under this bill I would have more disposable income. therefore. I have more income to invest. whether It is a prudent investment or not. But just the fact of having more principal to invest. I should get a greater return and have more income. That is the biggest point about this. It is a question of who has the greatest amount of disposable income. You have got it backwards in this bill.

This body spends. for every 7 cents it spends on education. it puts 52 cents to the Pentagon.

That kind of language looks innocuous on its face. but it will provide that the Federal Government cannot enforce antidiscrimination procedures against those schools. For example. religious and national origin discrimination cannot be enforced. Racial discrimination cannot be enforced by the Federal Government. There would have to be individual suits. one after another. The Department of Justice cannot invoke the situation where they can withdraw funds. David Duke academies could be funded without the enforcement of civil rights. What is this language doing in the bill?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there are many good reasons to be skeptical about the bill before us. but the most important is often left out. and I want to say before I go any further that the gentleman from California and I have worked together in an attempt to do exactly what I am talking about. It Is because school choice has been so widely talked about but has not been scientifically evaluated on a sufficient scale to draw concrete conclusions that I believe that the gentleman has come up with an improved accountability section of this bill. Evaluation is critical if we are to succeed or if we are to avoid monumental failure in this experiment of some size. Parental satisfaction is important. but it is wholly insufficient to measure the efficacy of choice on such a broad scale. A bill that is serious about a voucher experiment would include statutory requirements for a whole range of considerations. some of which I believe may well be included in the gentlemans bill but which go beyond many of those which are enumerated. And they talk about data on transportation problems and solutions. the effect on siblings within a family. the changing patterns of school enrollment by type and demographic characteristics. The list goes on and on. In short. this bill has a better evaluation component than most of the voucher demonstration programs that have been proposed in the last few years. And this is the critical point: This is not a demonstration program. We are finally getting closer to the kind of evaluation we would need if. in fact. we were doing a demonstration program. but we have it on the wrong vehicle. This is a huge and costly experiment with the lives of millions of children. and its emphasis on parental satisfaction matches the serious focus needed on cost benefits and measurable change in student performance. Whether or not politicians agree about the value of choice. the consequences fall on the lives of real children. We simply cannot afford to proceed without a mechanism for knowing whether we are right or wrong.",

Let us not try to fool the American people. and let us not be fooled ourselves. The vouchers in this bill are also a cruel hoax. They do not give all parents a choice in education. This proposal would not provide nearly enough money to pay for private school tuition for all children. With record enrollments. crumbling buildings. and the growing threats of crime and drugs that our public schools did not create. public schools are facing greater challenges than ever before. Children in public schools across the land do not have the basic materials that they need to get an education. Diverting resources to private schools is not the answer. Surely we can put the money to better use. Public schoolchildren need text books. library books. and other fundamental tools for learning. The globalization of the economy poses greater challenges to our children than those ever faced by previous generations. including myself. Today our children need math. science. and training in computers to be able to get on the first rung of competition for the jobs of the 21st century.

There has been a lot of talk about hurting public schools and that our agenda should be helping public schools. I think our agenda really should be helping kids get a good education. and saving and protecting public schools sometimes is involved in that. but sometimes these public schools are so bad that they should be closed down. and I am really pleased to see this bill come to the floor. I worked with the gentleman from California last session on trying to get a school choice bill to the floor. One of the reasons why I am so interested in this issue is one of the things I noticed when I got out of the Army and I went into private practice is that people with money send their kids to the schools of their choice. but poor people and people who are disadvantaged cannot do that. They are locked in a system. frequently a system that is failing. Some of our public schools are great. but some of them are failing miserably. and every time we try to talk about school choice. the same group of people get up and say. no. no. no. we cannot have school choice. All we have here is a modest bill to try it. Let me tell my colleagues something. The American people support this. they want to see this. Look at this chart here. All Americans. 82 percent. black Americans. 84 percent. whites. 83 percent. Democrats. 81 percent. Republicans. 86 percent. Independents. 81 percent. But every time we try to do this much school choice in this body. the same naysayers get up and say it is going to destroy public education. My desire is not to protect public education. but to provide kids in America better education. particularly those kids who are locked into failing schools. schools that are frequently riddled with drugs. where they are not getting an education. where they are coming out with a diploma and they cannot read. We are just trying to give some of those parents the ability to send their kids to a decent school. the ability that rich people have had for years.",

This proposal allows a few children to take a disproportionate amount of dollars out of the public schools to allow for private school vouchers. It is the wrong way to go.

The gentlemans amendment would prohibit funds under this bill from being used by the Clinton administration for a new Federal testing program in grades four to eight. Mr. Chairman. there is no question that our K12 education system needs reform and attention. but an arbitrary new Federal testing system is not the answer nor the cureall. There are already a number of tests that continue to be administered. In fact. in 1997 the Federal Government spent approximately $540 million in testing students. The question is. when you have a test. what do you test? I think we have heard the administration talk about when you have a test. you have to have standards. The question is. who sets the standards? If you have a Federal test. I guess it would be the Federal Government setting the standards. What is the next step? I spent 9 years on a local school board. My wife was a PTA president. We have reared six children. We have 15 grandchildren. We have real concerns about the Federal Government setting their standards and setting testing. The administration now wants to move forward and implement new testing without input or authorization from Congress. As a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. I. along with my committee colleagues. would like the opportunity to evaluate and study any such proposal. I encourage my colleagues to support the prohibition of this new. unauthorized Federal testing proposal. Let us do what local school boards are asking. Let us take some of the Federal regulation off of their backs. Some of the testing that we now have let us take off of their backs.

Congressional hearings on national tests would allow parents. educators and the test designers to voice their concerns and offer their input. helping to design the most appropriate and effective test. With the proper design. national tests would provide a much needed national standard for comparison. While some argue that these tests simply will divert much needed dollars from the classroom. national tests have the potential to help focus educational resources where they are needed most. eventually bringing all local schools to a higher level. If not constructed and implemented propery. however. these tests will not only waste taxpayer dollars. but could unfairly mischaracterize student and school performance.

As the gentleman mentioned. under the consent decree of 1989 entered when President Bush was our President. the Federal Government agreed to pay for the 1996 Teamster election. and the Teamsters themselves agreed to pay for the 1991 election. What was the national interest in doing that? It was to take a union that was obviously and by everyones evaluation under the control of unsavory elements and attempt to assure democratic elections. The goal was to reform the union and remove that unsavory control that had been a part of their history for a long. long time. I think the taxpayers have gone as far as they should go in paying for Teamster elections.

It is a great smokescreen. and I compliment him on it. It is one of those issues that I am very pleased to say that I hope everybody could see through it. This amendment is a mischievous amendment. It does nothing. I am tempted to vote for the silly thing. because it does nothing. it means nothing. It is a disaster when it comes to having taken the time to put this in this bill. As I told the Parliamentarian. and in fact. it is out of order if that is what it really does. because it does not do that with the amendment. The amendment is an innocuous little amendment. but it gives them a platform to talk and pontificate on the terrible evils of the mining law. My good friend from West Virginia. . now. he does not have any foreign people digging the mountains out in West Virginia. no. destroying the environment. no.

It wipes out the ability for America to participate with 146 other nations. It wipes out the exchange of information among scientists on a common international one page. Mr. Chairman. it wipes out the process that allowed the nomination from local governments. from State governments. from nonprofits. and from private land use. It wipes it out. Mr. Chairman. because it says that on page 9. \"Any designation shall not be given any force or effect unless it consists solely of lands that of the date of enactment are owned by the United States.\" So all of those programs that have been involved in this for so many years are wiped out.

They knew about it because of their host countries. That is why the National Tourist Association of Kentucky has written in opposition to this bill. because this bill wipes out essentially a tourist attraction. The Man and Biosphere program is a key program that helps train our Peace Corps volunteers. When we go overseas to try and develop an environmental program for the countries that the Peace Corps volunteers are serving in so that everybody can be on the same scientific page. they are trained by our Biosphere programs here in the United States before they go overseas.

The foundation has helped gravely ill youngsters in 17 states find some measure of happiness in their last days by financing a special vacation with their family members. or meeting a celebrity. or attending a circus. or participating in a group outing such as a VIP tour of the U.S. Capitol.

He accompanied me on a congressional delegation to China and on several trips to dedicate military facilities in the state of West Virginia. He has served the country in uniform and as a staff member of the U.S. Senate. I have always found Colonel Campbell to be a man of competence. compassion. and Christian conscience.

    "speech": "mandate clearly states that if SFOR patrols. including U.S. troops. encounter indicted war criminals and the tactical situation permits they are to arrest them and extradite them to The Hague. But we have also heard stories of SFOR commanders telling their troops that if they encounter an indicted war criminal they should leave the area immediately and take no action. I can think of no better way to honor the memory of Srebrenica then if today SFOR turns over a new leaf. and vows to pursue its mandate vigorously and to the maximum degree possible. If indicted war criminals are not brought to justice. the international community will have betrayed the legacy of Nuremberg. the victims of the war that tore Yugoslavia apart. and women worldwide. This will also set a dangerous precedent that will give encouragement to others elsewhere in the world who may consider the use of rape and genocide as tools of war. In the aftermath of the Holocaust 50 years ago. the civilized world vowed that we would never again allow crimes against humanity to blacken our history. In the aftermath of the tragedy of Srebrenica 2 years ago. we vowed that we would bring peace and justice to Bosnia. Today. on the second anniversary of the fall of Srebrenica the international community must vow to redouble its commitment to take immediate strong action to see that the indicted war criminals are brought to justice. If not. as I stated in my letter to the President on April 21. 1997. we run the risk that future historians will look back on current U.S. policy and conclude that the ethnic cleansing and the use of rape as an instrument of war is acceptableand that those who perpetrate this crime can do so with impunity. This would be a tragic betrayal of our history. our principles. and the people of Srebrenica. I ask that the correspondence to which I earlier referred be printed in the RECORD.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to offer my support as a cosponsor to Senate Concurrent Resolution 29. This resolution recommends the integration of Estonia. Latvia and Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ever since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. there has been talk of expanding NATO membership to include countries of Central Europe and the former Baltic Republics. These Baltic countries are continually striving to transform their political and economic institutions in accordance with democratic ideals and free market principles. We have seen remarkable achievements in this respect. from countries that have endured many years of communist occupation. I believe that expanding NATO to include Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia would benefit bilateral trade and investment through a stable security environment. Furthermore. these countries have made great strides in the areas of human rights. civil liberties and the rule of law. and have also actively participated in the Partnership for Peace. They should be rewarded for these efforts. Most importantly however. enlargement of NATO to include these Baltic States would secure a principal gain of the cold war by strengthening new free markets and democracies in the region. Latvia. Lithuania and Estonia are all working very hard to satisfy the prerequisites of entry into NATO. As such. I am supportive of all efforts to integrate them in the membership of that organization as soon as the process permits.*",

This resolution recommends the return of. or compensation for. foreign properties that were wrongly confiscated in formerly Communist countries and by certain foreign financial institutions. I join my colleagues on the Helsinki Commission in calling for restitution to the many victims who have suffered property losses at the hands of Communist and Fascist dictatorships. These victims had their property confiscated solely because of their religion. national or social origin. or expression of opposition to the regimes in power. In fact. many churches. synagogues. and mosques were destroyed and/or confiscated by these repressive regimes. Private property ownership is one of the key hallmarks of a free society. as are the freedom to practice ones own religion. express ones own social or national traditions. and speak against ones government. Violation of these freedoms. and disrespect for these concepts. is a glaring signal that a country is ignoring democratic norms and violating international law. Even more egregious is the fact that some financial institutions cooperated with these repressive regimes in converting to their own personal use those financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims. and their heirs and assigns. This is a clear violation of these institutions fiduciary duty to their customers. We must not sit idly by while they enjoy their illgotten gains. In this new and welcome period of transition for many of the formerly Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. it Is my sincere hope. that victims of confiscation will be sought out and compensated. Further. to expedite the compensation process. I fully support the elimination of any citizenship or residency requirement in order for those victims to make property claims.0",

I note with pleasure that both the Senate and House reports accompanying the Labor/HHS appropriations bills reflect strong support for community water fluoridation in preventing tooth decay among children. These reports clearly state that we can both save money and improve childrens health through fluoridation. Tooth decay remains the single most common disease of childhood and is highest in lowincome children. Millions of Medicaid dollars currently used to repair these childrens teeth could be saved through fluoridation. After 50 years. water fluoridation remains the hallmark public health preventive intervention. In my own State of South Dakota. water supplies for communities as small as 500 persons are fluoridated. It is my hope to extend similar benefit to children throughout the country. Both the House and Senate reports direct the Department of Health and Human Services to support implementation plans for additional community water fluoridation. The House provides $1.000.000 for this effort while the Senate directs the Department to fund this effort at a level no less than last year. Unfortunately. last year the Department allocated only $200.000 for this purpose. which did not meet the need. It is my hope that the conferees will be able to provide sufficient resources in the conference report to address this serious problem.

Approximately 25 percent of men alive today will also experience a serious fracture related to osteoporosis. It is clear that osteoporosis is becoming a greater and more expensive public health problem with each passing year. Medicare and other publicly funded health care programs are spending an estimated $28 billion per year to treat osteoporosisrelated conditions. Osteoporosis is both preventable and treatable. There are a number of FDAapproved therapies that have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing the disease in those at risk. as well as treatments that can arrest or retard the progress of the disease in individuals who already have it. Good nutiition. including sufficient calcium. has also been shown to help protect against the illness. If programs can be put into place soon that will help detect and combat this illness. we can make a tremendous difference in the quality of life of seniors. and effectively reduce the spiraling cost of osteoporosisrelated health problems. I understand that in its report. the committee has encouraged the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMS] and the Agency for Health Care Policy Research [AHCPR] to use competitive grants and other mechanisms to plan and carry out definitive studies. including epidemiological studies. that will enable us to better understand the nature and scope of osteoporosis and design more effective prevention and treatment programs.

As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. I am especially concerned about one item in the billthe recommended appropriation for the National Institute on Aging. As baby boomers shoulder their way into the 21st century. nearly 35 million Americans will be age 65 or older. compared to just 3.1 million at the start of this century. This tremendous growth is due in large part to better living standards as well as this Nations commitment to medical research.

Alzheimers disease and related disorders present one of the greatest threats to the health and economic security of the generation that will enter retirement in the 21st century. It has already stricken 4 million Americans. And if left unchecked. 14 million will fall victim to Alzheimers by the middle of the next century.

I support the continuation of support for this type of program. I urge the Department of Education. through its fund for the improvement of education. to give favorable consideration to a proposal that will stimulate students interest in and attention to music by airing the work of young and gifted student performers and which will also involve the public through supplemental educational tools. A young performance series. which affords 618yearold musicians the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their talents would be especially suited to carry out such a demonstration. If we are to encourage innovation and talent. we must foster that talent by recognizing the developing skills of our Nations youth. Public broadcasts of a quality young performance program will encourage youth involvement in classical and other serious music.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. every Member of Congress understands the importance of elections. The votes cast on election day determine the leadership and direction of communities across the country. and of the Nation as a whole. We know that informed voters are the essence of our democracy. The National StudentParent Mock Election helps young students learn about the importance of the election process. It also offers parents and teachers across the country an opportunity to help students learn about democracy. make decisions about key issues. and understand the meaning of the citizen responsibility on which democracy thrives. On October 30. 1996. millions of students and parents across the country cast their votes for President. Vice President. Senators. Representatives. Governors. and local officials as part of the National StudentParent Mock Election. Every State called in its votes on who would win the elections and its recommendations on key national issues to the National Mock Election Headquarters. while over 20 million viewers watched on television. The National StudentParent Mock Election is an ongoing project that received $125.000 in Federal funding in fiscal year 1997. I understand that it is the intention -of the chairman and ranking member of the LaborHHSEducation Appropriations Subcommittee to fund the National StudentParent Mock Election at $225.000 for the fiscal year 1998 so that it can continue to educate students on key issues and the principles of democracy.",

As you may know. I joined with several of my colleagues in sponsoring S. Res. 84 which recognizes suicide as a national problem. I share my constituents interest in promoting efforts to prevent suicide. and as deliberations on S. 1061 continue.

Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee In a dialog about an item in the House version of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. Mr. President. the House Appropriations Committee has approved $3 million within the Employment and Training Administration to support a telephoneaccess job search system. These funds are provided as part of the $71.8 million approved in the House bill for other federally administered programs. Through the labor market information activity. $3 million would be used to support the installation of a telephone access labor market exchange network for searching Americas Job Bank by telephone. This service has the potential of providing access to job information to persons with disabilities. including individuals who are blind. I would ask the chairman if he would review the House proposal and give it serious consideration for inclusion in the final version of the LaborHHSEducation appropriations bill. I understand that the $3 million would most appropriately go to assist states in meeting the firstyear costs of joining a labor market exchange network for providing job seekers with access to Americas Job Bank by telephone. With the innovative use of computer technology. this proposal could be of significant assistance to those who are disabled and in search of employment opportunities.",
