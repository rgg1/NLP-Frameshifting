It has been suggested that the personnel cuts which are in the PennyKasich deficit reduction plan are now going to be added to the Presidents package.

I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for his support and scheduling H.R. 897. the Copyright Reform Act of 1993. I also want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from New Jersey for the time and consideration he gave the many concerns I had about this legislation and congratulate him on an excellent bill. The most difficult concern I had related to the new. enhanced ability of photographers to sue if copyright registration is abolished. The subcommittee did hear during the second day of hearings complaints from photographers. Although the Copyright Office permit photographers to register 3.500 photos for one $20 registration fee. as a practical matter photographers dont usually register their photo. So if a family has its picture taken and the picture is copied by anyone other than the photographer who took the picture a copyright infringement suit could be filed by the photographers. That is the present law. However. as a practical matter most photos are not registered. therefore the photographers do not file suit against those people who have copies made of their photographs. Abolish registration and photographers would be more likely to file suit. What I wanted to do to take care of this problem without taking away the copyright of the photographer would be to authorize the judge to reduce or remit the award of statutory damages and not permit any recovery of costs or attorneys fees. Instead we are going to amend section 504 relating to the innocent infringers and permit the court to reduce the award of statutory damages to zero instead of \"not less than $200.\" The gentleman from New Jersey has agreed that strong report language on this issue is necessary so the parties and the court understand what our concerns are. And if it is abused by the photographers then we may need to correct it later. Again I would like to commend the chairman for his hard work on this issue. I urge a favorable vote on H.R. 897 as reported by the committee. Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina .",

I too would like to commend the gentlemen from Texas and New Jersey and my good friend from California and the gentleman from Massachusetts a cosponsor of the bill for their good work on this important legislation. The main thrust of H.R. 897 is the abolition of the requirement in present copyright law which requires U.S. authors to register their work with the Copyright Office before they can institute an infringement action. This is considered a formality (registration) and inconsistent with the Berne Convention. We got around this formality in 1988 when we passed the implementing legislation for Berne by saying that foreign authors from Berne countries do not have to go through registration. only American authors need register. This obviously discriminates against U.S. authors. thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage. with foreign authors who do not have to spend the resources to create deposits for Copyright Office examination purposes. The Berne Convention implementing legislation became law in October 1988. That same year I had the honor of personally delivering those official papers to the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization Doctor Arpad Bogsch. The Copyright Subcommittee is presently working on the Madrid Protocol legislation H.R. 2129 that will create an international trademark registration system within the World Intellectual Property Association. Again. the individuals and businesses in the United States that rely on this type of protection for their creative works will reap substantial benefits as a result of having a new and stronger relationship with 95 additional countries. I hope we can move that legislation early next session. I urge a favorable vote for H.R. 897. Again.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I heartily endorse H.R. 3276. a bill making simple technical amendments and minor policy clarifications to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA]. One of these policy clarifications is urgently needed. Section 153 of ISTEA penalizes States that have not enacted mandatory motorcycle helmet and seat bell safety laws by September 30. 1993. States failing to enact such laws by the deadline will have 1.5 percent of their highway construction funds diverted to highway safety programs in fiscal year 1995. The penalty increases to 3 percent the following year. H.R. 3276 changes the deadline for compliance to September 30. 1994. giving States an additional year to comply. I fully support the 1 year delay in the deadline date. However. I remain fully committed to outright repeal of section 153. Maine is facing the prospect of having roughly $850.000 in fiscal year 1995 highway transportation funds diverted away from much needed highway construction projects and into already funded highway safety programs. In the next fiscal year. the State could face a penalty diversion of S1.7 million. Maine has always spent its Federal money carefully. making every effort to ensure that the best interests of its residents are met. It is completely unacceptable that the Federal Government should dictate to Maine how its highway funds must be spent. In essence. the Federal Government is forcing Maineand other States--to waste valuable Federal resources. Currently. 27 States are not in compliance with Federal law. Some of these States have enacted neither a mandatory seat belt nor a motorcycle helmet law. or failed to enact one or the other of these two requirements. It is interesting to note that a minority of our 50 States have seen fit to enact mandatory laws of this nature. I object to the Federal Governments coercive tactics. My bill. H.R. 799. would address this problem by repealing section 153 of ISTEA. H.R. 799 has 116 cosponsors. over 25 percent of the House.

I support the enactment of H.R. 2683. continuing the Migrant Student Record Transfer System [MSRTS] until we have completed the reauthorization process for our Nations elementary and secondary education programs. Migrant children are among our Nations neediest population. with approximately 50 percent of migrant students dropping out before graduation. Before the existence of MSRTS and the Migrant Education Program. migrant students were often ignored. inappropriately placed below their grade level. and denied access to school because of the absence of health records. Although I have grave reservations about the ability of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System [MSRTS] to provide for the timely transfer of student records. I am opposed to the elimination of the current system until we have in place another mechanism for insuring the timely transfer of student records. Since the Department of Education. at our request. did not recompete the current MSRTS contract because it was so close to reauthorization of the chapter 1 Migrant Education Program. the current contract will expire in 6 months if we do not enact this legislation. H.R. 2683 would continue the current program through June 30. 1995 at which time I would hope we would have in place a new. less costly. and more effective. method of transferring records. In addition. the legislation does not allow for major modifications in the current system as we feel we should not be allowing the use of additional funds for changes in a system which may not be continued. Finally. if MSRTS is continued after June 30. 1995. the Secretary is required to recompete the contract. thus insuring it will not automatically be returned to the same contractors.

They call it Nynet. It is 21st century stuff. the kind dreams are made of. Congress has done much to promote this electronic revolution.

There is pain in change. but there is payoff in the acceptance of change. because status quo yields more of the same.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to introduce today legislation to raise the threshold requirement for the withholding of taxes on wages paid to an employee engaged in domestic services and to simplify the payment process. Under current law. an employer is required to withhold taxes on $50 or more paid per quarter to a domestic worker such as a maid or a babysitter who comes to the employers home to perform the service. Raising this threshold to $300 per year and enabling employers to coordinate their payments with the payment of their income taxes will have many benefits. Although this proposal received favorable consideration in the last Congress. it was not enacted. Ironically. the issue of withholding taxes for domestic workers has received widespread publicity recently with the problems of Zoe Baird and other prominent people. The present withholding requirements can have a detrimental effect on the hiring of domestic workers who work independently of companies that contract for services in the home. Many people just do not want to deal with all the paperwork. and they find it easier to call a cleaning or gardening service that will take care of withholding for their employees. Many parents may choose to hire a regular babysitter outside of their home rather than in their home in order to avoid the hassle of withholding. My bill will reduce the paperwork. but I want to assure my colleagues that it will not do away with the responsibility of employers to pay taxes on behalf of their employees. Social Security is an important protection for these workers who need to have retirement benefits to keep them out of poverty in their later years. Social Security taxes will be paid by the employer at the time at which he files his income tax return. Any unemployment taxes that are due can be paid in the same manner. My legislation will reduce the paperwork burden but not the financial responsibility of the employer. Mr. Speaker. I believe that people want to do the right thing by their domestic employees but are often scared off by the bureaucratic procedures of withholding. They are tempted to pay under the table or to avoid hiring certain workers. My bill will increase. not reduce. compliance. I urge my fellow Members of the House to support this effort.",

This is about the future of those children sitting up in the balcony right now. Mr. Speaker. I am a new Member of this body. For years I have listened to people talkabout two subjects. about cutting spending and about reducing the deficit. I have heard that again today from people on the other side of the aisle in general terms. but Mr. Speaker. the problem is that they never get to the specifics. In the first 3 weeks of this administration and last night. President Clinton has gotten to the specifics. On cutting spending. he has reduced the White House by 25 percent. not next year. not in the future. but right now. He has ordered the Federal agencies to reduce their administrative costs by $9 billion. He is going to reduce Federal employment by over 100.000 people. Indeed. in this body we have already moved to eliminate staff and budget of 16 subcommittees and we are going to continue in that trend. The specifics are on the table. Mr. Speaker. on the subject of deficit reduction. no one wants to pay higher taxes. but again we have a President who has been willing to put the specifics on the table. Mr. Speaker. I ask the American people to give this President credit for the specifics and reject those who talk in generalities and are not willing to put the details on the table.",

Year after year we have been assured that program management problems have been resolved. Yet. each year the budget swells just a bit more. and the scope of the mission is trimmed still further.

This proposal. which I am Introducing at the request of the Administration. sets forth a plan to authorize the National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] to fund pilot projects that promote a national communications and Information Infrastructure. The focus of the pilot projects will be those areas that most need communications resources but are least likely to get them: education. health care. and other social services. By using a limited amount of Federal Government resources to establish a model or testbed. the Government can leverage a modest investment Into rich payoffs for our society. The proposal also recognizes the role that public broadcasting will play in this multifaceted Infrastructure by authorizing the NTIA to grant funds to extend and upgrade the facilities of public broadcasters. I believe the Federal Government has a key role to play In the development of a national Infostructure. One aspect of that rolefunding of pilot projectsis covered by the legislation I Introduce today. These projects will advance our understanding of such critical matters as Interconnection and Interoperablity of multiple communications systems. as well as provide a concrete understanding of what are the communications needs of those who arent just in the entertainment business. There are other aspects of the Infostructure that must be addressed. and we will debate those issues at the appropriate time. but I think it Is important that we get started by giving the NTIA the authority they need to be a full participant in the development of a national communications Infostructure.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after the last Democrat Presidency. our Army. Navy. Air Force. and Marines were a badly demoralized force. That administration manifested Its disdain for ihe Armed Forces by failing to make ihe military a priority and by enacting deep budget cuts. The disastrous rescue mission In Iran is perhaps the most lasting and most definitive image of those years of military atrophy. But the deaths of those brave soldiers and the failure of the rescue also served as a turning point. and the administrations which followed restored military confidence and morale. The United States became. as a result of those refocused priorities. the preeminent power on the world stage. We won ihe cold war because of that foresight and today. we are primarily responsible for the present period of relative world peace. Todays peace is being threatened by the Clinton administrations policies that may take us \"Back to the Future\" and once again lead to an ineffective. weak military which encourages mischief and aggression throughout the world. Eliminating COLAs for both those on active duty and for retirees. allowing homosexuals to serve in the military. and shunning uniformed officers in the White House are all signs of the same degradation and lack of respect displayed little more than a docade ago. It seems likely that if the administration has its way. the greatest fighting force history has ever seen will soon be effectively neutered. The first practical problems created by the Presidents attitude are already beginning to emerge. as divulged in the following article. written by Brian Green in the July 1993 issue of Air Force Magazine. Green points out that the armed services. where enlisted men are often eligible for good stamps. are understaridably finding it difficult to attract highquality recruits. and must increasingly settle for second best. Green points out that the last time recruiters experienced similar problems was in the early 1980s. perhaps coincidentally following the last administration which treated the military with so little respect. I hope President Clinton and those who support his ruinous policies will consider the effects which ensued in the late 1970s. I hope they will recognize that recruitIng difficulties are the bellwether of much larger. much more extensive difficulties to follow. and I hope they will all read the following article. which I submit for the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to alert Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to an invention of one of my constituents that has the potential to save lives. On February 26. 1993. the World Trade Center was bombed at midday by terrorists. One ol the most vivid images of that day was the footage of workers coming out of the building with handkerchiefs over their mouths and black soot on their faces. Some of these people who spent hours movIng down the stairs of the towers became part of the more than 1.000 injured in the incident. People In the upper stories of the towers broke windows to get fresh air and attract the attention of rescue teams. This incident demonstrated that fires In highrise buildings still present unique and challenging dangers. Approximately 8.000 people die each year In the United States as a result of fires in hotels and highrise buildings. Most of these victims succumb to smoke to toxic fumes during their attempt to evacuate. While people have an Inherent fear of fire. they dont have an Inherent fear of smoke. A resident of my district. Mr. Edward Wicks of Danbury. has developed a life line air system which has the potential to save lives In buildings maintained by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Wicks life line air system creates refuge rooms out of the bathrooms of multistory buildings for occupants and firefighters to go for safety In the event of smoke. When the Wick system detects smoke. heat. or carbon monoxide. it drains the water from the bathroom pipes and forces fresh air into the room. This project not only will save lives. but it will also create jobs and promote the spirit of American entrepreneurship. I encourage Secretary Cisneros to investigate the potential of the Wicks life line air system.",

For example. we looked excessive payments for such items as blood glucose monitors. bandages. and TENS units. We have all kinds. And every year. we have hearings to expose wasteful spending and how we can combat it. And so with the mechanisms in our bill. we try to put more emphasis on activities such as the payment safeguards program. This is where Medicare hires investigators. accountants. and auditors to go after fraud. waste. and abuse. They are woefully understaffed. And as I mentioned in my comments. we have proven from GAO and from the inspector generals that for every dollar we put into these activities. we have actually saved. in real. hard cash dollars in that given year. $14 for every dollar we put in. In every administration. this was no different from the one before. Both administrations were asked to put in the payment safeguard program. We are in the odd position of trying to put money into the program. Talk about spending around here. This is one program we put money into that actually pays the taxpayers back. I assume at some point there. the costbenefit ratio is not that great. But we have not even approached that yet. I have not read the Senators amendment. My staff tells me that much of what is in the Senators amendment was in amendments offered by myself and others in different. various health reform bills that come through the Labor Committee. Much of this was in the Labor Committees bill. And some was in the Dole bill. So there Is broad general agreement. I think. for what the Senator is trying to do. But. again. I Just have one question.

One investigator has to oversee 8 million claims that are coming through the pipeline. With enforcement and oversight capacity as low as this. catching fraud is almost impossible. We simply do not have enough people. But what we ought to be doing is creating a system sending forth a signal saying. if you engage in fraud. we have a single statute the Justice Department is going to turn to. we are going to penalize you. collect it. and we are also going to expand the oversight ability on the part of the Federal Government.",

    "speech": "If the Senator will yield further. I understand. The problem is. as I understand itand we looked into this in great detailtake the blood glucose monitor. for example. which was drastically overpriced. I sent a staff person down to a drug store and bought one for $39. Yet HCFA was allowing payment as high as $500 for one. Just ridiculous. But it turned out that the overpricing was not fraudulent because it is allowed under the fee schedules set up under Medicare. So I suggest to the Senator. you might want to turn this over to the Justice Department. They go in there and. 1o and behold. they find out that is part of the law. What we have to do is get in there and change the kind of fee schedules that we have in there by which these people cannot overprice us for these things. That Is the problem. Once we get our fingers on it. then we can do something about it. But It is those initial overpricings we have a problem getting at. I suggest to the Senator what we really need in Medicare is to get away from that old fee schedule we used to have and perhaps we ought to have more competitive bidding. I suggest that to the Senator. That might take care of a lot of this. There is fraud. There are other frauds happening. Fraud is where perhaps a doctor would submit a bill for services that he did not render. or a hospital would submit a bill for items that they never provided. That is fraud. A company that makes a product and says. \"Hey. this is worth $500.\" Well. that is what the fee schedule allows. and so they bid it in. That is why they are not being prosecuted for fraud. We need to change that underlying provision to provide for more competitive bidding. Having said that. the Senator is right on target in terms of giving the Justice Department more authority to go after the fraudulent activities that are happening out there day after day. But some of these other things that he brings up. I think we have to go under the underlying law itself and change the way that Medicare is able to buy these things. I just ask the Senator if he had any further thoughts on that?",

    "speech": "I want to respond about what the Senator said about his experience with Chairman Stennis and being told it is not the appropriate place. I see several of my colleagues here on the floorSenator COCHRAN from Mississippi. who came to the House with me at the same time. I gave my maiden speech in the House of Representatives back in 1973. It was a speech pertaining to an amendment I offered to the energy bill. I offered an amendment to the energy bill to provide tax credits for people who conserve energy. The senior Members of the House of Representatives at that time got up and objected to the amendment saying that it was not germane under the House rules. that on the one hand by providing incentives for people to drill for oil was relevant and germane but providing tax incentives for people to save energy was completely nongermane. It was ruled out of order. It took 4 years before we finally passed that measure to provide tax credits for people to conserve energy. I feel the same sense here. It has been 2 years now. and maybe another year before we finally pass this bill dealing with health care fraud. So it is a measure of my own frustration. I have been at this nearly 22 years now finding the same kinds of arguments being raised saying. well. wait until the next bill. not germane to this bill. we will get it next year with a little more patience.

They are alltoooften unsung heroes on the frontlines of Americas efforts to educate our children. to steer them away from the negative influences of drugs and gangs and to equip them and inspire them to seek a better future through education. Margo Stone exemplifies the finest of Arizonas and our Nations teachers. Margo Stone has been teaching special education in Arizona schools since 1983. In 1990. she came to Centennial Elementary School. Renate Krompasky. her nominating principal. is quick to extol her qualifications: \"Margo is an exemplary teacher who can combine the scientific principles of teaching with human relations skills and creativity to make learning come alive for her special education students. It is amazing how confident the students become after a year of working with Margo Stone.\" Krompaskys support is shared by Stones colleagues who praise her not only because of her dedication to her students. but for the assistance she provides to other teachers. Stone believes that she brings to her classroom the confidence that her own teachers gave to her throughout her life. She no doubt passes this gift of selfconfidence and drive for success on to her students. Stones accomplishments continue beyond the classroom into her community. She has been a block captain in a neighborhood crimeprevention program. the Centennial Schools representative for the United Way Campaign. and a participant in the March of Dimes Walk America. In addition. she donates her time helping to prepare hot meals and brown bag lunches for the Salvation Army. She is also a member of the Council for Exceptional Children. the Learning Disabilities Association of America and Arizona and a delegate to the Arizona Education Association. Margo Stone deserves to be commended for her devotion to improving the lives of our children.

Unfortunately. that bill has been stalled in a conference committee since that time. Last week. the conference reached what it thought was a final bill. Regrettably. the other body rejected that proposal and sent the bill back to conference. It is my understanding that the conference has not even met since that time. The Senate members of the conference have done a fine job representing the Senate in their efforts to produce a final bill. Unfortunately. however. this process has taken entirely too much time. While the other body spends time discussing the merits of an extraneous matter. thousands of Rhode Islanders and hundreds of thousands of other Americans are forced to wait. They wait to find out if and when their Representatives will act on their behalf. While they wait. they plan and worry about making ends meet until we do act. Not a single day passes without my offices in Providence and Washington receiving calls from unemployed Rhode Islanders. all wanting to know if. by chance. Congress finally passed the bill. Not only are these people trying to pay the rent and buy the groceries. but as time goes by they now want to know if a Thanksgiving dinner can be prepared and whether Christmas and Hanukkah gifts can be bought. It is impossible to explain the peculiarities of the legislative process to someone worrying about feeding their family. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to explain my vote against the motion to cut off debate on the nomination of Janet Napolitano to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Arizona. In my view. Ms. Napolitano played a key role in an incident which disqualified her from a position of public trust. A little over 2 years ago. the Judiciary Committee took the deposition of a witness. Ms. Hoerchner. during its deliberations on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. For some reason. the committee not only permitted Ms. Hoerchner and her attorney to attend the deposition. but also allowed Ms. Napolitano. the attorney for another witness. before the committee. to attend the deposition. A careful reading of the transcript of the deposition of Ms. Hoerchner on October 10. 1991. reveals that. following an offtherecord conference with Ms. Napolitano and requested by Ms. Napolitano. Ms. Hoerchner modified her preceding testimony in ways to make it far less damaging to Ms. Napolitanos client and far more damaging to Justice Thomas. I believe this intervention was inappropriate. Ms. Napolitano has refused to disclose the substance of her conversation with Ms. Hoorchner to the Judiciary Committee. She claims that the conversation is protected by attorneyclient privilege. claiming that her client. Ms. Hill. and the other witness. Ms. Hoerchner. shared a common interest. I disagree with her analysis. Ms. Napolitano has given no hint as to what that common interest might be. There was no apparent legal or economic interests Ms. Hill and Ms. Hoerchnor held in common. Rather. they were supposedly disinterested witnesses in a proceeding in which neither had any apparent personal interest. Their testimony was designed solely to inform the Senate about a nominee. In my view. the two did not share a common interest. and thus her defense of attorneyclient privilege should fail. Because I believe that Ms. Napolitano was centrally involved in this unfortunate incident. I will vote against cloture on this nomination.",

State. and local governments. There are many reasons to support the agricultural community in this endeavor. American agricultural provides the safest. most reliable. and lowest cost food and fiber supply in the world. The food and fiber industry from farm to retail is Americas single largest industry. This industry employs nearly 21 million people. almost 19 percent of the Nations total workforce. and accounts for nearly onefifth of our gross domestic product [GDP]. In spite of its importance. however. farm income is at record low levels on a perdecade basis. and. while there has recently been some recovery. projections for the 1990s anticipate further decline. Agriculture is also the subject of the continuing upward spiral of expensive governmental regulation. The legislation that I am introducing today addresses the expense of current and proposed water and air quality regulations with which taxpayers engaged in agriculture or agricultural related businesses are required to comply. This )ill would provide a 15 percent. agricultural environmental tax credit for purchases of machinery. equipment. and structures for which the primtry purpose is to comply with environmental regulations. The credit would be limited to $15.000 in any given year and to $150.000 today for any taxpayer. A farmer or an agricultural related business would receive the credit for investment in structures and equipment including. for example. livestock wastehandling systems. constructed wetlands. terraces. notill planters and other conservation farm equipment. and containment dikes. These are items for which cost ranges from $200 to $100.000. sizable sums of money for a North Dakota farmer with an average per farm income of $20.003.00 in19.1. The credit would help alleviate some of the financial burden of complying with these provisions. This legislation that I am introducing with my colleagues. Mr. DASCIIIE and Mr. GRASSLEY. will help the rural community while furthering the goals of controlling environmental pollution and conserving Americas soil and water resources.

RI. who would now like to use the boat for a charter business. When the owners purchased the boat. they were unaware of the coastwise trade and fisheries restrictions of the Jones Act. They assumed that there were no restrictions on engaging the vessel in such a limited operation. However. due to the fact that the vessel has previously been partially foreign owned. it did not meet the requirements for a coastwise license endorsement in the United States. Such documentation is mandatory to enable the owners to use the vessel for its intended purpose. The owners of Big Guy are thus seeking a waiver of the existing law because they wish to use the vessel for the purpose of engaging in limited commercial use. Their desired intentions for the vessels use will not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters.

Thomas Swain Barclay was a son of Missouri. a graduate of its State university. who then went east to Columbia to secure his doctorate in political science. He returned to his alma mater. the University of Missouri. and in a few years was called to Stanford University where he joined the faculty in 1927 and served as professor of political science until his compulsory retirement at age 65 in 1957. He died at 101 on December 21. 1993. 5 weeks short of his 102d birthday. Five of Professor Barclays students became U.S. Senators. at least another five served in the House of Representatives. A number of his students became captains of industry with a keen understanding of American politics. Among the latter were Najeeb Halaby. former chief executive officer of Pan American Airways. Rudy Munzer. chief executive officer of Petrolane. Inc.. and George Egan. an entrepreneur in southern California. Because of the legislative schedule. neither Senator MARK 0.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on July 13. 1994. Fidel Castros henchmen deliberately and cruelly sank the tugboat of 72 fleeing refugees. causing the death and disappearance of approximately 40. Twenty of those sent to their watery graves were young children. The episode is one that has become all too familiar to those who monitor the plight of individuals fleeing Cubas brutality. The group of 72 freedom seekers hopped aboard a tugboat with the ambition of reaching freedom and safety. Once 7 miles offshore. the refugees were barraged by three Cuban tug boats which rammed their ship attempting to sink it. Castros men then turned powerful water hoses on the refugees instantly clearing some off the decks. Hoping that the presence of children would deter Castros men. the refugees pointed to the children on board only to have them knocked from their arms with the force of the water. Nearly as tragic as the massive loss of human life is the silence that has proceeded this brutal act. The survivors have spoken out. but the world has largely ignored them. Sadly. this is only one of many acts that Cubans have come to expect from the maximum leader. an inhuman dictator that makes a common practice of murder. Unfortunately. there are those who continue to embrace the Castro regime while conveniently overlooking these ruthless acts. They perpetuate this romantic notion of a charismatic leader who descended from the hills. Yet. if this act alone is not enough to thwart this notion. how many more corpses will it take until Castros allies are convinced that his stranglehold on Cuba must end? As freedom loving Americans. we cannot allow these lives to have been lost in vain. We must force the world to confront the gross violation of human rights and outright murder in Cuba.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the outstanding policy research efforts by the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution in building intellectual support for enhanced costbenefit analysis and risk assessment for environmental decisions. All too often. billions of dollars are wasted on environmental problems that are not really dangerous. leaving little for others that pose far more serious human and ecological risks. The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has undertaken an aggressive public information campaign to build support for costbenefit and risk analysis initiatives that would focus environmental regulation on the most serious risks. The Environmental Risk Reduction Act. which I have introduced with Representative JIM SLATTERY in the House and which Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN has introduced in the Senate. would ensure that policymakers and the public are aware of the true dangers posed by health and environmental risks. and the costs and benefits of reducing such risks. Only in this way can we rationalize environmental decisions and reduce the burden of environmental regulations on businesses. State and local governments and individual citizens. Clearly there has been a dramatic shift in the congressional debate over environmental questions toward requiring more stringent costbenefit analysis and risk assessments. The Senate has twice passed Senator J. BENNETT JOHNSTONS costbenefit amendment by large bipartisan majorities. The Senates version of the Safe Drinking Water Act would require more comprehensive risk assessments before new regulatory requirements are imposed on State and local governments. Here in the House. there has been a similar upsurge of support for risk assessment and costbenefit analysis. In my view. the de Tocqueville Institutions writings have played a major role in educating Members. the press and the general public about the need to rationalize environmental policy and reduce excessive regulatory costs. I would ask that an article by Cesar V. Conda. executive director of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution concerning the MoynihanZimmerSlattery Environmental Risk Reduction Act be entered into the RECORD for review by my colleagues.

This agreement was the convertibility of most major currencies around the world into a gold standard. Unfortunately in 1971. President Richard Nixon suspended gold payments to foreign governments ending an era of economic stability. From 1944 through 1971. consumer prices only increased an average annual rate of 3.2 percent. the lowest since World War I. Since the destruction of the gold standard by President Nixon. the average annual consumer price increase has been 6 percent. This unreasonable rate has slowed domestic production and international trade. Returning to the gold standard will create new international trade ventures with the former Soviet Union and South Africa. I urge my fellow Members of Congress to read the following article.

Gus was responsible for significantly reducing the percentage of substandard housing in Bessemer by developing almost 2.000 public housing units for the people of that community. As the first and only executive director of the Bessemer Housing Authority. he has set an extremely high standard of hard work and expertise in the realm of public service. Guss record of service extends far beyond his 44 years in public housing. During World War II. he served over 3 years in the Air Force. Later. he earned a bachelor of science degree in banking and finance and a masters degree in economics from the University of Alabama. Gus also contributed to the development of the business curriculum at the inception of the University of Alabama in Hunstville as the head of that department. From Huntsville. he moved on to Atlanta as a professionally appointed economist with the public housing administration. where he proved his ability to envision change and meet tough challenges. In 1957. the newly formed Bessemer Housing Authority welcomed Gus and his expertise to their community. The housing situtation in Bessemer needed attention badly. at that time. Bessemer had a higher percentage of substandard housing than any other city in the southeast. Gus took up the challenge and began by planning and building housing under three urban renewal program projects. His efforts proved successful. and as a result. many struggling families were able to find affordable housing. As director of community development. Gus developed a much needed citywide sanitary sewer system for the city of Bessemer. He also contributed to the building of a municipal golf course. the beautification of a central city park. and the opening of the Bessemer Hall of History. Gus has assisted in bringing in over $65 million to Bessemer for local development and has served as president of the Alabama Association of Redevelopment Authorities. It is my hope that Gus remains active even in retirement. His vision. diligence. and commitment make him an outstanding example for his successor and for all citizens. Gus Kuhn has shown. through many aspects of his work and his life. that he represents the true spirit of public service.",

I am pleased that several of my colleagues have joined me In this effort and look forward to congessional approval of the measure early next session. Women who do not work outside the home contribute as much as their working spouses to the care and support of their families and deserve equal retirement security. Unfortunately. the Tax Code prevents women who work at home from providing for their own retirement to the same extent as women who work outside the home. The problem is rooted In the rules governing Individual Retirement Accounts [IRAs. If both spouses In a household bring home a paycheck. each is permitted to contribute and deduct up to $2.000 to an IRA--4.000 In total. subject to Income limits. If only one spouse works. however. a married couple Is limited to contributing a total of $2.250 to an IRA. In other words. a oneincome married couple may put aside only about onehalf as much in an IRA as a twoincome couple. Furthermore. if the wage earner in a oneincome married couple may put aside only about onehalf as much In an IRA as a twoIncome couple. Furthermore. If the wage earner in a oneincome couple participates In an employee pension plan. there are further limits on total IRA contributions. Clearly. the Tax Code discriminates against spouses--primarily womenwho work at home. In order to end this unequal treatment and to promote private retirement savings. I am introducing legislation to permit full. $2.000 IRA contributions by nonworking spouses. Under my bill. a nonworking spouse could make a deductible IRA contribution. just as working spouses do under current law.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is an elemental difference between those persons who employ violence or the threat of violence as a means to an end and those who utilize peaceful nonviolent expressions of dissent such as sitins or sidewalk prayer. The plain language of H.R. 796. Mr. Speaker. blatantly and wrongfully eliminated the difference by elevating nonviolent acts of civil disobedience committed by prolifers from a misdemeanor category to that of a felony. Under the bill a woman who simply sits in front of an abortion clinic door or sidewalk and gets in the way of an abortionist would be deemed a felon and could be thrown into prison for 1 year for the first offense and 3 years for the second offense. The Smith substitute that I will offer today imposes strict penalties on those. Mr. Speaker. who use force or the threat of force. I believe that we ought to go after those who bomb clinics or in any way are involved with violence but not after those who are involved in nonviolent civil disobedience. Other causes in the past used nonviolent civil disobedience in order to get their point across. from the civil rights movement to AIDS activists to a whole host of causes. whether you agree or disagree. use nonviolent civil disobedience. To turn them into felons would be an atrocity.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as most of our Members now know. the other body intends to take up the North American FreeTrade Agreement and begin the crime bill and go home probably by 2 oclock on Saturday. I would hope that the Democratic leadership of the House would look at this and then begin to slow down and focus in on what we can practically do. Let me talk about one specific bill which I hope will not come up in precisely the spirit of comity that we developed yesterday. The Environmental Protection Agency bill. it seems to me. should not come up for three reasons. First. according to the Vice Presidents report. this particular bill will cost taxpayers an additional $1.2 billion. and I think at the present time. until that is worked into the Presidents budget. adding another $1.2 billion is the wrong signal. Second. the ranking member of the Committee on Government Operations. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . is incapacitated. He has worked hard on this bill. He can be here in time to do it when we come back. Nothing is going to happen to this bill between now and the beginning of next year. Therefore. it should not come up. But. third. every Member who believes in stopping unfunded mandates. every Member who has been going back home telling their mayors and their county commissioners. \"I am against unfunded mandates\" should vote against the rule. because this rule does not make in order the amendment on unfunded mandates. and this rule does not make in order the Johnston amendment from the Senate which passed overwhelmingly on risk assessment and rationality. and this rule. in its current form. Is a rule which I think may well go down. So this will be a test vote on unfunded mandates. and I think every Member who is concerned about unfunded mandates will want to vote no on the rule. I hope the leadership will pull the bill. Let us negotiate a little bit and come back in January with a rule we can agree on.",

The President spoke about the violent crime gripping our cities and communities across this great Nation. I wish you could have seen the chord he struck with the audience when he talked about drugs. crime. and violence that are ravaging our communities. The audience applauded the loudest when President Clinton talked about passing legislation to make our streets safer. Mr. Speaker. 37.000 people die each year from gunshot wounds. many of them our children. Gangs bent on violence flourish in our schools and on our city streets. We are all at risk. Violent crime has touched nearly every family in America. The public is afraid and demanding action. A recently published Washington PostABC news poll shows that crime is the most important issue facing the country. I do riot believe we should adjourn this year until Congress enacts and sends to the President tough anticrime legislation.

The base was constructed on the grounds of the Agnes Phipps Memorial Tuberculosis Sanatorium at the eastern edge of Denver and was one of a series of Installations built in and around Denver during the World War II era. As Denver historians Stephen Leonard and Thomas Noel later wrote. these bases \"transformed Aurora from a drowsy suburb. known for its jackrabbits and rattlesnakes. into Denvers most populous bedroom community.\" In fact. Aurora is now Colorados second most populous city. Flora Gassers poem follows: THE BoYs AT LowRy FIELD (During the war years) Its not Just a wartime base closing. Its beyond those barracks we see.

According to the Christian Science Monitor. the American Security Councils National Campaign To Keep the Ban on Homosexuals in the Military has been in the forefront of the opposition to President Clintons directive. The National Campaigns efforts have been featured in a variety of media outlets. These include the New York Times. NBC Nightly News. and the McNeil/Lehrer News Hour.

These spots will become increasingly prevalent In the weeks ahead. The Chairman of ASCs National Campaign To Keep the Ban on Homosexuals in the Military Is Adm. Thomas H. Moorer USN (Ret.). Admiral Moorer Is a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. as well as a former Chief of Naval Operations. In addition to myself. the congressional cochairman of the national campaign are Representatives CLIFF STEARNS. JOE BARTON. BOB DORNAN. and SAM JOHNSON.

The national campaign believes the Clinton compromise presents many legal. administrative. and national security problems.

This sorry episode underlines that the U.S. Government remains psychologically. and in some cases. legislatively unprepared to cope with the arrival of international terrorism on American shores. In a hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee last week. State Department and FBI witnesses admitted that neither agency had yet offered a reward for information on the World Trade Center bombing. Each agency has existing legislative authority to do so. and both witnesses agreed that such a reward should be offered. The FBI claims that while it is the agency with primary jurisdiction over acts of terrorism within the United States. it Is unable to use its terrorism rewards program because of insufficient funding. The State Department. which has primary jurisdiction over acts of international terrorism. admits that it has sufficient funds in its own terrorism rewards program. However. the Department claims it cannot offer a reward for the World Trade Center bombing because its legislative authority prohibits rewards for international terrorist acts that occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Five months have passed while this intellectual and legalistic argument has raged between the two agencies. My bill would remove the State Departments excuse for Inaction by deleting the reference to the territorial jurisdiction in which an act of international terrorism occurs against Americans or American property. I will be working to ensure that this legislative correction is made during Senate consideration of the HouseSenate conference for the State Department authorization bill. which passed the House last month. Still. I would urge the executive branch not to wait for congressional action. but to work quickly to resolve this disagreement administratively. To the extent that information may exist abroad that would aid in the arrest or conviction ot terrorists linked with the World Trade Center bombing. the administration should realize that its failure to act Is not just a regrettable bureaucratic disagreement.

We have said there are x number of people who do not have health care. whether because it is transition or whatever. but some of them do not have health care. Like the tax fairness issue. we need to find solutions to address that. I think we can target. we can pinpoint those solutions at those populations of people. For instance. small business. and I come from a small business situation. I said the statistics of small business drive them out of business if they have to provide health care. That was the NFIB statistics. the National Federation of Independent Businesses. How do we help small businesses? We can do some reform in insurance that small businesses have to do. that they can group together. they can go together into a marketplace. Instead of taking four people to a market. if you were a small business. you can take 400 or 4.000. The types of not only benefits but the costs you are going to have to pay are going to be a lot less with that approach. because you can purchase en masse. so that is another reform we have to look at. small group reform. When we are doing it. one of the things that the gentleman from California talked about is the issue of portability. If we make those risk pools bigger when we do reform. then all of a sudden people can move from job to job.

In the first place. this amendment does not shift our priorities from a cold war defense to a postcold war budget. As you can see from the charts in the well. which I requested from the Secretary of Defense who used them in his testimony before our congressional committees. that shift is already taking place. Defense spending is going down dramatically. The question posed by amendments like this is whether we pursue a rational. managed defense downsizing over the years or whether we gut our national security and our economy. As President Bill Clinton said in a letter yesterday to Budget Committee Chairman MARTY SABO. \"The committee has done a careful job in balancing the needs of the Nation. and I am prepared to work with you to oppose any cuts in the level of defense funded in the resolution.\" Second is deficit reduction. Despite promises in some \"Dear Colleague\" letters being circulated for this amendment. there is no deficit reduction in the amendment. It absolutely does not reduce budget outlays or the deficit numbers. The Frank amendment includes the exact same budget outlay and deficit figures as the Budget Committee resolution. This amendment simply \"squirrels away\" $2.4 billion this year and $11.4 billion over the next 5 years for spending somewhere else sometime in the future.

This is the force structure that we have repeatedly been told is the absolute minimum acceptable force necessary to fight and win two major regional contingencies. The amendment that is now pending before the House would impose a cut of a further $2.5 billion this year and $11.7 billion over 5 years on the Defense Department budget. In my view. that is totally irresponsible. The Presidents budget already represents a reduction in real defense funding of nearly 34 percent from the peak we reached in 1985. and 43 percent by 1999. For me. the question is simple: Are we going to ask our soldiers. sailors. airmen and Marines to put their lives on the line behind an inadequate force structure?

How much is enough to overwhelm our potential foes? Here is the United States spending. here is our allies. Add these two up.

Our young men and women in uniform are the heart and soul of military readiness. Mr. Chairman. I am at a loss to explain why the President has proposed for the second year in a row to send the wrong signa to the troops by proposing a cut in pay from levels endorsed by Congress less than 6 months ago. Today U.S. military personnel are working harder. deployed away from home longer and remain underpaid relative to their civilian contemporaries. If the Presidents pay proposals were to be enacted. within 2 years military pay would be a staggering 17 percent below comparable civilian pay. One result would obviously be a worsening of the already troubling trends becoming apparent in recruitment and retention. Today. for example. an EI. a private. makes $832 a month. That is only slightly above the federally defined poverty level. We have got people in our military on food stamps. Mr. Chairman. military pay is a key issue. The Frank amendment will only hurt more of our young men and women in uniform. To its credit. Mr. Chairman. Congress rejected the Presidents budget last year on the issue of military pay. and I suspect it will do so again this year. Defeating the Frank amendment is an important first step in this process.

President Clinton has rightfully cited three pillars for an effective foreign policy: A strong economy. support for democracy. and a strong national defense. He has also stated as his priorities within defense policy and goals to preserve the quality of the forces. the quality of technology. and preserve readiness. During the Presidential campaign when he was outlining his policy for how to reduce the defense budget while preserving these important priorities. he proposed a reduction of $60 billion on top of what President Bush had recommended. But when he came into office. he found out that the deficit was larger. and therefore he doubled that request and actually cut it $120 billion. By cutting $120 billion though. he created a serious challenge for the Department of Defense. and that is how do you reduce the overhead. the bases. the infrastructure. the overhead of the Department of Defense. and at the same time not sacrifice the quality of the force. the readiness. and creating a hollow force. What he has found is that in doing this. and by having such a rapid pace of decline. those very things that he is arguing to protect are being threatened today. That is why after a number of us met with the President and Vice President expressing our concern about readiness. that he decided in his judgment to recommend this offset. This is $2.4 billion for the pay raise and to adjust somewhat for the increased estimate of inflation.

Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 [FIRREA] provides the RTC as well as the FDIC as conservator or receiver a minimum of 6 years from the date of appointment as receiver or conservator to bring suit on contract claims. Contract claims include suits brought to enforce delinquent loans and other assets owned by the receiver or conservator. In granting the RTC the authority to dispose of loans and other assets. it was the intent of the Congress. as expressed in FIRREA. that all of the rights of the receiver or conservator with respect to such loans and other assets be transferred as well. These rights include the right to bring suit on the loans and other assets within the same period provided by law to the RTC. that is. a minimum of 6 years. Most courts have recognized this intent and have sustained the transferees right to bring suit within the time allotted to the RTC and FDIC.

It also preserves actions that may be brought under other applicable law. including actions based on simple negligence. The latter provision has been the subject of considerable litigation around the country. and most recently. a seventh circuit decision adverse to the RTCs position. Nevertheless. the RTC and FDIC have established. through decisions such as FDIC versus Canfiled (10th circuit). and FDIC versus McSweeney (9th circuit). that actions premised on ordinary negligence are permissible if allowed under other applicable law. such as State law. These decisions should not be disturbed by the mere extension of the limitations period applicable to certain types of tort actions.",

Second. the extension will apply to a claim that is not currently timebarred. but only if the claim arises from \"gross negligence or conduct that demonstrates a greater disregard of a duty of care than gross negligence. including intentional tortious conduct.\" As a result. the extension will not apply to a simple negligence claim or to any claim arising from simple negligence. such as the breach of a fiduciary duty of care.

Let me also emphasize that there is a clear distinction. wellrecognized in the law. between negligence and gross negligence. and that the intent of the provision is to recognize this clear distinction. For example. Blacks Law Dictionary defines gross negligence as \"the intentional failure to perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of the consequences as affecting the life or property of another.\" Blacks further states that gross negligence is not \"simple inadvertence.\" but instead \"very great negligence. or the absence of slight diligence. or the want of even scant care.\" In contrast. simple negligence focuses on \"inadvertence. thoughtlessness. inattention. and the like.\" The courts have been equally clear about this distinction. For example. according to Ryan v. Foster & Marshall. Inc.. 556 F.2d 460 (9th Cir. 1977). \"Gross negligence * * * is characterized by conscious indifference to or reckless disregard of the rights of others.\" In sum. the provision in the bill reflects the clear intent to draw a bright line between such claims and claims that arise from far more serious misconduct. The distinction between negligence and gross negligence is intended to be this bright line. based on the clear understanding from numerous courts and commentators that there is a substantial and meaningful difference in the seriousness of misconduct involved in the two types of torts.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I introduce legislation reauthorizing the representative payee program which allows certain nonprofit organizations to act as fiduciaries for Social Security beneficiaries who are unable to manage their own finances due to youth. mental or physical impairments. The Social Security Administration has had difficulty locating qualified groups or individuals to act as representative payees on behalf of beneficiaries who are unable to manage their finances. According to a GAO report. 8.500 adult beneficiaries had their benefits suspended because no qualified representative payee could be found to manage the beneficiaries finances. In response to the shortage of qualifed representative payees. Conilress. in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. strengthened the Social Security Administrations representative payee program by allowing nonprofit groups to collect a fee for providing financial assistance to Social Security beneficiaries who were incapable of managing their own finances. These nonprofit groups must be approved by the Social Security Administration and have been in existence before October 1. 1988. The representative payees receive benefits directly from the Social Security Administration and can only use the funds to meet the needs of the beneficiary. This program expires on July 1. 1994. The program has had some success in expanding the number of groups who will act as representative payees for Social Security beneficiaries but more time is needed to increase participation. As a result I believe this program deserves to be extended. The legislation I introduce today would extend the program until July 1. 1997. The legislation would also make an important modification to expand the number of potential representative payee organizations by allowing nonprofit groups created after October 1. 1988. to participate in the program. According to a GAO report which surveyed advocates. local Social Security offices and representative payee organizations. one the most common suggestions to improve the program was to allow groups established after October 1. 1988 to participate. Due to the fact that some still have a concern that a few organizations may attempt to profit from the $25 fee. this legislation requires a nonprofit organization to be in existence for at least 1 year. This important modification will improve the effectiveness of the program. I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.",

The cost of Government in 1993 is the highest ever and accounts for a full 53 percent of net national product. This leaves far too little to encourage business and so it is no wonder that when the cost of Government goes up. the economy slows down. When the cost of Government is low and declining. the economy grows. Regulations cost jobs. It is estimated that Federal regulations have cost approximately 6.6 million jobs. Regulations cost people time. The Department of Interior estimates that Americans spend about 12 billion hours per year simply dealing with Federal forms. That is about 120 hours per worker. These statistics confirm the belief of most Americans that Government costs working men and women far too much and spends that money recklessly. We do not need more regulations.

This bill authorizes the transfer of 10 naval vessels: 1 each to Argentina. Australia. Chile. Greece. and Taiwan. and 5 to Turkey. These vessels either have been. or are on the verge of being decommissioned by the Navy. This transfer authority was requested by the administration. Under section 7307(b)(1) of title 10 of the United States Code. these transfers require congressional authorization. This requirement applies to the sale. lease. or grant to a foreign country of any naval vessel in excess of 3.000 tons or less than 20 years of age. It is necessary for the House to act on this legislation today in an effort to ensure that the transfer of naval vessels to the Government of Turkey will occur prior to the retirement dates of those particular vessels. The U.S. Government will incur $6.5 million in immediate retirement costs for these ships if these vessels are not transferred shortly. If there is delay in this legislation it will cost the taxpayers $6.5 million. Hence we are trying to act expeditiously on these transfers. The United States will receive $15.8 million in leasing fees over the next 5 years from the Government of Turkey.

If enacted. this bill would stimulate research and development and allow the exploration of the groat promise of marine biotechnology in food production. pharmaceuticals. and industrial applications. H.R. 1916 gives the green light to an industry with incredible potential to produce the highwage. highskill jobs that our Nation so badly needs. In addition. by increasing the production of aquaculture and creating better methods of environmental remediation. this technology can help heal our wounded oceans. But along with great promise comes certain risks. With biotechnology. we now have the capability to create organisms far different from their wild ancestors. The bill before the House today ensures that genetically modified organisms cannot be released Into the unvironment without a review of the potential environmental impacts of that release. In addition. the bill requires that all Sea Grant research on genetically modified organisms comply with guidelines to safeguard against the accidental release of these organisms. The potential of this technology is great. The key is in using it wisely. H.R. 1916 promotes the wise use and development of marine biotechnology and I urge my colleagues to support it. At this point I would like to include a letter from our distinguished colleague and chairman of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. GEORGE BROWN. on a jurisdictional issue related to this legislation.",

I am speaking on behalf of the ranking Republican member of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on H.R. 1916. the Marine Biotechnology Investment Act of 1993. I appreciate the cooperation that the committee staff has shown in developing the text of this bill and. apparently. the committee all feel highly supportive of the bill. As you may recall. there were significant issues raised by members of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. on both sides of the aisle. regarding a balance that the bill struck between the environmental concerns as associated with the release of genetically altered organisms into the marine environment and the need to fund research in this promising and cuttingedge field. The amendment that has been offered today does recognize the arguments made by both camps on this issue and resolves it nearly to everyones satisfaction. The only other alternative would be to not fund this type of research. and I do not think such a drastic step is called for. given that genetically altered marine species have not proved to be a threat to marine ecosystems. With this type of research. it has tremendous potential in improving aquaculture and the health of our native fisheries. Again. I want to congratulate the committee on this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania . a member of the committee.",

This program will establish Sea Grant as a national leader in marine biotechnology research. Sea Grant has made a real difference in my State of Texas. not just conducting quality research. but taking this research to communities and private industry where it can be applied to create jobs. businesses. and enhance utilization and management of our marine resources. Mr. Speaker. we are currently in jeopardy of losing our competitive advantage in marine biotechnology to other countries. who invest more than $180 million per year in this area of research.

The televised hearings stemmed from a tragic incident. but they have served a useful purpose in educating Americans about the judicial process. The case has reminded us of the extremely influential role lawyers play in the criminal process. Under current law. crafty defense lawyers are able to avoid or overturn their clients convictions based on a variety of legal technicalities. Specifically. the exclusionary rule allows courts to keep highly relevant evidence seized from crime scenes away from juries if the police or prosecutors have not adequately jumped through all the legal hoops required by current law. We are. all of us. outraged by the rising tide of crimes in this country. We have to plug the legal loopholes that let criminals go free. We have to allow the police to do their jobs. Thats why I am introducing today the \"Law Enforcement Support Act of 1994.\" This bill reforms the exclusionary rule by requiring courts to admit evidence obtained in a search or seizure which was undertaken in good faith. If a police officer reasonably believes that he is acting in conformity with the fourth amendment. such evidence would not be excluded. My bill is by no means revolutionary. Identical language was introduced on the House floor as an amendment to the Omnibus Crime Bill in the 102d Congress. It passed by a bipartisan vote of 247165. only to be deleted in conference committee. This is a reasoned. deliberate approach to a difficult problem and has broad support in the law enforcement community. A strong show of support for my measure could convince House leaders to bring this issue to the floor for consideration before the August recess. We should not handcuff the police as they fight their continuing battle against crime. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the Law Enforcement Support Act of 1994.",

The Presidents speech called on the worlds economic leaders to do their part in promoting economic growth. He warned both developed and developing countries to honor their international commitments and promises of a liberalized trade environment. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. the task of implementing this trade philosophy is most difficult. As world trade liberalizes. industry winners and losers rise and fall at everincreasing rates. This economic dynamism. in turn. often results in national policies to protect or foster local industries. Mr. Speaker. such national policies which are purely protectionist efforts to save obsolete businesses or industrial sectors must be resisted and discouraged. Global economic cooperation and the creation or opening of new markets for U.S. goods and services abroad will do more for our Nations prosperity than any taxandspend economic stimulus package. Therefore. this Member strongly supports the Presidents stated commitment to require our global competitors to open their markets. follow established trade rules. and commit to further liberalized international trade. Such a commitment by our trade competitors and trade partners--though difficult to pursueis absolutely necessary for the economic prosperity of this Nation.

They have been lauded for their organization of the historic International Conference on Black Dance Companies held in February 1988. where over 78 representatives from around the world met In Philadelphia to discuss the status of black dance. As a result of that and subsequent conferences. the International Association for Blacks In Dance was formed and Ms. Brown serves as its chairperson.

Filings of frivolous bankruptcies have reached monumental proportions in southern California and many other parts of the country. The courts are now so overwhelmed that it is very difficult to sort through the fraudulent cases to get to the valid ones. I want to emphasize that I support the protections offered by bankruptcy. It is sometimes necessary to provide a clean start to a debtor. and It is also helpful to have a mechanism to sort out the legitimate rights of creditors. It is abundantly clear. however. that some tenants have been declaring bankruptcy merely so that they can thumb their nose at eviction. Because of the automatic stay provisions In Federal law. merely filing for bankruptcy stays any eviction proceedings. About 1.500 evictions are being foiled each month by this method. In Los Angeles County alone. The Los Angeles Times has reported that these bankruptcies are so blatantly groundless that they usually are routinely dismissed. By the time landlords are done jumping through the legal hoops. however. It can take up to 6 months or !onger to evict a tenant. Sometimes. the petitions are refiled. starting the process all over again. This problem is having a very negative effect on the availability of low- and moderateIncome housing. The fact that tenants can unilaterally refuse to pay rent Is a profound disincentive to investment in rental real estate. Indications are that this phenomenon played a significant role in putting almost a hundred apartment complexes out of business in Los Angeles County last year. A common procedure Is for one tenant to declare bankruptcy. then when others find out about the deal. it spreads. unit by unit and floor by floor. Frustrated landlords find themselves offering tenants hundreds or thousands of dollars to leave voluntarily. This loophole is also being abused by drug dealers. according to Los Angeles city officials. In cases where eviction may be the only way to shut down a crack house. dealers can stall proceedings for months. on top of the normal eviction process. by simply declaring bankruptcy. I am reintroducing legislation to make clear that the automatic stay provisions of Federal law do not apply to rental agreements. This is the only way to end the deluge of groundless cases that have been overwhelming our",

As the eaitorial makes clear. the Clinton administration is using the term \"spending cuts\" to describe what in actuality are proposals to Increase taxes. Equally distressing Is the method by which the Clinton Treasury Department arrived at its budgetary numbers. The Treasury is using Imputed Income and other gimmicks to make It appear that increased taxes wont hit those earning under $30.000 per year.

Mr. Houstons public servIce record speaks for itself. Both Texas and Tennessee are proud to call him their own. After serving two terms as a Congressman from the Nashville district. Mr. Houston was elected Governor of Tennessee in 1827. In the 1830s. Mr. Houston moved westward and led the great State of Texas in Its struggle for Independence. Twice he served as President of the Republic of Texas and once as Governor of the State. making him the only man to serve as Governor of two States. Mr. Houston also served over 13 years as a Senator from Texas. Deep down. however. Mr. Houston represented more than the needs of one particular State. He strongly believed in the merits of the entire Union. Yet. when his constituents voted In favor of secession. Mr. Houston abided by their wishes. He stepped down from his office. refusing a Union offer to lead a counterrevolution. It Is that brand of American spirit that we recognize today. Over 3 years ago. the late James \"Bobo\" G. Driver. of Smithville. TN. developed the Sam Houston walnut tree. I have had the pleasure of knowing the Driver family for many years. and I know Mr. Driver sincerely admired Sam Houston. He hoped this particular tree would honor Mr. Houstons spirit. This form of recognition could not be more appropriate. Mr. Houston was a strong. dedicated man with roots in both great States. Like the walnut tree. his memory will withstand the test of time. Please join me in recognizing the bicentennial of Sam Houstons birthday. March 2. 1993.",

Lighter aboard ship or LASH barge Is a method of cargo transportation whereby cargo is loaded into specially fabricated barges which are subsequently loaded into a cargo vessel for transportation overseas. In order for LASH barges to compete fairly with other more frequently used modes of containerized cargo transportation. I introduced in the 101st Congress a measure to grant an exemption from certain Federal tariffs on the repair of LASH barges overseas and the importation of necessary replacement parts and supplies. This exemption. which was granted for a 2year period ending December 31. 1992. is necessary if LASH barges are to exist as a viable alternative to other modes of maritime transportation. The bill which I am introducing today will continue this needed exemption indefinitely while making it retroactive to Although this form of containerization has not reached the popularity or generated the high volume as has cargo containers or 20foot equivalent units. LASH barges have continued to offer shippers a variation in shipping methods and will continue as a small but important part of the liner trade. I urge you to support this very Important measure.",

We have risen to the challenge and met each and every one of those goals. In fact. weve gone even further than the Presidents challenge. Instead of handing over the personal and private decision of health care to the Federal Government and lifelong bureaucrats. this legislation puts the individual consumer in the drivers seat and allows every American the right to choose his/her health plan that best fits their needs and that of their families. We believe that Americans know best when it comes to their health care. Just like they know which car insurance policy and home insurance policy is best for them. Mr. Speaker. let us give the American people the same choices President Clinton and all Members of Congress have when it comes to choosing our health insurance. Americans are already skeptical of the Government. What is going to make them think that bureaucrats and politicians know better than they do when it comes to health insurance?

Our former imposition of sanctions expressed our belief that South African society must accept the equality of all its citizens. allow for their full participation in the political process. provide equal protection of the law. and permit equality of opportunity in the economic market place. I believe South Africa has made fundamental and irreversible strides in achieving those objectives. An important milestone in that process will be the April elections. wherein. for the first time in South African history. all members of that society will have the opportunity to decide the direction of South Africas future. Frankly. there are many of us in this body who did not believe we would see such an event during our service in Congress. We knew that one day the equality of all South Africans would be achieved. but that this is happening on our watch makes the event all the more exciting. as well as making it all the more imperative that we act to support the democratic transition process. Mr. Speaker. I want to commend my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for their longterm interest and involvement in the South Africa issue. I also want to express my gratitude to the committees with which we shared jurisdiction for promptly moving this important piece of legislation. H.R. 3225 answers the pleas of all South Africans who want the democratic process in their country to succeed. South Africas economic development and growth will help that country emerge from its legacy of racial separation and inequality. The United States has a continuing contribution to make to that process. This legislation places us on the right side of history in South Africa. Accordingly I urge the adoption of H.R. 3225.

Now. the gentleman has been around long enough to know that there are a lot of youthful offenders that should be treated as adult offenders. And nobody Is saying otherwise. But there are certain categories of youthful offenders that are prime candidates for this type of a program.

The judges in this country. unfortunately. have one of two options: To either send the youthful offender back home to the same bad environment.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am Itroducing a bill that will help protect our young people from nicotine addiction. This legislation. the Prohibition of Cigarette Sales to Minors in Federal Buildings and Lands Act. would ban cigarette vending machines in all Federal buildings and lands. This bill. which is companion legislation to S. 673. introduced by Senator BINGAMAN. has been endorsed by the American Cancer Society. the American Heart Association. and the American Lung Association. This legislation will strike where the malority of people begin smokingIn their adolescent years. Specifically. this legislation directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the head of each Federal agency to institute regulations that would prohibit the sale of tobacco products In vending machines located in or around any Federal building. In addition. this bill would prohibit the distribution of free samples of tobacco products in or around Federal buildings and lands. Although it Is now illegal In all States to sell cigarettes to minors. research shows that vending macines offer easy access for children to obtain this deadly product. While cigarette manufacturers use cartoon characters and beautiful people to make smoking appear attractive. wholesome. and sexy. Congress has a responsibility to prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes in Federal buildings. We have the responsibility to make it more difficult for minors to obtain products that if used as directed will kill them. Over 90 percent of smokers start smoking in adolescence or childhood. and they continue to smoke throughout their adult lives. Each day. more than 3.000 children and adolescents start smoking and collectively smoke nearly 1 billion packs of cigarettes per year. In addition. reliable studies indicate that tobacco use is a gateway to other. more harmful drugs. Smoking costs the United States $65 billion In health care costs and lost productivity every year. More imporantly. our children are being targeted as the next revenue source for tobacco manufacturers. These companies spend over $4 billion a year on advertising and promotion. They must concentrate on young people because older smokers are falling victim to everything from lung cancer to heart disease. It is time to stop the role of vending machines in this distribution of death. and my bill is a good. first step in that direction. I urge your support for this important legislation.",

But you can cherish the memory of a man who gave so generously of his time and talent toward making his community a better place. Mr. Sweet passed away on February 5. after a lifetime of civic involvement and of dedication to the lumber industry. an important economic pillar in our area. In 1941. he founded the R.J. Sweet Lumber Co. in Warrensburg. In 1986. he acquired the Great Eastern Lumber Co. and the North Creek Woodworking Plant. He was chairman of the board at the time of his death. In 1963. Mr. Sweet donated the tree that became the national Christmas tree in Washington. But Mr. Sweets contributions did not end there. He was an active member and senior warden of the Saint Sacrament Episcopal Church in Bolton Landing. and served on the finance committee and as a trustee with the Albany Episcopal Diocese. Like others who have been involved in scouting. I had enormous respect for Mr. Sweets own involvement. which included serving as district chairman of the Mohican Council Boy Scouts. He received the Silver Beaver Award. the highest honor given to adult counselors in Scouting.

The business is a family affair. with Bobs wife and soninlaw on staff. Perhaps more telling is the length of service of the extended family of the dealership: the service manager has been there 20 years. the service manager. now in his mid30s. started out with Failing as a high school student.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on Procurement. Taxation. and Tourism. of the Small Business Committee. my staff and myself have also spent the better part of the last year and a half analyzing and discussing the impact this legislation would have on the small business community. Through countless negotiations sessions. and three hearings in which my subcommittee has held. it has become clear to me that the product that we see before us today will not only simplify our cumbersome and inefficient procurement system but more importantly it will provide new and more dynamic business opportunities for small businesses. There have been a number of misconceptions surrounding the impact this bill will have on small businesses. Lot me state once and for all. this bill is good for small business. This legislation will ensure that small business gets access to contract opportunities--faster and more efficiently through the creation of an electronic commerce network. Second. it will increase the number of contracts available to small business by raising the small business reservation to $100.000. In addition. it will spread the benefits of programs such as the 1207. small business disadvantage program throughout the Government. Finally. it will allow the Government to enter the commercial marketplace. buy goods directly off the shelf. thereby removing the cumbersome requirements that have kept small businesses from participating in the government procurement system. I want to take a moment to thank the staffs of both Armed Services and Government Operations Committees. Cathy Garman. Robert Rangol.

This is the most comprehensive reform in a decade. Several businesses from my home State in Oregon came to me and said that the process of selling products to the Government is too complicated. it takes too much time and money to figure out how to jump through the proper hoops to conform with outdated regulations just to make a sale. And these arcane regulations also push up the price of goods when the Government finally does find a product to buy. This bureaucratic redtape also prevents small companies from doing business with the Government. even though they have terrific. affordable products to offer. This acquisition reform legislation means that businesses wont have to hire extra accountants and lawyers just to comply with arcane regulations that no one in the private sector ever deals with. This acquisition reform legislation is also about common sense. Right now the Federal Government is contemplating whether to buy a sparkplug connector for $544. when that same item costs about $20 at the local auto parts store. We must pass this bill so that the Federal Government will begin to go shopping like everybody else: you go to the store and buy items off the shelf. which are cheaper. I am particularly pleased that this conference report contains a provision that I insisted on including. which is the recoupment of a portion of the research and development costs of U.S. weapons systems when we sell them to foreign governments. This generates revenues to the U.S. Treasury worth tens of millions of dollars each year. I want to emphasize that this reform legislation is only a beginning.

There are few areas of the Federal Government that are more important for controlling spending. saving taxpayers dollars. and better managing our limited resources. As cochair of the bipartisan Freshman Task Force on Procurement Reform and as a member of the conference committee. I strongly urge the passage of this conference report. This legislation will simplify and streamline the Federal procurement process while improving its fairness. accountability. and integrity. It will reduce paperwork by allowing the Government to buy commercial products off the shelf. In other words. there will be no more doctored specifications that allowed for $500 hammers and $800 toilet seats. outrageous examples of Federal procurement abuses. It raises the simplified acquisition threshhold from $25.000 to $100.000. thereby reducing paperwork significantly. Fiftyfive percent of the Defense Departments contracts are under $100.000. yet it is only 5 percent of their expenditures. So this is a very important provision. It also strengthens the protest and oversight process. improves the integrity of the procurement process by standardizing the procurement code and by eliminating obsolete and redundant laws. The Federal Acquisition Improvement Act also incorporates several of Vice President GOREs National Performance Review recommendations. such as providing for multiyear contracts. promoting excellence in vendor performance. and allowing State and local governments to use Federal supply services. Of the $108 billion in savings that they project. $22 billion is projected to come from these changes in the procurement laws. This legislation also creates a separate 5 percent nonbinding procurement goal for womenowned business. Government purchasing from womenowned businesses has boon unacceptably low for far too long. This will. hopefully. improve that. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Government Operations and also the Committee Armed Services.

This conference agreement strikes a more equitable balance between the multitude of Governmentunique policy requirements imposed on Federal procurement and the need to lower our cost of doing business. This agreement increases the Governments reliance on the use of commercial products. goods. and services. and improves the access of small business to Government contracting opportunities. Purchasing commercial products should abolish the current practice of buying expensive. specially designed products. when offtheshelf. less expensive commercial products would suffice. Mr. Speaker. two other significant aspects of this agreement for which I had the opportunity to work with Chairman CONYERS in developing. are the small purchase threshold increase and the training courses for Federal procurement personnel. The increase of the small purchase threshold from $25.000 to $100.000 would allow use of simplified procedures for an estimated 45.000 additional procurements. These procurements have an aggregate value of approximately $3 billion per year. The training courses for critical procurement officers are aimed at increasing the participation of small disadvantaged and womenowned businesses in the procurement process. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to offer yet another endorsement of H.R. 2338. the Federal Acquisition Improvement Act. With the passage of this bill today. we will take a giant step forward in the effort to increase governmental efficiency and costsavings. I have been working toward this goal for some time. In 1993. I offered an amendment to the Defense authorization which would have incorporated into Defense Department buying practices several of the reforms included in H.R. 2338. Unfortunately. that measure was scuttled to ensure that governmentwide procurement reform would not be sidetracked. Fortunately. H.R. 2338 includes the commercial buying practices. simplified acquisition threshold. and reduced paperwork provisions that were contained in the Weldon amendment. and applies them to all Federal agencies. House passage of this measure today is critical. Although many Members may not realize it. this bill may well mean the difference between survival and elimination of key weapons systems over the next several years. Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch recently circulated a memo ordering the services to consider major delays or cancellation of most major weapons programs nearing the production stage. That list includes the Comanche Helicopter. the F22 fighter. the V22. DDG51 destroyers. the new attack submarine. the advanced amphibious assault vehicle. JPATS trainer aircraft. precision guided munitions. and the advanced field artillery system. There is literally no weapons program in the budget that will be exempted from the rigors of this austere budget environment. Last week. the Department of Defense validated the need for the V22 Osprey aircraft and endorsed limited production of it. At the same time. Pentagon officials called on the Marine Corps and the contractors to employ the commercial buying practices and innovative procurement practices allowed in this bill as a way to reduce V22 costs. The V22 pilot acquisition effort. which will reduce the cost of each aircraft by several million dollars. will also be applied to future weapons acquisition programs. At a time when every major weapons modernization program remains under scrutiny. it is absolutely essential that we remove the nonvalueadded requirements from major acquisition programs. H.R. 2338 will not solve all of our problems with respect to the declining defense budget. but it is one huge step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to put the final stamp of approval on this bipartisan bill and send it to the President for his signature.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the conference report on H.R. 2238. the Federal Acquisition Improvement Act. This legislation reforms Federal procurement practices and. In particular. raises the simplified acquisition threshold under which procurement paperwork requirements would be streamlinedfrom a current threshold of $25.000 to $100.000. This reform will be particularly important to the Department of Defense where some 55 percent of all purchases will fall under the higher threshold. In addition. small businesses will benefit from the legislation due to the fact that these businesses will be able to bid on numerous Federal contracis without having to comply with the burdensome paperwork and bookkeeping requirements under the previous procurement regulations. I am especially pleased that this legislation includes section 7014 of the Housepassed version of H.R. 2238. the Federal Acquisition Improvement Act. These provisions would prohibit agencies from requesting pricing data from private contractors for the purchase of competitively priced. commercial products. Mr. Speaker. I have been very interested in procurement reform as a means of reducing Federal spending. In 1993. Vice President ALBERT GORE released his National Performance Review which included recommendations for changing Federal procurement procedures In order to streamline Government purchasing of goods and servicessaving an estimated $22.5 billion over the next 5 years. I applaud these. and other efforts. to reduce Federal spending and regulations. I urge Members of Congress to support the conference report on H.R. 2238. the Federal Acquisition Improvement Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I intend to vote for this conference report because it represents hard compromises worked out among widely divergent groups. Also. I believe that some provisions in the bill will help the Federal procurement system. Nonetheless. I am troubled by the direction of the bill. which pushes the Government toward goods and services like a commercial firm buys goods and services. in other words. toward commercial buying practices. We all agree that the Government should buy offtheshelf. commercial products whenever possible. instead of always having things built to Government specifications. But adopting commercial buying practices is an entirely different matter. The Government is not a commercial firm and has different interests and goals than commercial firms. In reinventing Government. we are not supposed to be destroying the mission of Government. That mission includes: The Government answering to the voters and taxpayers. commercial firms answer to the stockholders. The Government being concerned with the welfare of all Americans. commercial firms are concerned chiefly with profit. The Government treating all potential sellers fairly. commercial firms need only be concerned with efficiency. The Government assuring fair treatment for all Americansincluding small businesses. minorities. women. and the handicapped. commercial firms have an interest in the bottom line. There is no debate over whether we need an efficient Federal procurement system. But we cannot permit efficiency to be achieved at any cost by permitting an unsupervised raid on the Federal Treasury. I agree that procurement procedures should be made simpler. But the price of that simplicity cannot be a system in which the same monolithic corporations win contracts with tiresome predictability. at the expense of competitive. innovative smaller companies. When I hear complaints about the procurement system and calls for repeal of laws such as the Competition in Contracting Act. the Procurement Integrity law. the Brooks A.D.P. Act. and other laws enacted to protect the taxpayers. I think of an inscription found in one of John F. Kennedys notebooks. \"Dont ever take down a fence. until you know the reason why it was put up.\" This bill leans hard on several important fences. Before Congress moves any farther in this direction. we should step back. take a hard look. and be sure that the direction we are moving Is in the best interests of the Government and all the people the Government serves.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as we anticipate the debate over national health care reform and the development of strategies to contain and re-. duce escalating health care costs. I again bring to the attention of my colleagues the importance of medical research. Health care cost containment depends largely upon preventing and curing those diseases that incur the greatest need for longterm care. Investment in medical research is the most successful method of controlling the costs associated with disease as it is the first step toward preventing disease. As an example of the importance of medical research. I would like my colleagues to consider Alzheimers disease. This perilous disease affects 4 million people and the indirect and direct costs of Alzheimers disease are in excess of $90 billion annually. As Dr. Gene Cohen. Director of the National Institute on Aging. testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this year. without substantial advances in the prevention and treatment of diseases which lead to disability. the growth in the size of our oldest age groups will have a devastating impact on future health care costs. These increased costs will more than offset potential gains from any cost containment strategies. We know. Mr. President. that simply delaying the onset of Alzheimers disease by 5 years would yield savings of $45 billion annually. Two days ago I received a letter which reported recent developments in Alzheimers disease research and which gives me reason to believe that our investments in this research are beginning to pay off. Dr. Allen D. Roses. the chief of neurology at Duke University. wrote that. \"The pace of new discovery concerning the cause[s] of Alzheimers disease has accelerated to the speed of light.\" Dr. Roses went on to say. \"we have found an important genetic risk factor for the most common form of this devastating disease which. through further research. promises to pinpoint the mechanisms of this disease. This will allow new. relevant therapies to be developed. It will also allow us to have early and more accurate diagnostic procedures. Early diagnosis also would allow us to test treatments which may significantly slow or stop the progression of this disease.\" These recent discoveries were reported in a June 7 Wall Street Journal article. I ask unanimous consent that it be included in the RECORD immediately following my remarks. [From the Wall Street Journal. June 7. 1993]",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to add my great concern to that expressed earlier by Senator DANFORTH regarding the inclusion of the moratorium on bovine growth hormone in the budget reconciliation bill. First. this provision will make it unlawful for manufacturers to sell a product regulated by FDA after the FDA approves an application for commercial use. This is an unprecedented legislative intrusion of social and economic considerations into the regulatory process and the U.S. marketbased system. While the current restriction is only for 90 days. I am concerned about the precedent it sets. and I fear that the sponsors of this provision will seek to extend the time indefinitely. This legislative action not only deprives Americans of U.S.-developed technology. but it also exposes the U.S. taxpayers to the costs of paying expensive judgments in likely to ensue takings litigation. Second. the moratorium legislation imposes a projected cost of $5 million on the taxpayers for the payment of additional dairy subsidies as a result of the gimmick employed to allow this provision to pass the Byrd rule. Thus. the taxpayers will get stuck with two bills. one for takings judgments and one for the cost of getting this provision to pass the Byrd rule. Third. while this provision is included in the agriculture title of the bill. it has severe implications for health care and other beneficiaries of biotechnology. Adoption of moratoria on biotechnology products by the Congress may begin to erode domestic support for the U.S. biotechnology industry. encourage our international competitors. and result in a loss of U.S. competitiveness. Instead of imposing a moratorium on biotechnology. we should be taking steps to maintain the United States as the world leader in biotechnology. an industry which now employs more than 80.000 employees and generates annual sales of around $5 billion. Fourth. this legislation may well raise the specter of safety concerns that have not been supported in exhaustive reviews conducted by the Food and Drug Administration. I certainly hope that the FDA does not take this legislation as a signal to slow down or in any way change its current review procedures related to the application for market approval of bovine growth hormone. It is time that we look to maintaining the U.S. competitiveness that benefits all of us.",

As many of my colleagues remember. it was in 1971 that the Peoples Republic of China took Taiwans seat on the United Nations. The P.R.C. has never held jurisdiction over Taiwan. and it has never represented the 21 million Chinese people on Taiwan. Thus the rights and privileges of these 21 million residents of free and democratic Taiwan are not represented in the United Nations clearly. this goes against the United Nations principal of universal representation. But it Is not only Taiwans loss. The people of Taiwan are welleducated and hardworking. They enjoy an increasingly high standard of living. and they are willing and able to help other countries reach their own development goals. Countries around the world are emulating Taiwans economic model. To deny the people of Taiwan and their government the opportunity to be represented in the United Nations is unfair and unjustified.

Mr. Speaker. what has distinguished this leader the most in his years of service is his passionhis passion to see the good in his fellow man and woman. while others only would see the bad. his passion to fight not only for the things that would \"play in Peoria.\" but also for the things that would help all American families. and finally. his passion for his party and this institution has been a constant source of inspiration to me and to those who may have forgotten the true meaning of public service. Mr. Speaker. it has beenand will continue to bea distinct honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. House under a man of such rare quality as our minority leader. While his presence in this body will be greatly missed. there are plenty of us who understand his desire to conquer the new challenges that lie aheadlike knocking those three stokes off his game in the early months of 1995. In closing. Mr. Speaker. I have one final comment to share with BOB MICIiEL and that is to say \"thank you.\" I thank you. BOB. for your tireless efforts and your loyal commitment to your party and to your Nationyour hard work certainly did not go unnoticed.",

It is not surprising that some of those opposing this effort to improve our schools are the leading opponents of public education. For the first time in 13 years we have a President who believes that improvement of education is much more than a throw away line in a campaign speech. For the first time in 13 long years. it is possible to move ahead with educational reform because for this President reform means action. not reaction. This bill calls for the setting of voluntary national education standards. including content standards. The bill also authorizes incentive grants to assist in the implementation of the goals. The opponents of this legislation are using the same arguments used in the 1960s when the Federal elementary and secondary programs were created. This is yet another example for their arguments intellectual costiveness. They say this takes away local flexibility and will create a national school board. but these are the same people who decry that state of Americas public schools. They really want to shut down public education and limit it to the wealthy. Mr. Speaker. the House should reject the Janusfaced arguments of the opponents of goals 2000.

One gentleman was listening to my recitation of the names of the 12 heroic young men who were killed in Somalia. He said he began to cry. because he recognized the name of the son of his best friend from high school who. like myself. served his country in Vietnam. He and his friend had survived Vietnam. and the son dies in an alley in Mogadishu. But the worst call came from the wife of a U.S. Army captain stationed at Fort Campbell. One of her neighbors. another military wife. recognized that it was her husband being mutilated and dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. his corpse. She had not been informed by the Army that he was dead or missing. She sees him on a television screen mutilated and dead and stark naked and being dragged around.

I want to point out that the chairman and I went on this subcommittee the same day and. as he said. at the time we went on the subcommittee the funding for the National Institutes of Health was $73 million. In this bill it is $11 billion. We are doing the research essentially for the world as far as health is concerned. In that length of time we have changed the health system of the world. The delivery system has not kept up with the research that we have done. and that is one of the big things that. we are hearing about now on health. Until the delivery system catches up. we are going to continue to hear about it because we have the kind of a system now that. if delivered. would deliver a lot more health care to the American people. And so it is very difficult in an area where technology has moved as fast. and the new knowledge has moved as fast. we are not moving the same kind of health care today that we moved 20 years ago. So you cannot expect the system to operate on the same amount of money. We are also subsidizing health professionals. doctors. to the extent of about $100.000 per year in the education of health professionals. and that is over and above what they pay. This is all good because it has produced the health system that is unequaled anywhere else in the world. if we can provide the way that people can finance it so everybody has access to it. In education. I was on the Committee on Education and Labor when we only had one education program for post12. and today we have numerous ones in this bill. So the educational system has spread throughout the population. Mr. Speaker. this is a good bill. it is one of the very few bills that will hit the floor that has very substantial increases for a number. a number of the programs that are in it. and it shows the dedication.

This is an excellent subcommittee. and I am honored to serve as a member under his leadership. One important measure of the strength of our country. Mr. Speaker. is the health and education and wellbeing of our people. It is the work of this subcommittee to fund that. and that is why. as I say. it is an honor to serve there. This bill responds to many of the top priorities of the Clinton administration and our country. The Labor section addresses displaced workers and the administrations hopes for disadvantaged youth with increased funding for youth training. Job Corps. summer youth employment. and the SchooltoWork Program. The Health and Human Services section reflects the new administrations commitment to respond to the AIDS epidemic with a 21percent increase in funds for research. a 9percent increase for prevention. and a 66percent increase in funds for patient care. The bill also reflects the administrations priority on womens health. as well as the Senates. the Congress of the United States emphasis on womens health. with $292 million for breast cancer research. an increase of $84 million. or 40 percent. over 1993 and $7.5 million for a new initiative to research ways to prevent domestic violence and violence against women. At the same time. this bill gives new attention to childrens concerns with major increases in funding for such programs as Head Start and childhood vaccinations. And the bill helps alleviate the backlog in Social Security disability claims. The Education section includes $155 million for education reform and funds a variety of vital programs that will make the difference for the future of our country.

I am proud that this legislation significantly increases support for biomedical research for breast cancer and AIDS. preventive health. and job training for dislocated workers. The conference report will also help eliminate waste and fraud in student aid programs so that we can use those resources to expand access to higher education.

There is a great anxiety among the people of my State. and I am sure in Illinois and Minnesota. and I know in Missouri and the other surrounding States that have been so hard hit. including Kansasa great anxiety about what the future is going to hold.

A lot of our small towns and communities out there that rely upon the income of those farmers around there. the harvest they bring in in the fall. that keep our small stores open. our implement dealers. our grocery stores. our elevators. that maybe help pay the wages of the people that have the nursing home for our elderly. that help keep the local rural hospital going. all comes down to this: There is a great anxiety that that grocery store will not be there. or they will not be able to have the funds necessary to keep the nursing home going.

A demonstration of the answer the Senator from Iowa gave was the fact that when the House of Representatives passed this bill out of the Appropriations Committee. it sent with it--I do not have it with mebut they sent a committee report with it and it talked about the flooding in eight States. It did not name North Dakota. because this is a disaster in progress. Since that time. since the House Appropriations Committee issued its bill with its report. North Dakota has flooded. Crop loss alone in our State is $600 million and rising. Total damage will probably come close to $1 billion. The point is. what did the President request? He requested an amount of money based on the knowledge he had of what flooding existed at that point. But this is not a hurricane that has gone in and destroyed a lot of property and moved out to sea. This is a disaster in progress that is not yet complete. and the damage grows daily. As I said. evidence of that is the report from the Appropriations Committee that accompanies the legislation we are now going to consider in conference does not even include North Dakota. and yet North Dakota is clearly damaged by flooding. That is why I think we have a situation in which the position of the White House surely will have changed as oppoaod to 2 or 3 weeks ago. when it began considering what it must do legislatively in requesting a supplemental appropriations bill. I simply wanted to make that point. I think the Senator from Iowa is making the point. but it is even more clear by the fact that the original appropriations report did not even list all the States that are damaged by flooding.

That is my understanding. I hope that the Senators would talk with the administration and seek to prevail upon it to change its policy. Let us not change the policy on the floor and. by so doing. increase the amount of money in the bill at this point. That can be done later. It does not have to be done tonight or this week. Because if we are going to change this language. I think we have to contemplate going back and compensating those people from last year. They are going to feel that it is unfair. that they are not being treated fairly in comparison with those who have suffered from disasters this year.

Whatever they are called. their numbers are climbing. Federal figures are sketchy. but about half of the jobs people have been getting in the last year are parttime or temporary or involve other unconventional arrangements. That is up from less than a quarter of the new jobs a decade ago. Most of these new jobs pay less than regular jobs. and few come with good benefits.

The museum is governed by a board of trustees that sets the policies and oversees the museums operations. Funding of the museum comes from corporate and private foundations. bequests. sales from its gift shop. and other fundralsing activities. The museum also receives donations from Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel. members of the Fraternal Order of Retired Border Patrol Officers. and the public. No appropriated funds are. or will be. used for the maintenance or operation of the museum and library. The purpose of this legislation is to give the Immigration and Naturalization Service statutory authority to officially recognize the museum and to provide nonfinancial support. Specifically. the bill will allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service to convey to this fine museum equipment. artifacts and memorabilia held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service which would be much better displayed and preserved in the existing museum. as well as to transfer any property that the Attorney General may determine Is necessary to further the purposes of the museum and foundation. The bill will also authorize the Attorney General to provide technical assistance to the Border Patrol Museum and Memorial Library Foundation for the purpose of displaying any items which may be transferred under the bill. The Immigration and Naturalization Service supports the legislation. I invite my colleagues to join me in my effort to provide recognition and support of the Border Patrol Museum and Memorial Library Foundation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

Thousands of lives have been lost simply because those who may have donated organs and tissues were never aware that they could. At any given time. there are 30.000 adults and children waiting for organ and tissue donations. Approximately. every 20 minutes a new patient is added to the national patient waiting list for an organ transplant. There is an adequate supply of transplantable organs. We simply need to make our citizens aware of the importance of organ and tissue donations. We should encourage our citizeis to decide now. whether. in the event of a future tragedy. they are willing to be a donor. This will inevitably lessen the burden on the family when asked by the medical profession if they may allow a particular organ or organs to be removed for transplantation. Although this decision is frightening to many people. these vital organs and tissues could be used to give the gift of life. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this worthy measure. and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the resolution appear in my remarks.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced budget. I am reminded of a story I heard once about a little boy growing up on a farm. This little boy would watch with great anticipation as the hens on the farm would nest their eggs until they were ready to hatch. One day the boy went out to the hens nest and saw that the eggs were hatching. The little chicks were struggling and pecking their way out of the shells. The boys heart was moved and he thought he ought to help those little chicks out of the shells. But then a terrible thing happened: All of the chicks from the shells that the boy opened died. When the boy told his mother what happened. she warned him that the struggle to get out of the shell is what made the chicks strong enough to survive once they made their way out of the shells. I believe that this story reflects the state of the Nation with respect to the budget deficit. We are shelled in by an enormous debt. There is serious longterm work to do to break through that shell. if we are going to be economically strong and sound enough to survive the future. The policies of the pastthe shortterm. easy way out solutions are making us economically weak. The deficit continues to soar. The resulting high interest rates make us more and more reliant on foreign investment and widespread ownership of U.S. assets. As long as this trend continues. the deficit will continue to drain our economy and cheapen the value of the dollar and American goods and service. This being the case. I believe that the Nations deficit problem must be our No. 1 domestic priority. I join the administration in its call to the Nation to rally and sacrifice in order to bring down the huge debt Goli-",

Along with four other Western Senators. I am an original cosponsor of this important piece of legislation critical to public lands States like Utah. To understand the critical nature of this legislation. one must understand the intent behind the PILT Program. Originally established in 1976 by Congress. the PILT Program was designed to compensate States with certain Federal lands within their borders. These landswhich include those managed by the Forest Service. the National Park Service. the Bureau of Land Management [BLM]. the Fish and Wildlife Service. those withdrawn for the Department of Defense. and Indian reservationsare exempt from property taxes. the primary revenue source for counties to provide services. Unable to assess property taxes on these lands. counties were literally taxing to death that portion of their land held privately to make up the shortfall caused by the presence of Federal lands. Fortunately. Congress recognized the financial burden management of these lands placed upon local governments and established a mechanism to pay counties a per acre amount to watch over the publics lands. This mechanism is the PILT Program. We in Utah are concerned about the continued viability of PILT because the Fedeal Government is the majority owner of our acreage. According to the BLM. 70.2 percent of Utahs 52 million acres is owned and managed by the agencies I mentioned above. In most of Utahs rural counties. the Federal Government owns more than 70-. 80-. and even 90percent of the entire county. This means that the land base in the large majority of Utahs counties. as far as Lax support is concerned. consists of 30-. 20-. and yes--even 10percent or less of the countys total acreage. From these dismally low percentages. a county must obtain the necessary funds to provide all county services to all county citizens. be they permanent residents or visitors.",

These funds were used last year to help county volunteers search for four crosscountry skiers caught in an avalanche in the MantiLaSal Forest in southeastern Utah. The Forest Service did not provide any funds to undertake this rescue attempt. and San Juan County had to cover the entire cost. including an $8.500 bill for the use of a helicopter. These funds were also utilized to rescue a family of eight who. while hiking near Hite Marina on Lake Powell. became trapped after a flash flood forced them into a canyon. Twenty county individuals spent countless manhours. in addition to the necessary equipment. to retrieve this family visiting Lake Powell. These funds are also expended by counties to purchase the appropriate equipment and receive the requisite training. mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. to prepare a response to a hazardous waste release or spill. The EPA requires this upfront spending before a county receives EPA approval for its local emergency plan. without being reimbursed for these expenses. These are a few examples that vividly demonstrate how PILT funds are utilized in Utah. They are not misspent or used in some wasteful fashion that taxpayers would disapprove of or resent.",

All of us realize the emergency nature of those who are out of work. For them it is an emergency. We want to extend to them a helping hand by extending the unemployment compensation bill. The question is: Should we pay for it? The administrations bill. which we have before us. will spend close to $6 billion over the next 2 years for unemployment compensation. without paying for it. We are going to widen the deficit and borrow the money. The amendment I have offered has suggested a 0.5 percent--half of 1 percentcut in a variety of administrative services. travel. and other executive branch expenditures. which will raise the money necessary to pay for the bill in the first year. There are about $644 billion in personnel. travel. communications. printing. consulting services. and whatnot. and it is from this amount that I cut the money. Interestingly. the President has suggested this spending cut in his economic plan. It is one of the streamlining in Government cuts he proposes for deficit reduction later on. All I am suggesting is that with this first spending bill we have In the Senate. this is going to set the standard for whether or not we are going to pay for things. or whether we are just going to spend and not pay. So the amendment is simple. The amendment will pay for the expenses of the bill in the first year. The question for the Senate is: Do you want to pay or borrow? I think we ought to pay. and I do it by cutting other programs. not by increasing taxes. The bill. as it stands. would simply say let us widen the deficit and borrow.

We may be emerging from the recession. but new Jobs are simply not being created fast enough. In my home State of Washington. where the unemployment rate is over 7 percent. Boeing recently announced plans to lay off more than 20.000 workers in the next 18 months. Each Boeing job supports an additional 2.8 Jobs. meaning that as many as 60.000 workers and their families may be affected in the near future. In our timberdependent communities. thousands of other workers and their families are struggling to survive as they have consistently watched jobs disappear over the last 4 years. We must not abandon any of them at this time of great need. Nor can we foresake the other 1.5 million unemployed Americans currently receiving Federal emergency compensation. These emergency benefits will stop flowing on March 6. Just a few days from now. if we do not pass this bill. As large American companies are downsizing and banks have a tight hold on credit needed to help start new businesses. it is extremely difficult for many of our unemployed workers to find new jobs or to get the kind of retraining they need to enter new fields. I am committed to working with President Clinton to enact his deficit reduction and economic stimulus package. For Washington State. job creation and economic diversification are two of my top priorities. But as we move forward to create goodpaying jobs. we must not cut off support to the unemployed in the meantime. Finally. I would like to commend President Clinton and the sponsors of this bill for recognizing that many displaced workers must find new employment in different industries.

The Senate on two separate occasions has looked at this proposition which I think was illconceived in the first place and the Senate has spoken clearly on it. that it is the desire of this Senate to repeal the socalled luxury tax on large vessels. It was an idea to try and offset the regressive nature of the tax on beer and alcohol and wine by somehow hitting millionaires who bought large boats. The problem is instead of hitting the millionaires. as the Senator from Rhode Island has accurately spelled out. we hit the people who make the boats. the workers. the craftsmen and women who build the boats. They lost their jobs because fewer and fewer boats were actually produced. Instead of generating more revenues. we generated no new revenues and. in addition. put people out of work. That was not the intent of the Congress. It is time we recognize it. as we have on two separate occasions. and ask the Clinton administration to embrace this. I just want to comment to Senator CHAFEE from Rhode Island. as well as the majority leader who has been steadfast in pushing this legislation for the people he represents in Maine. It has been a high priority for the majority leader. We have been working with the chairman. the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to encourage his active support.

It has clearly not worked as intended and should be and must be and will be repealed. I commend the Senators from Rhode Island and Louisiana for their leadership in this area. and I commit to all involved that we are going to get the luxury tax repealed this year and as soon as possible. The problem we face with respect to this bill was. of course. stated by the Senator from Rhode Island. Under the American Constitution. the Senate has no legal authority to initiate a tax bill. None. All tax measures must originate in the House of Representatives. If the Senate on its own initiative passes a tax bill. it will not be taken up in the House. It is annulled. It is an act that has no legal consequence or significance. The unemployment insurance bill is not a tax bill. Adoption of the luxury tax repeal on boats would convert !t into a tax bill and. therefore. would have only the effect of killing the unemployment insurance extension without enacting the boat tax repeal. That must originate in the House of Representatives. Therefore. what we must do is find a vehicle which originates in the House under constitutional procedures and which we can then take and act on the luxury tax repeal. I am strongly committed to that. I have discussed it with several members of the administration. highranking officials in the administration. as has Senator MOYNIHAN. and I believe is going to address that subject now because he himself has been involved in the discussions. We passed this twice last year. Twice it was vetoed. not because of this provision but because of other unrelated provisions in the bill. I hope very much that this year. and soon and promptly. we are going to be able to pass this repeal and get this matter over with once and for all because I think the Senator from Rhode Island is quite right. it must be repealed. and I say to him and my friend from Louisiana and others. it will be repealed.

It is called the layoff tax. I met with a number of employees of failed boat companies in the State of Florida. These workers told me that is how they refer to this tax.

I would like to extend my comments a moment longer not for the purpose of getting into some tough partisan debate. but to talk about a tax that was designed to make the wealthy pay more in taxes. The Senate has voted twice to repeal this measure because we have found out that you cannot force the wealthy to pay more taxes. they will find a way around the effort to make them pay more taxes. This is a prime example of how tax rates can affect peoples behavior. The assumption was made. when this tax was passed. that all action. all behavior. all decisions by the wealthy in the Nation would continue as if nothing had changed. The reality is that with the higher tax on boats. on luxury items. people decided not to buy them and the wealthy did not pay the tax.

It imposed a 10percent excise tax on the amount of the retail sales price of boats that exceeds $100.000. and it took effect on January 1. 1991. It quickly became clear. however. that the tax was counterproductive. It has been the cause of significant job losses in the boat industry in Massachusetts and many other States. and has only made the recession worse. Obviously. that was not the purpose of the tax or the intention of Congress in enacting it. More than a year ago. in November 1991. by the overwhelming vote of 8214. the Senate adopted a resolution urging that the tax should be immediately repealed. I voted in favor of its repeal then. and I continue to support its repeal. Unfortunately. that resolution was nonbinding. and all our efforts throughout 1992 to enact the repeal into law were finally blocked for unrelated reasons. when President Bush vetoed the omnibus tax bill. Now. that impasse is behind us. and effective action is possible.

His belief in this bill and support have made the progress on this bill possible. I introduced H.R. 4394. the Comprehensive OneCall Notification Act. in response to a pipeline accident that occurred in my district last March. In Edison. NJ. a rupture in a natural gas pipeline caused an explosion that demolished eight apartment buildings and left hundreds of people homeless. The explosion produced a fireball so great that it could be seen in three States. and a fire so intense that it melted the cars parked at the apartment complex. To the people in my district. the safety of pipelines has taken on a terrible new significance. They were witnesses to a horrible tragedy and they carry with them. even today. fears that they had never before imagined. In a way however. they were also witnesses to a miracle: Only one person lost her life in the accident. tragically suffering a heart attack. and most residents escaped without injury. Certainly. in light of the total devastation of the area. the potential for a greater number of fatalities is apparent. The Edison accident. like the majority of pipeline accidents. was caused by third party damage. Often times. excavators do not know what is buried beneath their work site. This ignorance can lead to fatal and expensive consequences. H.R. 4394 proposes a simple solution to this problem: Before excavators begin",

With the passage of the Water Resources and Development Act of 1994. they see an opportunity to lay to rest economic stagnation which has plagued the area for 30 years. On June 14. Representative PETRI joined me in the introduction of H.R. 4575. a measure which would direct the Secretary of the Army to transfer to the State of Wisconsin lands and improvements associated with the LaFarge Dam and Lake Projecta Corps of Engineers flood control project initiated in 1962. This legislation would deauthorize the construction of the reservoir and dam. while completing other features of the original project. Prior to 1962. the LaFarge area was a farm community which suffered from severe flooding each spring. Responding the residents complaints. the Federal Government promised to correct the flooding problem by constructing a reservoir and dam. For environmental reasons. work was suspended in July 1975. leavIng 61 percent of the dam uncompleted. while 80 percent of the land was acquired. By 1990. it was estimated that annual losses resulting from the removal of family farms and the unrealized tourism benefits anticipated with the completion of the project totaled over 300 jobs and $8 million for the local economy. further exacerbating poverty in the area. In March of this year. the Wisconsin Legislature created the Kickapoo Valley Reserve and Governing Board. Having established this entity. the State of Wisconsin is prepared to receive the transfer of land from the Federal Government. pending action by the Congress. I want to take this opportunity to thank Representatives APPLEGATE. BOEHLERT. and PETRI. and the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environmental staff for their conscientious efforts In bringing this legislation to fruition in the House of Representatives. I encourage my colleagues in the other body to pass this legislation during the remaining days of the 103d Congress.

Based on the billions of dollars being poured into the F22 program. one would assume that we are on the verge of being outclassed by the air forces of foreign powers. But is that really the case? In endorsing the F22 over the socalled F15XX. the Major Aircraft Review [MAR] predicated its choice on a year 2000 scenario in which the Air Force would have to gain and hold air superiority over Warsaw Pact territory against a Soviet Union boasting: Overwhelming numerical superiority. highly sophisticated integrated air defenses. stealthy air superiority and counter air fighters [ASF/CAF] armed with improved AA10 Alamo airtoair missiles. and. nextgeneration SA15 and SAX17 surfacetoair missiles. Back then. with the cold war still uppermost in planners minds. a global conventional war against the Soviet Union was a prudent scenario against which to plan. Since then. the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union has wrought havoc on what remains of Russias integrated air defenses and Russian advanced weapons development has been slowed to a crawl or halted outright due to the same funding constraints we face. That being so. what relevance does the MAR threat projection have today? Isnt a Desert Stormlike scenario of total U.S./allied air superiority more reflective of todays reality? Against most future opponents. wont the United States. with or without allies. enjoy numerical superiority? And what country is likely to be better equipped. trained. or led? And that raises an inevitable question: In this new world order. isnt an improved F15 good enough? Something to ponder when considering the $2.5 billion request for F22.e",

The Fallon Clinic was founded as a small group practice by Dr. Michael Fallon in 1929. Since its inception. it has been a pionebr in the health care field. striving to meet the needs of its community through innovative practices. When the Fallon Clinic first opened. group practices were rare. Nevertheless. its founders understood that this efficient coordination of resources allowed them to provide patients with greater choice while lowering costs. In 1951. Fallon expanded into a multispecialty group practice. providing patients with the benefit of having a specialist available to deal with each of their ailments. As time passed. word of Fallons excellent service spread and patients. in increasing numbers. turned to the Fallon Clinic for their health care needs. With the original office bursting at the seams. the clinic was forced to open a new facility in 1966 and subsequently expanded to 29 sites. Never content to rest on its laurels. the Fallon Clinic has continued to innovate and to improve the quality of its services. In 1977. it established a health maintenance organization or HMO called the Fallon Community Health Plan. Today. Fallon is one of the most successful HMOs in the country. It has been praised as a \"model HMO\" and named as one of the 10 best HMOs in the Nation. A large part of the HMOs success is the fact that it is the most efficient and lowest cost HMO in the area. But cost is only half the story. Fallon continues to grow because of the quality of its work and the care with which it treats its patients. At a time when Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to afford highquality health care. Fallon stands out as a bright example of what can be accomplished by bold thinking. On its 65th anniversary. I praise Fallon for its innovative heritage and exhort it to continue moving forward at this critical stage of health care reform in America.*",

Last year. $27.4 million in food stamps was redeemed at military commissaries nationwide. up from $24 million in The time has come for Congress to take a serious look at how it compensates the defenders of this Nation and to make a serious commitment to keeping our service men and women above the poverty line and off welfare. The simple fact is that when someone agrees to wear our countrys uniform. lying awake at night wondering how theyll ever be able to provide for their families shouldnt be part of the deal. We need to show the men and women of our Armed Forces that we care enough to provide them with a decent life. a dignified life.

During the last several years. the University of Mobile has played a major role in the development of Nicaragua through campusbased research. training programs for management personnel. and consultation with the central and local governments on issues such as elementary and secondary education and health care. The University of Mobile in Nicaragua has also opened opportunities for cultural interchange between the United States and Central America. Nicaragua and other countries in the region have long been in desperate need of a quality educational organization to sponsor a variety of educational programs. This years freshman class at the Nicaraguan campus has grown to 150 students and next years enrollment is projected to be even greater. I strongly urge the Agency of International Development to support this program. The University of Mobile needs assistance in providing scholarships to indigent Nicaraguans and in the building of new facilities. The U.S. Government should use this project as a model for other higher education efforts in this region of the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing legislation to prohibit insurance companies from dropping young adults from their parents family health plan until they reach age 27. According to the National Center for Policy Analysis. only a small portion of the 15 percent of the population without insurance remains uninsured for a long time. Fifty percent regain insurance in 4 months. Another 25 percent is insured in 12 months. Only 2 percent of the population remains uninsured for 2 years. Furthermore. approximately 40 percent of the uninsured are under 25 years old. The fact that young adults make up such a large percentage of the uninsured speaks to the need to fill in the gaps. During young adulthood. many individuals either cannot afford health coverage or fail to spend their discretionary income for insurance since they feel immortal. Insurance companies typically drop coverage for children from the family plan once they reach age 18 or they graduate from college. leaving too many of these young adults without insurance. For this reason. I have introduced legislation to ensure that insurance companies cannot drop individuals from their parents family health plan until age 27. Providing the child has not married and has no dependents. he or she will be able to remain on the parents family plan. My bill will give young people an incentive to retain affordable health insurance while helping to ease the unnecessary burden of higher health care costs for the rest of us. The Family Health Coverage Act is a common sense proposal taking a step toward responsibly reforming our health care system. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.",

VA for receiving the 1994 National City Challenge to Stop Drunk Driving Inspiration Award for cities over 100.000 in population. After realizing that habitual offenders constituted a disproportionate share of the citys drinking and driving problem. Hampton developed the Habitual Offender project. By obtaining a list of repeat offenders from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. city police officers selected and monitored 88 of the worst habitual offenders for sentence violations or additional DWI violations. Fiftyeight percent of the citys repeat offenders had been arrested within 2 years. With the help of the Habitual Offender project. Hamptons alcoholrelated accidents have decreased 36 percent and alcoholrelated fatalities have decreased 70 percent over the past 5 years. We all are aware of the losses caused by drunk drivers. not only in Virginia but also across the Nation. I recognize the need to involve all citizens in efforts to reduce the frequency of drunk driving and support community programs such as Hamptons Habitual Offender Project. A program inexpensively transferred to other jurisdictions. this project sends the indispensable message that injuries as well as deaths resulting from drunk and drugged driving. specifically repeat offenses. are not to be tolerated. I again congratulate Hampton for its efforts and hope the city continues to be an innovator in the fight against drinking and driving.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as we consider the fiscal year 1994 VA. HUD. and independent agencies appropriations bill. I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to a unique flooding problem that plagues the city of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. and to ask that $25 million be provided to complete 9 miles of a flood control tunnel that is critical to solving this problem. In early June of this year. approximately 45 billion gallons of rain fell in Chicago over a 2day period. The subsequent flooding from this massive thunderstorm resulted in nearly one billion dollars worth of damage to Cook and Du Page Counties. the death of three people. and disruptions of Interstate 55. and the Dan Ryan and Stevenson expressways. Rainwater and raw sewage backed up into the basements of nearly 500.000 homes. creating serious public health problems. These type of flooding emergencies will continue to plague the city of Chicago until an integral system of tunnels and reservoirs are brought fully on line. This system is known as the tunnel and reservoir plan [TARP]. an initiative of the metropolitan water district of Greater Chicago. TARP is a network of underground tunnels and reservoirs designed as an outlet for sewage and floodwaters during large thunderstorms. For almost two decades. the TARP system has slowly grown. gradually improving flood prevention system in Chicago. Without TARP. local sewage and rainwater drainage would have nowhere to go when large storms hit the area. Already. TARP has greatly reduced polluted backflows into Lake Michigan. and to the amazement of many. has markedly improved the water quality of the Chicago River. a feat thought to be impossible a decade ago. Although TARP is largely complete. funds are still needed to finish the system. The urgency of bringing this system online was exemplified during the recent Chicago floods. when TARP tunnels held nearly 1.5 billion gallons of the total rainfall before quickly filling to capacity. Chicago desperately needs additional capacity to stop this flooding. Without TARP. Chicago will continue to experience serious economic and health hazards from flooding. Therefore. during conference consideration of the fiscal year 1994 VA. HUD. and independent agencies appropriations bill. I ask the distinguished Senator from Maryland to include $25 million to complete the final 9 miles of the Des Plaines system tunnel.",

This program provides a 100 percent Federal guarantee on loans. made through private lenders to Indian families. for the purchase. rehabilitation or construction of a home on Indian trust lands. The trust status of tribal land has made lenders unwilling to make loans for homes on that land. This program addresses lenders concerns by providing them with a 100 percent guarantee on their loans. and keeps the trust status of the land intact by providing that the Federal Government will only liquidate foreclosed properties by selling them to a member of the tribe. the tribe itself. or the Indian housing authority where the tribal land is located. The Housepassed version of the VA/ HUD/Independent Agencies appropriations bill includes $2 million to capitalize the program.

This is a community which I brought to the attention of Congress on August 4. 1993. when I testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on serious wastewater treatment needs. It is a semirural community of 4.100 households experiencing recent growth. Original homes were constructed with onsite water wells and septic tanks. However. increasing density. a combination of soil characteristics. and a very shallow water table now makes this area susceptible to groundwater contamination. thereby contaminating the drinking water. In the past. the Governor has had to call in the National Guard to provide clean drinking water when problems existed within the area. South Valley lacks the tax base and governmental structure for funding the needed infrastructure improvements. It faces high system costs per household because of its relatively small population. a high percentage of residents with lower incomes. and lack of access to existing Federal rural water grants due to its size. The State of New Mexico recognizes the plight of this community and is already contributing to finding solutions to the probln. However. State and local funds cannot meet all needs. I believe that the Clean Water Act should be amended to include a grant program to help the South Valley and similar communities. I appreciate the subcommittees intent not to fund any site specific projects in the bill unless they are specifically authorized by law. However. because of the serious nature of this situation.

The amendment that has been offered by the Senator from North Carolina would be a Federal mandate to the State and local governments relating to prayer in school.

It does not offer money or withhold the money depending on what Is done by a local school district. It allows local school districts to make their own decisions about whether in that school district voluntary prayer should be allowed or not. It also allows flexibility for those school districts to tailor whatever they are doing according to what the law is. Furthermore. it does not fall into the trap of the Helms amendment which is the trap that is in the very last sentence of the Helms amendment which says. in effect. that local school districts cannot have any control over the form of prayer in their schools which would mean presumably that any student could arise from his seat any time of day and do anything that he or she wanted to do in the name of prayer. out loud. in a belligerent way. whatever. This is. therefore. much less directive. It is not directive. It is simply a statement of position by the Senate. What is the statement of position? The statement of position Is that it is a good thing to have a brief period of silence. We do not direct the school boards do it. We simply advise that in our opinion it is an appropriate thing to do to have a period when students can reflect on their religion. They can reflect on their value system. They can reflect on how they want to be good citizens of that school or what they want to accomplish during that day in school.

The way I read it. a court would have to make that judgment. So it is only those situations where a student has a constitutional right to pray. as determined by a court. that would be implicated by this amendment. This is. obviously. a difficult balance to be struck in the area of free exercise and the establishment of religion. It is a delicate balance. The modification protects only those situations that the free exercise clause protects. We withhold funds here if we find that there is going to be discrimination on the basis of race. We withhold funds if there is going to be discrimination on the basis of religion. We also have done that with regard to disability. The way I read this amendment. as changed. the amendment would say that if they are going to deny. as a matter of school board policy. constitutionally protected rights. then that school district will lose funds under this act. So I have enormous respect for my friend and colleagues--the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Vermontin terms of their positions. the uncertainty that might be out there in terms of the schools and understanding what is appropriate or what is not appropriate. and the arguments that are made in terms of the issues of public policy that are raised.

Our environmental statutes that we pass today are passed for good reason. They are well intended. And. by definition. by the implementation of a lot of these statutes. there have to be some rules and regulations. We have very dramatically cleaned up the environment in many ways.

In addition. the amount of particulates in the United States in the last 20 years has also been cut 50 percent because of enactment of American environmental laws. The air in Utah is cleaner. Mr. President. The air in Ohio and all of our States is cleaner as a consequence of statutes we have passed to clean the air. In addition. the ambience level that occurs in the atmosphere has been reduced from about 200.000 tons to zero. That is basically because we ban lead in gasoline.

This amendmont will reduce the number of currency transaction reports which banks have to file under the Bank Secrecy Act. Senator BRYAN. Chairman RIEOLE. and I introduced S. 1664 on November 17. 1993. I believe that this bill. added to S. 1275. the Community Development. Credit Enhancement and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1993. will help relieve bank regulatory burden. improve compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act. and better money laundering deterrence efforts. Action must be taken to relieve the banking industry of the burden of unreasonable regulatory requirements it now faces. The bank regulators currently require all kinds of burdensome compliance reports. activities and documents that cost significant amounts of time and resources. Consequently. banks. are generating too many reports and other paperwork of questionable value. instead of making loans. In particular. to help combat money laundering. banks have to file a Currency Transaction Report [CTR] for all currency transactions over $10.000. The American Bankers Association estimates that it cost banks almost $130 million to file 9.2 million CTRs with the Internal Revenue Service in 1992. The utility to the Government of this massive number of reports has yet to be proven. This amendment will help to reduce drastically the number of useless CTRs which are filed with the Government. thus reducing. in part. bank regulatory burden. The AntiMoney Laundering Act of 1993 would create mandatory exemptions for transactions between depository institutions. transactions with any U.S. Government or agency. and transactions with any business or category of business where CTRs have little or no value for law enforcement purposes. In addition. Treasury would have the discretion to exempt transactions between a depository institution and its qualified business customers who most frequently engage in transactions which are subject to reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy At. I am well aware of the serious problem this situation has created for the banking industry and have been in consultation with my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee to find solutions. Bank regulatory reform is one of my highest priorities. I also consider it a key to economic growth. A companion bill. H.R. 3235. has already been acted on in the House.

In winning the gold of the Iditarod in record time. Martin Buser takes his place with other historic Alaskan athletes. including Tommy Moe. the recent goldmedal winnek. for America in the Olympic mens downhill. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is without any doubt the most difficult challenge any athlete could undertake. The trail. winding for more than 1.000 miles through North Americas most rugged wilderness from Anchorage to Nome. crosses mountains. forests. muskegs. and open savannahs. Hazards to both humans and dogs include not only the physical challenge of the race. but more exotic experiences. such as avoiding charging moose and angry grizzlies. Buser crossed the finish line in Nome. on the shores of the icecovered Bering Sea. at 10:02 p.m. yesterday. His win sets a new record for the race of 10 days. 13 hours. and 2 minutes. more than 21/ hours faster than the old record set last year by another Alaskan. Jeff King of Denali Park. The Iditarod is an annual testimony to the strength and stamina possible to both humans and dogs. and to the peerless spirit of competition and good sportsmanship. It celebrates a unique partnership of determination. cooperation and conditioning between each racer and his or her dogs. The Iditarod Trail was first marked as a dog team postal carrier route in 1910. The race was started as an annual event in 1967. to commemorate a lifesaving relay race with time in 1925. when mushers along the trail cooperated to deliver critically needed diptheria serum in time to save the residents of Nome from an epidemic. I am proud to have played a hand in helping the founders of the race. Joe Redington and Dorothy Page. obtain financing for that first race.",

In a effort to gain control of the Greek Province of Macedonia. Marshall Tito. in 1944. changed the name of the Skopje region of Yugoslavia from Vandar Banovina to Macedonia. The regime in Skopje has persisted in increasing tensions between it and Greece. The propaganda campaign against Greece from Skopje continues today. It is in the best interest of the United States to promote stability in the Balkans. By diplomatically recognizing FYROM. we will possibly jeopardize our relationship with Greece. and perhaps even threaten the peace in the Balkans. As you well know. Greece. our wartime and NATO ally. is an important strategic. political. and economic partner of the United States. Greece is also our main ally in the region and is crucial in promoting peace. democracy. stability. and economic progress in the Balkans. President Clintons actions are in direct contradiction to his October 1992 campaign pledge to not recognize FYROM. Assurances from President Gligorov as to the several disputes with Greece are certainly not enough to allow for United States recognition. Before establishing diplomatic relations with FYROM. the Clinton administration should follow the following conditions: FYROM must remove the word \"Macedonia\" from its name. remove the objectionable constitutional language in articles 3 and 49 of its constitution with respect to expansionist and irredentist policies. remove the objectional symbols implying territorial expansion. such as the star of Vergina on its flag. cease its propaganda campaign against Greece. and adhere fully to CSCE norms and principles. The United States should withhold all financial and/or other aid until these actions are taken. Mr. President. to put it simply. the President should not have granted diplomatic recognition to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia until the above conditions were met. and he should reconsider his decision and withdraw this recognition.",

DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: This letter is in response to inquiries from your office regarding my position in support of the Schenk Amendment on cruise ship gambling. As you know. federal law was changed in 1992 to give states the authority to ban gambling on the high seas during interstate voyages. Indian tribes seeking to expand the scope of permissible gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) immediately went to court arguing that state acquiesence to casino gaming on intrastate voyages amounted to tacit agreement for tribes to conduct fullscale casino gaming within the states territories. I believe the IGRA should be amended to clarify that the scope of permissible Indian gaming within a states territorial boundaries is game specific. i.e.. only those forms of gaining the state permits played in the same fashion. Without such an amendment. any relaxation of the states ban on cruise ship gambling could be used by a court to justify the expansion of gambling activities under the IGRA. Alternatively. the Johnson Act (AntiGambling Devices Act) could be amended. as the Schenk language. attempts to do. to return the task of regulating casino gambling on legitimate cruise ships in intrestate travel to the federal government. This approach would reduce the risk that gambling activity that occurs outside Californias borders will dictate the scope of gambling within its borders. Of course. any such amendment should be accompanied by measures to ensure sufficient federal regulatory control over shipboard gaming. I trust this clarifies my position with regard to the need for changes in federal law in order to allow gambling on legitimate cruise ships operating out of California ports. Sincerely. PETE WILSON.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the amendment I offer today is virtually identical to a bill passed in this body by a very large vote on November 20 of last year. That bill would close a loophole in our maritime law which gives an unfair advantage to our foreignflag competitors. Under the present law. if a foreign-. made. foreignflag. foreignowned vessel which operates out of the United States of America sails a mere 3 miles out to sea. turns around and comes back. it is considered a foreign voyage. In doing that. they are able to get around some of the oldest laws in our country. called the cabotage laws. which reserved coastlines for American vessels. American crews. and Americanowned vessels. The amendment today would close this loophole. I think it is something both Democrats and Republicans can agree on. I think Republicans in particular are always keenly aware of the mandates we put on American businesses. It is not fair to have a mandate on American businesses and yet allow people to operate out of the same areas not to live by those mandates. The Democrats in this body can certainly approve of the jobs that will be created by insuring that in the future these vessels are made in America and preserve our very important national shipbuilding base for America in times of military use. Mr. Chairman. I know of no opposition to the bill. I thank the chairman. the gentleman from Massachusetts and the ranking minority member. the gentleman from Texas . for allowing the amendment to come to the floor. and I urge its passage.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to rise in support of the amendment offered bv my colleague from Mississippi. GENE TAYLOR. a member of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. This amendment is a revised version of a bill that has been passed twice by the House of Representativesonce in the previous Congress and last Novemberbut. clue to matters beyond our control. has not been enacted. This amendment will provide American companies the opportunity to become involved in the extremely lucrative cruisetonowhere trade. These voyages. which are currently conducted exclusively by foreignowned. foreignflagged. and foreignmanned cruise ships. represent a significant economic growth potential for American businesses. In addition. hundreds of jobs for American merchant mariners would be created. As a result of administrative determinationsthat the members of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries strenuously disagree withthe U.S. Customs Service has allowed these foreign ships to continue to operate. This has led to the absurd situation that if someone goes on a saltwater fishing trip and returns to the port of departure. that fishing boat has to be U.S.-built and U.S.-owned. But if that same person gets on a cruise ship and spends the day eating. drinking. and gamblingrather than fishingand the vessel returns to the same port. then the cruise ship can be foreignbuilt and foreignowned. This amendment would allow foreignflag cruise operators to continue their activities until January 1. 2000. or for 15 years after construction or a major conversion of a ship. if they crew their ships with American merchant seamen. However. if they choose not to recrew the ships. their operations would have to cease after 5 years. The amendment would also allow a U.S.-cruise operator to enter a cruisetonowhere trade and bumpout an existing foreign operator sooner than 5 years. if the foreign operator elects not to hire an American crew. This amendment will eliminate a major loophole in our coastwise trade law. I urge the adoption of the amendment and reserve the balance of my time.",

We have all seen the important work of the Coast Guard in recent weeks regarding both Haitian and Cuban refugees. That we need a strong and wellequipped Coast Guard for these type of actions is undisputed. But in addition to refugee intervention. a strong Coast Guard is also necessary in the war against drugs. When the President first proposed a fiscal year 1995 budget for the Coast Guard. it provided no funds for drug intervention. The Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee added $21 million to that request for drug intervention. In addition. the committee added language to require the Coast Guard to dedicate at least 9.5 percent of its operating expenses to drug interdiction activities. Unfortunately. with this administrations policy of drug treatment as opposed to drug interdiction. and the reallocation of Coast Guard resources to the Cuban and Haitian situations. there remains minimal resources for drug interdiction. Since May alone. the Coast Guard has been notified of 11 instancos of drug trafficking and has been unable to respond due to the fact that all of its resources are being used elsewhere. This is a situation that simply cannot continue. Given Floridas past role as a major conduit for drug trafficking from Latin America and the Caribbean. and the impact these illicit operations have had on the crime rates in Florida. further reductions or reallocations of the Coast Guards drug interdiction activities are unacceptable. With the help of the Coast Guard and other Federal crime fighting agencies. Floridas law enforcement authorities have scored impressive successes against drug trafficking. We simply cannot reduce our vigilance in this regard. For these reasons. I support passage of this legislation.",

Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant is the major employer in Mineral County. NV. However. over tie past 15 to 20 years the ammunition production mission has been gradually eliminated at Hawthorne. This has resulted in corresponding reductions in employment which have had a serious economic impact on Mineral County. Because this is a rural county. recovery from this loss of jobs is extremely difficult. The ammunition plant previously used this site as a family housing area. Iowever. the reductions in employment anti the physical deterioration of the facilities have made it uneconomical for the Army to retain the housing area. The Army has demolished the housing units and is in the final stages of removing debris from the site. The Army has sent a letter stating they no longer need this property. Last years Defense Authorization Act included provisions that encouraged land transfers to allow local governments to maximize their economic redevelopment opportunities after being impacted by Base Closure and Realignment actions. I ask that similar opportunities be given to Mineral County. NV. Even though the reductions at Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant are not a result of the recent Base Closure and Realignment process. the local economic impacts are just as severe.

    "speech": "Mr. President. shortly after taking office last year. the Clinton administration undertook a significant reorganization of the Department of Energy. Some elements of DOEs reorganization plan were commendable. Others. however. caused me some concern. particularly the fate of the Nuclear Safety Office. Under DOEs reorganization. the Nuclear Safety Office was folded into the Office of Environment. Safety and Health. The Office of Nuclear Safety is responsible for providing independent safety oversight of DOEs nuclear facilities. It is the only inhouse check on nuclear safety that is independent of those who manage DOE nuclear facilities. Partly in response to criticisms from Members of Congress and others. DOE transferred the Nuclear Safety Office intact. without reducing its staffing. at least initially. While this was a welcome decision. the reorganization had other effects on nuclear safety oversight that were of continuing concern. In order to have a sound basis for evaluating this matter. last April I asked the General Accounting Office to review DOEs restructuring of nuclear safety oversight and evaluate whether the proposed changes woud improve or detract from DOEs ability to ensure nuclear safety. What the GAO found is disconcerting. After its yearlong review. it reached three basic conclusions: First. DOE does not currently have an adequate number of qualified staff to oversee nuclear safety. Second. DOE does not have a mechanism to ensure that nuclear safety issues are elevated up the chain of command until they are resolved. As a resuit. DOE may fail to take action to correct known safety problems. \"potentially posing unnecessary risks to workers and the public.\" This organizational flaw is particularly important because nuclear safety oversight officials told GAO that some DOE nuclear plant managers have become less responsive since the reorganization was adopted last year. Third. most importantly. GAO found that the independence of the nuclear safety oversight officials is compromised because they are now being directed to provide management assistance to those they oversee. The regulators are. in effect. being told to become part of plant management. undermining their ability to regulate in an objective. independent manner. Mr. President. the amendment I am offering does not seek to reverse DOEs reorganization. But it would direct DOE to take corrective action in the three problem areas identified by GAO so that nuclear safety oversight officials the tools they need to protect the public health and safety.",

That makes no sense to me. I have listened and read the rhetoric from the advocates of this amendment.

They object to having. automatically. additional participants come into the program. They really would like that to be wiped off the books. That is not a budgetary problem. that is a problem of law. Madam Chairman. if they want to fundamentally change that. they should introduce a bill to repeal indexing. repeal automatic growth in beneficiaries for programs.

It is time to end the kind of gimmickry that could only exist in Congress: where an increase in spending can be touted as a spending cut. This amendment would simplify the current budget process by requiring that all budgetary proposals be compared with actual spending levels of the past year instead of baseline estimates. This would bring some rationality to the process. It would bring our budget process in line with those of our constituents. A spending increase would actually be an increase from last years funding levels. while a spending cut would represent a true decrease. The PennyKasichStenholm amendment provides for genuine reform to the current confusing and dishonest baseline budgeting process. Under the current system. Members of Congress can argue that they are supporting spending cuts which are actually increases over last years levels. They do so because the funding levels are below a socalled baseline. which takes into consideration inflation and economic and demographic factors. Unamended. H.R. 4907 does little to address this problem. because it does not change the statutory definition of baselines. thereby preserving the inflated baseline. On the other hand. the PennyKasichStenholm amendment eliminates all of the budget gimmicks that are currently used to shield Members from having to make real spending cuts. I urge my colleagues to vote for real reforms to the baseline budgeting processsupport the PennyKasichStenholm amendment.",

The PennyKasichStenholm amendment will require the Federal Government to use last years funding level in planning for the next years budget. It is the right thing to do. For years. Congress has allowed the baseline to automatically include inflation without discussion. Now. under the new baseline of last years spending level. we will be allowed to compare spending from year to year honestlywithout confusion. For Americans everywhere. that plan their budget based on the amount they are paidnot on what they assume they should spend after an adjustment for inflation. this bill is honest and understandable.

They can do this because of something called baseline budgeting. where estimates of inflation costs. new recipients and other economic projections become built in to future government spending. Only funding that goes beyond such estimates has to be called a spending increase. If Congress does limit a real funding increase to less than these estimates. any of us can then talk as if we actually cut a programs spending. This practicewhere a spending increase is called a cut--corrupts all talk about budgets here in Washington. Madam Chairman. if we in Congress are truly serious about controlling spending. we must begin by eliminating such accounting tricks as baseline budgeting. We need to use real spending numbers as our basic budget reference. like what was spent last year on any program or department. Madam Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support the StenholmPennyKasich amendment. Congress should be willing to talk about money like Americas families do. where more money being spent could never be called a cut.

By using a measure that every American family uses to run its household--comparing this years spending to last yearsthe American people will finally be able to see whether Congress is truly cutting spending or not.

Members of the public and Members of this House have a right to see the budget from both perspectives. Now. the gentleman on this side of the aisle who just spoke says it has nothing to do with entitlements.

The first column reads. Appropriated. 1994. It lists the dollar amount for military personnel. The next line lists the amount spent in 1985.

Mr. STARK. and his attempt to evade the questions. that either he has not read the resolve clause of this Oxford debate or he is very uncomfortable with the question that is supposed to be in front of us. I will repeat it: Resolved that the Clinton health care plan best represents the elements that should be included in health care reform. Nowhere do we see goals. it is the elements of the Presidents plan. And I believe we have heard several responses tonight which indicate that they are far more comfortable talking about general ephemeral goals than they are about the elements of the Presidents plan. Frankly. when the American people are going to be required to live under this plan. they are not going to be living under ephemeral goals. they are going to be living under a national health board that has the ability to set the prices for the entire health care delivery system of the United States. They are going to be told they can no longer have the insurance plan that they currently have. And at some point in this debate. I do hope we begin talking about the elements of the Presidents plan. There has been waltzing outside these chambers for 6 months. I thought this would be an opportunity to engage on the elements of the Presidents plan and bring to the American people a better understanding so that they can make real choices. It is pretty ubvious the opposition does not want to close on the elements of the Presidents plan.",

It is the only plan before the Congress that assures that everyone is covered by private health insurance. every day. no matter what. and its the only plan that attacks the core problem. Insurance and medical costs are rising through the roof. Those costs rob working people of their wages and increases in wages and businesses of their competitiveness. and for many good people it has meant personal bankruptoy. Were debating health care reform tonight because Bill Clinton had the courage to tackle the issue for more than a decade. The leaders of this country through two administrations did nothing while the insurance crisis worsened. I come to this health care debate as a cancer survivor. I have seen the best in our health care system. and it saved my life. But I also saw the enormous costs. I dont begrudge the doctors and the doctors their fees. but imagine if my family had to face those tens of thousands of dollars of bills without insurance. What if I had been between Jobs? What if I had worked for a small business that couldnt afford Insurance? The Clinton health care plan includes the essential elements of reform. Expanding the pool of the insured will control costs. Guaranteeing universal coverage ends cost shifting. Emphasizing preventive care lowers costs. Our experience teaches us that these methods will work. and we dare not falter before this challenge.",

This convention. which entered into force in 1979. provides a forum for multilateral scientific cooperation with respect to the fisheries of the North Atlantic and for the conservation and management of fish stocks that occur outside national zones of fisheries jurisdiction. Prior to NAFO and the 200mile limit. the United States and other nations that fished in the Northwest Atlantic were party to ICNAFthe International Convention on Northwest Atlantic Fisherieswhich set quotas for shared fisheries that occurred beyond 3 miles. With the extension of coastal State jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore. ICNAF became obsolete and NAFO was created to manage those fisheries occurring outside these 200 mile zones. The United States was very active in the negotiations that led to the development of the NAFO Convention and since that time. has participated as an observer at NAFO meetings. While we ratified the convention in 1983. we never acceded to it. pending the enactment of implementing legislation. Ten years later. this has still not occurred. The time has come for the United States to do the right thing and join NAFO. We live in a world growing steadily smaller. where activities in the waters off of our coasts have the potential to impact resources of concern to other nations. Environmental problems and solutions cross national boundaries. The United States and all coastal States have a responsibility to participate in international organizations such as NAFO that provide responsible management and conservation for shared resources on the high seas. While U.S. boats have not fished regularly in the NAFO regulatory area in recent years. they have belore and may elect to do so again. In fact. two U.S. boats were spotted there last month.

Frankly. the Republicans offered an alternative today and had the full support of almost every single Republican. As I remember it. two Senators voted against it. It made the Republican case for real substantial entitlement cuts and for a moving toward a balanced budget in a realistic way. Senator Lorr was there in the forefront supporting that. I believe what he is doing in his amendment should in no way detract from the fact that there is no stronger supporter for defense than Senator TRENT LOTT in this body. Whatever the interpretation of his amendment. it is because of the nuances and peculiarities of budget processes. The truth of the matter is that he clearly intends to reduce the deficit more than was done in the Budget Committee. and he intends to do it in a way which he feels very comfortable with in spite of his very strng feelings with reference to defense. It just happens that there are interpretations indicating that some of the things he hopes to do will not be mandated on this body. but will be there as clear intentions and clear guideposts. So I commend him for his effort. I am very hopeful that we can do something very specific before we are finished with reference to defense if. in fact. we have to. Once again. I commend the Senator from Mississippi for his efforts here on the floor. The amendment. which takes an amendment which I intend to offer and incorporates it in his. is a good amendment. a solid amendment. The other Republicans speaking to it have so indicated. and I laud him for it.",

As several of my colleagues have already said. this budget resolution contains few surprises. However. I have a few concerns about the direction that the debate on this bill may take. DEFENSE First. I am deeply worried about the continuing decline in defense budgets. Given the recent events in North Korea. I think we need to be especially cautious. I would like to remind my colleagues that there are still potential. serious shortfalls in the defense budget. My colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have already raised the red flag regarding unrealistic future inflation estimates for this particular budget. I also remain concerned about potential shortfalls regarding bottomup review requirements. I have seen widely varying estimates. but they are all in the billions of dollars. I think we are harming military readiness with continued budget cuts. Let us put this in perspective: If we continue on our current course. entitlement spending will have increased by almost 40 percent between 1990 and 1999. domestic discretionary spending will have increased by 12 percent over that same time period. but defense spending will have decreased by 35 percent. Therefore. I cannot support amendments to this bill that will make further cuts in our defense budget. As much as I support increasing funding for IDEA. as set forth in the JeffordsDodd amendment. I Just cannot support cutting defense further to accomplish this. I am pleased that the President promised Americans that he will not try to accelerate cuts in the defense budget. In my opinion. defense has already taken more than its fair share of cuts.",

But that motion to recommit is losing. even though 250 Members voted to instruct the conferees earlier this week. So it shows nothing changes. You can vote both ways most of the time. I would just suggest that the majority leader is accurate In what he said. This can be remedied very quickly if we arrange to put the Helms amendment back Into the Goals 2000 bill. We would not be in this predicament now if they kept the amendment in conference. which passed the Senate by a vote of 3 to 170 some to 20 some. Therein lies the problem. The Senator from North Carolina feels very strongly about it. The Senator from Massachusetts . the manager of the bill. voted for the amendment. It had broad bipartisan support. and it was the hope of the Senator from North Carolina and others who supported the amendment that that would be part of the conferonco report. Had it been part of the conference report. then we would not have the dilemma which faces all of us now. as we near a recess. So I understand the Senator from North Carolina will request that the report be read. and I will check with my colleagues with reference to the socalled buyout bill so I can convey that information to the majority leader at the earliest possible time because. as always happens at recess time. some people make plans to leave and sometimes they are interrupted.

There was the amendment of Senator HELMS. of Senator DANFORTH. and of Senator LEVIN. Coming back from the conference. in the conference report are the following words: No funds authorized to be appropriated under this act may be used by any State or local educational agency to adopt policies that prevent voluntary prayer and meditation in public schools. I believe that we have carried basically the sense expressed in the Senate. We did that in a conference with the House of Representatives. and this has been the language which has been included in appropriations bills since 1982 and has been effective in dealing with this issue. They have been in since 1982. and it has not been challenged. Here we have an extremely important education bill that has passed overwhelmingly In the House and here with bipartisan support. and we have appropriations that are dependent upon action to be taken prior to next week.

And I reiterate. it is a donothing amendment. and it was intended to be one of these \"CMF\" amendments. meaning \"cover my fanny.\" Now. my staff person informed me that he stayed at the meeting. but conferees themselves never discussed school prayer that night and the meeting was continued to Wednesday.

They are telling us that there was an increase of violent strikes in the 1980s. when in reality there were fewer violent strikes in that decade that in any other since the 1938 Mackay decision. They are telling us that in the 1980s the right to strike eroded severely. They say that the use of permanent replacements escalated dramatically in the 1980s. and that employers use permanent replacements to bust unions. Wrong on both counts. Mr. Speaker. the fact of the matter is that labor unions are losing membership. popularity. and political clout. They have come to this body with a desperate plea to restore their viability with H.R. 5. American laborers are choosing not to join these unions. and this body has no responsibility nor right to mandate their popularity and power. Mr. Speaker. we must not involve ourselves in such a desperate grab for power. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on H.R. 5.",

Mr. Speaker. an important question before the Congress is whether we should enact campaign finance reform to reduce the excessive influence of special interest lobbyists. Consider for a moment that all three Presidential candidates during the last election recognized that special interest lobbyists. with their millions of dollars in campaign contributions. were deciding too often what ends up in legislation and in appropriations. Today I am introducing a bill. cosponsored by many of my colleagues. that will limit PAC contributions to $1.000 per candidate per electionand will limit the PAC money to the amount that can be raised by individual contributions from within a congressional candidates own district. There should be no question as to whom a congressperson owes their allegiance. In the 1992 elections. PACs were estimated to have contributed over $160 million to congressional candidates. Mr. Speaker. I am convinced that when a congressmans time is limited. preference is given to the special interest lobbyists that make contributions to the campaign over those who did not contribute. That preference results in undue influence. Those that \"bend the ear\" for a congressperson bend the legislation. It is time to either ban PAC contributions or limit their contributions to $1.000 per electionthe same as an average citizen can give. We should also impose limits. as called for in this legislation. on the percentage of money a candidate can receive from PACs. Mr. Speaker. many of my freshmen colleagues stand ready to support a strong campaign finance reform measure. that will reduce the undue influence of political action committees and lobbyists. The American people clearly have the perception that most politicians in Washington are bought and paid for. and we must end that perception by having real campaign finance reform.",

I had the honor of meeting with the Under Secretary General of the United Nations. Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed. I would like to commend Ambassador Reed for his fine and dedicated service at the United Nations. His exemplary commitment to the international community deserves to be recognized. He is a public servant worthy of great praise. Ambassador Reed has served as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council during the Reagan Administration. and was Under Secretary General of the U.N. for Political and General Assembly Affairs under Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. While serving at his current post at the United Nations. Ambassador Reed traveled to Kuwait to coordinate United Nations efforts to slow the adverse effects of the oil well fires set during the Persian Gulf war. He also represented SecretaryGeneral Boutros BoutrosGahali at a U.N. Conference on the Disabled. He has devoted a lifetime of skill an energy to the public he serves. There are many things I could say about Ambassador Joseph Reed. but I would add that Ambassador Reed has become a personal friend of mine. What Is unique about him is that he has made a point to know more African leaders and more about Africa than most people in our Government. He arranged for Western African Ambassadors to the United Nations to meet with the congressional delegates to the United Nations. At this meeting. it was apparent the affection and esteem these leaders hold for Joseph Reed. He maintains his relationships with African leaders as a volunteerhe does what more of us should dol He has developed expertise in an area of the world and he pursues it. I very much admire that and pay tribute to Ambassador Joseph Reed. Mr. President. in recognition of Ambassador Reeds dedication. skill. and hard work at the United Nations. I ask unanimous consent that the transcript from Ambassador Reeds address to the United Nations at the EnglishSpeaking Union be printed In the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. I urge all my colleagues to take a moment to read Ambassador Reeds address. His lifelong dedication to international service is evident in his eloquence.",

HHS did go forward with the banks last fall. and I understood that plans were for five banks to be funded for a 2year period.

In a 10 billiondollar budget for NIH. though. I think they ought to be able to find the funds. I will talk to the appropriators about this. if necessary. Frankly. I was disturbed that NIH chose to spread out the funding among five projects. most of which are not institutions with large obstetrical services or in the more highly populated areas of the United States.

It is my understanding that that amount for fiscal year 1993 would be about $1.1 billion. The discretionary fund would be comprised of up to 25 percent of any new funding above that amount. For example. in fiscal year 1994. if we appropriate $100 million above fiscal year 1993 current services. up to $25 million would be available for the OARs discretionary fund. The commitment base. in contrast. is used to gauge the amount of funds over which the OAR Director would have oversight and coordination authority. leaving the Institute Directors with the authority to actually make the grants.

Summary Report. from the Office of Research on Womens Health: Half of all women but only 31 percent of men who have heart attacks die within a year. Approximately 90 percent of all heart disease deaths among women occur after menopause. Osteoporosis affects over 24 million Americans. primarily women. It affects onethird to onehalf of all postmenopausal women. and the rates for osteoporosis increase dramatically with age. ranging from 17 percent for women ages 45 to 49. to 90 percent for 75 years of age or over. with all the accompanying complications of bone fractures and postural difficulties. We find that 90 percent of individuals with lupus are women. There are also important differences between the rates of disease among black women. white women. and Hispanic women. Death from stroke occurs twice as often in black women as in white women. Rates of death from coronary disease are higher for black women than for white women172 versus 106 per 100.000. The incidence of breast cancer is lower for black women than for white women. but death rates from breast cancer are higher for black women than white. Rates for lung cancer are higher for white women than for black women. And the incidence of cervical cancer is twice for Hispanic women when compared to nonHispanic women. Death due to stomach cancer is twice as high for Hispanics as for nonHispanics. The incidence of these various health disorders comes at a predictable time for women. The time for understanding why these differences occur and how these diseases can be treated is due. certainly. overdue.

Earth Day has become a traditiona tremendously popular occasion for Americans to focus on conservation and environmental protection. Regrettably. few citizensespecially millions of younger Americans who are the most enthusiastic observers of Earth Dayare aware of the origins of this annual event. It was our beloved former colleague. Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. who originated the concept for Earth Day and championed it into reality. In September 1969. Senator Nelson set forth his vision for Earth Day in a speech in Seattle. His call for a national environmental teachin to be held the following spring was met with an overwhelming grassroots response. Telegrams and phone calls poured into Senator Nelsons office. and his staff set about organizing and orchestrating the first Earth Day on April 22. 1970. That inaugural Earth Day captured the attention and imagination of the entire country. and the popularity of this annual event has been sustained for 25 years now. Of course. Senators of a certain age know that Earth Day was but one facet of Gaylord Nelsons careerlong commitment to environmentalism. As Governor of Wisconsin from 1959 to 1963. he initiated the Outdoor Recreation Acquisition Programusing revenue from a pennyapack on cigarettes to purchase 1 million acres of recreation and wildlife areas. As U.S. Senator from 1962 to 1980. cosponsored the 1964 Wilderness Act. authored legislation to preserve the 2.000mile Appalachian Trail. and introduced the first bills to control strip mining. mandate fuel efficiency standards. and ban DDT. Today. this Army veteran of the Okinawa campaign in World War II. is counselor of The Wilderness Societythe position he has held since 1981. His passion for environmental protection remains strong. and his list of victories grows longer by the year. Mr. President. our friend Gaylord Nelsons work is hardly finished. However. he is a man who has already made his mark on our national life.

On that fateful day. his plane was shot down off the coast of Bodo. Norway. He and his crewman. Stephen Bakran. remained with the aircraft in 160 feet of water until the summer of 1990. when members of a local scuba diving club found them.

He attended Louisiana College in Pineville and was commissioned on his 21st birthday in 1941. His background and circumstances were representative of those of millions and millions of other young people at that time who faced the terror of fighting In a global war. But it is during perilous times like this that the most ordinary of citizens show extraordinary courage and conviction. So it was with Lieutenant Tucker. he never expected more than he received. yet always gave more than was expected.

Second. to take us back to where these districts come from. to the actions of this body. the Congress of the United States. the predicate for. the reason for the language from which these districts were created. Third. to say a word about the extraordinary success of the statute we passed in 1965 and amended in 1982. precisely to get the results we have gotten in the drawing of these new districts. The statute is the most successful of the civil rights statutes. with the possible exception of the public accommodations statute. That was the easiest of them all. and no one can say that affording equal right to the ballot for people of color in this country was easy as public accommodations after the statute turned out to be. First. let me say why these districts are in the best interests not only of their constituents. but of the country. As I go out into the black community and hear and read the views and the opinions of blacks. I am disturbed by the degree of alienation that is there in the black community. the sense. even after all the progress. that this is not a fair country. It is very disturbing. You see it everywhere.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the use of redistricting as a means of promoting racial equality and fulfilling the goals of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As you know. the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was constructed as a broad piece of legislation to dismantle all votingrelated discrimination practices. For the past three decades. the courts have consistently. and with few exceptions. reaffirmed the provisions of this Act. It is fitting that we recognize the contribution of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the use of redistricting as a means to realize the goals of the act in a time when the concept of equality in representation is now under judicial attack. Too many Americans have fought too long and too hard to relinquish the constitutional rights we have fought to realize. Mr. Speaker. during the long and distinguished history of this Nation. there are few conceptions of democracy more sacred than the concept of representative government. The intellect and wisdom of the Founding Fathers who enshrined this concept as the central pillar of our democracy is what makes this Nation one of the greatest ever created. Yet. even with the intellectual commitment to promote representative government. this Nation has failed to live up to its potential because of the historic and entrenched practice of excluding minorities from being fully represented. We are all aware of the antidemocratic practice of excluding minorities from participating in representative government. The U.S. Congress has distinguished itself by playing a key role in the past by passing legislation designed to protect the civil rights of all citizens. The recent attacks on the use of redistricting by the U.S. courts is shocking. Redistricting is one of the most important means of correcting the lingering and virulent legacy of the exclusion of minorities from the benefits of representative government. Mr. Speaker. it is clear that the Voting Rights Act expressed a preference for creating districts where minorities have a realistic opportunity to be elected. Redistricting that is sensitive to the essential government interest of racial equality is consistent with the constitution and representative democracy for America.",

I announced that I would not accept the costoflivingadjustment [COLA] provided to Members of Congress elected to the 103d Congress that went into effect January 1. 1993. I state that instead of accepting the pay raise. I would donate the amount of that COLA to individual volunteers in my congressional district. In the past. I also gave away any increases in salary effective during a sitting Congress. I believe salary increases should only take effect after an intervening election. I donated those increases to local organizations in support of literacy programs. home heating assistance and for other charitable purposes. Even though the 1993 COLA was announced before the 1992 election and took effect afterward. I did not think the 102d Congress. as a whole. earned a salary increase. I contacted the House Sergeant at Arms and was informed. however. that I was required to accept the salary increase. I also explored the option of returning the funds to the Department of the Treasury. There was no guarantee that it would be used to reduce the deficit and as long as we have a deficit. it certainly could not be counted toward retirement of the national debt. Therefore. any amount returned to the Department of the Treasury would simply go into the general fund. and quite possibly would be spent in another Members congressional district. Consequently. I decided to donate the COLA to people in my own congressional distdct. I chose to give the money to individual volunteers who truly make a difference in the lives of those in need. I requested nominations for deserving individuals and was very heartened by the tremendous response I received. There are many fine individuals in the 19th district whose compassionate deeds often go unnoticed and this was one way to provide a degree of recognition to these caring and committed individuals. As of the end of July 1994. I had exceeded the amount I had pledged to give for the 103d Congress. I have sent checks to 66 individuals. charitable organizations or charitable causes in the 19th Congressional District.

Fred Georges. who emigrated to the United States as a youngster. taught me about my cultural heritage as I grew up in Connecticut. Thanks to him and my relatives. I learned how to speak the Assyrian language. a form of Aramaic which scholars call \"neoSyriac.\" and absorbed the history of my people. I came to appreciate the richness of Assyrian culture. as well as the lives Assyrians led in Iran. Iraq. Syria. and Lebanon. Assyrian immigrants have come to the United States in search of a better life and have made their homes and have established businesses in New York. Illinois. Michigan. California. and Connecticut. AssyrianAmericans are hard working. patriotic citizens who have created a supportive organizational network for themselves while making major contributions to the communities in which they live. Many. like my father. are successful small businesspeople. I pay special tribute to Adam Benjamin. the first AssyrianAmerican Member of Congress. who represented Gary. Indiana for many years after having worked as an Assyrian community leader in the 1950s and 1960s. most notably as the editor of the Assyrian Star. the official publication of the Assyrian American National Federation. The federation for which Rep. Benjamin worked was established in 1933 to create unity among Assyrians. preserve their heritage. and represent them in the United States.

H.R. 1025 provides for a 5day waiting period for prospective handgun purchasers. which will remain in place until such time as a national instant check on firearms purchasers is certified by the Attorney General. While I believe that H.R. 1025 is motivated by an understandable desire to keep handguns out of the bands of criminals. I have grave doubts about whether the bill achieves that purpose at all. and most serious. whether it infringes on the rights of lawabiding citizens. It is important to be realistic about the nature of acquiring handguns in this country. The main market for the purchase and sale of such weapons is the illicit market. That is.fact. plain and simple. We are deluding ourselves and the citizens of this country if we attempt to paint this bill as the answer to violent crime or even to the proliferation of handguns. I cannot support the legislation in its present form. For a number of years. the legislation has been considered by its proponents as akin to \"Biblical text.\" That is not my view. and I believe that it would be wise to keep an open mind throughout this debate about the three reasonable amendments being offered if there is a true wish to move the bill to the Presidents desk. But. if the goal here is simply to hoist up a banner for gun control in order to keep an issue alive. then we can continue to debate the bill endlessly for years to come. If the House accepts these simpleyet critically importantamendments. I think there might well be wide support for the legislation. I. for one. would reconsider my position. but only if lawabiding citizens are treated with respect and accorded fundamental due process. One such amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Minnesota would merely allow a prospective firearm purchaser to inquire as to why he or she was denied that rightby requiring the law enforcement official to provide the reasons for the denial if asked for those reasons. I am happy to report that there appears to be an agreement on both sides to accept this amendment. I certainly hope so. Another reasonable amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Florida.",

Just a bit. A third amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania would sunset the 5day waiting period after 5 years. This amendment would create a time certain for implementation of the national instant background check in the bill. Acceptance of this amendment is proof positive that there is a real commitment to implement the instant background check in H.R. 1025. While the national instant check system is touted as a central premise of the bill in its current form. it is a premise with no teeth at all. In conclusion. the Brady bill is no panacea for the scourge of violent crime in America. It may make a very modest contribution. however. if it targets with specificity that group of dangerous individuals who are the real problemthe criminal elements of our society.

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1025. the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act. The Brady bill is s vital part of the overall crime prevention package. My home State of Maryland has a mandatory 7day waiting period on the purchase of handguns. Since 1966. when the waiting period was implemented. over 16.000 handgun purchases have been disapproved. On average. 1 to 2 percent of all gun purchase attempts in Maryland are denied because the potential purchaser has a criminal record. For example. from January 1. 1993. through September 30. 1993. 24.704 people had applied to buy a gun and 264 of those people were disapproved. Clearly. this Maryland law has been very successful. A mandatory waiting period on a national level would be successful as well and dramatically increase the effectiveness of local efforts like those made in Maryland. A large number of criminals do buy their guns from gun stores. A Bureau of Justice study found that 27 percent of State inmates purchased their guns from retail stores. An additional 28 percent of the State Inmates got their handguns from the black market. a drug dealer. or a fence. Gun traces have shown that many of the guns that are being sold on the black market are originally purchased in gun stores In States that do not have waiting periods and/or background checks. A national mandatory waiting period would stop crossState purchases. Presently. many teenagers obtain guns through straw purchasers who cross State lines. Earlier this year the National Education Association estimated that more than 135.000 children bring guns to school every day. The growing impact of gun violence on our young people Is devastating. A national waiting period on handgun purchases would help curtail the proliferation of weapons among the young In our society. I am an original cosponsor of the Brady bill and a strong advocate of curbing the use. illegal use. of guns in our society. Since the Brady bill was Introduced in 1987. over 150.000 Americans have died In incidents involving handguns. It Is time to reduce the avenues through which criminals can obtain handguns. I urge my colleagues to follow the example of Maryland and Impose a national waiting period on the purchase of a handgun.",

The most disturbing irony of the \"Brady bill\" is that it would not have prevented John Hinckley from purchasing the gun he used in the heinous crime against President Reagan and Jim Brady. We have seen time and time again States enact waiting periods expecting violent crime and homicides to go away. In almost every instance. the homicide and violent crime rates increased. In my home State of Illinois. we witnessed an increase of 31 percent in violent crime and a 36 percent jump in our homicide rate. Alabama witnessed a 51percent explosion in their violent crime rate and Massachusetts was helpless as the waiting period led to a 40percent jump in the homicide rate. The way to control gun violence is to send a message to criminals that if they do the crime. they do the time. We need to pass increased mandatory minimum sentences for criminals who use guns to commit crimes. We need to enact a comprehensive crime proposal sooner rather than later.

Mr. Chairman. in 1991 handguns killed 22 people in Great Britain and 12.000 people in the United States. so it does not take a rocket scientist to acknowledge that there is a problem of epidemic proportions that needs to be addressed. Those opposed to the Brady bill will simply recommend stiffer sentences for those involved in gun crimes. I feel compelled to challenge my colleagues to take a more preventive approach. We are faced with a choice of preventing violent crime before it occurs or reacting to crime after someone has already been raped. robbed. or murdered. Mr. Speaker. the Brady bill will not end all crime or prevent all criminals from getting firearms. but it is one step toward stemming the tide of handgun violence. Despite the theories by some in this body. convicted felons do attempt to purchase firearms. Hundreds have been stopped in California. and in Virginia we have denied over 5.000 requests of firearm purchasers who have been convicted of crimes. Mr. Chairman. in addition. 319 persons who were wanted on crimes were attempting to buy firearms. so for anyone that says that the Brady bill is not effective.

This amendment gives both the same treatment. 3 years of funding. and after all. the bill is only a 2year commitment with a sunset. so it really does not matter whether it is 3 years or 5 years. but they all ought to be the same. The other provision this amendment seeks to change is to make the costsharing provision in the bill real. Right now the costsharing only applies to partnerships but to no one else. This means the Federal Government would fund everything for everyone else except partnerships. which must fund half of their jobs. The costsharing should apply equally to anyone getting taxpayer funding under this new subsidy program.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. during deliberations by the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology on H.R. 3870. an amendment was offered in the committee which potentially. and I think unintentionally. attempts to use or possibly use defense dollars for use in nondefense research and development activities. The committee accepted this amendment with brief explanation. and following the markup. it was realized the actual language of the amendment went further than was understood. and it is for that reason that I offer this amendment. As I said. it potentially. and I think unintentionally. would allow for the above. What it does. this amendment directs that the environmental management funds that are authorized in title IV of the bill will be funded out of the nondefense funds appropriated to the environmental management program. As amended in committee. the language in the bill provides for the funds to come from any research and development funds in the environmental management budget. including defense funds which are authorized by the House Committee on Armed Services. not the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology. I would like to add we have talked with the Committee on Armed Services. who have been cooperative and supportive in the development of the original language. So the provisions in title IV. in summary. in fact reinstate funds to a civilian research and development program in the environmental management area to address those remediations at the DOE. civilian laboratories among other things. The action taken in this amendment to amend what was done in committee I think is in full letter and spirit of the gentlemans amendment. What this does is direct that nondefense research and development funds will be taken from nondefense environmental management programs. all within existing funds as the gentleman wanted to establish in the committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Tanner amendment. During the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology markup. I agreed with my colleagues amendment based on his explanation of its intent. However. upon further reflection after the committees deliberations. I found two points of the language highly objectionable. First. this language would give legislative stature to the administrations budget request. This precedence is unheard of. and I believe most Members will find this objectionable. as well. It also implies that the administration budget request for research and development in the Environmental Management Program would be granted in order to accommodate the authorizations in the bill. Again. such a precedent should not be made. This particular part of the language was never discussed or brought to light in the explanation in markup. Second. as I am also a member of the Armed Services Committee. I share Mr. TANNERS concern regarding the use of defense funds to pay for civilian programs. In the Armed Services Committee authorization. I was very disappointed that we could not accommodate the Environmental Management Program with the full budget request. but in todays budgetary climate. sacrifices must be made. But I certainly cannot condone taking more of that money to use on the civilian side when the civilian portion of the program was already fully funded. This too is a precedent. As a member of both committees. I have always been careful not to cross over the line between civilian and defense funding. Mr. TANNER has offered us a thoughtful solution to this problem by emphatically stating that civilian programs will be funded from civilian funds. and I urge Members to support it. Vote \"yes\" on the Tanner amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 3870. the Environmental Technologies Act. I offer this amendment today in the interest of fiscal responsibility and commonsense budgeting. In this body. we often speak of the need to tighten our belts. reduce spending. and set priorities. We now have the opportunity to make our actions match our words. The amendment I am offering would reduce the authorization from the administration requested and committeeapproved level of $80 million for fiscal 1995 and $120 million for fiscal year 1996 to $65 million for both fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996. This reduction in the authorization of H.R. 3870 is not an effort to make an arbitrary spending cut. The $65 million figure is a very significant figure because it is the amount that was provided for the environmental technology initiative in the Housepassed fiscal year 1995 Environmental Protection Agency appropriation. My amendment would simply bring the authorization down to the level of the fiscal year 1995 appropriation and maintain that same level through fiscal year 1996. Frankly. I find it absurd that we are considering the authorization after the appropriation has already been approved. but I believe the least we can do at this point is conform the authorization with the appropriation. This reduction in authorization would not endanger the goal of advancement of environmental technologies provided for by Environmental Technologies Act [ETA]. In fact. the programs established in the ETA largely duplicate programs already extant. including the Advanced Technology Program at the Department of Commerce. the Technology Reinvestment Program at the Department of Defense. and the technology transfer initiative at the Department of Energy. These three competing programs already total $1.35 billion in the Presidents fiscal year 1995 budget. If we truly believe that the Governments advanced technologies programs should have an environmental component. that is a policy decision to be made by the administration. but Congress should be the final judge of the cost. In my view an authorization of $130 million through fiscal year 1996 for the programs in the ETA is enough new spending for this purpose. I would also add that the respected National Taxpayers Union has expressed its unqualified support for this amendment and urges its passage. I ask for your vote in favor of the Linder amendment to H.R. 3870 and demonstrate your support for responsible spending and for budget integrity.",

The argument that the gentleman uses is that the House appropriation is currently at the $55 million level. What he neglects to say is that the Senate appropriation is at a slightly higher level of $70 million. That is the figure which I have inserted. I would. frankly. prefer that we keep the $80 million figure. because there is no expectation that the appropriators will appropriate up to the last dollar of what is authorized. I think it is a waste of our time. as authorizers. normally. to try and guess what the Senate and the House will come up to in conference. But in the spirit of comity here.

It seems to me that to have a figure of $80 million for fiscal year 1996. that would approximate the Presidential request for this year and would make a very good compromise. We would then have $70 million the first year. and we would have $80 million in the second year. which amounts to more than a 10percent increase and does follow the figure that was sent to the Hill by the administration earlier this year.

My bill would do this by extending by 2 years the current 3year slatute of limitations for professional liability claims filed by the RTC against the former directors and executive officers of failed S&Ls. Professional liability cases are brought by the RTC against individuals whose negligence or fraud caused the failure of the institution. The RTCs professional liability section needs this extra time to cope with their extraordinarily heavy workload and the disruplion of a recent organizational restrucluring. The RTC has had to take over 721 institutions. All of these failures must be examined for potential fraud. for the RTC estimates thal there was fraud or negligence in 75 percent of thrift failures. And the current statute is beginning to run out on many of these ailed thrifts. Last year alone it expired for over 300 institutions. It will run out on an additional 213 failures this year. 141 next year. and at least 33 in 1994. The regulators duties have been complicated by a recent reorganization. The GAO reported to the Senate Banking Committee that the RTC professional liability section lost 40 percent of its attorneys and that many of the replacements had lille or no experience in this highly lechnical field. This reorganization also disrupled the investigation of a number of cases being pursued at ihe time. Despite the heavy workload and staffing disruptions. the RTC has already collected $97.6 million from professional liability claims and settlements. By May of 1992. ihe RTC had claims pending for over $4.5 billionand the bulk of the lawsuits have yet to come. My bill is similar to bills introduced last year by Senator Wirth and Congressman Levine. A weaker version of Senator Wirths bill passed the Senate by bipartisan majorities four times but was dropped in conference. Both the RTC and the oulgoing Bush administration registered support for extending the statute.

The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act [PACA]. was enacted In 1930 to promote fair trading in the fruit and vegetable industry by requiring buyers and sellers of fresh and frozen produce to honor the terms of their contracts. The measure I have introduced will allow federated cooperatives as being exempt from fines levied by the Department of Agriculture as a result of misbranding and misrepresentation by an affiliated or member packing house. Marketing cooperatives. like brokers. should not be subject to fines because of misbranding or misrepresentations made by an affiliated or member packinghouse. They do not have the knowledge of misrepresentation and lack the ability to correct these mistakes and therefore should not be punished. In August of 1988 Congress established an Industry Advisory Committee to review the PACA Program and propose ways to enhance its efficiency and equity. The committee was composed of representatives from most major segments of the produce industry. The committee met five times and submitted its final report to Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture on May 1. 1990. The committee thoroughly reviewed the PACA Program and suggested a number of actions. Included in the committee recommendations was to limit misbranding liability to licensees that could have knowledge of a product misrepresentation and the ability to correct it. This bill is an attempt to honor the committees recommendation and remove the federated cooperatives from liability for the violations of others whom they have no control and. in my view. improve the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act.

Most of us would assume that the process is as lamentable as it is inevitable. Historical processes do not make small traditional societies disappear. Greed and a lack of understanding. however. do. Such groups are weak and tempting targets to the development programs that they are presumed to hinder or in the name of states that they are assumed to subvert. There is no reason. however. that indigenous and tribal peoples cannot survive. both physically and culturally. the rapid changes that contact with expanding industrial societies and economic and political institutions brings. Seen as impediments to progress and development. small societies throughout the world are tacing extinction. Those that survive are often decimated by diseases introduced by outsiders and denied a political voice. Usually deprived of their lands and means of livelihood. they are forced to adapt to a national society whose language they do not speak.

As some of you may recall. I introduced identical legislation last Congress. This legislation was prompted by the fact that under current law. local jurisdictions are required to fund special censuses. even if an undercount is the result of a disaster. In the fall of 1989. the devastating Loma Prieta Earthquake struck and did extensive damage to areas in my district. The earthquake caused millions of dollars of damage and cost many lives. In addition to the physical harm done. a good number of people were displaced as a result of this disaster. Some earthquake victims remain homeless today. Because of the displacement that occurred as a result of the Loma Prieta Earthquake. the city of Watsonville was significantly undercounted in the 1990 decennial census. They have repeatedly requested that the numbers be adjusted to reflect the true number of people residing in the city of Watsonville. But. the Bureau of the Census claimed that they could not make this adjustment. but rather than a special census would be necessary. The city of Watsonville and many other localities cannot afford to fund a special census in addition to the financial burden that they are carrying as a result of the earthquake. The legislation I am introducing is designed to ensure a fairer arrangement for jurisdictions that have been undercounted as a result of a disaster. It frankly doesnt make sense to require local and State jurisdictions to pay for special censuses when the undercount was through no fault of their own. Our Constitution requires that a census be taken every 10 years. The census is required to count every person living in the United States. and it is the constitutional obligation of the Federal Government to pay for special censuses when a disaster results in a significant undercount.",

Briefly. 271.000 acres were eliminated for offroad vehicle use. utilities. and mining. In addition. all known active mines were eliminated from any wilderness area. Specific concerns of the utilities were resolved. Language was included to provide a land exchange provision for two of the largest private landowners in the desert. the California State Lands Commission. and the Catellus Corp. Grazing in the Mojave National Monument was allowed for up to 25 years. and three proposed wilderness areas. totaling 160.000 acres near Fort Irwin. were kept in study status pending expansion proposals from the Defense Department. The bill I introduced today is substantially the same bill which passed the House of Representatives In the 102d Congress. It designates 73 areas containing 4.3 million acres of land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management as wilderness. It also redesignates the Joshua Tree National Monument and the Death Valley National Monument as national parks. Further. the bill makes some additions to each of these parks and designates wilderness within them. Finally. the bill transfers jurisdiction of 1.5 million acres of BLM land to the Park Service to become the Mojave National Monument. Protection of the desert can no longer wait. This is a piece of legislation whose time has come. and I look forward to expeditious passage of this bill.",

I must vote to preserve the integrity of our democratic processes. If this were a perfect world. Federal employees would be accorded the political privileges belonging to the rest of society. However. the nature of certain Federal jobs in the real world and the lessons of history demand such privileges be balanced with the personal rights of coworkers and others. Our political process cannot afford the presence. inferred or actual. of the undue infiuence that comes with Federal jobs having significant investigatory powers. The very character of these valuable and important careers necessarily precludes their direct participation in campaigns and elections. A coworker or neighbor must never lear the use of information available to Federal officials as barter for their political allegiance. Furthermore. we should take a cue from opponents directly affected by this legislation. Employees of the Federal Elections Commission have asked to be exempted from this legislation recognizing for themselves the potential and damaging conflicts of interest which might arise were the Hatch Act summarily repealed. But. perhaps. what is most disturbing in the consideration of H.R. 20 is the imposition of a closed rule which. in this case. prevents the House from working its will in the best democratic fashion. The majoritys refusal to allow the consideration of amendments to H.R. 20 impedes our ability to secure political privileges for the greatest possible number of citizens.",

That is what I think the Presidents package tries to do. it tries to take action that will translate into a better living standard for every working American. And if you doubt the need. for Instance. for the stimulus package which the President is proposing. I think we need to understand that the job growth that we have had since this recession technically ended. the job growth has only been about onetenth of that of past recessions. creating about 400.000 to 500.000 jobs since the end of the recession rather than the 1 million jobs that have normally been created this far out of the technical end of a recession. So I just think that what the gentleman has pointed out is a clear picture of what has been happening to this country. I think the Presidents package has spelled out what we need to do to try to attack the basics. And frankly. I do not know why it Is considered in some quarters to be partisan. because the fact Is that these economic troubles really began to show up clearly in 1973. This has been a 20year problem that we are facing. It is certainly true that the problem was made much worse by the decisions that were made in the 1980s. But this is a longterm problem that transcends even those mistakes. And I think the gentleman in the well has clearly pointed out that fact. and I think the President has clearly pointed out what we have to do if we are going to correct the problem.",

I would finally state that I went to St. Louis. my hometown. with President Clinton on Thursday. and he gave a presentation in our Union Station to 15.000 to 20.000 people who had come to hear him talk about this plan. Afterward. I ran into people that I have known. many of them my whole life. some who are very conversant with a lot of the issues. who have followed the budget deliberations and other things here in the House. I was surprised and pleased. and I am sure the gentleman has had the same thing happen to him at home since the Presidents plan has been announced. that they came up to me and said. \"I sure hope Congress will get behind the Presidents plan and pass it.\" the spending cuts. the taxes even. some of them said to me. the health care reform which they feel so strongly about. the shortterm stimulus which they think is needed in a town where GM plants are still closing. and the like. But their point was that they did not want Congress to unravel this package. One of them said to me. \"Give the President a chance.\" This is what was said in 1981 when President Reagan had been elected and people said give him a chance. give the program a chance. And I might say that both Democrats and Republicans. I did not happen to be one of them. but many Democrats joined with the Republicans and passed that program. and it has had its chance. as the charts well indicate. Now I think all we are saying is we have a new President. we have a new Congress. He has come forward with a plan. It is not perfect in every respect from anybodys viewpoint. but if we all tear it apart. there is not going to be any plan. And I agree with my constituents. I think we ought to give it a chance. give him a chance. put it in place. give it 4 years. Let us see what it does.

For those who are attacking and saying. oh. my goodness. this is going to cost us something. this is going to cost too much to do. the fact is that I think that the proper way to evaluate this package is to compare the cost of this package against the cost of continuing the status quo. because we have seen in the 1980s what the cost of continuing the status quo is. It is much larger deficits. it is a much weaker economy. it is much lower family growth. I wish people understood that if we had simply had the same amount of productivity growth in this economy since 1973 that we had up to 1973 that each and every American family today would have $12.000 more in income than they do now. You could do a lot of things with that $12.000 income. The cost in comparison to the cost of doing nothing. the cost of this package is tiny. The economy under the Presidents plan is projected to grow by the cumulative amount of economic growth that will be created under the plan which is expected to exceed $5 trillion between now and 1998. and the Presidents program asks in additional contributions only about 6 percent of that amount. So I think that puts in perspective what the cost will be. that 6percent cost. in order to create that $5 trillionplus in economic growth. and it is hard to imagine what that number means. but in plain language. it simply means added dollars in families pockets all over this country if we can get the economy moving again at anywhere near an acceptable and sustained rate.",

I saw today that longterm interest rates on a 30year. fixed mortgage note went to below 8 percent for the first time since. I guess. they have been selling longterm Treasury notes. since the 1970s. the first time it has broken below 8 percent. What that means is that thousands and perhaps millions of middleincome families. young families. can go now and get a mortgage to buy a house who could not do that a few months ago. a few years ago. When they buy the house. they are going to buy furniture and appliances to go in the house. It is going to excite economic growth throughout our entire economy. just that one fact. if we can continue it and sustain it with the passage of this program. and making the cuts and putting the different changes in place -an keep those longterm interest rates coming down. I remember when I was a kid we had interest rates. longterm interest rates. of 3 percent. My dad had a 3percent note on our little bungalow in St. Louis.

I rise in support of this bill. and I want to commend my chairman for his leadership in authoring this legislation to address a serious problem for farmers. Though we all refer to a minor use pesticide problem. it is a major crisis for hundreds of thousands of agricultural producers around the country. The issue arises as an unintended side effect of EPAs reregistration of crop protective chemicals. The very expensive laboratory testing required by this process has caused manufacturers to voluntarily withdraw thousands of chemical formulations that were used to control pests on smaller crops. Since smaller crops in this context means most fruits and vegetables. many producers face the prospect of having no way to control pests that could devastate their crops. Consumers also are at risk because preventable insect and disease damage means significantly higher prices for apples and lettuce at the grocery store. This bill attempts to alleviate the problem by providing economic incentives for manufacturers to invest the necessary money to register chemicals for minor uses. We should emphasize that this bill in no way diminishes the safety standards that EPA imposes on pesticides. It merely attempts to address the economic barriers that have resulted from the reregistration process. This is a serious and difficult problem for both farmers and consumers. and we believe that Chairman DE LA GARZAs bill is an Important first step in resolving it. There are many other pesticide issues outstanding. including modernizing the Delaney clause and streamlining the pesticide cancellation process. I hope that next year Congress can move legislation on these larger issues. But for today. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 967. Mr. Speaker.

It was just reported out by the Committee on Agriculture last Friday. and it is now on the suspension calendar. But it is. as I understand it. a controversial piece of legislation. because it authorizes the continued use of potentially dangerous pesticides on the food that the public will eat. and may be especially harmful to children. In 1988. Congress passed legislation requiring EPA to review the health and safety of pesticides used on food. The legislation requires the pesticide manufacturers to submit health and safety data to EPA demonstrating the safety of the pesticide. If the data is not submitted. eventually the permission to use the pesticide may be withdrawn. In fact. it must be withdrawn. This bill carves a big loophole in that statutory scheme. It allows the pesticide for socalled minor use to remain on the market beyond the statutory deadline set by law in 1988. Minor uses are not so minor. They include products such as tomatoes and lettuce and many fruits and vegetables. and under this bill pesticides could be used for these products for years after these uses should be prohibited. Fruits and vegetables are the foods that kids eat the most. H.R. 967 provides that the manufacturers do not have to prove these pesticides to be safe. Instead. if the bill passes. the Congress will be unilaterally authorizing the continued use of these pesticides without the health or safety data. Now. the National Academy of Sciences last year found that children are not being protected from pesticides In the food. They are susceptible particularly to some of these pesticides that may be in the food. and I fear this bill would make the situation worse by allowing the continued use of pesticides that have not been proven safe.

Let me give you a couple of facts. Fruits and vegetables are categorized as minor crops by USDA. Children eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. and according to the 1993 National Academy of Sciences report. current pesticide tolerances are not safe enough for children. The pesticides at issue in this bill are admittedly dinosaurs. There is nothing in this bill to encourage development of newer. safer pesticides orGod forbidto encourage farmers to decrease their use of dangerous pesticides. Food safety issues are also the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. which has not had a chance to weigh in on this bill. The concerns of farmers who apply these pesticides should be addressed simultaneously with the concerns of the American public over unreasonable levels of dangerous pesticides in our childrens food.

I regret the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce has raised this concern. I do not think it is a real concern. As the chairman has indicated. this bill deals with economic incentives. We are not lowering standards. Nothing in the bill even refers to that. Let me point out to the gentleman and to my colleagues that on page 8 of the bill. specifically. if the Administrator determines that the registrant is not meeting the schedule for the production of such data. the Administrator may proceed in accordance with the appropriate section regarding the continued registration of the minor use and shall inform the public of such action. If during the extension period the Administrator has been furnished data which is sufficient to determine that an unreasonable adverse effect exists involving a minor use of a pesticide. the Administrator shall provide in writing to the registrant a notice of revoking the extension of time for submission of the data. There is a time limit of 30 days. We stress that this is not a safety concern. this is an economic incentive. so we can continue the production of fresh fruit and vegetables. That is all it is. Next year. when we get to the Delaney clause and FIFRA and streamlining the cancellation process. we will be happy to work with the chairman of the subcommittee. and we look forward to doing that.

It takes into account the risks of potential diseases that are controlled by the use of pesticides. We could be overrun by plagues of every kind. and some of these chemicals are used to do that. This bill takes that from another bill. So I wanted to assure my colleague. the gentleman from California that we have as cautiously. as studiously. and as positively as we can. tried to protect all of the areas he is interested in. that we are interested in. That has nothing to do with the areas he mentioned with the National Academy of Science. All this is. is a few items of incentives to the companies to continue to manufacture these items that are needed. We are the best fed people in the history of the world for the least amount of disposable income per family. and we want to keep it that way. We are the healthiest people in the world also.

As I understand this legislation. and I have not had a full opportunity to look at it because it just got out of the committee Friday. it is on the floor here on Monday. As I understand it. it would give additional time for some of these manufacturers to submit this data. It also gives them no incentive to submit the data if they do not have to do it under the deadlines and under the expectations of the existing 1988 law. That is disturbing to me. because if we do not have this data. the determination as to whether there is a health problem cannot be made. Meanwhile. the pesticide would stay on the market. I appreciate the gentleman feels very strongly otherwise. I understand his concern. but I hope he understands our concern. We have been hearing from environmental groups all day that this bill is on suspension. They do not feel it ought to be on suspension.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the path to comprehensive crop insurance reform and the reorganization of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been a long and. at times. difficult course. I would like to thank Chairman DE LA GARZA for his hard work and his willingness to listen to the minoritys ideas and concerns regarding the final shape of this legislative package. First. crop insurance. When the House Agriculture Committee completed action on a comprehensive reform of the Federal multiple peril crop insurance program. we were hopeful this legislation: Would establish a viable. reformed crop insurance program that provided agricultural producers an array of riskmanagement tools. Would forcefully meet the challenge of preventing future costly ad hoc disaster assistance legislation. Would save taxpayers roughly $400 million per year based on the annual average of recent ad hoc disaster assistance costs. and. Would address the immediate concerns regarding shortfalls in discretionary funding relative to the current program. We worked with Chairman DE LA GARZA in a bipartisan manner to amend this legislation to ensure that: It is fully funded and within the budget rules of the House. and. it makes additional cuts in the program where reasonable and appropriate. and in such a manner as not to destroy the viability of the reform package to meet its goals of preventing future disaster programs and providing usable risk management tools to farmers. We have worked with our colleagues in the other body. and have made the tough choices and necessary adjustments to the crop insurance reforms to meet these goals. Further. our committee has pledged to help devise the mechanisms to address future potential discretionary shortfalls. a pledge we have been very clear on from the beginning. By approving this legislation. we are ensuring availability of the Federal multiple peril crop insurance program for coverage of 1995 crops. While the package certainly is not all we had hoped for. Kansas wheat farmers already are putting the seed for next years crop in the ground. They need to know right now what tools will be available to manage the weather and other risks that too often threaten a crops success.",

Working nights to pay his way through undergraduate and law school. he graduated from the University of Illinois in 1930. That same year. he founded the firm that today bears the name Halfpenny. Hahn. Roche & Marchese. Harold retired in 1992. after 62 years of service to his fellow man. and the legal profession. Early on in his career Harold served the State of Illinois as assistant state treasurer. He was consistently active in civic. charitable. and political affairs in my hometown of Chicago and throughout the State of Illinois. He served on the board of directors for many organizations in the Chicago area and appeared before countless congressional committees as a spokesman for small and emerging businesses. In addition. he wrote numerous articles on the legal aspects of distribution. and the impact of State taxation of interstate commerce on small businesses. Harold led the effort to obtain congressional relief. through the passage of the Interstate Income Act of During Harolds long and distinguished career. he specialized in helping the backbone of our Nation. small and emerging businesses. He became a major force in helping to establish over 60 national. regional. and local trade associations. Harold won recognition as a leading legal authority in the automotive aftermarket industry. receiving the Industrys leadership award in 1975. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Citation from the Automotive Hall of Fame and was honored as a charter member of the WholesalerDistributor Hall of Fame in 1987. Harold was a rare individual. His dynamic drive. combined with his experience and sensitivity toward his neighbor was the hallmark of his career. Harolds death is a great loss to the legal community and to all who had the pleasure to meet him. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt prayers to Mary. his wife. and their three children. Tom. Mary Joan. and Richard.

The impetus for this legislation stems from the sad realization that 1993. which has been designated by the United Nations as the International Year of the Worlds Indigenous Peoples. is nearly gone. Yet. there has been no official recognition or acknowledgement by Congress of this proclamation or of its importance to advocacy for the rights of indigenous peoples. As a native Hawaiian. I know how issues related to indigenous peoples get relegated to the backburner in national and international priorities. Fortunately. the United Nations recognizes that the plight of indigenous peoples is an important issue and that international cooperation must be strengthened to address common problems in areas such as human rights. the environment. development. education. and health. The United States needs to recognize the plight of indigenous peoples as well. We often take an active role in global issues such as peace. world security. the environment. and human rights issues. The rights of the worlds indigenous peoples are no less important. As we reflect on the International Year of the Worlds Indigenous Peoples. I simply ask my colleagues to give equal energy to the rights of indigenous peoples as we give other important issues in our Nations domestic and foreign policies. My resolution urges the United States to play an active role in cooperating with indigenous peoples. the United Nations. and national governments to promote public awareness of and improve the political. social. and economic conditions of indigenous peoples. Public awareness can only be obtained through greater support and cooperation. One year is not a sufficient period of time to promote an awareness of the rights of indigenous peoples. For this reason. my resolution urges that the United States should continue to actively support the United Nations in its efforts to establish international standards on the rights of indigenous peoples and urges the United Nations to proclaim an International Decade on the Worlds Indigenous Peoples.

Critical vendors are those that must meet stringent quieting or Subsafe requirements or manufacture items unique to submarines. such as torpedo tubes. periscopes. and sonar bow domes. The hull for which shipyards are responsible is nothing more than a husk. a metallic shell into which the brains. sensors. and guts of a submarine are stuffed. Shipyard skills are transferable. Witness the eddy and flow of artisans between submarine and aircraft carrier work. The same is not true for critical subcontractors whose skills. technology. and tooling reflect the unique environment in which submarines operate. The essential core of these suppliers work only on submarines. and these are the vendors that we need to bridge to Centurion. Without them. Centurion will simply be a hole in the water.

Mr. Perot takes up the NAFTAs alleged effects on American trucking. real estate. communications. construction. banking. automobiles. and agriculture. Mr. Perot begins with trucking. Points out that Mexican law allows heavier trucks and younger drivers. he says that if NAFTA passes. behemoth trucks will pour into America. crush our highways. wreck our bridges. and ruin our tunnels. I am not sure just how the last catastrophe would happen. Maybe he means the road leviathans would get stuck. Mexico does allow heavier trucks and younger drivers in Mexico. -But under NAFTA. Mexican trucks in the United States must obey American laws. Those heavy trucks and young drivers cannot operate in the United States. Perot answers this by saying. well. violations of this law occur now. That may well be true. To some degree they do occur. But if so. the problem would not be with NAFTA and the problem would not be with current law. It may simply be a shortage of customs inspectors and highway patrolmen.

Properly managed and properly articulated. this program will be an inspiration to our young people. more of whom will become scientists. mathematicians. and engineers. which we desperately need in our economic struggles in the world. But I will tell you. there is another reason to vote for this and to continue it. that is both it is exciting and emotional. as far as I am concerned. and that is Stephen Hawking. the British theoretical physicist. who has what may be the best scientific mind in a millenium. trapped in a body wracked by disease. waging a desperate battle to finish his research before he is totally incapacitated. I am told that the results from experiments in the SSC. with 20 times the energy of the Fermi accelerator. may very well provide just the data he needs to finish his calculations. solving many of the mysteries of the universe. inspiring our young people. and placing our country in the forefront of technology and science.

As a country we must prioritize what we believe to be Important Investments for our future. We must live within our means. We must reduce and eliminate the Federal deficit. But at the same time. we must continue to plan and Invest In our future. The SSC is exactly that kind of investment. We do not have to look too far to begin to see some of the real benefits of investing In this new technology: SSC technologies are enhancing a cancer treatment known as photon beam therapy. SSC magnet technology Is being explored as a means of providing cheaper. cleaner and more efficient energy for cities. SSC technology Is being used to test prototype trains that levitate and travel at speeds up to 300 miles per hour. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Slattery amendment. Invest In our future.

The super collider not only represents the future of our scientific knowledge. it represents the future of our economy by providing highskilled jobs for our work force. There are those who point to the super collider as an easy budgetcutting target. but the super collider represented only .6 percent of all Federal research and development dollars in 1992 and continues to be only a small percentage of Federal research funding. This project means 15.000 jobs all over the country and should not be abandoned due to a temporary downturn in our economy. I ask my fellow Members to imagine where we would be if we had abandoned all of our major scientific ventures in the past because they appeared to be too expensive at the time. Think for a moment about all that has already been built and imagine it sitting useless. not realizing any of its potential while our understanding of the nature of matter and the origins of our universe stands still.

Our future in the trade world is in producing high tech products. and the way you produce high tech products is you do your homework. you do the research. and that is where the products come from. We cannot compete anymore in many of the basic industries. High tech is our future. research is the way to go. This is a computer chip. Right now it is todays technology. It is 1 million bits of storage on this little piece of silicon in the middle. This was produced because 12 years ago we were willing as a nation to fund the synchrotron. which is the predecessor to the SSC. We are about to announce the next generation of smaller and faster computer chips through xray lothography using the synchrotron. Clearly. the SSC is that next generation of device that will allow us to produce those products that we need in America to compete in the world. Research is the key to our future in the world of products. Please support the SSC. America needs it.",

Former President George Bush is for the SSC. I will put a letter in the RECORD. Congressman BOB LIVINGSTON is for the SSC. I will put my statement in the RECORD. But I would like to add that there are a couple of points to which I would like to speak today. There has been much talk about the costs. There has been a statement to the effect that not enough countries are coming through for this project. We have been trimming this project back since it started. No country in their right mind wants to come up with an upfront expenditure for their costs unless we demonstrate we are serious. And we are certainly not demonstrating we are serious in some of the debate today. Second. the gentleman from New York says that the project is expected to cost $11 billion to $14 billion. I have come to the well earlier today. and pointed out that this floor is littered with ostriches. or people who have their heads in the sand. Now it appears we are littered with red herrings. I am beginning to smell them. There was an $8.2 billion cost estimate for the SSC prepared in 1990. It has not changed since it was released. The cost estimate includes $850 million for contingencies and $875 million in contributions from the State of Texas. A recently released GAO report. which includes data examined in August 1992. only looked at a small portion of the conventional construction activities. and yet projected a $630 million cost overrun in the entire conventional construction project. They extrapolated from that. just as the gentleman from New York has done. They extrapolated from small figures and made them into big figures. Using the same extrapolation today. the final construction figures actually would be $261.000 below the original cost estimates.

Only $4.1 billion of that was supposed to be Federal money. Secretary of Energy Watkins said. \"We wont support the SSC if it is a dime over $5.9 billion. We promise.\" In 1992 the official cost rose to $8.25 billion. The Federal share was supposed to be $5.65 billion. Now independent cost estimates tell us this turkey is going to cost us at least $11 billion. plus at least $2 billion in stretchout costs. And at most. according to the administration. only $400 million in foreign contributions are expected. in comparison to what was supposed to be $1.7 billion. I know that the Government has salted SSC contracts around in 47 States. including my own. to try to save this program politically. But. frankly. it is time to say enough. The deficits are too big. other needs are too urgent. The super collider might be nice to have someday. but for now we need to put it on the shelf until we can afford it.",

One was that the total Federal contribution to the SSC would not exceed $5 billion. and second. that foreign contributions would be 20 percent of the total cost of the SSC. Those were the parameters upon which the SSC proceeded forward several years ago. And there was an ironclad commitment to proceed along those lines. The reason I am standing here today is because the SSC and its supporters have met neither of those parameters in the bill that they sponsored when this House originally authorized this plan. The Federal contribution is much over the $5 billion if the SSC is to be completed. and the most generous outline of foreign contributions would be $400 million out of an $11 billion project. When we passed the authorization bill. a deal was struck. A deal is a deal. And now. because the supporters of the SSC cannot come through with their part of the bargain. that is. getting the foreigners to contribute 20 percent and holding the Federal taxpayer contribution to no more than $5 billion. I believe the time has come to pull the pin on the SSC. They have had their chance. They had the commitment that they wanted. They could not do the job within the parameters that this House overwhelmingly set several years ago. Now is the time to say that the deal is broken and the SSC ought to be defunded.",

I think it is worth noting that both a Republican President and a Democratic President. the current Democratic President. supported continued funding for the superconducting super collider. It certainly is notable that the administrations of George Bush and Bill Clinton. who have studied this matter in detail. in depth. consulted the scientific community. both support this project. Now. some may disagree about the scientific benefits of the SSC. We have heard testimony or remarks here today that there are scientists who believe that there are more worthy scientific projects. That is true. There is also a large body of scientists who believe that the SSC is extremely important for our future in this country. and that body of scientists will tell us that this project is providing unique educational opportunities which will help meet this Nations critical need for more scientists and engineers. Educators will tell us the same thing. That body of scientists will tell my colleagues that SSCrelated research has already yielded a significant improvement in the magnetic resonance imaging technology used widely in medical diagnostics. They will also tell my colleagues that advances in superconductivity from the project will have an important impact on the energy. transportation. and manufacturing fields.

This vote is about fiscal integrity. it is about setting spending priorities. it is about judgment. We do not need any more pseudohistorical lectures on vision and Isabel telling Columbus. \"We cant afford it this year.\" I taught history myself. Historical vision is not what this decision is about. And here I address myself to all of my colleagues who rail against deficit spending and repeat the mantra of no new taxes. ad nauseam. and then will not cut a penny in pork. but will vote to throw senior citizens out of nursing homes. The time has coma to stop wasting taxpayers money on this enormous pork barrel project. In fact. if the other body and the conference committee had heeded the will of the House. last June. and terminated the SSC. we would have already saved the taxpayers money and we would not be spending time on this debate today. When the Department of Energy [DOE] first sold the SSC to Congress in 1985. we were told its total cost would not exceed $4.4 billion. Two years later. Congress was told the cost would not exceed $5.3 billion. And so the trend has continued. This year. the Department of Energy is telling Congress that the SSCs total construction costs will exceed $11 billion. The General Accounting Office [GAO] recently reported considerable cost overruns. contractor abuses. and the absolute failure of DOE to monitor and account for the expenses associated with the SSC. Yet. Congress continues to build an $11 billion toy for a select number of highenergy physicists. Now. I might Judge the value of this project differently. if I thought that many of these same Members who champion SSC would ever vote to raise the taxes to pay as you go. Mr. Chairman. how will future generations of Americans view this Congress as they struggle to pay down our Nations $4 trillion. and growing. national debt?

I think this is a perfect example. I could not understand a lot of this technical language that they used in promoting the project. but I understood one thing: When we bring together the former president of the Soviet Academy of Scientists. when we bring together seven Nobel Laureates. when we bring together the best scientists from all over the world. we are going to have some beneficial results in this country to keep this country in the forefront of the technological advances that we need to compete worldwide.

Some people suggest maybe we have too many lawyers or we have too many people that come directly out of college and all they want to do is run for public office and run government. It is much more difficult to find people who have everyday. practical experience. and success. working in Americas private economy. AL MCCANDLESS is a reflection of that. I said he used to pound tires and was a car dealer. He was a very successful small businessman in the desert country in California. It is very important for all of us to recognize that it was that common sense that made him so successful here as a Member of the House. I know when he had that responsibility in his dealership. he developed some traits that he has used with his own staff that involved how he would screen people. I hear that in the old days. when he was looking to determine the special qualifications of people who were applying for work. he did a variety of things. Among them. he asked a potential employee. \"if you were a car. what kind of a car would you be?\" The answers obviously were always very thoughtful and revealing. and sometimes even made the difference between two closely qualified candidates. Did his technique work. you may ask? Apparently it did. Because AL traditionally had an office with very. very little staff turnover. even in those days. Occasionally some cranking and starting problems. but very little turnover.

AL MCCANDLESS has left an impeccable and distinguished record. ALS career in the House is marked by a steady and understated dedication to service. While never flashy. he was most importantly always ready to light the good light. And fight AL did. Before AL came to Congress. he had already been battling for 12 years to bring balance to protection of the California desert. So when he arrived in 1982. desert dwellers gained a knowledgeable and dedicated proponent of fair desert legislation. Throughout his career AL showed wise judgment in how taxpayers money should be spent. He was also one of the first Republican Members of Congress to raise a red flag regarding the savings and loan crisis. In fact. he joined the Banking Committee just because he was so alarmed at the state of affairs in that industry. Recent achievements include working for reform of the National Flood Insurance Program and prohibiting high cost. home equity funding. And. AL MCCANDLESS is a nice man. While he goes about his job in a no nonsense way. he also takes the time to know and talk with all those around himthe policemen. doorkeepers. cloakroom stall. subway and elevator operators as well as staff.

Even though I am from the mountains and he is from the desert. we hit it off quite well. He has always been the kind of businessoriented. realworld conservative that we need more of in the House. Whenever we feel pressured to respond to a problem with a quick legislative fix. AL is one to stand up and make his colleagues see what unforeseen problems the legislation could cause. AL loves to talk about the beauty of the southern California desert that comprises most of his district. AL has fought ceaselessly to stop a bill that would turn this land Into a national park and deny much of its use to those who now enjoy it. When AL believes that something is not right. he pulls out all the stops to oppose it. as everyone who made it through the California desert debate can attest. Courage. tenacity. and common sense have been hallmarks of AL MCCANDLESS service to his country over the last 40 years. In the Marines Corps. in local government in Riverside County. and here in the House of Representatives. AL has given much to the people of his State and his country. It is fitting that we take time tonight to salute him and to wish both he and Gall a happy and fulfilling retirement. I hope that they keep in touch. and while I will sorely miss AL.

It sounds to me. from what I have heard this morning and from the debate I heard yesterday. that the whole approach is to distract attention from what is really involved here. We need to talk about the real issue: What this particular amendment does. It would repeal the unfair jobkilling retroactive income. estate and gift taxes from the tax bill we passed earlier this year. the socalled reconciliation package. These retroactive taxes will affect 1.1 million taxpayers in this country this year. Of the total taxpayers affected. 675.000 are small businesses. What do you think this does to a small businessperson who has budgeted a year in advance? The business has no choice but to pay the tax. So. then what do they cut? Jobs. We should be encouraging job creation through our policynot layoffs. I know my colleagues here in the Senate go home and talk to their constituents as I do. I do not believe any part of that tax bill made the people. the taxpayers. madder than the retroactivity of the tax increases in that bill. We have all heard it. We have retroactively raised taxes back before this Congress was sworn in. back before the President was sworn in. to get more revenue in an unfair way. It is destructive to business planning. I went home after that tax bill and people were saying: What does this mean? I made plans and business decisions based on what. my taxes would be under current law. Now. I have to go out and come up with more money. The Senator from Texas is trying to repeal this unfair tax. Her amendment is not a killer amendment. The important thing is to focus on what we are trying to accomplish. and that is to get rid of this unfair tax. Most of the debate has focused on how is it going to be paid for. how we would make up for the lost revenue here.

Now. some of our colleagues are saying. \"How could we cut $9 billion out of Government spending?\" Well. the President proposed $108 billion of savings from reinventing government. What we are doing here is simply taking $3 billion a year of those savings to eliminate a totally outrageous and unfair tax increase. So if you are against retroactive taxes. put your .ote where your mouth is. If you are in favor of cutting more. vote that way. do not just talk that way.

Americas small business owners--675.000 of themwere hit right between the eyes with an unfair. unexpected retroactive tax. Eighty percent of the businesses in America pay taxes as individuals. These are the people who invest their own money for our future and create 80 percent of the new jobs in America. Yes. we may help a few people who are rich in doing so. but let us not hurt those small businesses that are creating the new jobs in our country to prevent that. As my friend from Arkansas said yesterday. a former Attorney General may be working to get into the top income bracket now that he is out of Government service. But I think the other side of the aisle wants to put him there by raising the rates. We want to put him there by raising everyones income: rich. poor. and middle class.

A parent seeking support confronts a dizzying array of legal rules and procedureswhich can suddenly change when one parent or the child is moved to another State. As a result of these uncertainties. children who are entitled to receive support are suffering needlessly. To address this problem. I am introducing the Enhanced Access to Support Enforcement Act of 1994. My bill will require each State to grant full faith and credit to the child support judgments issued by the courts of other States. While not removing the courts or lawyers from the child support system. this measure will limit drawnout litigation and relitigation of claims. It will help promote simplicity and fairness in a system which is now anything but simple or fair. Mr. Speaker. by spending less money on litigation. more can be spent on the children who need and deserve financial support from their parents. I therefore urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.",

The bill authorizes increased research into the causes and treatment of this widespread but enigmatic disease. Doctors estimate that there are about 500.000 Americans known to be suffering from lupus. It is estimated that another 500.000 have not been diagnosed. Known cases of lupus outnumber those of leukemia. muscular dystrophy. or multiple sclerosis. While lupus affects both men and women. 9 out of 10 people struck with lupus are women. The disease has its most significant impact on young women during the childbearing ages of 15 to 45. All ethnic backgrounds are stricken with lupus. but it attacks AfricanAmerican. Hispanic. and some Asian and native American women three times more frequently than white women. Within those ethnic groups hardest hit. rarely is there a person who has not been directly or indirectly affected by a friend. relative. or loved one who is suffering from lupus. Perhaps the most discouraging aspect of lupus for the sufferer is the fact that there is no cure. Lupus organizations throughout the country have endorsed H.R. 2402. Many of them. from districts throughout the country. have contacted my colleagues. Let us not turn away. Let each of us assure the 1 million who now suffer that we will not choose to neglect their cry for help. Mr. Chairman.

He said that back in 1989. I would simply point out to the House that last year we had $40 billion in trade deficits. That means that the Clinton economic program lost us over one million jobs. and translated into a growing weakness in the economy. So far this year we have had over $10 billion in trade deficits. and that translates into a loss of another 250.000 good jobs and signals a growing weakness in our economy.

This is illustrated by the fact that all the House conferees on title III signed the conference report. The conference report includes the House mandate that FAA establish a longterm research program in cabin air quality. Airplane cabin air quality has not shown to be harmful. However. that is the heart of the problem. The potential transmissioi of diseases by bacteria and viruses has never been studied scientifically. The conference report agreed with the mandates in the House passed provision. that if there is a problem. it should be addressed before major health problems occur. On the other hand. if the cabin air quality and disease transmission are not problems. then FAA. with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control. will have a scientific data base on which to base future decisions. The conference report also in6ludes the House provision requiring the Agency to establish a joint dualuse aviation research and development program. The program calls for the establishment of a joint FAAFederal agency. including DOD. aviation research and development program. which will be conducted by grants to industry. The intent is to assist the Defense sector in making the transition to civilian sector. This would preserve both the high technology involved and the jobs. Moreover. the program would provide the civilian aviation sector with expertise developed by the military. In order to make advancements in aviation safety and to develop future technologies.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am strongly opposed to legislation that would deregulate the intrastate trucking industry. Its bad for shippers. bad for highway users. and bad for rural America. If you liked Frank Lorenzo. youre going to love this bill. Deregulation flies in the face of every lesson weve learned over the past 16 years. Interstate motor carrier bankruptcies--caused in large part by the last round of deregulationtopped 1.600 in 1990. and the list is growing. Along the way. thousands of family wage jobs have been lost. lives have been ruined. and small businesses have been squeezed out of existence. I dont think its appropriate for Federal law to substitute its judgment for that of States when it comes to regulating motor carrier use. Oregon. for example. is one of eight States that rely on a weightdistance tax to help finance highway repairs necessitated by tractor trailer use. Most everyone in the State agrees that its a fair and efficient way to allocate costs. Yet this legislation will make the tax extremely difficult to collect and the State will have to find other ways to supplement repair costs. Its a safe bet that ordinary citizens and commuters will now have to shoulder this extra burden. I also dont believe this legislation is neutral toward safety. Common sense tells us that a carrier facing bankruptcy will cut costs wherever it can. usually starting with equipment maintenance and hoursofservice limits. After all. safety costs money. Cutthroat competition can spread like a cancer. Before you know it. a lowest common denominator syndrome will grip the industry and everyone will hedge on safety to stay competitive. Thats what happened in commercial aviation after deregulation. Thats exactly what will happen here. And finally. Im not convinced that deregulation will improve service. Twothirds of the population in my State live in rural areas. Many of these communities are isolated by mountains or the Pacific coastline. and are far from population centers. Without regulation of rates and service. most carriers in the State will probably bypass these routes altogether. This legislation is a disaster waiting to happen. Rushing headstrong into the biggest regulatory change in a decade will surely produce unintended effects. many of which could be ruinous for States like Oregon.

I am always happy to have the opportunity to work alongside my good friend and colleague from California. Mr. MINETA. and it brings me particular satisfaction when it involves legislation authorizing funding for aviation programs which. as we all know. are a significant contributor on the U.S. economy. Mr. Speaker. the conferees are reauthorizing the FAA research and development programs for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. These programs form the base for the improvements that are made by the FAA in the national airspace system to increase system capacity. reduce the number and length of delays. and automate the outdated hardware and software used by our air traffic control system. In this regard. H.R. 2739 authorizes a relatively modest amount of funds for research and development at the FAA. and it is arguable that this funding should be significantly higher given the large number of technological and operational issues these programs are meant to address. Overall. I believe aviation research and development as conducted by FAA and other agencies under the jurisdiction of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. such as NASA. are critical to the technological advances which must be made in order to increase safety. capacity. and security of the U.S. airspace. But I also believe Congress at some point needs to rationalize FAA. NASA. and perhaps Defense Department R&D programs across the breadth and depth of the Government and determine a better method of investing the Federal dollar in this crucial area. Too often. important areas of research can be neglected or given low priority in the scramble to keep programs on schedule. and someone eventually pays in the long runusually the Government through more funding. but unfortunately. occasionally the flying public through accidents and delays. I urge my colleagues to recognize the important contributions made by aviation to our Nations preeminence. and to support the conference report to H.R. 2739. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I think that the Department of Commerce has a far better record of data collection for purposes of the census as well as issues relating to insurance. This Department already has expertise on issues involving the availability and affordability of insurance. We have had some problems with HUD in the past. I hope we do not continue to have any such problems in the future. It is a very important department of government. But it is not the department to which this issue should be given. Let us authorize the Department of Commerce. with their longestablished record. as the agency that has the job of collecting data as required in this legislation.",

Contrary to what many have said here today. HUD has the experience because they have administered a program of this nature for over 20 years.

The agency that has the proper jurisdiction. that currently is responsible for dealing with redlining issues. for dealing with racial discrimination is HUD. That is what they do. Part of their mandate is to go out and find out where racial discrimination and rediining take place in the housing industry. We are asking them to expand into a couple of other areas in addition to housing insurance. The fact is that if we look at how this whole thing got going. it got going out of an extension of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. You take either Energy and Commerce base text or Banking Committees base text. they are both based on the HMDA Act. the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. which came out of the Banking Committee. I got it passed with the chairman. the gentleman from Texas . 6 years ago on this House floor. That is the base text.

The KennedyGonzalez amendment makes the process better by making HUD the agency that receives data instead of the Commerce Department. Giving HUD the responsibility t6 collect data makes sense on the merits. In fact. it makes so much sense one is left with the feeling that the selection of Commerce was based more on internal jurisdictional battles than on the most capable agency. HUD has ample experience administering and overseeing the collection of data that will be generated by this legislation. Currently HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act including provisions prohibiting discrimination in homeowners insurance. Does it not make sense. therefore. for HUD to receive data from insurance companies about their homeowners and other property insurance data? HUD has been collecting data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for 20 years. This data is extremely similar to the data that will be provided under the provisions of this bill. Again. does it not make sense for this information to go to the agency that has. even with all its flaws. the most experience? Why. as we reinvent Government. do we want to reinvent the Commerce Department by having them do the work that HUD has already been doing for 20 years?

This amendment would designate Housing and Urban Development rather than Commerce as the agency responsible for data collection. for analysis. for study. and for reporting under the bill. This is truly the most cynical amendment we are likely to face today. Under the guise of helping those who suffer from discrimination. it is simply a grab at committee jurisdiction in the House. period. The Department of Commerce is the datacollecting arm of the Federal Government. It has broad and long experience in designing and carrying out data collection responsibilities. This is. of course. most evident in its responsibilities as to the census. but it is also evident in many other areas such as its Bureau of Economic Analysis and the International Trade Commission. In addition. the Department of Commerce is the sole Federal agency with substantive experience in insurance. The Department of Commerce. for example. is responsible for implementation of the Risk Retention Act. and the Department of Commerce conducts an annual and complete analysis of foreign reinsurance markets in the United States. The Department of Commerce acts as the substantive expert on all trade negotiations regarding insurance. HUD has no expertise in property casualty insurance. the type of insurance covered by this bill. It has no genuine expertise in designing and implementing data systems. These are the province of Commerce. Keep in mind when Commerce does carry out its data collection and analysis responsibilities under H.R. 1188. this information will be available to all Federal agencies including HUD for fair housing purposes. including Justice for discrimination purposes. and any other agency in the Federal Government for any other valid purpose. We must be sure that this data is the most accurate. most usable. most complete data that a welldesigned system can produce. Commerce is the obvious agency to carry out that task. There is really.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Madam Chairman. I want to start by commending the efforts of both the Energy and Commerce Committee and Banking Committee for focusing attention on the availability of insurance in urban America. We should all take allegations of discrimination by insurance companies seriously. Redlining is already illegal and must not be tolerated in any case. But after hearing the debate on jurisdiction. I think the public might well conclude that nobody is qualified to deal with the problem. In considering the banking amendment to H.R. 1188. I have a number of concerns about the proposed amendments disclosure requirements. I think the requirements are unnecessarily broad and costly to the insurance industryand will reduce the availability and affordability of insurance in urban areas. For example. the banking amendment requires insurers to collect data on the basis of census tracts. H.R. 1188 uses zip codes instead which are much more cost effective and userfriendly units because they are normal classifications that are large enough to lend statistical credibility to any redlining analysis. Second. the banking amendment requires insurers to disclose loss data. Loss data is not necessary to determine who is served or not served in urban markets. It only creates expensive disclosures that could potentially reveal trade secrets concerning the marketing practices of insurers. Third. the banking amendment increases the number of MSAs from 25 to 75. To require 75 areas to make these disclosures imposes an unfair burden on insurers in cities. like my own Charlotte. where redlining was shown not to exist in a statewide market conduct study completed last year. These are just some of the differences between the Banking Committee amendment and H.R. 1188. While I am concerned that H.R. 1188 duplicates the antiredlining regulatory efforts of the States. I do think its provisions are more sensible and less expensive for the industry than are the requirements of the Banking Committee amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment and for H.R. 1188.",

Mr. SKEEN. who unfortunately cannot be with us today and Mr. MYERS for so ably taking Mr. SKEENS place. I commend them for crafting a very fair and balanced bill. The bill provides roughly $56.2 billion for mandatory domestic food programs such as food stamps and farm program crop subsidies. In addition. it provides roughly $14.4 billion in spending authority for discretionary programs. This amount represents a $303 million increase over fiscal 1993 funding. but it remains $248 million less than the subcommittees 602(b) allocation and $160 million less than the amount the President requested. I am very pleased that the subcommittee has placed priority on the WIC Program and rural water and sewer programs. Under this bill WIC is increased by $350 million and rural water and sewers by $200 million. I have always been a strong supporter of the WIC Program. This special supplemental food program for women. infants. and children provides critical nutrition and health benefits to lowincome pregnant women and young children. These benefits reduce infant mortality. avert premature births and help our needy children reach their full potential. To those of us who represent rural areas. the increase for rural water and sewers is very important. These programs help improve the quality of life of those who live and work in rural areas. I am also glad that the bill includes funding for full time equivalents for the Food and Drug Administration. I am hopeful that the Commissioner will use this funding to support at least 65 FTEs for the implementation of the Mammography Screening Act as he recommended earlier. As a breast cancer survivor. I know the importance of accurate testing for this devastating disease. Because there is no cure for breast cancer. we must do all we can to provide an accurate and responsible method of diagnosing this disease.

As the chairman of the House Committee on Agricultures Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities. I want to draw special attention to the contributions that American farm workers and ranchers are making towards deficit reduction in the context of this appropriations bill and the overall budget resolution. While the overall agricultural appropriations bill will increase spending for food programs in particular. which are now the lions share of the agricultural budget. the Food Stamp Program going up in excess of $7 billion. consistent with the Mickey Leland Child and Hunger Relief Act. WIC funding going up. other nutrition programs going up. but in fact that share of the budget that goes to farmers in the form of farm program payments of every kind is going to be going down by $2.95 billion. a huge decrease. over the next 5 years. I think we need to keep in mind the context. as well. that this comes on the heels of a 13 plus reduction in farm program spending mandated by the 1990 budget agreement. Over the last number of years that share of the agricultural budget. always relatively small compared to the entire budget. has been on a rapid decline. and continues to be so. It is important that our colleagues understand that and give full credit to the farm and ranch community for the contributions they are making. Obviously. our first priority is to find savings that have the least impact on direct farm income. That is difficult to do.

But I am troubled about another thing. I. too. want to see methodology developed for paying for this disaster as I do for anything else that comes along. But is it not dumb for us to have to vote for a measure to cut spending in an area like hurricane prevention measures or floodwarning measures that might be in one of the amendments that is going to call for offsets? We have one that the gentleman from Iowa described about hurricane prevention. Should we be dumb enough to cut that kind of spending when we are talking about natural disasters. that is. preventing future spending of the type we are going to vote for today? I believe it is possible that one of those amendments has in it the very Susquehanna River that I spoke about previously. a reduction in funding for a flood warning system that we have worked for every year since 1972 to put in place in order to prevent further damage of the proportions that we suffered in 1972. So I have to weigh that very carefully. An amendment of the type that the gentleman from Indiana is offering might be more attractive. but one that would cut prevention of disaster is simply dumb.",

And we mus continue this tradition in responding to the terrible damage wrought by the recent earthquake in Los Angeles. Fortunately. this bill also seeks to extend American generosity to the millions of citizens who have been suffering through a severe. recordbreaking winter in the Northern States. In my district in central Maine. the average temperatures this winter have been 10 degrees below normal. Northern Maine is experiencing the coldest winter on record. As the temperatures plunge. the heating bills soar. And the increased heating costs begin to strain family budgets. For the poor. it becomes a matter of survival. of food. rent. and clothing---or heat. How do our less fortunate citizens cope with these conditions? During a typical winter. they rely on the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP. But LIHEAP. thanks to repeated cuts since 1985. is one of the most underfunded programs in the budget. despite being one of the most essential. Even a normal winter can be harrowing for lowincome citizens thanks to inadequate heating assistance. A winter like this one qualifies as a disaster. H.R. 3759 rightly addresses this serious problem in the context of disaster aid. It gives the President the authority to disburse up to $200 million for LIHEAP upon declaration of an emergency. Unlike a similar. existing authority. these funds are not automatically distributed to every State. but only to those States that have truly suffered from severe winter cold. Helping those facing the devastation of the earthquake in Los Angeles is the right thing to do. Helping those suffering from the unprecedented cold is the right thing to do. In times of need. Americans have always done the right thing. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3759.",

Although Greg and Barbara were qualified sailors who could handle adverse weather conditions. there was little that could be done against this treacherous storm. As time progressed and the storm strengthened. Barbara and Gregs yacht was slowly being decimated. Greg at this time was in the early stages of hypothermia and was losing strength. Fortunately. the Royal New Zealand Air Force had by this time been on a search and rescue mission. As the storm began to dwindle somewhat. Barbara was able to notice an F3 Orion plane that was passing by overhead. She sent two parachute flares into the sky but the Orion crew did not notice them. Barbara proceeded to put on a search light which the plane was able to locate. Members of the plane crew proceeded to contact the Royal New Zealand Navy and notify them of the whereabouts of the destroyed yacht.

Since 1974. Mr. Chairman. the country. through the Congress. has weighed this Budget Act for deficit spending over 600 times. We. as history will conelude. collectively. both administrations. Democrat or Republican. and the Congress. whether it was Democratically controlled in the House or the Senate. both or one. have been unable. with the collective advice and consent of the citizens of this country. the voters of this country. to bring our financial house in order. There are two factors about this debt that concern me. No. 1. it is relative. A $4 trillion debt to a $7 trillion economy is one thing. A $4 trillion debt to a $15 trillion economy is somewhat less severe. Our economy needs to grow and our debt needs to stay the same or stable. The second thing that bothers me most about this debt is that we have mortgaged our country. In 1979 to 1980. about 8.9 cents out of every revenue dollar went to pay interest on our national debt. Today we are paying 14.5. almost 15 cents of every revenue dollar as interest on the national debt. What we and others who have come before us and the people who return us here have done is mortgaged our home. our country. from an 8percent rate in 1980 to an almost 15percent rate today. That cannot continue. We now. even with the Budget Act that was passed last year. are headed toward a 15. 16. or 17percent mortgage rate on our country. It has been suggested that we cannot get to a balanced budget if we do just a yearly balanced budget by 2001. As the gentleman from Texas has suggested. we still have a $4 trillion debt. and that will go to $5 or perhaps $6 trillion by the year 2000. So we have a debt. no matter what we do here today. We Just cannot continue raising the interest rate and continue to mortgage our country. That is why I think the time has come for us to collectively put everything on the table. I think we are going to have to do something about our debt and our deficit. and we are going to start today.",

They are those of my colleagueson both sides of the aislewho are advancing the idea that amending the Constitution can balance the budget. With all due respect. this is simply not the case. We know how to balance the budget. We know it is not easy. quick. or pleasant. It is done through painstaking scrutiny. not through broadbrushed rhetoric. It is done through toughminded decisions. not through easy slogans. And above all. it is done honestlyby laying out the options explaining the consequences. and deating the choices.

Of course. there is no guarantee that a balanced budget amendment will ensure fiscal responsibility. In fact. there is every reason for fear that. with an amendment. that goal will become more elusive. Far from ensuring that a balanced budget must be passed. the amendment simply ensures that a budget supported by threefifths of the House must be passed. Why? Why make it more difficult to enact a responsible budget? Why make it more difficult to kill unnecessary programs. to enact responsible reforms. to make unpopular choices? As the Washington Post noted on Tuesday. a balanced budget amendment would allow 40 percent of the House or Senate to hold the entire process hostage.

I said. our leaders in Congress and Washington realize the imperative of restraining our spending. In my third budget cycle a number of years ago I came to the bitter reality that the temptation to borrow and spend is much more attractive than fiscal responsibility. Since I have been here. we bailed out the savings and loans to the tune thep of $150 billion. off budget. It did not count. We still have to borrow the money. We still have to pay it back with interest. but it does not count. The California earthquake relief. just a month ago. we are going to borrow the money. over $11 billion. We are going to have to pay it back. but it was a dire emergency supplemental. It does not count.

We must make every effort to realign our national priorities and focus limited Federal dollars on our most pressing national needs. The problem with the balanced budget amendment is that it makes no provision for social programs benefiting our most vulnerable population. as in previous budget reduction measures. Under this proposal it would likely be the sick. the poor. and our children who will sacrifice. If this amendment is adopted. todays health care crisis will become tomorrows public health disaster. Revenues earmarked for financing health care reformMedicare and Medicaid cost reductions-- would instead be directed towards deficit reduction. With this constitutional amendment. we will have no dollars for universal health coverage. too few funds for HIV research and treatment. inadequate support for community health centers. and scant attention to breast cancer research and other urgent health needs. This amendment would also force us to turn our backs on our most precious resource--our children. Today. almost 15 million of our kids live in poverty. Many have no chance for a meaningful. quality education. More than 50 percent of eligible children are never reached by Head Start. Federal dollars for educating our children. which have dropped to a mere 2 percent of the budget. would drop further if the balanced budget is adopted. The constitutional amendment would also mean cutbacks for critical antipoverty measures. such as lowincome housing assistance and urban revitalization. During the dark Reagan years the poor in our cities were relegated to the shadows. The Department of Housing and Urban Development. the primary vehicle for urban aid. saw its budget slashed by more than any other Federal agency. With a new administration and the strong leadership of Secretary Cisneros. our urban poor are again getting the attention and support they desperately need. Passage of this amendment would mean severe cutbacks for housing assistance and the community development funds critical to the revitalization of our city neighborhoods. Mr. Chairman. we do need to make tough budget choices. We need to turn billions for weapons into medicine for the sick. computers for school children. and housing for the homeless.

Bipartisan amendments suggested by the members of our committee were adopted by the Science. Space and Technology Committee in its markup sessions. Our efforts have focused on an attempt to confront the primary challenges facing education and its ever expanding uses of technology. First. that the best technology be made available to institutions of education at all levels. not Just research laboratories. Already. as reported in a recent National Education Association report. over 50 percent of American classrooms have a computer. Our goal must be not only to expand the reach of technology. but to insure it is quality technology. Equally. we have tried to stress that the future holds a technological impact on education in many diverse fields. not Just research as I mentioned earlier. For example. one can readily see the benefit of technology for early childhood programs such as Head Start and Even Start. as well as for nowevolving school to work programs including youth apprenticeships. We also included provisions which will provide for evaluations of the cost effectiveness of the technology programs under this legislation. Education clearly faces special challenges as its financial resources are severely stretched. These special cost factors must be evaluated as new systems are developed to insure that they are accessible to educational institutions at all levels. but not just physical access. but financial access as well.

The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area Act. was introduced by Mr. BILBRAY and passed the House in April. The legislation is very similar to a measure passed by the House in the 102d Congress but on which action was not completed prior to adjournment. The Senate has made a few technical amendments which change some of the wording. but not the substance. I urge the House to concur with these amendments. The bill before us today would designate a 316.000acre national recreation area in the Spring Mountains of southern Nevada. The national recreation area would encompass all of the lands of the Spring Mountains unit of the Toiyabe National Forest. Located near two rapidly growing population centers. Las Vegas and Pahrump. the area receives approximately 5 million visitors a year. It Is the only area readily accessible to southern Nevadans with forests and snow. At that hearing of the Subcommittee on National Parks. Forests and Public Lands. on March 3. 1993. we learned that the resources of the Spring Mountains are impressive. Dominating the area is Mount Charleston which. at 11.918 feet. is the third highest mountain in Nevada. Vegetation includes ancient bristlecone pines. which are the oldest living things on Earth. five vegetative life zones and 48 plant species found nowhere else in the world. Wildlife includes elk. deer. wild turkey. bighorn sheep. golden eagles. wild horses and burros. and the palmers chipmunk. which is found only in the Spring Mountains. Threatened species include the desert tortoise and Lahonton cutthroat trout. The Spring Mountains are also the beginning of the water aquifer for the city of Las Vegas.

Were we to hold the games. the Olympic games. in Beijing. this would be an enormous setback for the international Olympic movement. We must not allow the Olympics to be associated with the dictatorial totalitarian regime. We must not stand idly by and allow this to happen. Mr. Speaker. the Washington Post. in a recent editorial. came to the same conclusion. and I would like to quote its concluding paragraph: China took a chance by putting in its 2000 bid. and to lose our might embarrass sponsors of the initiative. But there is a useful lesson to be learned: This is 1993. The world is changing. Largescale systemic human rights violations are incompatible with the conduct expected of a nation seeking status as a late20th century Olympics host.

But even those who believe the death penalty is morally right should be worried about mistakes. The death penalty. once imposed. can never be recalled. Innocent people should never be put to death. As the late Justice Marshall said: No matter how careful courts are. the possibility of perjured testimony. mistaken honest testimony. and human error are all too real. We have no way of Judgink how many innocent persons have been executed. but we can be certain that there were some. Last year. Chairman EDWARDS released a report which documents 48 people on death row who were released because of significant new evidence of their Innocence since 1973. Gary Nelson of Georgia spent 11 years on death row. waiting to be executed. He was finally released after a review of the prosecutors files revealed that material Information had been Improperly withheld from the defense. Later the district attorney admitted that there was not a single element of the prosecutions case which had not been impeached or contradicted. In 1984. Federico Macias was convicted of murder in Texas. He was granted habeas because of Ineffective assistance of counsel. He was released in 1993 after a grand Jury refused to reindict him for lack of evidence. Also In 1984. Kirk Bloodsworth was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young gid. In 1993. he was released after subsequent DNA testing confirmed his Innocence. These are not Isolated incidents. In 1987 alone. nine people sentenced to death were released because of a finding of Innocence or of guilt only of a lesser charge.

The Supreme Court ruled. and I believe it was 7 to 2. that the death penalty was disproportionate. and therefore unconstitutional under cruel and unusual punishment. because for the Government to execute someone in connection with another crime. somebody should have been killed. somebody should have been murdered. Even in this brutal rape case. the Supreme Court said that it was inappropriate and unconstitutional. cruel and unusual. to have the death penalty. Mr. Chairman. the subcommittee that I chair Just in the last few weeks received a report on the implementation of the drug kingpin law that was put into effect a number of years ago.

AfricanAmericans are 13 to 14 percent of our country. but in the report that we issued. we found. and this was confirmed by the General Accounting Office in an earlier report. that where the death penalty is administered. overwhelmingly for the same kind of crimes. whites do not get the death penalty. where AfricanAmericans do.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the work of the Northern Forest Lands Council [NFLC]. which ceases to exist today after completing its 4year effort to develop longterm conservation recommendations for the Northern Forest. The Northern Forest is a 26millionacre expanse of forest which extends from New York to Maine. This vast area. which Is mostly privately owned. is home to more than 1 million people. along with moose. osprey. bear. loon. and hundreds of other species of wildlife. The Northern Forest provides the Northeast and the Nation with forest products. opportunities for outdoor recreation and tourism. and billions of dollars of direct and secondary economic benefits. As a recreational destination. the Northern Forest hosts millions of visitors annuallyoffering some of the most spectacular scenery in America. The region is characterized by clear mountain rivers and lakes. magnificent mountain peaks. and peaceful New England villages. The Northern Forest region is currently facing strong forces for change. Intensified forest practices. land speculation. and subdivision threaten to permanently damage the character ot the region. The NFLC was created in 1990 in response to these threats. Through 4 years of effort. the NFLC developed a series of recommendations to help preserve the Northern Forest. One of the most remarkable things about the work of the NFLC has been the process. The consensus recommendations were developed after countless hours of discussions. with input from all concerned parties. Unlike forest communities in other parts of the country which have been plagued by polarization. Northern Forest communities have shown that opposing interests can find common ground and work together in developing conservation strategies. Continuing with this spirit of constructive cooperation. I look forward to working with the rest of the Northern Forest delegation to implement the recommendations of the Northern Forest Lands Council.",

A victim of the 1991 base closure cycle. Lowrys technical training missions have already relocated to other bases. But today Is the day when the flag comes down for the last time. Today is a day to reflect on the contribution Lowry has made to our national security. Training is always of highest military priority and Lowry shined in its ability to produce ready and reliable munitions loaders. mechanics. photographers. and a host of other specialties. I wish to extend a national thank you for that service. Today is also a day to encourage and commend the redevelopment effort underway to turn Lowry into a residential. commercial. and recreational asset for the community. Two cities overcame past differences to organize a neighborhoodbased planning and now implementation authority to fill up the vacated base. Theres great success already. A community college is moving Into classroom and dormitory space. The Presidents new National Community Conservation Corps has set up a regional campus there. The Air Force museum has become a civilianrun Wings Over The Rockies Museum. the Defense Finance and Accounting center maintains a large presence and has space t grow. And the delicate and contentious issue of providing available housing to the homeless has been settled. I met today with Air Force Assistant Secretary Rodney Coleman to review the redevelopments progress. He said that Lowry has been one of the Air Forces success stories because of the communitys ability to move forward. He pledged continued support and assistance to keep that momentum up. Ill hold him to that. I. too. pledge my continued assistance to this effort. When Lowrys fate was first sealed. I quickly convened a local forum to plan the way. I scouted for Federal opportunities. resources. and obstacles. I troubleshot when potential conflicts with the Air Force arose and I carefully listened to the concerns of the neighbors and blended them Into the redevelopment planning mix. Mr. Speaker. the conversion of closed military bases is not an easy trick but with the right resources. talent. and attitude. it can be done. Lowry Air Force Base is living proof.",

Mr. Messano will be honored by the Dante Aligheri Society. a charitable organization made up of professionals and business owners who make donations to meritorious community programs. It is most fitting that the society has chosen to honor the prosecutor. because he too has generously donated his time and efforts to a wide range of community activities.

I live in Hudson County. so I can personally attest to his fine efforts on behalf of our residents. Through his office. the second largest in the State. Mr. Messano has worked with seniors to ensure their safety in their golden years. He has worked with juveniles to guide them away from crime and encourage them to lead productive lives. He has worked with local community watch groups striving to make their neighborhoods a safer place. Throughout his life. Mr. Messano has consistently distinguished himself. He graduated magna cum laude from Lafayette College in 1974. Three years later he received a juris doctor degree from Boston College Law School. The prosecutor has worked as an adjunct professor at St. Peters College in Jersey City. In the past. Mr. Messano has served on numerous nonprofit agencies. including the Jersey City Museum and at the St. Josephs Home. He currently serves on the board of directors of D.A.R.E. New Jersey.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. Congressman CHET EDWARDS and I are introducing the Endangered Species Act Moratorium Amendments. This bipartisan legislation will help put a stop to the current abuses of the Endangered Species Act [ESA]. In its current form the Endangered Species Actthough well intentionedworks contrary to. and often against. one particular speciesthe human being. Many hardworking ranchers. farmers. and homeowners in Texas have a greater fear of the golden cheeked warbler than they do of tax hikes and tornadoes. In my own hometown of San Antonio. TX. the entire source of water has been held hostage by Federal agencies and courts over a small fish called the fountain darter. This bill is an important first step to allay some of those fears and bring common sense to the ESA process. We in Congress must act and insure that human beings no longer play second fiddle to spiders and snakes. Specifically. this legislation will suspend the future listing of endangered or threatened species and the designation of new critical habitat until the Endangered Species Act is reauthorized by Congress. The ESAb authorization expired in 1992. This bill is a realistic vehicle toward reforming the ESA. Passage of this bill compels Congress to consider human factors and bring balance of the ESA when it considers the reauthorization. ESA must be reconstructed with amendments which not only protect the environment. but respect property rights. Protecting property rights does not mean that threatened species cannot be protected. It simply means that human costs should be considered when the ESA is imposed. It also means that Government agencies. such as the Fish and Wildlife Service. should be creative in finding ways to balance these goals. rather than slamming the heavy fist of the Federal bureaucracy down on landowners. The Federal Government should work in concert with the true stewards of the land. instead of threatening them with fines without warning. Please join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. It is long since past the time that we brought sanity and common sense to the ESA process. This legislation will stop current abuses and make possible real reform of the ESA. Thank you.",

PAL was created over 50 years ago in New York City by Lt. Ed Flynn. who. faced with persistent gang violence. organized a baseball league to give kids an alternative to crime. PAL now has 246 local chapters in cities nationwide. Including Jacksonville. De Moines. New York. Denver. Houston. San Francisco. and Seattle. Three million kids participate in PALs recreational and educational programs. such as athletic tournaments. police cadet clubs. and computer training. Fifty years after its inception. the principal mission of PAL remains the same: police officers volunteer their free time to work with youths In promoting trust and understanding in an atmosphere of cooperation. The kids benefit by receiving positive role models and learning life skills. The officers benefit by getting an opportunity to make a real. positive difference in kids lives. The story of Ben Hansberger. the 1993 PAL Boy of the Year Award recipient in California. is a shining example of the effectiveness of PAL. Ben thanked PAL in a letter.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the purpose of the bill that I am introducing today. the Equity in Remedies Act. is quite simple. Congress should abide by the same rules and be subject to the same damages as it chooses to impose on privatesector employers. It congressional employers are not subject to punitive damages. privatesector employers should not be subject to punitive damages. The Equity in Remedies Act would achieve that goal. Under title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act [ADA]. only privatesector employers are subject to awards of punitive damages. Executive branch employers and State and local government employers are not subject to punitive damages. Under the Congressional Accountability ActH.R. 4822passed by the House on August 10. 1994. by a vote of 4274. Members of Congress are also not subject to punitive damages. Some version of congressional coverage legislation may soon be passed by the Senate. but none of those under serious consideration include punitive damages. The Equity in Remedies Act will subject privatesector employers to the same damages as proposed under H.R. 4822. and those applicable to executive branch and State and local government. by eliminating punitive damages under title VII and the ADA. Unfortunately. the amendment that I submitted to the Rules Committee to provide for punitive damages under H.R. 4822 was not made in order. even though an earlier bilIH.R. 2721reported by the Education and Labor Committee on congressional coverage allowed for such damages. Since the House was precluded from debating this important issue and the bill excludes punitive damages. it is only appropriate that legislation be introduced to bring privatesector laws concerning punitive damages in line with the bill passed by the House. Hopefully. this vehicle will engender a useful debatea debate denied by the Rules Committeeas to the appropriateness of exempting Congress from the same damages as imposed on the private sector. We take this step with some hesitancy. as we recognize the controversial nature of eliminating punitive damages under title VII and the ADA. However. if the Congress wishes to exempt itself from these damages. its seems only appropriate that it should similarly exempt the private sector. Mr. Speaker. I realize that time is now short in the session. but I hope we will revisit the issue in the next Congress.",

Mr. Chairman. the amendment is similar to House Concurrent Resolution 26 which has strong bipartisan support. And states that prior to the United Nations authorized operation in Somalia. over 300.000 Somalisincluding onefourth of the children under the age of 5died due to civil strife. disease. and famine. and at least half of Somalias population of 8 million people. were considered at risk of starvation.

And. that the United States contributed immeasurably to Operation Restore Hope including the deployment of over 20.000 military troops and the loss of American lives. The amendment concludes by commending United States Armed Forces for successfully establishing a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia. In the end. Mr. Chairman. over 28.000 United States servicemen were deployed in Somalia. They came under enemy fire and a number of American lives were lost. Mr. Chairman. as Congress and the administration moves to cut back on Americas defense budget. we should be mindful that it was our military which made it possible for the starving people in Somalia to be fed. They are. without a doubt. the best trained. best equipped. most highly motivated young men and women. coming from all walks of life. a true cross section of America. and they are all volunteers serving their country in a most honorable profession. as a member of the Armed Forces of America.

Mr. Chairman. when called upon to perform. our Armed Forces have consistently responded in a manner that makes our Nation proud. When asked by thenPresident Bush to provide a secure environment for the conduct of relief efforts in Somalia. 25.000 men and women of the United States military responded. In performing their task. they were confronted with a massive human tragedy and uncertain security situation. As the gentleman from New York notes in his amendment. prior to the deployment of U.S. forces. some 8 million people were considered at risk. with over 300.000 already having died from either civil strife. disease. or famine. Tragically. of the victims. about onefourth were children under the age of 5. As a result of our military intervention. the threat of starvation has been dramatically reduced and a secure environment in Somalia has been created. Our U.S. Armed Forces performed an outstanding humanitarian service in Somaliaa service that the armed forces of very few other countries could have performed. Regrettably this feat was not done without cost: There were some killed and wounded. and families were separated.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2128. to authorize the refugee resettlement program for fiscal years 1993 and 1994. This is a simple. straightforward piece of legislation. Currently. the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes such sums as may be necessary for the refugee program for fiscal year 1992. Funds for fiscal year 1993 were appropriated but never authorized. H.R. 2128 simply changes the authorized years to 1993 and 1994 to comply with the Appropriations Committees request for an authorization prior to appropriating a supplemental. This legislation is needed immediately in order to allow a supplemental appropriation for the Office of Refugee Resettlement to move forward. Without this supplemental. the primary Federal program for refugee resettlement will be cut from 8 months of cash and medical assistance for recipients to 3 months. Such a cut would be devastating for the refugee resettlement program. When we first set up the program through the Refugee Act of 1980. Congress authorized 36 months of resettlement assistance to help these dispossessed persons adjust and become selfsufficient In their new home. Over the years. the Federal Government has reduced the cash and medical assistance program from 36 months. to 18 months. then to 12 months. and finally to 8 months. ReducIng assistance further to 3 months would be tantamount to bringing these refugees into the United States and abandoning them. H.R. 2128 does not specify authorized dollar amounts. Last year Congress appropriated $381 million for fiscal 1993 for refugee resettlement. The supplemental appropriation request. which originally was for $27 million. Is now for $15 million. for a total fiscal 1993 funding level of $396 million. The budget request for fiscal 1994 is $420 million. These figures are not out of line with the fiscal 1992 funding level of $410 million. In fact. they represent a significant decrease in the Federal Governments share of responsibility for refugee resettlement from what was envisioned In the Refugee Act of 1980. H.R. 2128 Is a simple bill that is nevertheless vital to the refugee resettlement program. The legislation represents our countrys continued commitment to the worlds refugees who have no hope of returning safely to their home countries. We are doing the right thing by helping these unfortunate people. and they. In turn. are enriching our culture as contributing members of our society. I urge my colleagues to vote In support of H.R. 2128.",

As we consider this week the tax and spend provisions contained in the reconciliation bill. it is truly refreshing to pause for a moment to actually consider improving how Government works for the American people. I welcome this bill and the opportunity it represents to train our Government agencies to review. assess. and improve the programs they deliver to our citizens. This issue of improving the delivery of Government service is one personally important to me. as I was a sponsor of similar legislation during my tenure in the New Jersey State Legislature. I also recently introduced my own Government performance review bill. H.R. 2245. which would establish a permanent commission to schedule and direct performance reviews for all major agencies of the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. I believe H.R. 826 represents an important first step toward improving the efficiency of the Federal bureaucracy. Today. the American people are highly suspicious and increasingly cynical about how their Government spends their hardearned tax dollars. This legislation can begin to reverse that perception. Mr. Speaker. I commend the work of Chairman CONYERS and ranking minority member CLINGER for bringing this bill to the floor in an expedited fashion.

The primary purpose of the bill is to increase the access of the public to public information that the Federal Government holds and to have that access be in electronic form. This is truly a bipartisan effort to make changes that in our opinion are long overdue. The gentleman from Wisconsin quite correctly outlined what the bill is going to do. What I want to do for a minute is talk about what the bill is not going to do. There is nothing in the bill that authorizes the Superintendent of Documents to impose conditions or requirements on the creation. dissemination. redissemination. use or reuse of Federal electronic information or electronic directories by Federal agencies or the public. We are not creating a clearinghouse. an approval ground. an editing structure. We are creating a throughchannel so that the public can access public information. In addition to that. Mr. Speaker. nothing in this legislation should be construed so as to authorize an increase in funding. Rather. it is the intent of the committee that the Government Printing Office implement the system of access. the electronic directory. and the electronic storage facility within the current Government Printing Office budget. Such a requirement should compel the Government Printing Office to find cost savings from existing services. As I said. Mr. Speaker. it is long overdue for the public to have direct electronic access to public information. This bill provides it in an efficent. foolproof. and financially reasonable method. Mr. Speaker.

The provisions of title III are absolutely essential to ensuring the continued success of commemorative coin programs. First. title III includes a sense of the Congress resolution that Congress should not pass enabling legislation for more than two commemorative coin programs per year unless otherwise advised by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The committee was established in the 102d Congress to comment on the selection of subjects and designs for commemorative coins. This provision recognizes the limited manufacturing capability of the mint and the limited purchasing power of those who are interested and purchase commemorative coins. Second. title III of the bill will require those organizations who benefit from the sale of commemorative coins to submit quarterly financial statements and a final report to the mint.

H.R. 789 was carefully drafted to ensure a successful sales program at no cost to the U.S. Treasury.

Monticello is the only American home ever named to UNESCOs World Heritage List. Monticellos share of the proceeds will fund its first general endowment and advance its primary mission of education and preservation. The endowment will support structural repairs to the property itself. acquisition of Jeffersons personal possessions and educational scholarships. Poplar Forest was designed and built by Thomas Jefferson as his personal retreat. It was struck twice by fire and underwent renovations that changed its style and appearance. Painstaking research was required to establish exactly what the House looked like in Jeffersons time. Now supporters are in a race against time to proceed with restoration before the building suffers irreparable structural damage.

Mr. Jeffersons monumental achievements are well known to all of us here. Fifty years ago when this Nation commemorated the 200th anniversary of Thomas Jeffersons birth.

Fourteen million dollars is needed before the ground can be broken for the memorial. So far only $1.5 million has been raised.

Mr. Speaker. this memorial will not be an ordinary one. It will tell the story of what these brave women have done. The memorial will house an educational center with a computer containing a registercomplete with the pictures and stories of women who have served the U.S. Military. To date. nearly 100.000 women veterans have come forward to share their stories and memories for inclusion in the memorials computer data base. There are currently 1.2 million living women veterans and 400.000 women on active duty in the Guard and the Reserves. An estimated 100.000 to 200.000 women have died for this country since the Revolutionary War. For too long we have ignored their legacy and their example.

H.R. 1926 reauthorizes the Office of National Drug Control Policy for fiscal year 1994. and in addition makes several substantive changes to the authorities and responsibilities of that office. The Committee on Government Operations has conducted extensive oversight of ONDCP and how it has operated during the 5 years since it was created. That oversight has raised important questions about the ability of the office to direct the Nations Federal counternarcotics efforts. H.R. 1926 addresses many of these questions. It makes several changes that will strengthen the Director of National Drug Control Policy in his ability to provide effective leadership. while requiring greater accountability for counternarcotics programs. The bill authorizes ONDCP to require agencies to include specific initiatives consistent with the National Drug Control Strategy in their budget proposals to OMB. Such authority will help ensure that all Federal agencies are working with. and not counter. to that strategy. H.R. 1926 also requires the thorough evaluation of all domestic and international counternarcotics programs. These evaluations will provide crucial information about the programs that we fund. Previous evaluations of our counternarcotics efforts have focused on casual drug use. amounts of drugs seized. and other measures that do not go to the heart of hardcore drug use. These requirements will finally provide meaningful information on how effective we have been in reducing drug use. in reducing the availability of drugs. and in developing successful drug treatment programs. In addition. H.R. 1926 makes the Director a member of the National Security Council. This will enhance the Directors ability to develop national and international efforts to counter the drug threat.

I think it also. appropriately. should honor his talents. His training. of course. came from the ward politics of Boston and were shaped by Massachusetts politics as well. I think Tip ONeill personified the Democrats of the mid2th century at a time in which the Democrats retained majority control in the House of Representatives throughout virtually his entire career as a Member of the House of Representatives. including the entire time that he was Speaker. Mr. Speaker. it has been said of Tip ONeill that his politics were basically rewarding friends and punishing enemies. not that Republicans were necessarily enemies. but Republicans were friends off the floor. I have a number of vivid memories of Tip. up close and personal. In terms of attempting to either influence or cow me. I can only imagine how it would have been had I been a member of his party. since I was a member of the opposition party. it almost might be fitting to ask that the resolution be amended to request that every Democrat who honors the memory of Tip ONeill walk a mile in Republicans shoes to fully appreciate the Speaker of the House and the talents that he displayed. But let me say that I think it is entirely appropriate that this resolution honors him in a way that he would not have found acceptable in life. and that is with frugality. Mr. Speaker. I am going to ask the gentleman from North Carolina to engage in a colloquy with me. I understand that. although H.Res. 329 designates 1994 as a year to honor former Speaker Tip ONeill that no expenditures from the contingent fund will be utilized to support any activities associated with this designated year. is that correct?",

I wish to thank my colleague. the gentleman from California for calling this special order and allowing us to speak on the issue of the 79th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Mr. Speaker. today Members of the House of Representatives sadly commemorate the 79th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. I want to recognize the hard work of my good friend. the gentleman from California . for calling this special order. Today. I must first askHow can words ever express the tragic loss of over 1 million innocent people? Yet. the very fact that genocide is so incomprehensible. strengthens the need to speak out. to commemorate. and to remember the Armenian tragedy. Denial and silence compound the crime against humanity that was committed by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1923. Only when all sides recognize the depth and scope of the Armenian genocide can we move forward in building trust and peace in this troubled region. As a country. the United States has been blessed by the Armenian populations in our communities who are descendants of those who were forced into exile. As immigrants fleeing persecution and death. many Armenians found safety and a new way of life in America. With determination and dignity they started over. established roots. and became contributing members of our society. Such survival is a tribute to their strength and reaffirms that the United States acceptance of thousands of persecuted Armenians is a part of our history and tradition that deserves recognition. These Armenians and their children and grandchildren shall never forget less fortunate individuals--the thousands upon thousands who died. and those who survived struggling for self determination in their homeland. Those of us who are not of Armenian descent must also never forget the Armenian genocide. It serves as a tragic reminder that unchecked and abusive government power has and can lead to the deaths of over a million innocent people.",

Beginning in 1915 and until 1923. over 1.5 million Armenians died as a result of persecution by the Ottoman Empire. The massacre of the Armenian people was a systematic program to cleanse the Ottoman Empire of the Armenian people. Armenians were displaced from their homes and subject to torture. mutilation. and Inhumane treatment. This type of ethnic cleansing Is still frequent today. in the former Yugoslavia. the Caucausus. Rwanda and Burundi. We still live In a world where racial bigotry and persecution rule the governments and lead the people of various nations.

It is one more step along the way to ending up with the force specified by President Clinton in his BottomUp Reviewa plan that I believe will ultimately compromise our readiness and put our service people at greater risk. The BottomUp Review also perpetuates a faulty view of future military challenges and our ability to meet them. Though I recognize that times have changed and our military forces must undergo reductions. this bill cuts bone. not just muscle. That said. it also includes provisions that I am convinced are important and necessary to our Nations defense. It is for these reasons. that this measure has my support. This legislation increases the pay raise for our military personnel from the inadequate 1.6 percent requested by the President to 2.6 percent. a level that more closely matches the real Increase in the cost of living. This pay raise will provide an urgently needed incentive for the best and brightest of our military personnelwho serve today under increasingly difficult circumstancesto remain in the service. It authorizes $3.65 billion in funding for an item that I consider to be absolutely crucial to our Nations continued ability to support our security strategy overseas--CVN76. our next nuclearpowered aircraft carrier. We absolutely must provide the funding necessary to move ahead with this critical program In fiscal year 1995 if we are to ensure our ability to protect our most vital interests and address the threats that are certain to arise in the 21st century.

I believe that the key to maintaining the longterm security of the United States is a strong national defense. I am sure that many ot my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree with me when I say this. With the ending ot the cold war. it has become necessary for us to reexamine the needs of the American military. As U.S. military activity in Desert Storm demonstrated. there is an increasing need for the capability to make precision conventional strikes anywhere in the world. By allocating the funding necessary to equip the B2 bomber with GATS/GAM technology. we are ensuring that the U.S. military will have these capabilities. By approving the GATSGAM lunding. we will enable the B2 Stealth bomber to make precision conventional strikes anywhere in the world from bases In this country at a minimum risk to the lives of American servicemen and women and at a minimum cost to the American taxpayer. By approving the GATS/GAM funding. we will arm the B2 Stealth bomber with a weapon superior to current precision conventional weaponry. GATS/GAM technology can be used in all weather conditions. unlike laserguided bombs. GATS/GAM technology can also be deployed on longrange aircraft. unlike current precision gravity bombs. By approving the GATS/GAM funding. we will arm the U.S. military with longrange precision strike capability 3 to 4 years sooner than would otherwise be possible. GATS/GAM weaponry will demonstrate 60foot accuracy by mid1995 and 20foot accuracy by mid1996. Twentyfoot accuracy. Mr. Chairman. thats about the distance between your chair and my podium. Any comparable precision weaponry will not be ready for deployment until 1999. Mr. Chairman. it Is clear to me that we must approve the funding necessary to equip the B2 Stealth bomber with GATS/GAM technology. Arming the U.S. military with the capability to make precision strikes with conventional weapons anywhere in the world is a step that must be taken to support a strong national defense. GATS/GAM technology is one of the keys to ensuring the longterm security of the United States. and we must approve its funding.",

H.R. 4301. the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995. continues to reduce our national defense to the point where the U.S. will be unable to support our countrys defense needs. military force levels. and readiness. Mr. Chairman. lets take a look at defense spending over the last few years. Since 1986 defense spending has decreased 35 percent. by the Presidents own numbers. Today. only 17.8 percent of the Federal budget is spent on defense. the lowest since 1940. As a percentage of gross domestic product. defense spending is 3.9 percent. the lowest since 1948. While were gutting defense. domestic social spending continues to spiral out of control. I will not support this bill because these severe cuts are beginning to undermine our national security and will return the state of our defense to the hollow forces ol the 1930s and late 1970s. I would. however. like to take this opportunity to express my strong support for the provision in the bill that eliminates the disparity between civil service and military retiree COLAs. The disparity. enacted as a part of Mr. Clintons 1993 tax plan. unfairly singlesout military retirees by delaying their COLAs until April 1994 and until October in every year thereafter until 1998. I was pleased to have cosponsored H.R. 3023 to eliminate this unfair treatment of our military retirees as well as join many of my colleagues in sending a letter to Chairman MARTIN SA3O of the House Budget Committee requesting his support in correcting this disparity. Mr. Chairman. we must honor the promise we made to our military retirees and eliminate this unfair COLA treatment. They have served this country with honor and courage and we should give to them what they are owed. Although I will oppose this authorization bill.

Department of Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 1995. cap spending on the first two Seawol submarines. SSN21 and SSN22. at $4.673 billion. The Seawo/f program has been plagued by documented production problems. delays. and cost overruns. What began as $4.4 billion for two subs is now estimated to cost $4.7 billion. $300 million more than planned. Our Nation is struggling to meet national defense needs with a drastically reduced budget. Our guiding philosophy has been to make our Armed Forces leaner. more efficient. more mobile. and more effective. How building a large. incredibly expensive new class of submarine fits into this overall scheme is beyond me. In the meantime. we are lorging ahead to put a number of highly capable Los Angeles class attack submarines into early retirement. This is clearly a case of misplaced priorities. Simply put. the Seawolf is a luxury that we cannot afford in the age of $200 billion budget deficits. and with an administration looking to cut $156 billion from the defense budget over 5 years. Continuing to pour money into the Seawolf sinkhole is a bad deal for. the taxpayers and for our national defense. Finally. while I am glad to support the spending cap in the PorterPenny amendment. I am dismayed that this will only alfect the two Seawolfs already in production. We need to stop the administrations plan to purchase a third Seawolf. SSN23. a move that will save taxpayers another $2.5 billion. I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 4100. which would cap the Seawo/f Program at two subs. This bill has been endorsed by Citizens Against Government Waste. the National Taxpayers Union. and Citizens for a Sound Economy. For the cost of one Seawolf. we can repair and overhaul 10 Los Angeles class attack submarines. This approach provides our Armed Forces with the flexibility needed to address numerous regional conflicts. I believe this is a far better use of our limited resources given the world situation today. I urge the Rules Committee to make in order an amendment to limit Seawoll production to two submarines. Let this proposal come to the floor for a full and open debate.",

While everyone concurs that spending levels of our military should be carefully reviewed and that overall defense spending should be reduced. our cutbacks should not endanger the lives of our men and women who are placed in harms way defending our Nations interests. Unfortunately. many of the funding levels and policies the Democrats and President Clinton requested in H.R. 4301. the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. have failed to protecl our national security interests. It will be Impossible to reconcile the Nations declining defense resources with the Clinton administrations continuing commitment of U.S. military personnel to operations around the world. Our national defense Is already cut to the bone. The fiscal year 1995 defense budget represents the 10th consecutive year of real defense cuts. Under Clintons budget. defense will be reduced from 18 percent of the Federal budget in 1995 to 13.2 percent by 1999. As a percentage of GDP. it will decline to 2.8 percent by 1999the lowest since the Great Depression. It is for these reasons that I cannot support the 1995 National Defense Authorization Act.

It went to the Senate. They have not acted on this amendment. No one voted against the amendment in the House earlier last year. What the amendment does is it clarifies the promotion of Reserve and National Guard officers. it makes it easier to find out about promotions and discharges of military reserve officers. and it is just a codification clearing up Reserve and National Guard officers serving for their country. Mr. Chairman. I ask for support of the en bloc amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. today. I am pleased to offer an amendment which would provide explicit authority to the Secretary of Defense to accept gifts fr DOD domestic elementary and secondary schools for dependents. also known as Section 6 schools. The Secretary has such authority to accept gifts for DOD dependent schools located overseas. so it only makes sense that he have such authority with respect to domestic schools. This discrepancy was thankfully brought to my attention by Wendy A. Steiger. president of the Fort Jackson Elementary Schools Board. Fort Jackson. SC. The lack of explicit authority to accept gifts makes it difficult for parent groups and other organizations to donate items such as computers. library equipment. books and playground equipment to section 6 schools. Currently. if a gift is offered. it must be accepted by the service secretary as a gift to the service which then transfers the gift to the school. This is a cumbersome process which makes gift giving difficult. Because of this. many schools are accepting items on a loan basis. There ought not to be any obstacles which inhibit or act as a disincentive to the donation of needed educational materials like books and computers. My amendment. by giving the Secretary of Defense the same authority he already enjoys with respect to DOD overseas schools. will facilitate the acceptance of gifts. This is an important issue for our military families and ultimately. for our children. Mr. Chairman. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Goss].",

And certainly the Committee on Education and Labor ought to take that up. and encourage them to do it. I support this program though and oppose the amendment because this is a unique program of the kind that I hope we will explore. As I visit businesses in my district. and particularly manufacturing businesses. what they have said to me is. of all of the training programs that are out there. they would like a training program that involves them directly. and that they are personally. the businesses are personally involved in designing the training program for their own workers. So this program. first of all. I think. is located in the right department of our Government. in the Department of Commerce. which is where this critical issue of training current workers ought to be lodged. And second. it is a program that involves the Government through its support. but directly to business. and the community college system of our country. which I think is where the most effective Job training is going on. So to me this responds very specifically to the request from the manufacturing businesses that I have talked to for a target program that addresses their needs specifically. I urge the defeat of the amendment. but I encourage the gentleman and his colleague. the gentleman from Wisconsin . to go after the duplication and the wasteful programs that exist in the other areas of the Government.",

This amendment diverts this body from our efforts to improve competitiveness. to assist small business and the middle class. It is specifically this type of amendment which give open rules a bad name. Mr. Chairman. let me review where we are. The committee included in this bill a standard. boilerplate provision. contained in many. many bills passed by the House and long enacted into Federal law which. simply requires the Secretary to the extent possible to set aside 10 percent of the loan guarantees under this bill to businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and women. as defined by the Small Business Act. Congress has adopted this policy. time and time again. as a modest effort to remediate the decades of welldocumented discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities that have prevented them from full participation in the U.S. economic mainstream. Mr. Chairman. present law is very clear that these types of setasides are aimed at individuals who have been disadvantaged because of race. ethnic origin. gender. and physical handicapnot sexual preference. Mr. Chairman. there are no court cases construing the Small Business Act to include homosexuals as a socially and economically disadvantaged minority. The Small Business Administration is aware of no instances in which homosexuals have attempted to claim such status under their act. The SBA regulations are clear that discrimination is based on race. ethnic origin. gender. or physical handicapnot on sexual preference. Mr. Chairman. at best. this amendment is a solution in search of a problem. If the gentleman from California truly feels we are facing a problem. the appropriate place to address this issue is in the Small Business Act. where changes in the law would control numerous statutes which refer to this definition. However. the aims of this bill are too important to be diverted by irrelevant issues. So that we can continue our efforts to improve the economy of this country and to improve the competitiveness of American business. we will accept the amendment on this side despite its irrelevance and lack of necessity.",

Now is the time for Congress and the executive branch to band together. and join in a partnership with our countrys manufacturers and universities to provide good jobs for the future. The actions we take today are not without precedence. The Japanese have been doing this for years. In fact. the Japanese manufacturing miracle is no miracle at all. Japanese manufacturing is the powerful international player it is today. in part. because of the tremendous investment the Japanese Government has made in manufacturing outreach. Government entities in Japan invest about $500 million each year in their manufacturing sector. compared to about $79 million by the United States. Japanese universities. government agencies. and industry all work together to create jobs and opportunity for their citizens. We should expect the same from our country whose economy is twice the size of the Japanese economy. This bill is one more example of a concrete step we can take now to help provide good quality jobs for the future. H.R. 820 will help identify those technologies which are most important for the future of our economy. This bill will require Government to cooperate with the private sector by: Helping remove impediments to technological development. improving manufacturing infrastructure. easing access to capital. improving training and education of workers. and promoting international standards favorable to American goods. Between 1972 and 1987. my home State of Maryland lost approximately 40.000 manufacturing jobs which have had a significant impact on our economy.

Many citizens in the Milford area did not want their contributions going to .tupport other churches. As a result. several people of the Baptist community came together to form their own church. They have been reaching out to the community ever since their founding 140 years ago. Many of the churchs 110 active members have gone out and volunteered in the community. One of the places in the community that has benefited from their generosity is the local homeless shelter. Additionally. many church members have served in Baptist missions around the world. The church was founded in 1853 and soon after that a building was found in Milford that suited their needs perfectly. The property was bought from the Italian club that occupied it at the time. It was then converted into a church. Services are still being held in that original building. One of the churchs programs that has inspired many of the church members has been the Angel Tree Program. Each Christmas. the children of the Sunday School adopt 30 or 40 children of whom one or both of their parents have ueen incarcerated. The children give them a Christmas. Food and presents are supplied. along with plenty of love and support. The present pastor. Paul Traverse. brought much to the church when he arrived on their doorstep 5 years ago. The most important thing that he brought. one of the members said. was his seven gifted children. who brought with them their musical abilities and joyous aense ot family that they have shared with all. This has enlightened and inspired the church members. and as a result. many inactive members have come back to the fold. Mr. Speaker.

Their exemplary efforts in the name of children bring us closer to a world without birth defects. child abuse. and neglect. For nearly 20 years. Christine Antoskiewicz has been a voice for the rights of abused children who may not have been able to speak for themselves. She has taken a leading role as an advocate of childrens rights in both her professional and private lives. Since 1964. she has worked at the Macomb County Juvenile Court Division. rising to her present position as supervisor of the Community Provisional Release Program with the Macomb County Youth Home. Giving of her own time. Ms. Antoskiewicz has strengthened community support for ShelterCare. an outreach program for abused or neglected children. William B.

These retirees. ones who gave at least 20 years in our armed services. are currently being denied prescription drug benefits because they live in the wrong ZIP Code. Last year. the Department of Defense [DOD] instituted a prescription drug demonstration project to help military retirees who were adversely impacted by the closure and realignment of many of our military bases. However. the way DOD decided who was eligible for this program was ZIP Code. Those whose ZIP Code is within the invisible 40mile radius around Carswell Air force Base are eligible. those who are not. tough.

Much of this knowledge has been provided through the research of a unique organization whose main research center is in my Congressional District.

Since its founding in 1969. the Foundation has been dedicated to working toward the reduction of avoidable chronic disease through preventive medicine.

Aware of the fact that other steps toward disease prevention can and must be taken. the leaders of the foundation. and its visionary founder. Dr. Ernst L.

The contributions he made to music In Michigan will not be forgotten. Mr. Wilmer Schaeff. known as Willie to his friends. was born in Saginaw. MI. on June 5. 1934. The third of seven children In his family. Willies musical career started when his parents bought an accordion for his oldest brother. At the age of 15 he started playing publicly with various bands. eventually studying music at Delta College. In 1972 he formed his own band called the Music Chefs. Throughout this time he spread Joy to all the people who listened to his expertise. Whether it be at local clubs. halls. or taverns there was always a large crowd on hand to hear and feel his music. They truly enjoyed all that Willie gave them. On March 23. 1957. Willie married Marie Herbin. It was because of Marie that Willie decided to learn how to play the plectrum banjo. He quickly taught himself and soon was entertaining at various events. They were the parents of four children. three girls and a boy. Willie served in the Army for 2 years. is a 31year member of the Pattern Makers League and also belonged to the Saginaw Musical Association.

By allowing tile Secretary of the Interior to impose landuse restrictions on private property within these desIgnated heritage areas without providing any compensation to the affected property owners. this bill will lead to more abuses In the historic preservation process. I cannot understand why we are givIng more control to a department where one of its own historic preservation officials said: * * * the greatest threats to historic propertles. natural resources. scenic values. and national parks come not from Federal agencies but from private parties. doing private things on private lands. In my own congressional district. this way of thinking is being used over the overwhelming opposition of surrounding counties to declare an entire mountain a historic district. Based on claims that It is of religious significance to American Indian tribes. the keeper of tlte National Register of Historic Places has decided to designate 235 square miles and over 1.000 private parcels of land as a historic district. The area in question. better known as Mount Shasta. contains no physical evidence of the activities that are being designated as historic. The reason for the designation. I believe. is primarily to halt economic development in the community. Mir. Chairman. this bill is just another Trojan horse to restrict more of our private property rights. Vote \"no\" on this bill and on any amendments that further weaken private property rights. Finally. I urge your \"aye\" vote on the TauzinGrams amendment which provides private property assurances.",

The bill establishes a new method of designating and managing nationally important heritage areas. Specifically. H.R. 5044 creates a partnership with State and local governments. as well as private entities. to preserve these historical regions by allowing communities to develop and implement operation and management plans. This new partnership will go a long way in preserving valuable historical areas while limiting the Federal Governments role and future linancial obligations. I am especially pleased that this legislation includes reauthorization for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. The bill also adds three new towns. Glocester. Smithfield. and Burriville into the corridor. Most importantly. the bill extends the Blackstone Valley commission for 7 additional years. This will allow the commission to continue enhancing the distinctive character and nationally significant resources of the corridor. The Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor is the largest national park in New England. and is widely recognized as the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution. It was here. at Slater Mill. where the first successful waterpowered cotton spinning mill was used in 1790. This rich area best exemplifies the entire history of the American Industrial Revolution and the complex economic and social relationships of the people who lived and worked there. The Blackstone Valley Heritage Corridor has become an example of how surrounding communities can work together toward a common theme of protecting and promoting their area. This rich and historic national resource needs to be protected so that the history of the Industrial Revolution can be preserved for all generations. Mr. Chairman.

The rules and obligations agreed to by the parties to the agreement will govern international world trade well Into the 21st century. This agreement provides substantial new opportunities for U.S. businesses by breaking down many of the trade barriers that have long prevented free trade throughout the world. While I believe this trade pact on the whole will expand global trade. many of us are concerned about various specific provisions and whether the U.S. trade laws will be so weakened by the agreement that the U.S. manufacturing base will be exposed to unfair trade practices in our own market without real access to a remedy under our laws. It is very important. as we work on the Implementing legislation. that we are careful to ensure strong and effective antidumping. countervailing duty and market access laws. Recently. Jeffrey E. Garten. Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. spoke before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the antidumping laws and U.S. trade policy. Mr. Garlens speech. I believe. provided a sound description of the historical and economic rationales for effective antlidumping laws. It successfully refuted the notion that products dumped by foreign competitors lower consumer costs by demonstrating that the dumping of products into the U.S. market actually undermines our manufacturing base. As a result. U.S. consumers ultimately are captive to Inflated prices imposed by the foreign producers who no longer have any U.S. competition to maintain fair and reasonable pricing. As we prepare for the debate on the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement. I believe it Is helpful for us to read the key points raised by Mr. Garten in his speech.

I strongly support the package of womens and childrens health care benefits that are contained in chairman PAT WILLIAMS version of H.R. 3600. being considered by the Education and Labor Subcommittee on LaborManagement Relations. For women. the benefits in this package are lifegiving. since recovery from cancer depends on early detection. The provisions for screening mammogramsevery 2 years for women in their forties. and annually for women 50 and olderare appropriately comprehensive. coupled with annual clinical breast examinations for all women. It is also appropriate that these services. along with annual pap smears and pelvic examinations for all women of childbearing age. be provided with no costsharing. For children. our most precious resource. the provisions promote healthy development and physical and emotional growth. They expand outpatient rehabilitation services to include coverage for children with chronic and congenital conditions. They also provide hearingald coverage for children under 18. during the crucial years when efficient learning greatly depends on comprehension of spoken language. In addition. by providing these services that both save lives and help to build healthy lives. we are actually saving money in the long run. because preventive care is far and away the most economical care. I am proud that this Congress Is moving toward health care reform that includes prudent. wise. and humane heatlh services for women and children. I urge my colleagues to insist that any final version Include the provisions in the Williams package.",

We have a new consent agreement which essentially provides that all amendments listed must be offered by 3 p.m. today in order for them to be in order. I urge Senators to think long and deep about the meaning of that consent agreement. because it essentially has the effect of saying that If there are amendments up. say. at 1 oclock being extensively debated and we are still on the amendment at 3 oclock. all other amendments on the list are out of order. They cannot be brought up once we reach 3 oclock. So I strongly urge Senators to bring up their amendments now. It is 5 minutes after 9 in the morning. Those amendments brought up now will have a much better chance of being fully debated. I think the Senate will be in recess beginning at 10:40 a.m. in order to accommodate the joint session of Congress. so that Members of both bodies will be able to hear an address by the Prime Minister of India. That Is time which is not available to offer amendments. I also believe there might be other times during the day which would be more difficult for Senators to offer amendments.

Mr. President. when Cineas was sent to Rome by Pyrrhus. the king of Epirus. laden with gifts to buy the Senators and Senators wives. Cineas returned following his mission and reported to Pyrrhus that he had witnessed the Senate of Rome and that it was veritably \"an assemblage of kings.\" This was in 280 B.C. There were no takers of his gifts. About 170 years later. Gaius Sallustlus Crispus. a Roman historian who lived between the years 88 and 34 B.C.. wrote about the conspiracy of Catiline and also about the Jugurthine war which occurred between the years 112 and 105 B.C. Sallustius writes that when the Roman Senate ordered Jugurtha to leave Italy and to return to Africa. Jugurtha passed through the gates of Rome and looked back at the city several times in silence. and finally exclaimed: \"Yonder is a city put up for sale. and its days are numbered if it finds a buyer.\" What a sad commentary upon Rome and the Roman Senate which had so changed after 170 years. The same commentary can very well be said about this city. I am sorry to say it can also be said with respect to this institution. It is like property owned by the special interests. They hold title in fee simple to ita title that is vested in special interests. Eight times. I tried to get cloture on campaign finance reform legislation when I was majority leader during the years 1987 and 1988. There were more cloture motionm against that legislation at that time than ever were filed before or since. and I failed eight times to get cloture. And the current majority leader has tried many times. and he has failed. Mr. President. until the American people understand that campaign finance reform is more important than any other reform and until. as the majority leader stated. they rise up in indignation and say they have had enough. then this institution will continue to be the property of the special interests. We all know it. And it is too bad that the American people just dont get it and realize it to be the case. They are the real losers. I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair.",

I am one of the 8 percent he referred to who has been working hard here to try and get an agreement. I was discouraged to hear from the Senator from Oklahoma that the bill is dead. I would like to bring to his attention those things which I feel would have to be modified in order to reach the agreement that the six or seven of us had to vote for cloture. I would like to comment. and then get your comment. as to whether or not it would be foreseeable to try to get those changes in the time we have left. I commend the Senator for the tremendous work he has done. I have enjoyed working with him. The elements that we have concern about are basically as follows: First of all. the reduction of the PAC limits. The Democrats in the House. who have been holding this process up. came down in their limit. They came down from a $10.000 to a $6.000 total limit for the election cycle. That is not even halfway from where we started. I would hope they would agree to come down at least another $1.000. The more difficult part of the PAC aspect relates to the differences between the House and Senate limits. regarding what percentage of the total money can be used within the spending limits. It is 20 percent for the Senate in PACs and 40 percent for the House. This is in violation of the guideline that we had. They had to be the same. The frank is another area where there is a difference which creates difficulties on this side. As far as the Senate Is concerned. we would have no frank during the election period. whereas. in the House there Is no agreement on this issue. These are. I think. the major areas of concern. I am perhaps an incurable optimist. but I hate to give up.

Unfortunately. that bill was narrowly dofeated in the Senate Judiciary Committee. despite the argument that it might help to avoid the baseball strike which. of course. began a few weeks later. Senator METZENBAUM now offers an even narrower amendment. which does not repeal the full antitrust exemption for the major leagues. Instead. the amendment simply applies the antitrust laws to any unilateral terms imposed in baseball labor negotiations in the absence of a contract. I have had some skepticism about the ability of the antitrust laws to provide a magic bullet to resolve the current baseball labor dispute. However. I am encouraged by the willingness expressed by the players to end their strike if this amendment is adopted. Mr. President. this limited amendment is not intended to and will not resolve the deeper problem of major league baseball not showing sufficient attention to its fans. Nonetheless. I believe this narrowly tailored amendment may have a desirable impact on the baseball strike and urge my colleagues to adopt it.",

We actually need to use Clinton speak. now. no longer the words of Mr. Subliminal. To crack this code. we need to consider the other campaign promises that have been made. For example. President Clintons promise to cut middleclass taxes really meant increased taxes on everyone. especially the middle class. His promise to be a new kind of Democrat really meant he wanted to be a more effective taxer and spender in the finest liberal tradition. Thus. the translation of Clintons campaign promise on the lineitem veto is. \"We need political cover so we can continue to fund porkbarrel projects and continue Government waste.\" That is what we have with this enhanced rescission program that is supposedly going to come up before us today.

Unlike the abortion President. Mr. Speaker. the American people realize that pregnancy is not a disease. that babies are not throw aways. they are not chattel. they are not objects. These little kids deserve better than chemical poisoning and dismemberment by either suction or other means. These kids--like their mothersdeserve our love. our compassion. our respect. Americans know that every abortion stops a beating heart and they do not want their tax dollars being used to subsidize that kind of violent act. Incredibly. the President claims that he wants abortions to be rare. Mr. Clintons actions. however. expose his rhetoric to be nothing more than Orwellian double speak.

I am concerned in central Florida it will hurt senior citizens on fixed incomes. While Secretary OLeary graciously answered individual questions. I left the hearing with the impression that this administration simply does not understand the negative effect the energy tax and its other tax increases will have on our economy. A study by DRI/McGraw Hill sanctioned by the Commerce Department estimated that the energy tax alone will cost America 400.000 jobs by 1998. It also will cost consumers billions of dollars. disproportionately hurting lower income Americans. particularly the elderly and the working poor.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a sad and unfortunate fact that throughout our great Nation this summer baseball fans from Little Leaguers to the President are sorely disappointed that for the eighth time in eight negotiations major league players are on strike. While fans are disappointed. many others feel a real economic impact of the strike. Those communities that host major league teams have lost valuable jobs and millions in revenue because their major league stadiums have all been shuttered by the strike. To make matters worse. in the 2 weeks since the strike began. little progress in resolving the strike has been made and it appears that neither side seems intent on ending the strike any time soon. Frustrated fans sit on the sidelines and watch the remainder of the season dwindle away while the negotiations between players and owners stall. That is why I join today with Congressmen BUNNING. OWENS. and BIURAKIS to introduce the Baseball Fans and Communities Protection Act. This legislation will apply the Federal antitrust laws to major league baseball in a manner designed to spur the now stagnant negotiations between the players and owners of major league baseball. This bill is specifically designed to allow the players to get back to the field while all parties to the strike have their rights and bargaining positions protected through the application of the antitrust laws. The current impasse between owners and players is that owners are committed to imposing a salary cap following the season and players feel the only way to negotiate on the imposition of the salary cap by the owners is to strike now. during the season. when their bargaining leverage is at a maximum. What the Baseball Fans and Communities Protection Act will do is allow the players to retake the field by giving them access to the rights and remedies of the antitrust laws from which major league baseball is currently exempt. I believe giving the players antitrust remedies will preserve their bargaining positioning during the upcoming negotiations without having to resort to a strike. This will allow all parties. players and owners. to sit down and bargain in good faith until an agreement that is satisfactory to both sides is reached. In the meantime. players can play ball. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation. and I look forward to its",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a resolution to designate October 1. 1994. as \"National Incest and Sexual Abuse Healing Day.\" As the crime bill has dominated our attention this week. I think it is important to reflect on why it is so important that anticrime legislation strongly address the problems of sexual abuse through such measures as strengthening evidentiary rules for the prosecution of child molesters and notifying communities when sexual predators are present. The statistics on child abuse and sexual abuse of children are grim. In 1992. 2.9 million child cases were reported to child protective service [CPS] agencies. This represents a 50percent increase in reported child abuse cases between 1985 and 1992. But despite this increase in the reporting of cases. there remain thousands of children whose cries go unheard. In addition. it is estimated that nearly 1.300 child abuse and neglectrelated fatalities in 1992 were confirmed by CPS agenciesan average of over three child deaths a day. Almost 84 percent of these children were under 5 years old at the time of their deaths. The futures of those who survive these crimes follow two paths. The fortunate ones may be able to overcome child abuse by speaking out. creating an open and honest dialog on the subject. Others. unable to come to terms with what has occurred. may face years of physical and emotional problems. Many will grow up to become the next generation of abusers. perpetuating a vicious cycle of violence. Mr. Speaker. I encourage all my colleagues to join me in bringing attention to these crimes and recognizing the brave survivors of incest and child abuse by commemorating October 1. 1994 as \"National Incest and Sexual Abuse Healing Day.\" And I hope we will join together to pass a crime bill that helps protect our children and prevent such crimes in the future.",

With its fieldstone and clapboard houses. period street lamps. and strict building restrictions. the 45household. 4block village invokes the past. Brookeville played a significant role in the events surrounding the War of 1812. On August 26. 1814. President James Madison fled burning Washington. DC. and was given refuge by Henrietta Bentley. wife of the towns postmaster. With the President came his military attache. General Mason. and the Secretary of the Treasury. and the assetsgold barsfrom the National Treasury. For 2 days. our Federal Government was located at the Bentley farm. Later. the Bentley farm was renamed the Madison House in honor of the presidential visit. The town of Brookeville had been laid qut in September 1794 by Richard Thomas. who married Deborah Brookeone of four Brooke sisters. on whose land the town was built. The Maryland State Assembly officially recognized the town of Brookeville in 1808. 5 years later. the town of Brookeville was authorized by the State Assembly to appoint its first constable. By 1890. Brookeville made clear to all visitors who passed through its boundaries that it had an agricultural identity. Many of the towns laws dealt with the conduct of Brookevilles animals. One regulation stated that \"no hogs or hog pen or pens or slaughter house\" were allowed within town limits. nor were barking dogs. The population of the town of Brookeville at the time was 250. making it the third largest town in Montgomery County. The town was incorporated by the State Assembly in 1890. Today. Brookeville has a population of 150. and retains its rural. smalltown flavor. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I want to offer my congratulations to the town of Brookeville and its citizens on its 200th birthday.",

As we in California know all too well. fires in the dry forest of the Los Angeles basin are commonand destructive. Solutions to reduce the number and intensity of the fires are difficult to come by. But Mr. Minaberri is contributing to a solution -with a lowcost. lowtechnology answer that is proving successful. You see. Mr. Minaberri is a successful sheep farmer. And by simply grazing his sheep on ridgetop firebreaks. Mr. Minaberris sheep keep the grasses and brush low. thereby denying fires fuel and thus an opportunity to spread from mountain to mountain. These firefighting sheep benefit just about everyone. sheep included. They are cheaper than machinery. far better for the environment than herbicides. and they help protect the residents of communities threatened by uncontrolled brush fires. In addition. according to Mr. Minaberri. the sheep \"thrive better in the cooler temperatures of the national forests\" than they would in the 100degreeplus heat of the lower altitudes. For his contribution to reducing the number of fires in the LA Basin my hat goes off to Mr. Sebastian Minaberri--an American success story. and a practitioner of one of our greatest arts--common sense.",

Senator MITCHELL and I sponsored the original legislation creating the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in 1984. and I am happy to report that the accomplishments of the Foundation have greatly exceeded our expectations. The Foundation was established as a federally chartered but private and independent. nonprofit organization to serve as a link between Government and private efforts to conserve our fish and wildlife resources. The Foundation is authorized to receive private donations and matching Federal appropriations to benefit fish and wildlife conservation. Since its establishment in 1984. the Foundation has funded 660 projects. providing over $79 million for fish and wildlife conservation projects--of which only $27 million was Federal appropriations. The Foundation successfully raised the remaining $52 million from private and other nonFederal sources. Dollar for dollar the Foundation is one of the most effective organizations for implementing conservation projects. matching every Federal dollar with $2 in nonFederal contributions. As impressive as these numbers may be. the Foundations role as a catalyst for conservation efforts goes beyond the specific projects funded. The Foundation has been at the forefront of the effort to form partnerships between Government agencies. conservation organizations. individuals. and corporations interested in conservation of our natural resources. Not only do these partnerships help to stretch scarce Federal dollars. but they encourage greater public participation in conservation programs. setting the stage for future initiatives. The Foundation has also been instrumental in getting important projects off the ground by providing seed money and expertise. including the North American waterfowl management plan. an initiative to benefit declining populations of waterfowl. Partners in Flight. a program to conserve neotropical migratory birds. including songbirds. and conservation training and education programs. The Foundation. with our support. will continue to be in the forefront of innovative and costeffective methods to advance the conservation of our fish and wildlife.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join once again with my colleague. the distinguished junior Senator from Michigan. in introducing the Preemption and Clarification Act of 1993. My colleague and I introduced this bill during the 102d Congress in response to the burgeoning number of preemption cases on the dockets of our Nations courts and other attendant problems. Congress has enacted some 350 laws since 1789 which preempt State and local authority. As my colleague. Senator LEVIN. has pointed out. over half of these laws have been enacted in the last 20 years. Article VI of the Constitution. the supremacy clause. states that Federal laws made pursuant to the Constitution. \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\" In short. this means that any State or local law in conflict with a constitutionally enacted Federal law is negated or preempted. Should there be a question of jurisdiction. we may look to the 10th amendment. which prescribes that \"the powers not delegated to the United States. are reserved to the States respectively. or to the People.\" Unfortunately. Mr. President. the numbers indicate that the issue of Federal preemption of State and local authority has increasingly dominated intergovernmental relations. and internecine conflict during the past halfcentury. The chief cause of this conflict is Congress failure to explicitly define its intent when formulating legislation that affects State and local authority. The resulting ambiguity is then resolved. not by Congress. which. through its failure to be clear. surrenders its role. but by the courts. Congress should determine preemption issues. as is intended under the supremacy clause. not the courts. The Senator from Michigan and I offer this legislation as a means to resolve this problem. In short. the bill provides that no Federal statute shall preempt any State and local law unless such preemption is specifically stated or there is a direct conflict which cannot be reconciled. This legislation would not create new powers for Congress or the States. nor would it expropriate the authority of State or local governments. The bill would. however. ensure that Congress makes its intent clear when preempting State or local law. Should Congress fail to clearly articulate its intent. this legislation would ensure that the benefit of the doubt lies with the State or local government.* By Mr. SIMON (for himself. Mr.",

This bill amends section 612(a)(1) of title 38. United States Code. to ensure that all former prisoners of war receive outpatient care. I would like to point out that this bill passed the Senate in both the 101st and 102d Congresses. but. unfortunately. it was not signed into law. I think everyone agrees that the development of medical treatment policy for POWs has been a long. arduous process. but in recent years it has grown into a comprehensive system meeting most of their needs. For example. in determining service connection. former POWs have the benefit of every reasonable doubt because of the obvious lack of records regarding their imprisonment. This has made it easier to assess severe physical and mental damage from brutality. torture. hunger. and disease. Now more than ever. we need to make a commitment to former prisoners of war. The uncertainty and the brutality of the imprisonment endured by former POWs does not vanish upon release but remains throughout life. We owe special consideration to those who are imprisoned while fighting for the United States. and it is our obligation to provide health care to our POWs who suffered for love of their country. My bill will correct a problem arising from Public Law 100322 which guarantees inpatient care to POWs but restricts outpatient care to those with 50 percent or more disability. This restriction is not acceptable in light of the sacrifice these brave Americans have made for our country. Mr. President.

I am pleased we are considering March as \"Womens History Month.\" which sets aside the month for us. as a nation. to recognize the countless contributions of women. In my own home State of Utah. women have always played vital roles in nearly every capacity. Utahs heritage of women is unique. In 184647. many endured trying hardships that are unfathomable in our day. Leaving the comforts of their own hometowns. pioneer women traveled across the plains. pushing and pulling handcarts. to settle in a valley that would protect and provide for them and their families. Many buried their children along the way in search of a better life free from religious persecution. Physical afflictions were abundant. Not a few succumbed to the elements. Those fortunate enough to survive the long trek then had to till the vast. dry earth of the West to continue to survive. A few years before. the first womens organization in the United States was formed. which is known as the Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. Starting with only 20 members in rural America in 1842. the Relief Society has grown to 3.2 million members worldwide today. In addition to housing the headquarters of the first womens organization in the United States. Utah was the second State to allow women the right to vote in 1896.

The destruction of the Kulaks. Jewish Holocaust. Pol Pots extermination of millions of Cambodians are but a few that come to mind. Even today. Saddam Hussein attempts to erase the marsh Arabs and Kurds. and the Serbs continue to practice their own form of ethnic cleansing. It is fitting that today we commemorate the Armenian genocide. However. how even more fitting it would be if we could mark this sad occasion knowing that we had done all that was in our power to put such outrages behind us. How fitting it would be to remember such anniversaries as a thing out of our dark past. rather than as a scourge of our own time. or a foreboding preamble to our childrens future.",

Beginning in 1915 and continuing until 1923. the Ottoman Empire carried out a planned extermination of the Armenian people. During this peorid 1.5 million Armenians were killed and 500.000 exiled from the Ottoman Empire. In 1915. newspaper headlines told of mass starvation and drownings of Armenians. Henry Morganthau. our Ambassador to Armenia at the time. telegraphed the Secretary of State on July 15. 1915. and had this to report: Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses It appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress under pretext of reprisal against rebellion. Tragically. no one came to the rescue of the Armenians. Equally tragic is the fact that the Republic of Turkey denies the genocide. I am a strong supporter of Turkey. an important ally and friend of the United States. Just as the United States faces up to our mistreatment of black Americans. native Americans and others. the Turks must face up to the genocide of the Armenians. This genocide was not carried out by the existing government which is a democracy. but by the Ottoman Empire. We must be able to discuss history openly with our allies. We strengthen our democracy by acknowledging these tragedies. The danger of not facing up to history is demonstrated by the statement Adolf Hitler made during his planning of the Holocaust against the Jews. Hitler said. \"Who today speaks of the extermination of the Armenians?\" The Armenian genocide was a terrible tragedy. To look away would be a greater tragedy. That is why on this 79th anniversary of the Armenian genocide we remember not only the Armenians who died in this senseless killing but also the efforts of Armenians and ArmenianAmericans who have struggled to pressure the Turks to acknowledge the Armenian genocide.",

Many fell prey to forced marches which led to starvation and disease. while others were victims of executions and massacres. Armenians refer to this period as their national genocide and an event of such magnitude deserves pause: To honor those tragic victims of this dreadful period and to salute those brave souls who survived and were able to rebuild their lives.

This legislation reflects significant bipartisan efforts to provide much needed reform of our bankruptcy laws by addressing new issues which have arisen and attempting to streamline the bankruptcy system. The bill is the result of numerous hearings before the Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice over a long period to consider various bankruptcy issues and their effect on the bankruptcy community. S. 540 represents a comprehensive reform of the Bankruptcy Code. The first title of this legislation addresses Issues Involving Individual debtors and bankruptcy court administration. This title seeks to encourage individual debtors to file chapter 13 bankruptcies. if possible. as opposed to liquidating under chapter 7. Other provisions of this title will increase the maximum eligibility limits for filing a bankruptcy under chapter 13. and require that the debtor be examined under oath to determine if he or she fully understands the consequences of filing a bankruptcy. Title 1I addresses a number of commercial and credit issues in bankruptcy. It seeks to clarify bankruptcy law with respect to Employee Retirement Income Security Act pension fund assets and encourages bankruptcy courts to begin payments under a chapter 13 plan as soon as possible. Title III relates to a variety of consumer bankruptcy issues. including greater protection for children and former spouses who are beneficiaries of child support or alimony payments. Title IV establishes a National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study problems relating to the Bankruptcy Code and develop proposals to make the bankruptcy process more effective and efficient. The Commission will report its findings to Congress for appropriate action. The final two titles of the legislation contain technical corrections. Mr. President. in my home State of South Carolina. as in the rest of the Nation. bankruptcy filings have increased dramatically in recent years. The Congress must take steps to ensure that the bankruptcy system is not overwhelmed by this increase and the problems which have accompanied it. The bill we are considering today contains many necessary reforms that will assist in making the system more efficient. I believe that overall this legislation is fair to all parties. and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 540. the Bankruptcy Amendments Act.",

My only regret is that this amendment is only a sense of the Senate and is not. in fact. binding. It is impossible to explain to residents of this country why elected officials deserve or warrant the special perk of being able to pull into a busy parking lot at Dulles or National Airportand get free parking at any hour of the day. It is time to ban this needloss special perk. In addition. at both National and Dulles. significant amounts of construction are currently underway. Traffic in and out Is tremendous. and access to parking lots is tough. particularly on a busy Friday evening. Imagine the frustration that touristsall of them a constituent of one Senator or anothermust feel as they struggle with their luggage. get out of a parking lot bus and look over their shoulder to see an empty or halfempty parking lot marked with a sign that says: \"Reserved Parking: Supreme Court Justices. Members of Congress. Diplomatic Corps.\" I know that some of my colleagues in the House and here in the Senate will say that by having parking reserved at the airports. more business gets done here because less time is needed in traveling to and from planes. But for men and women anywhere else. if work or some other task keeps them late they do not have the option of zipping into their free parking spot at the movie theater or at the grocery store or at the ball park.

I cast this vote to retain the Senators airport parking even though I almost never use the lot.

Mr. HANSEN. a bill which will have a direct and positive impact on Utahs children: the Utah Schools and Lands Improvement Act of 1993. We cannot In good faith deny our children any opportunity without having first stretched our resources to the very limit. Utah has long allocated a large percentage of its State and local revenue to education. in the face of Federal funding formulas which penalize us. Indeed. we have gone so far as to create a State trust fund. in which the revenue we earn from the use of our vast and beautiful lands Is earmarked for our schools. But many of the Stateowned land parcels have been surrounded by National Parks. National Forests. or Indian reservation. where Infrastructure needs and land management regulations render the parcels virtually worthless. As a resuit. Utahs schools have suffered. But by turning these parcels over to the Federal Government in return for certain tracts of more accessible land. as well as a portion of coal lease revenues on other lands chosen by the State. we can help to ensure adequate resources for the needs of our children without shortchanging the Federal treasury. Mr. Speaker. for the good of the children of Utah. I look forward to the prompt consideration of this bill by the House of Representatives.

A new GATT agreement that ensures free and fair trade could bring tremendous benefits to American agriculture by opening more world markets to U.S. farmers and ranchers. Sound agreements must be reached in other key sectors. such as telecommunications. banking. insurance. intellectual property rights. and Government procurement markets. The most important decisions to date. involving 108 nations. are soon to be reached.

That deadline is approaching rapidly. Now is the most sensitive time for the negotiations. Estimates of the worldwide economic benefits from a Uruguay round trade agreement have ranged from $200 billion to $1 trillion. Selecting a bipartisan Senate observer group to attend the GATT negotiations would send ameaningful message to the other GATT countries that the United States is intent on achieving a balanced revision of the GATT. Given the positive roles previous observer groups have played in arms control negotiations and other areas. a Senate observer group could be a valuable asset to our U.S. negotiators. Mr. President. today I am asking the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Republican leader to establish a U.S. Senate observer group to the Uruguay round GATT negotiations. I hope that such a group can be formed and I ask unanimous consent that my letters to the Senate leadership be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased today to pay tribute and thank an outstanding South Dakota educator and my good friend. Mr. John Reynolds. for his tremendous contributions to South Dakotas higher education system. John served as president of National College in Rapid City from 1982 to 1984. In 1984. he was named president of Huron University in Huron. SD. He took over the reins of a 110yearold university that was on the brink of closing its doors because of low student enrollment and financial difficulties. Under Johns leadership. the turnaround of Huron University was almost instantaneous. After a decade of budget deficits. John engineered a university budget that began having a positive cashflow. Through Johns careful planning and foresight. Huron University is now in good fiscal health. During Johns tenure. Huron University more than rebounded. Indeed. its stamp of excellence was felt in all corners of the globe. Huron University now operates campuses in Tokyo and London. the only American university with campuses on three different continents. In addition. the university expanded to Sioux Falls. SD. This expansion. coupled with a streamlining of the curriculum. has caused enrollment to grow from 280 students in 1984 to more than 1.200 this yeara 400percent increase in enrollment in 8 years. In that time the university has made the transition from near extinction to worldrenowned excellence. It is a vibrant. thriving center for learning. Much of the credit for this extraordinary transformation goes to John Reynolds. Recently. John announced his resignation from Huron University to accept a similar position at TriState University in northeast Indiana. South Dakotas loss surely is Indianas gain. John is a remarkable person whose friendship I have appreciated over the years. His advice on Federal financial aid programs has been invaluable to me. He will be missed by all Huron students and all South Dakotans who had the opportunity to know him. His presence will be missed. but his contributions to the university will be felt in the years to come. We all wish him the best in his new position.",

Wheaton College exists to fulfill a Christian missionto stand \"for Christ and His Kingdom.\" It defines that purpose through its passion for intellectual excellence and individual character. Dr. Chase has been a faithful steward of that vision. bringing unique talents to a high calling. He leaves Wheaton College more financially secure. He oversaw an aggressive program of campus building and renovation. He undertook longrange planning to guide Wheaton into the next century. He expanded academic programs. He won a number of professional awards. He has been an educator of influence. and a respected Christian leader. This legacy has earned the appreciation of parents. alumni. and teachers.

A personal tragedy prompted Pete to lead his public war against handgun violence. The horrible death of his eldest son changed Petes life. Nick Shields was senselessly murdered in San Francisco in 1975a victim of a random shooting. Pete did not allow the anger and grief over the loss of his son to defeat him. Instead. he set out on a journey to save other lives by fighting to reduce the kind of violence that had claimed his son. Starting out with little money and a small staff. Pete Shields launched Handgun Control. Inc. He knocked on doors. visited State legislatures. and pounded the pavement in Washington. And he watched his organization grow to 1 million members. He claimed his share of legislative triumphs as well. Pete and I worked together in the fight to outlaw copkiller bullets and undetectable. plastic handguns. He was also instrumental in getting a ban on the import of Saturday night special parts and a ban on the sale of Saturday night specials in the State of Maryland. One item on Petes agenda remains unfinished. He was a strong advocate of a national waiting period for handgun purchases. In the last Congress I sponsored the legislation which is known as the Brady bill. It was stalled at the end of the session. but things have changed since then. We have a new President who favors the waiting period. I intend to introduce the bill again this Congress. We will pass the Brady bill. And well do it during this Congress. Even though he wont be with us to fight for the bill this time. Pete Shields will deserve a lot of the credit when it passes. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

The Palisades plant is operated by Consumers Power while the D.C. Cook plant is operated by American Electric Power. On the whole. these plants operate reliably and salely. If I didnt think so. the people I love most in this world wouldnt be living near them. No member of the general public has ever been injured by a nuclear powerplant. The greatest problem facing nuclear power is the highlevel radioactive waste produced at every powerplant. This didnt come as a surprise long after nuclear power was developed. Waste was seen as a problem from the earliest days of the nuclear era. when President Roosevelt established the Manhattan project to develop the atomic bombs that ended World War II.

It is the last day of the session. So if you want PILT payments to be increased. vote no on this amendment. vote for the bill. That is the deal. It is that simple. There is no automatic appropriation increase in this bill. none. What is in this bill is the right for your county commissioners for the first time in almost 20 years to come and ask you to go to the appropriators and say. \"Will you give us a little more.\" to your county commissioner than you got 18 years ago. If this amendment passes. the day comes again when that choice is taken away from you and your county commissioners and they are going to be stuck with no inflationary increase. So here is the deal: Oppose this amendment. Let the appropriators have the choice. Give your counties a break and give your property tax payers a break. Every single State in this country with the exception of one. Rhode Island. benefits from PILT payments. Vote against this amendment. Help those other States. Vote for this bill.

The bill would establish the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Corridor in Connecticut and a Commission within the Interior Department to assist with the management of the corridor. Most Importantly. the measure includes my legislation to expand the boundary of the Weir Farm National Historic Site. The National Park Service is authorized to acquire the last two remaining undeveloped parcels of the historic Weir Farm that remain in private ownership. This requires no additional funding authority or appropriations. Although these parcels were a part of the historic Weir Farm and were identified as such when the State of Connecticut and the trust for public land began acquiring the land that eventually became the Weir Farm National Historic Site. the Federal legislation that designated the site moved more quickly than the negotiations between the State and the trust for public land. Not wanting to include land from an owner who was unwilling to be included within the boundaries of a national park site. the sponsors of the authorizing legislation removed these parcels from the boundary maps. The legislation I introduced was prompted by an agreement between the owner of the land. the recent acquisition of the land by the trust for public land. and the expressed Interest by the National Park Service of acquiring the land. The funds to do so have been appropriated. so no new funding authority or appropriations would be required. Moving forward with this acquisition would preclude development of these last remaining privately owned undeveloped parcels. Because these parcels are directly in view of the most visited part of Weir Farm. their undeveloped state is necessary to preserve the aesthetic integrity of the site. This will preserve the landscape as it was in the late 19th and early 20th century when it was painted by thoseled by J. Alden Weirwho became known internationally as the American impressionists. The J. Alden Weir National Historic Site is the only site in the National Park System to commemorate an American painter and it is Connecticuts only national park. Mr. Speaker. I support this legislation. and would urge my colleagues to support it as well.",

As my colleagues will recall. the Senate committee considering the bill we approved earlier added several unrelated provisions and has not returned it to the House in a timely fashion. H.R. 5231 is being considered with the hope that the plan can be approved before we adjourn. The lack of action on the legislation leaves the Secretary of the Interior without adequate authority to properly manage the Presidio. which the Department of the Army turned over to the Department of the Interior on October 1. The trust fund called for by H.R. 5231 is a responsible managerial and financial mechanism to reduce costs at the Presidio. The bill would save money. protect and improve Federal property. and free up appropriated money for other use in national parks.

I have also known Mr. Machemehl through his service to our country in another area. Mach. as his friends call him. was also a brigadier general in the Air National Guard. Mr. President.

He was respected and loved by the people of New London. and all of us owe him a great debt of gratitude. He was a quiet hero and family man who loved his work and served as an example for many who followed in his footsteps. John OConnor gave his life in the line of duty. and it is a tragic reminder of the risks involved in being a firefighter. It is reported that the fire he was fighting when he died was allegedly set by a drug addict who was upset with an elderly man who refused to give him money for drugs. Three other people also lost their lives in the fire. Every day. men and women like John OConnor put their lives on the line. with tremendous and selfless courage. to protect all of us. Mr. President. I ask that the following article. written by Stan DeCoster of The Day of New London. be printed in its entirety in the RECORD.

It is a problem that unit and field commanders cannot overcome. If the rationale. is that we just simply have a behavioral code. then there is no justification or rationale to separate men and women. Because if the orders are simply everyone will be a professional. everyone must restrain their behavior or their conduct and it simply is bad conduct that results in disciplinary action. then there is no basis on which to say that men and women should not be put in the same situation.

For that reason. we need to closely examine the consequences of this. the implications of this. the way all of this will affect our military before we change the policy.

That is an outright ban. something I myself do not support. But. that shows my colleagues what has been called the sea change in American thinking about handguns. Eightynine percent of the people support the Brady bill. the 5day waiting period. before a handgun can be sold. and 68 percent of the people. who identified themselves as members of the National Rifle Association. also support a waiting period. Later this afternoon. I will meet in my office with the Casey family from Louisville. KY. who lost their son. brother and husband. John Patrick Casey. in 1990. from a handgun incident.

Call your Congressman. call your Senators. In fact. when I came into my office the next morning. my phone lines were jaxnned. They were Jammed in Washington and I could not even call in to my home State offices in Texas because so many people were calling wanting to register how they felt. We have had over 6.000 calls to my offioe in the last 2 days. The calls have been 10 to 1 against the tax plan. The people of America are speaking out and they are saying we do not want new taxes. I have talked to my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and they are having the same experience. In fact. the Capitol operators have said that 3 million calls came into the Capitol yesterday. that is far in excess of the normal number of 120.000.

Ill take a moment today to express my respect and admiration for an industry which has contributed so much to the freeenterprise system of our Nation as well as to the economy of North Carolina. Mr. President. the hosiery industry represents a significant portion of the textile and apparel complex. It alone employs 68.700 people in 347 plants around the Nation and continues to grow. The large size of the hosiery industry makes it a major contributor to our Nations economy. But Mr. President. it is in the many smaller communities where the hosiery industry makes its most significant co.*ribution. but it is there that these companies constitute a large part of the local economy. In many cases. a hosiery company will serve as the major employer in the area. providing good. stable Jobs for its employees. During the past year. the hosiery industry has made great strides in the area of foreign trade. Exports in 1992 were 47 percent above 1991 levels. reaching 13.042.582 dozen pairs. This increase in exports helped push total U.S. production to 347.753.000 dozen pairsand that. Mr. President. is a lot of hosiery. Mr. President. members of the National Association of Hosiery Manufactures produce and distribute 83 percent of U.S. hosiery. contributing more than $6 billion to the U.S. economy each year. The hosiery industry has made great strides in improving productivity in its mills and in improving the quality of its product. These efforts to make the hosiery industry more competitive have resulted in significant technological and design improvements in the manufacture of hosiery. Mr. President. National Hosiery Week is of special importance to me because North Carolina is the leading textile and hosiery State in the Nation. North Carolina Is proud of the leadership of the hosiery industry and the fine quality of life that it has provided for so many people. On behalf of my fellow North Carolinians. I extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the hosiery industry and to its many thousands of employees for their outstanding contribution to our State and Nation.",

He conducted himself with an integrity that was obvious to everyone around him. He sought and he found a harmony between public service and service to his God. Pauls death was untimely and difficult. difficult for him to endure and difficult for us to explain. It has left a deep and enduring sorrow. But death can only be avoided. not escaped. Every cradle implies a grave. Thankfully. for those of faith. that grave holds no lasting fear. Paul trusted in a Gospel which teaches that sorrow and suffering are a brief prolog. not a final verdict. but that there is a path through death to joy. The strength of his faith is a comfort to those of us who survive him. I want to offer my sympathy to Pauls wife. Karen. and his family.

With health costs increasing ten percent a year and millions of Americans uninsured. corrective action must be taken now. Many of us have been working to devise a proposal for comprehensive health care reform. It is essential to preserve the best elements of our existing system. while minimizing costs. and ensuring adequate health care for our nation. We are strongly opposed to an employer mandate to pay for health care reform. Whether it is a wage based premium. payroll tax or other carefully crafted euphemism for taxes. job loss among small businesses will be unavoidable and significant. Small businesses create the vast majority of new jobs in our country each year. Indeed. undercapitalized small businesses are often the first step to realizing the American dream of entrepreneurship. While we strongly support health care reform. small businesses and family farms cannot be sacrificed in the process. Health care reform must include provisions to help employers provide health benefits. However. new health care taxes will cost jobs and slow the economic growth of our country. We look forward to working with you and other members of Congress in an effort to adopt a health care reform package yet this year. Sincerely. Bob Dole. John H. Chafee. Larry Pressler. Don Nickels.

The White House plan would not cut Federal expenses. but it would gut our Nations defenses. The only spending cuts the White House can even imagineand they are imaginaryare supposed to come in their plans last years and are supposed to come on top of deep cuts already being made in defense. The Democrat plan for Americas economy can be reduced to this: A guarantee of new taxes now and a promise of unrealistic defense spending cuts. No wonder the more Americans know about the Clinton plan. the more they know they will get more taxes. no spending cuts. and no deficit reduction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout the 1980s. we had high real interest rates. Even when inflation was tamed. interest rates remained high. That is because people didnt have sufficient confidence about the longterm future. The markets knew that high interest rates were the only way of attracting foreign lenders in a climate of borrowandspend policies and huge budget deficits. But this is changing. After President Clinton made it clear he was determined to attack the deficit. the bond markets responded favorably. Since then. interest rates have dropped to a record low. and mortgage rates remain at a 20year low. And these low interest rates are good news. Businesses large and small are better able to finance new investmentsthe kind of investments that create good paying jobs and put people back to work. Every time mortgage rates go down a point. an additional 350.000 families can afford to buy homes. And a family who refinances their 10 percent interest $100.000 mortgage at 7.5 percent saves over $2.000 a year. after refinancing costs are subtracted. That interest savings is several times the very modest energy tax a middle income family is likely to pay under this serious deficit reduction plan. Low interest rates also mean that millions of Americans are saving money every month with lower car payments. lower small business loan payments. lower consumer luans. and lower college loans. If interest rates stay at this level. an estimated $100 billion in additional money will be pumped back into the economy this year alone. Thats part of whats at stake in passing a conference agreement on the budget. And that is real savings--and hard evidence that the Clinton economic plan is getting this country back on track.",

Mr. Speaker. we raised taxes on the rich from 28 to 31 percent. and the justpublished tax revenue results on the top 850.000 earners in this country. those who are making $200.000 or more per year. the results on them showed that the receipts from this group fell by $6.5 billion. or 0.1 percent. In other words. raising tax rates decreased actual tax revenues. Now. come on. Mr. Speaker. this administration needs to wake up. Not only is this proposed tax increase on the rich bad politics. which it is. because remember in general Americans do not want to punish the rich. we want to become the rich. but it also is bad economics.

Today. 100 Members of the Congress will be chosen to shape the future of our economy by finalizing the budget plan. As this process continues it is important that the American people clearly understand what the goals of the Democratic plan are: First. we aim to reduce the budget deficit by $500 billion over 5 years. Second. we want to encourage the growth of small business by providing incentives for investment and expansion. Third. we want the plan to be fair by asking those most able to pay their fair share.

Her days. filled with great triumph and great tragedy. remind us that. in the end. character rises above circumstance. Jacqueline Bouvier was very young when she enchanted the people of Massachusetts as the bride of their j%:lior Senator. She was pregnant with her second child. and needed to be shielded from the campaign trails wind and rain when her husband sought the Presidency. But in her own unique way. she still captured the Nations imagination. As First Lady. she made Individuality fashionable. displaying a grace bor.:e rot of pretense but of confidence. She seemed the embodiment of the Nation we hoped to bea dream made real. at least for a time. And on that terrible fall day in 1963. it was her image which most touched us. reaching to grasp the empty air. standing beside the new President. blood stains on her suit. to affirm the endurance of our democracy. and directing a tribute to her husband which enabled all of us to face the awful news. and yet move forward. Since then. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis has been less before our eyes. but perhaps more in our hearts. Those of us from New York thought of her as the citys first citizen. concerned always with preserving New Yorks special vitality. made visible in the brick and mortar of countless structures and monuments. She was a patron of the arts whose personal commitment to beauty and expression enriched the cultural experience of our entire community. She was an editor. an author. a mother. a dreamer. and a doer. And though she never sought the glare of a public life. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis never denied to us the warmth of her personality. or the inspiration of her example. Mrs. Onassis lives on in our memories as a model of grace. intelligence. and integrity. Through trials that would break many men and women. she remained always true to herself. never losing sight of the values she thought so important to our nation. never dimming the spirit that shined through even the darkest experience. We will miss her.",

But the bottom line is this--we have a chance to vote for real deficit reduction. and an economic package that creates real jobs and real opportunity. The Federal Government has been awash in red ink for far too long. The philosophy of borrow and spend. borrow and spend must be replaced by a new philosophy grounded in responsibility and accountability. I am pleased that the Presidents economic package contains over 150 individual spending cuts. And I am even more pleased that the Budget Committee of the House has gone further in proposing an additional S63 billion in cuts over the next 5 years. I urge my colleagues not to squander this opportunity to work with our new President in passing a sensible economic plan that creates jobs and that reduces the Federal deficit. Lets pass this investment package and budget resolution. and let the American people know that we are serious about breaking the gridlock in Washington and serious about the course of this Nations future. This Congress has an obligationto make the tough choices. to cut projects. to eliminate wasteful subsidies. and to streamline government. This budget resolution meets that obligation Mr. Chairman. I go home every week. I have talked to the people in my district in San Diego. They are willing to sacrifice to get this country back on track. They are willing to accept taxes and painful spending cuts now. in return for genuine economic prosperity in the long run.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 64. the budget resolution for fiscal year 1994. This is a momentous occasion for the new Members like myself who must cast their first votes on setting the new direction our country will take under the Clinton administration. Again and again we have heard that there will no longer be business as usual. dodging the hard decisions that we are called to make by the voters who sent us here. Mr. Chairman. I know there will be budget cuts. and I am prepared to vote for spending reductions that are chosen wisely. I commend the leadership and the Budget Committee for bringing us a resolution that emphasizes not just deficit reduction. but investment in programs that set us on the right path to the future. This resolution assumes full funding of many programs close to my heart. Head Start. WIC. child immunization. the Ryan White AIDS Program. and the Mickey Leland Hunger Program will at long last have the resources they have needed for so long. Many people whose needs have gone unmet up to now will receive help. We will invest in jobs programs. innovative education programs. and defense conversion programs. These expenditures will pay off in the future as we become a healthier. better educated and more competitive society. The Presidents tax proposals seek to place the greatest burdens on those who can afford it. This is the direction we must take. There may be changes in the details as Congress works its will. but the issue of fairness must remain paramount. I strongly support the expansion of the earned income tax credit which rewards lowincome people for working and trying to stay off welfare. There are many people in my congressional district who will directly benefit from this. The budget resolution sets the tone for this Congress as we begin working with our new President to put people first and create a future filled with hope. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.",

The first time that I learned that I could grow the private sector of the economy and raise revenue for the Federal Government by cutting taxes was in 1962. when I learned that lesson from Presitent Kennedy as a young econonics student. The next time I saw that lesson was in 1982. when I was in the top quintlle income distribution as a tenured professor. and learned the same lesson from President Reagan. The lesson was the same whether I was in the poorest fifth of income distribution or the highest fifth of income distribution. The lesson that we cut taxes. grow the economy. generate revenue for tile Government was the same in both cases. whether coming fiom a Republican or a Democrat. Mr. Chairman. I paid more than my fair share in taxes to the Federal Government in both cases. and I will believe that until the day I die. Mr. Chairman.

That approach to budgetmaking wrecked our economy anid mortgaged out future. Today with this package. we start down a new path. Today we have before us a plan for longterm economic growth that changes our spending priorities. cuts the deficit in half over 5 years. restores tax fairness and strategically invests in people to create jobs. This plan cuts the deficit by $510 billion. and it makes real cuts. not gimmick cuts. It even makes $63 billion more in cuts than the Presidents original proposals. This plan restores some tax fairness to out system. placing the heaviest burden on the richest. members of our society. that 2 percent of the population who had the blowout party in the 1980s. This plan rewards fulltime. but lowincome workers. by expanding the earned income tax credit. And most importantly. this plan puts people back to work.

Well. of course. they have been saying that for a yearandahalf. but real jobs are not being created in this recovery. Last month 80 percent of the jobs created were parttime jobs. while the majority of the jobs lost in the same month last month were fulltime jobs.

A small bank which receives an outstanding rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. of which only 10 percent attain this. would be granted a safe harbor from Community Reinvestment Act protests should that small bank want to. for instance. engage in an expansion of some type. And furthermore. under thir. the regulators would be directed to significantly reduce the paperwork requirements under CRA for banks that obtain the highest CRA rating. That is one side of the equation. That is what the chairman of the committee so aptly called the carrot. On the other side. there would be a stick. The bill calls for stiff penalties on small banks with the worst CRA rating. specifically that is substantial noncompliance. In our legislation. we have a fine of up to $20.000 on small banks which receive that worse rating. so what we are trying to do is say if you get the best rating under CRA you ought to get something for it because that is an encouragement to try to seek this rating.

As the chairman of the committee knows. for the last 2 years. I have opposed the efforts to fund the Resolution Trust Corporation. I recognized the responsibility that we have with respect to depositors. But many of us were deeply concerned about the level of mismanagement at RTC. the problems that existed within the RTC itself. And regrettably. for better or worse. simply calling it the way it was. in the past administration our efforts to reform the RTC. our efforts to really create an accountable system. frankly. fell on deaf ears. This will be the first time that I am going to be voting for this then since the RTCs creation. The reason is very simple. The chairman and the ranking memberI want to thank them for thishave made extraordinary efforts to reach out to both the administration and members of the committee to help to fashion a piece of legislation that represents our best effort to try to create the reforms and accountability we need. while simultaneously creating a structure that gives the RTC the flexibility it needs to be able to move large assets and be able to deal with large amounts of money that are necessary. It is a tough balance. The real proof will be in the efforts of Secretary Bentsen and the new leadership of the RTC to follow through on the structure that we institute here today. I thank the chairman. particularly. for having been as openminded and as willing to work to encompass the views of many different people. He has a tough job. and it is a thankless job. There is no bright ends in spending these sums of money for past failings. I think he has walked us through this process with great skill and with a commitment to reforming this mess. while at the same time recognizing the larger responsibilities of keeping the system afloat. I think he deserves great credit for that. I also thank my colleagues on the committee who joined together to create. I think. a consensus about some of the changes that we needed to implement. particularly Senators BRYAN.",

I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue over a great length of time. These are not new issues to him. but ones for which he has expressed a concern and made an effort to correct over some great length of time. The reforms that are included in this bill today are in part reflecting his leadership. He has kindly mentioned the other members of the committee. and particularly the new members of the committee. that have also had a very strong interest in this area. But the Senator from Massachusetts has been very directly involved in this effort for a great length of time. and that should be noted. It is something that I very much appreciate. I think the bill that we have. as the Senator has said. makes this as strong as we know how to do it with respect to the written law. In the end. we have to rely on others to implement the law. That really is beyond our reach. We can write the law. we can give them the tools. as we did going back to the initial formation of the RTC. But we cannot execute their jobs for them. They must do that. They do it. obviously. with the knowledge that we will conduct oversight to try to monitor to see what they are doing. and when we see that things are off track. to come back and tighten the law or change the law or provide additional methods to get things to happen the way we intend for them to happen. I think it is also fair to say that we do now have a new administration. And leaving aside the long history of where the problem came from. I think the fact that new people will be coming in and taking a fresh look and are under pressure to perform by even more stringent legal requirements gives us some encouragement in thinking that problems that have been out there will be dealt with and will be corrected. There ought not to be anybody defending the status quo. and if there are changes and improvements that are needed they. in fact. can be done. I want to thank the Senator again.",

The collection of restitution and fines from the criminals responsible for a significant amount of the losses incurred by the American taxpayer for the savings and loan bailout has concerned me for some time. Last year. in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. the General Accounting Office presented some shocking data. The GAO analyzed the Justice Departments prosecution efforts for the 100 largest criminal savings and loan referrals. In these 100 referrals. Justices efforts resulted in fines and restitutions being ordered of $83.6 million. Of this amount. only $365.000 had actually been collectedless than half of 1 percent. Confronted by this information. the Justice Department agreed to make an effort to improve the collection of restitution. Several months after the GAO report. Justice reported back that their analysis showed an increase in the collection rate to a little more than 5 percentan improvement. but still far below what I am certain the American taxpayer would expect. My efforts to determine exactly how much of the restitution ordered by the courts has been collected have been frustrating. to say the least. It is clear to me that the Justice Department has not taken a sufficient interest in the collection of restitutiononce the fines are levied. Justice seems to lose interest. It is also clear to me that Justice has no Idea how much of the restitution that has been ordered has actually been collected. I understand that in some cases the collection of fines and restitution can be difficult. if not impossible. Sometimes. I am sure. the assets simply are not there. and there is no way to collect a fine. Nevertheless. the American taxpayer. who is footing the bill for the criminal behavior of many of those involved in the savings and loan crisis. deserve a full report on the actual collection of fines and restitution. in addition to a full reporting of the prosecutions and sentencing. Mr. President. the amendment offered by Senator SHELBY simply requires the Department of Justice to provide to Congress a single report on its efforts to collect fines and restitution assessed against savings and loan criminals. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment.",

I was a clinical optometrist before I was elected to Congress in 1992. As an optometrist I dealt with patients on a oneonone basis. I dealt with mothers on welfare. and not infrequently. if not always invariably they would point out to me the reason they could not get off welfare is they needed to keep their health insurance. they needed to stay on the Medicaid program. so no matter what they did from the standpoint of finding jobs they never could find the jobs that would pay the kind of a salary that they could purchase their own health insurance. That is presuming it was even available to them. much less find a job that would cover it as a part of their work. So. as a consequence. you saw a situation where it precipitated them staying on welfare. If we care about welfare reform. if we really care about what happens to children in welfare families. then you have to have universal coverage. which brings us back to the point that was being made earlier quite eloquently. Those who argue that what we need to do is just fix what is broken. meaning just a little bit of insurance reform. is so shortsighted. It leaves major gaps. It will never achieve universal coverage. It means that we take care of the wealthy. making sure we do not step on their rights to make sure that they always get health insurance. We may throw some bones to the poor. But the middle class is left out in the cold. Increasingly they find it difficult to continue to purchase health care. that they are being priced out of it. that they do not have the resources to purchase any longer. Their salary increases are being eaten up trying to maintain their health care benefits. and if they lose their job they find it that much more difficult to be able to keep their insurance. if they can afford it for the 18 months that they are able to continue it right now. much less have any other benefit.",

What they concluded was for persons between $10.000 and $20.000 a year income they would pay annually $201 more. for persons between $30.000 and $40.000 a year they would pay $344 more. and from $40.000 to $50.000. $137 a year more. The middle class gets burned if you just do insurance reform.

Now. in California the State and local governmentsand we know about the Federal Governmentare having all kinds of problems meeting their debts and meeting their obligations to the people. Now we are saying. \"All right. lets continue to increase the stock of Federal land at the expense of State and local governments.\" the prime source of their revenue being related to land values and land taxes in the form of property that is improved or not improved.

Now. if we continue to add to this land. we continue to reduce what it is that people in these jurisdictional areas can receive in the way of property tax. and we increase what the Federal Government then pays these localities for what these Federal landsare worth.",

I. like the chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources. have a district that is very low in Federal ownership. But we are at the point right now where over half of California is owned by one government agency or another. and I strongly support this concept that if the Federal Government is going to take over more land. they should have to divest themselves of land to make up for it. for a number of reasons. the main reason being that I think the Federal Government owns too much land already. Constitutionally. the Federal Government is limited as to what land it can own. and when other States were brought into the Union after the original Thirteen. they were guaranteed the same rights that the original Thirteen States had. One of those rights was that the Federal Government would divest itself of its large land ownership. Somehow that was forgotten when we got west of the Mississippi because most of the land west of the Mississippi is land that the Federal Government owns. Mr. Chairman. I think it would be a very important and a very good idea to force the Federal Government to give up as much as it is buying so that we can maintain private property in this country.",

Ethical rule 33 states. \"It is unethical to accept or perform an appraisal assignment if the assignment is contingent upon reporting a predetermined analysis or opinion.\" The fact is that the 0MB and the various agencies involved have the uniform rules with regard to 18 Federal land management agencies that function. They have adopted these guidelines. They are forced to pay a fair market value for whatever they purchase. This issue that there is some 16526 ( conspiracy theory. that somehow the Federal Government specifically is the root of all evil and that they somehow are designing in passing these laws and this legislation. whether it be clean air. the Endangered Species Act or wetlands delineation with the idea of somehow taking away from the citizens of this Nation something for less than fair value I think is frankly a very flawed logic. I can understand that people may be very suspicious. but this gets beyond suspicion and into a conspiracy theory. as I said and should not be the basis for our vote or policy decision today. I think such conjecture and allegations are not helpful to the debate. The law and the Federal policy is required payment of fair market value. If this Congress can in some way qualify or limit what the Government can look at or consider. they can also exclude other factors that would result in less than fair market value going to people for their property.

My colleague. the gentleman from California . who is a dear friend from the urban center of northern California. says there are no roads. no water. powerlines and aqueducts. nobody would buy this stuff in the first place. To suggest that is to say he has never really visited my desert. You know. Palm Springs is not the only part of the desert. I say to the gentleman from California . The lack of understanding about this issue is really unbelievable. The east Mojave is filled with fantastic values. There are thousands of miles of roadway. There are endless channels of aqueducts and utility corridors. Those elements are factors that would never be considered to be part of a park. yet. they want to take millions of acres. and say every one justifies park consideration. In the east Mojave there is a fantastic mix of potential value that would be limited by this committee and. indeed. by this debate. It is incredible that people do not understand the values that exist there today and are to be found there tomorrow. Just in the last couple of years a spot in the eastern Mojave Desert would be just inside this proposed park by less than 8 miles. one of our prospectors discovered a new mine. It just happened to be a minor item. Who worries about marble in the United States? It is a major deposit of marble that is of quality higher than the best marble to come out of Italy. I have no idea what its future value is. But it is tremendous. It would not have been available for even access if this bill had passed 8 years ago when the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from California would have had it.

I will never forget the issue of the fringetoed lizard coming to my attention. Suddenly a newly designated endangered species was impacting territory in and around that area that is Palm Springs. CA. Over time it became very apparent if the Department had its way they would take most of the open land left north of Palm Springs and put it in some kind of preserve. What eventually had to be done. because there was a designation of the fringetoed lizard as an endangered species. we actually had to create a preserve. several hundred acres of otherwise extremely valuable property owned by private citizens would have been somehow essentially taken over in terms of its relative value by this Department. That is precisely what the gentleman is trying to get to. that the Government should not be able to manipulate the value of peoples property long held or otherwise because they decide to designate \"X\" endangered. In my territory. another minor extension. I think expansion. of the original intention of Congress is as it relates to endangered species. the wooly star. I am sure that maybe even the gentleman from Minnesota has not heard of the wooly star. But it is a cactuslike plant. an ugly little devil. I must say. but for about 3 weekends a year it develops a very small little purple flower. and it grows in watersheds. sandy territory. Now. frankly. that partially describes much of my desert.

If there is a \"slippery slope\" or however else you may wish to define it. that is a part of the actual land in question.

I rise today to introduce a very important and necessary piece of legislation that will ensure that Congress has the information it needs to properly implement its constitutional responsibilities in overseeing the U.S. territories. Furthermore this bill will ensure that the executive branch respects Congress authority to carry out this responsibility. T he legislation reflects a bipartisan effort cosponsored by nine of my distinguished colleagues including the ranking minority member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. Given that Congress is constitutionally empowered to provide for the governance of U.S. territories. including the determination of status. I believe there are certain procedures that need to be established to ensure that Congress is adequately informed to successfully carry out this important responsibility. The Territorial Consultation and Notification Act will require that periodic plebiscites be held by all U.S. territories so that Congress can be regularly informed about how the citizens who reside in these territories view their political status. In addition. this legislation will require the executive branch to provide Congress with sufficient notification of all regulations and policies impacting the territories. While some of the territories have already conducted plebiscites. most of these votes do not take place with any regularity. In fact. Puerto Rico held a plebiscite in November of last year. This vote was the first Puerto Rican plebiscite in over 20 years and it resulted with none of the status options receiving more than 50 percent of the vote. Through regular plebiscites. Congress will ensure that basic American values such as selfdetermination and human rights apply to all U.S. territories. In mandating periodic plebiscites. this legislation does not seek to endorse any particular status option for the territories. Instead. the bill will provide Congress with adequate information to properly carry out its constitutional duties. The United Nations has declared the 1990s as the decade to \"eradicate colonialism.\" As a result. Congress must promote the progress of U.S. territories toward selfgovernment consistent with the principles of selfdetermination. It strongly urge my distinguished colleagues to support the Territorial Consultation and Notification Act. By implementing these necessary procedures. Congress will be able to take a fair. informed. and accurate approach in evaluating the U.S. territories.",

Whether it was increasing funding for the education of children with disabilities. or improving AIDS services in El Barrio. Richard was a powerful voice for change in our communities. Richard always seemed to have time for any person or any organization that needed his help.

The 103rd Congress faces a crowded legislative agenda before its scheduled adjournment In midOctober. This Congress has had several accomplishments to date. Including passage of a $430 billion deficit reduction measure. the North American Free Trade Agreement. anti the most comprehensive crime bill In six years. Health care reform has preoccupied this Congress. pushing aside many other bills. especially welfare reform. Tile overall legislative record for the 103rd Congress still hangs in the balance. The unfinished business Is staggering. I do not agree with those who argue that this Congress should close down and get out of town. There Is still important work to do. What follows Is my \"wish list\" for the remainder of the session. If Congress can enact these measures. or even most of them. the 103rd Congress would post a solid record of achievement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I note with sadness that on September 15. the Indian regime stopped noted human rights activist Ajit Singh Baines. a former high court justice. from boarding a plane to Great Britain. Justice Bains is remembered in this House for his moving testimony to the Human Rights Caucus regarding the repression of the Sikh nation by India. Justice Bains strongly advocates the liberation of the Sikh homeland. Khalistan. by peaceful means. In addition. the most prominent Sikh leader in Khalistan. Mr. Simranjit Singh Mann has recently been charged by the Indian regime under the repressive Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act. [TADA]. His crime? Mr. Mann spoke out at a Sikh temple in support of an independent. sovereign Khalistan through peaceful. nonviolent means. Without a trial. the Indian regime has seized Mr. Manns passport and the Punjab police have threatened his life. These antidemocratic acts by the tyrannical Indian regime are but the latest chapter in Indias illegal occupation of the Sikh homeland. Khalistan. which declared its independence on October 7. 1987. severing all political connection with India. The massive Sikh electinn boycott of 1992 shows that this movement has the peoples support. These former olficials are again subjected to a kind of brutality Americans would not tolerate if it were inflicted on ordinary citizens. Occupied Khalistan is not the only place where India faces a demand for freedom. There are independence movements in Kashmir. Nagaland. Assam. Tamil Nadu. and Manipur. India is relying on repression. and supporters of Mr. Mann are concerned about his fate despite his status as a former member of Parliament. What crime has this distinguished leader committed? As we begin to send United States troops to Haiti. how can America sit idly by and allow this oppression to continue. What is happening to Mr. Mann and Justice Bains violates democratic principles. It takes more than elections to make a democracy. Democracy requires respect for human and individual rights. It is time for India to recognize reality and begin real negotiations. If Israel and the PLO can make peace. if the IRA can negotiate with the British. then India can sit down with the Sikh representatives. such as the Council of Khalistan and demarcate the boundaries of an independent Khalistan.",

It sets the United States share of United Nations peacekeeping operations at 25 percent. less than the current 31 percent. It keeps funding for the counterterrorism office. Especially noteworthy is the provision expressing the sense of Congress that the President should lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and allow the Bosnian people to defend themselves from Serb attack. There Is one aspect of the bill that I do not support. and that is the language stating that the government of Vietnam has cooperated with the efforts of the United States to account for missing servicemen.

The Senate added this language to the bill last January. and President Clinton used their vote on it to justify his order lilting the trade embargo against Vietnam. The House was never given the opportunity to vote on the wisdom of lifting the embargo. so I have not been able to vote on this important issue before now.

Farmers were being robbed blind by the railroads of America. Today we have deregulation and competition between railroads. competition between railroads and trucks. and competition between water and land transportation. Mr. Speaker. we need to take a look at the ICC and how it functions. We need to rethink its mission. It has dropped from 2.000 employees in 1980 to 630 at the present time. but it is an agency of highpaid commissioners and a lot of staff still looking for a mission. The ICC is still dealing with a 14yearold dispute as to whether the railroads were charging too much to transport corn syrup between Texas and California. when the shipping rate has already been decided by the free market. The ICC has had little effect in the last 4 years in stopping railroads from giving up track. The railroads abandoned enough track to go round trip from Seattle to Miami and back. The length of track prevented from abandonment would not even be a round trip from Seattle to Tacoma. So much for effectiveness. Perhaps any legitimate functions that remain should be turned over to the Department of Transportation and a few administrative law judges. That would save the taxpayers many millions of dollars. Let us take another look at the ICC and give it a peaceful burial. Mr. Speaker.

As part of this celebration. these two men of God. Cardinal Cahal B. Daly and Archbishop Robin Eames. have come to the United States for a briet visit.

They talked of renewed efforts at reconciliation between their two religious traditions and of the willingness of their churches to be a part of that ettort.

Let the Members vote up or down spending cuts. It is called representative government. It works in many State legislatures. Mr. Speaker. Give us an open rule on spending cuts.

Today. we have the opportunity to put behind us a controversy that has for years been a major roadblock to research aimed at treating many lifethreatening conditions: diabetes. Alzheimers. Huntingtons disease. and Parkinsons disease. But the Bliley amendment would jeopardize this critical research by continuing to hold biomedical science hostage to abortion politics. This amendment is an affront to American women. The decision to have an abortion is a highly personal one. and one that is never made lightly. To assume that women would be encouraged or discouraged from having an abortion because of our action on this amendment is a slap in the face of all women. Let us be very clear: The Bliley amendment will do nothing to stop abortions. All it will do is make it more difficult for tissue to be utilized for potentially lifesaving research. If there was one message that was loud and clear from last Novembers election. it was that the American people wanted an end to gridlock. and that they want our Government to get out of the way of positive productive activity. But the Bliley amendment flies in the face of that message. It would impose additional bureaucratic burdens on physicians and on women. The net effect will be to make it more difficult for fetal tissue to be used for critical research. It has no bearing on the abortion decision whatsoever. Is that what we want? To slow the progress of research that affects millions of lives? All because some in this body cannot leave abortion politics out of this debate. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Waxman substitute. It strengthens appropriate safeguards for fetal tissue research. it does not throw another roadblock in the way of finding cures for diseases that threaten us all.",

Mr. Speaker. if my colleagues want to know how far we have gone toward more Mussolini rules. just take a look at this chart. Over the last several years we have moved from a time when only 20 percent of the rules of the House were closed Mussolini rules to the point where now we have 100 percent of the rules of this House that are now Mussolini rules. Back in the 95th Congress we were at 80 percent or more than 80 percent of the rules that were open rules that allowed free debate on the House floor. Now we have in this Congress so far no such rules. We have heard a lot of nonsense uttered on the House floor today about this particular rule. We are told. for example. that the waiving of germaneness is something that just is not done. But in the last four Congresses the Democrats have waived germaneness more than 20 times. Invariably they have waived germaneness when it is Democrats involved. not when it is Republicans involved.

This bill not only reauthorizes NIH. it revitalizes our commitment to biomedical research and redirects that commitment to serve all the people of this country. Basic biomedical research is one of the best investments a nation can make. It produces treatments and cures for diseases that threaten us all. It helps us understand how to prevent disease and promote health. it strengthens some of our most successful industries in the competitive world economy. There is so much good in this bill that I could not possibly list everything. But I want to mention three of the most important provisions: First. this bill ends the ideological controversy over fetal tissue research. It allows this essential work to go forward with safeguards to separate the research from the intensely personal choice about abortion. Second. the bill guarantees the benefits of medical research to all people. by assuring that the health of women and minorities receives equal attention. This is long overdue. and I am pleased that the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle has been chosen to administer the womens health initiative. Third. the bill provides for a coordinated research strategy against AIDS. I commend the gentleman from California for his work to develop the planning and funding mechanism in this bill.

Congress deserves to be heard on this issue. The administrations new policy will open U.S. borders to visa applicants seeking medical treatment at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer. Our hearts go out to those afflicted with this disease. But health experts estimate that treating each person with AIDS costs $100.000. That translates into at least $100 billion just for the estimated I million people with AIDS already in the United States. There are millions of people on waiting lists to get into this country who are healthy. It just does not make sense to admit individuals who are going to put an additional strain on our health care system. In a prepared statement. the American Medical Association says it is * * * concerned that large numbers of HIVinfected permanent immigrants could tax the resources of our already burdened health care system.\" The AMA supports the \"exclusion\" of HIVinfected persons\" who are \"permanent immigrants.\" President Clinton maintains that the HIV virus poses a serious public health threat requiring additional resources here at home. but that opening our doors to immigrants with AIDS somehow does not. You cant have it both ways. The point has been made that most other advanced nations do not restrict the entry of HIVpositive aliens. But those nations have extremely low levels of any kind of immigration. The countries that admit the most immigrants. such as Australia. Germany. and the United States. do restrict the entry of those with AIDS. Current policy should remain because changing it would threaten the public health and drain the Public Treasury.

It is the second part that is the problem. I am not sure he realizes the catastrophic impact it has on the bill. The question is. What threshold do you have to meet for the Attorney General to go into the 90day period? The history of this act is that only 13 independent counsels have been appointed in 15 years. It is not as though this has been rushed into and independent counsels are appointed willynilly. right and left all the time. It is very rare. In fact. of those 13 independent counsels. almost half of them have decided there was no reason to prosecute. So changing fundamentally the threshold would be a terrible mistake. What the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois does is provide that the Attorney General would have only 15 days in which to determine. not if there is a specific allegation from a credible source. but 15 days in which to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to go forward.

Let us really look at the record of the special prosecutors and how they have evolved over the years. It is a very tough standard that we must put on any administration that a special prosecutor with all these powers can be appointed. and this person is appointed to investigate a specific person. and this person is semiindependent from the Department of Justice. I think that what we have to do is say that if we are going to put this as a standard on the administration. then we certainly should apply it ourselves. It can be said that here we go again. exempting ourselves from these laws. and that is exactly what we are doing. By boiling this thing down and saying it is permissive. it just simply yanks the heart out of the whole thing. This is a high standard that we place upon the administration. We should place this same standard upon ourselves and this body. I do not view this as a partisan move at all. It simply says that exactly what we are going to do to any administration. whether it be a Republican or a Democratic administration. we simply apply the same standard to ourselves. That is the question. It is plain and simple. Mr. Chairman. I ask for a positive vote on the Gekas amendment and a negative vote on the watereddown amendment.",

I Just have to observe that whenever a human being. in the face of the language of the law when it is laid before them and repeated over and over in terms that anyone could understand. continues to deny what is before their very eyes. there is something afoot other than a legitimate effort to offer an amendment to improve legislation. The law since 1983 has provided that Members of Congress are covered by the independent counsel statute when the Attorney General would like to appoint an independent counsel. My amendment to the Gekas amendment which I will offer in just a moment will continue the law just as it has been. and it has worked well for 15 years. After all. there have been only 13 independent counsels appointed. Notwithstanding that. as I said a moment ago. despite the outburst we heard a moment agoand I noticed that the Member would not yield to me. apparently for fear that he would hear the words I am about to speakwhile considering this matter in the Judiciary Committee last year. we had four people being investigated. I think three conviitions had already taken place. and there were also a number of other ones gning on at the same time. There has never been any hesitancy to prosecute Members of Congress. Let me point out one other thing that was said so very well by the gentleman from New Jersey a moment ago. The great irony of this is that you would come to the floor and act as though you were somehow trying to guarantee that Members of Congress are treated like everyone else when the plain result of what you are doing is to put us in a special category that would make it harder. more cumbersome. and more difficult for the Attorney General to prosecute or conduct an investigation against the Member of Congress. Every knowledgeable analyst of this statute agrees with what I have just said. This is a shell game. as the gentleman from New Jersey described it so aptly a moment ago. Mr. Chairman. I urge the Members of Congress to vote against the Gekas amendment and vote for the Bryant amendment which I will bring before the body in just a few moments.",

The National Taxpayers Union and Citizens Against Government Waste both support this amendment. There is no innuendo. no rumor. or no rhetoric that can confuse people.

Of special importance to me is the provision contained in this measure which would increase the current limit on singlefamily loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration in highcost areas to $172.675 from the current level of $151.725. This provision is identical to an amendment I offered during the full Banking Committee markup of the Housing and Community Development Act reauthorization legislation which the full House is scheduled to consider now that it has been reported out. I want to thank Chairman STOKES and ranking member JEtRY LEWIS for agreeing to incorporate this provision into the bill we have under discussion today. In so doing. they have given middleincome working families in high cost areas like northern New Jersey the opportunity to purchase their first home by taking advantage of the lower down payment requirements of the FHA program. In areas like mine. where the average home costs $179.000. many young families have been frozen out of the housing market simply because they do not have enough cash on hand to meet the minimum down payment and closing costs associated with a conventional loan. Mr. Chairman. increasing the ceiling makes good sense. Home buyers in high cost areas can finally participate in the FHA loan program and. indeed. everyone will benefit because lower cost houses can benefit from a mortgage insurance fund that is more financially stable and stronger. Indeed. it will help the economy by spurring housing construction. Finally. this particular provision is revenuepositive. It will produce at a minimum $40 million more dollars for the Government. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation and to support the increase in the FHA loan limit.",

If I understand the gentlemans amendment correctly. he takes $598 million out of the Public Housing Program and he transfers $180 million over to the Voucher Program. What we did in our bill was to provide for public housing at the 1994 level. In doing so. we did disagree with the administration who wanted to cut this particular program. But we felt that as a result of the hearings we conducted and the testimony that was taken during the course of our hearings from the Department of HUD. there was a great need for public housing. We felt it was our responsibility to provide funds for public housing which. as all of us know. is for poor people and lowincome people who are unable to obtain any other type of housing. Our Government does provide what is supposed to be decent housing for people in a decent environment in order to try and care for them because they are unable to care for themselves. But let me just point out a couple of things. The gentleman made the statement that vouchers are the most efficient means of providing housing for poor people. I do not know what the gentleman relics upon in making such a statement. I do not know of any basis for that. I do know that vouchers are only good for 5 years. and I do know that public housing is available almost forever. For instance. Mr. Chairman. in the city of Cleveland. public housing. which my brother and I grew up in. was built in 1938. That housing is still good housing in Cleveland and continues to provide an opportunity for poor people to have a place to live. So. Mr. Chairman.

But I know of no organization representing tenants. or the poor or elderly people. that has come forward to the housing subcommittee and said. \"Change this.\" The overwhelming majority of housing groups have come. those representing tenants. and said to build them because. as the gentleman from Ohio has pointed out. we are talking hero about temporary versus permanent housing in our hands. and lot me add one other important issue. Many have asked us to be able to tear down existing public housing. People have said we have got this problem. we want to be able to tear down some of the existing public housing. The law requires that. if public housing is torn down. it be replaced. because otherwise we get a net diminution. If we take away the money that is in the bill of the subcommittee. we are going to make it very difficult for our communities to replace public housing that has become so deteriorated or abandoned that it is an eyesore because the law has. and nobody has been pushing for total change of that successfully. the law still requires some replacement. I say. You need what the gentleman from Ohio has done if youre going to have that replacement. This is the most flexible way to do housing. Finally.

I also appreciate the position of the President pro tempore and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has a bill to get through here. The boundary bill of 1934 confirmed ownership to what is now known as the 1934 Navajo reservation lands to the Navajos and other Indians residing on these lands. Starting in the early 1960s. the Hopi Tribe began to assert its claims to the 1934 lands. In 1966. the BIA Commissioner imposed an administrative freeze on all development and construction in the 1.5 million acres of the 1934.Navajo Reservation. He took this action in response to the Hopi Tribes legal counsel assertion that Hopi tribal approval was required on all development involving the 1934 lands. The Commissioner acknowledged that financial hardships would be imposed on both tribes by not allowing either tribe to take unilateral actions within the area that trespass on the rights of the other. He stated. \"the period of hardship and administrative difficulties would be shortened * * * by a friendly confrontation of the tribes. to the end that in facetoface talks they might agreeably negotiate * * * their respective interests and thus form the basis for an early and amicable legislative\" settlement. In 1972. the freeze was modified to exempt the Moencopi Village area where the Hopi residents of the 1934 reservation lived. This allowed the Hopi tribal members to be exempted from the devastating impact of the development ban. In 1980. Congress authorized the District Court of Arizona to settle the tribal claims to 1934 reservations. It also codified the Bennett Freeze which was to remain in effect until the Court had determined the rights of the litigating parties (Public Law 96305).",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment is quite simple and straightforward. It would prohibit the Department of Agriculture from forcing farmers to repay advance deficiency payments until next year. It would provide much needed relief to producers in the Midwest who were prevented from planting a program crop this year due to this years unprecedented flooding in South Dakota and the Midwest. It could provide breathing room for farmers who are suffering. The full extent of this years flood damage will not be fully assessed until this years harvest is complete. The production of wheat and small grains looks promising. but those crops could be lost if farmers are unable to harvest due to wet fields. Unfortunately. this is becoming a reality in South Dakota. Producers who were unable to plant this years crops soon will be forced to repay advance deficiency payments. Many of these producers simply do not have the cash on hand to make repayments. Waiting until next year to require repayment would. at least. provide a little extra time for financially strapped producers to accumulate the resources to repay the Government. The administration has taken steps to make this reality less of a burden. My amendment will assist this effort. By the first of the year. disaster assistance should be in the hands of producers needing relief. My amendment also could help other producers. Depending on the outcome of this years harvest. it is possible there will be no deficiency payments on certain crops. Should this happen my amendment will provide breathing room for those producers as well. Mr. President. the Congressional Budget Office has stated there is no cost to this amendment. I am joined in this effort by Senators GRASSLEY and DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the amendment be printed in the RECORD.",

Mr. Peterson. knowing the Nicol family was away from home and unable to take the necessary steps to protect their home and belongings. drove to the Nicol home on his own time and organized their neighbors for cleanup operations. In addition. he offered to store the Nicol possessions in his garage until the waters receded. That is. in my view. service above and beyond the call of duty. Buckley Peterson is to be commended for his dedication.",

I am extremely interested in laying this proposal next to others currently on the table so that it might receive full review and consideration. I am introducing this legislation. not because I necessarily support the substance of the proposal. but because I support the process of moving this important issue forward. Although I recognize the complexity of these issues and appreciate the efforts of the respective agencies to produce a comprehensive package. I am discouraged that we are only now receiving this legislation7 months after my subcommittee held hearings to review the administrations intentions. We should have been moving forward many months ago. not in the later stages of the 103d Congress. Todays agriculture community is extremely sensitive to the environmental and consumer impact of bringing food and fiber to the rest of the Nation. The farmer knows that he or she is successful only to the extent that the consumer is satisfied. Our task. however. is to ensure that these decisions are based on sound. practical science. not temporary emotional appeal. Although we are blessed with. and often taken advantage of a tremendous and wholesome food supply. todays society demands and deserves an updated legal framework by which to regulate that food supply. From improving efficiencies in the regulatory process to assuring consumers that there is no significant risk associated with our Nations food and fiber. improvements can and should be made. I am anxious to move swiftlyto begin reviewing the details of this proposal and to work cooperatively with other committees of jurisdiction. the full Agriculture Committee. and this administration in bringing a measure of this nature to the floor of the House as soon as possible.",

Fungicide. and Rodenticide Act [FIFRA]. the principal law regulating the manufacture and use of pesticides. I am introducing this bill because I believe the Administrations proposals deserve a place at the legislative table. While I do not endorse every provision embodied in this legislation. I do wholeheartedly support the Administrations effort to move the legislative process forward. I am especially pleased that the Administration package includes language to establish incentives for registering pesticides for socalled minor uses. This is an issue of vital concern to our Nations fruit and vegetable growers. including those in the south Texas district I represent. Last year I introduced a bill to help ensure the availability of minor use chemicals. and many of its concepts are embodied in the Administration bill. I want to take this opportunity to commend the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. including the Food and Drug Administration. as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. They have worked together long and hard to develop a comprehensive package on very complex and contentious issues. I want to particularly thank EPA Administrator Carol Browner for her leadership in developing the Administration proposals to reform FIFRA and the related statutethe Federal Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act. She has made the passage of pesticide and food safety reform a priority for this Administration and I congratulate her for her efforts. The Administration proposals put before this Congress are one approach to coordinated pesticide and food safety reform. The introduction of this legislation likely marks the beginning of what will be a long and difficult process. However. I believe we canand we mustwork together to enact legislation that restores credibility to Government food safety regulation and. at that same time. allow American agriculture access to tested and approved chemical tools for modem food production",

It is highly appropriate that we mark the 50th anniversary of this critical military turning point in World War II by appropriate ceremonies and events to commemorate the allied landings at Normandy. In this connection. Mr. Speaker. I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues in the House to a particularly perceptive opinion article which appeared in todays issue of the Washington Post by Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski. the National Security Advisor to President Carter and currently Counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS] here in Washington. Dr. Brzezinski is one of the brightest and most original and insightful minds focusing on the security issues that face the United States. and this particular article is one of his best. Dr. Brzezinski focuses on the practical political symbolism of the exclusion of Germany and Russia from the Dday commemorative activities planned for Normandy next month. He rightfully emphasizes the vital importance of strengthening the political. economic. intellectual. and security links of Germany and Russia with the United States and Western Europe. It is vital that we take the longterm perspective that Dr. Brzezinski has articulated. Mr. Speaker. I ask that Dr. Brzezinskis artiI urge my colleagues to read that thoughtful article and seriously consider its message.

    "speech": "U.S. Senate. Washington. DC. DEAR MR. VICE PRESIDENT: I am writing in regard to recent reports of bonuses being paid to twothirds of the employees of the Social Security Administration (SSA). In Fiscal Year 1993. SSA paid $32 million to 45.644 of its 65.000 employees. While I recognize that Social Securitys workforce has dropped from 84.000 to 64.000 since 1983 and its workload has grown substantially. I am concerned that the number of bonuses is excessive. The National Performance Review (NPR) recommended that \"agencies should be allowed to design their own performance management and reward systems. with the objective of improving the performance of individuals and organizations.\" I understand that you are working to craft civil service reform legislation to implement this and many other NPR recommendations. I would urge you to consider. as you draft this legislation. the need to improve the manner in which bonuses. or incentive awards. are used. All too often. federal employees have been given reason to believe that bonuses are a matter of routine. rather than in return for truly exemplary performance. Section 4505a of Title 5. United States Code. states that employees who are rated fully successful or above may be paid a cash award. This is not an entitlement and should not be treated as one by either the manager or the employee. Managers must receive better training in how to review and evaluate their employees. Frequent criticisms of the bonus system have been that it works as a buddy system or that managers will pass the bonuses around to employees in turn. If the bonus system does not work well. it can actually serve as a disincentive for productivity improvements. as employees quickly learn that their job performance is not directly linked to bonus awards. The NPR envisions a smaller workforce that is rewarded for individual or group performance. A respected performance evaluation and assessment system is essential to making that vision a reality. I look forward to working with you on this issue. Sincerely.",
