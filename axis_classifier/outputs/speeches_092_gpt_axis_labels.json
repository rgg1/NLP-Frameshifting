If Senators vote for the provision. some might interpret it. no matter what the exigencies. even to the very existence of our country. to mean it could be destroyed without the ultimate effort to protect it.

We cannot by statute deny the constitutional power of the President. I would hope that as the Senator feels deeply about this. and I do. that would be placed in a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that nuclear weapon should not be used in a first strike.

Two years have lapsed from the time this legislation was introduced until the time when it will be voted upon tomorrow. The legislation. in my judgment. should go forth from this body. regardless of what fate awaits it on the other side of the Capitol. or at the hands of the President. on its own as the best collective thinking of the Senate on the question of the war powers division of power between Congress and the President of the United States. I respect the Senator from Wyoming. who has been consistent from the time of his dissent on the national commitments resolution and through this debate in his view that the world has changed so much that perhaps the Constitution of yesterday does not meet the requirements of today. Nevertheless. the proper course of action. in my judgment. would be that if a study is indicated in the future. it should be considered as separate legislation. Do not tie it on the end of this legislation. so that the House of Representatives or anyone else who views it can say. \"Well. that is an uncertain body. They debated for almost 2 years. they studied for almost 2 years. they developed a hybrid bill out of five different approaches on the subject of war powers. and then. on the end of it. they said. But we better turn it over to a Presidential commission to study during the first 2 years of its enactment. \" It is on this basis that I oppose the amendment. as we did the suggestion by the Senator from Maryland which was voted on. many hours ago. today.

I once discussed with the distinguished Senator from New York the thought of a substitute for his bill through this procedure. and the objection was raisedand understandablythat this puts it off for another 2 years. that it is a delaying action. I am suggesting here that we not delay anything. that we support this measure. because it does cover the short run. I think most Senators here would be the last to suggest that it holds the ultimate of the answers on the question of facing future policy crisis decisions. We still have not caught up with the changing times. This amendment would only urge that we put this group at work right now. looking ahead. to make recommendations back. It. in turn. does not prejudice what we are doing here tonight. It seems to me that it strengthens it by saying to all who would listen to us that we want this done over the long range. the right way. We have waited too long as it is.

Anything the Senator from Wyoming proposes in this field certainly is worthy of the Senates consideration. and certainly has mine. But I think that now. having inched forward somewhat in the single purpose of the bill. we would confuse the issue. and the interpretation would be that we did not know which we wanted to do. I would favor this overall reconsideration or renegotiation of our commitments in the light of conditions as they exist now. I have said that many times here in arguing the procurement bill.

The idea of the Senator from Wyoming deserves the fullest consideration of this body as a billthe weighing of it. the careful wording of it. the consultation with the executive. and all the considerations that would go into an exhaustive review of all the matters that he mentions. not only the war powers but also the U.S. foreign policy and national commitments.

I refer to the East Technical High School Scarabs of Cleveland who. led by coach John Chavers. have highlighted Ohio basketball over the years. In 1958 and 1959 East Tech took two consecutive State championships but since has been unable to capture the title. This year. led by senior center Freddie Beamon. the captain of the Scarabs. East Tech faltered in the semifinals of the class \"AAA\" tournament after an heroic comeback effort that marked one of their finest exhibitions of skill and teamwork. Other starters for the Scarabs last season were junior forwards Robert Lukas and James Abrams and guards Lawrence Bolden and Sam Walker. Walker was the defensive standout of the team. Since its championship in 1959. East Tech has participated in the State championship tournaments six times. reaching the semifinals and the finals three times each. The team has had strong support from the other students and the schools principal. Mr. Joseph Smith. whose leadership and loyalty was acknowledged when the team presented its trophy to him on their return to Cleveland. Undaunted by his teams loss. Coach Chavers is already looking to next years season.

Rather than continue to live in an atmosphere of such tyranny and oppression. many Russian Jews are desirous of emigrating to Israel.

The Passover season is a most fitting time for a reversalof this policy.

Its first aim was simply \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war\". this we are still trying to do. But in its other aims. it has realized greater progress: the nations of the world have cooperated. to a great extent. \"to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights.\" \"to establish conditions of justice and respect.\" \"to promote social progress and better standards of life\" for all mankind. What is more. the fact that a world body has continued to press for these ends has made all the nations and peoples of the world. individually. more conscious of the rights of other men. Recently. the U.S. mission to the United Nations issued a summary of the accomplishments and concerns of this historic anniversary session just concluded: The 127th nation was admitted to the world body. A treaty prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons in the seabeds of the world was adopted by the General Assembly. U.N. peacekeeping responsibilities in Cyprus and Korea were considered and extended. The nations of the world once again expressed their profound distress over the continuing remnants of colonialism and racial injustice in Southern Africa. A new strategy for development in the U.N.s second development decade was adopted. encompassing new approaches to world trade and transfer of financial resources.

After Russian troops were allowed to enter Lithuania in 1939. Russia then annexed her in 1940. The German Nazis then drove out the Russians. replacing one cruel totalitarianism for another. The country was reconquered in 1944 by the Soviet Union. For these people of Lithuania there is little opportunity for freedomculturally. politically. individually.

Although early reports on the other incidents do not indicate that they were executiontype slayings. nevertheless these tragic and useless incidents continue to occur across this Nation. During the last Congress I introduced a bill. S. 4348. to make assaults and killings of State and local law enforcement officers. firemen. and judicial officials a Federal crime. Hearings were held on that bill. along with other similar bills. by the Senate Internal Securities Subcommittee last fall. At that time. convincing evidence was presented by eminent police and law enforcement officials that the killing of these officers is a national problem and that there Is substantial justification for Federal legislative action. Regrettably. because of the lateness of the session. no action was taken on that legislation last year. I have reintroduced the bill this year. slightly redrafted. as S. 120.

It will be recalled that that status was a threat to the freedom of Danzig and. ultimately. to world peace. Professor Smith believes that the current situation in West Berlin is awkward but livable. and he wonders why we have allowed ourselves to become preoccupied with it to the extent that. in a seriously troubled world. we invest so much energy in tampering with a relatively stable situation. Professor Smith suggests an answer to that question: Obviously the U.S. State Department has too many people with too little to do. The result is to continually dredge up livable but nevertheless awkward problems for refinement. In the case of Berlin. such efforts can only be selfdefeating. Gradually. points that were nonnegotiable prove negotiable. and gradually positions of strength become hostages to doubt. In the case of Berlin. let sleeping dogs lie. Mr. President. so that all Senators can profit from Professor Smiths reasoning. I ask unanimous consent that his important letter to be printed in the RECORD.",

I want to begin by saying that ona of the six goals that President Nixon emphasized in his revolutionary State of the Union message. of all the six. he called \"welfare reform\" the most importantcharacterizing it as a \"monstrous consuming outrage.\" His new welfare reform plan. calls for taking employable people off welfare and putting them to work. Monetary policy. which you control. has a great deal to do with how much employment opportunity exists. What if. when welfare reform is enacted. there are not enough jobs to take the employables off the welfare list? Will you then be forced to pump more money into the economy to create more jobs to make the welfare system work?",

Its a question concerning the administrations optimistic \"upturn\" claimssubtitle: \"Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?\" The Harris Survey. results appearing nationwide on Christmas Day. asked the question: \"Do you have a great deal of confidence that the Nixon administration will keep the cost of living under control. and will reduce unemployment in 1971?\" Only 18% had a great deal of confidence in President Nixons assurances.

As early as 1881 the Supreme Court said we are sure that no person can be punished for contumacy as a witness before either House unless his testimony is required in a matter to which that House has Jurisdiction into which to inquire. and we feel equally sure that neither of these bodies possesses the general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen. Every inquiry. the Supreme Court has stated. must be related to and in furtherance of a legitimate task of the Congress. On another occasion it affirmed that Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate appropriately.\" Wouldnt you concede that Congress cannot legislate with respect to the exercise ofin such a way as to prohibit or to impair the exercise ofthe First Amendment rights.",

Mr. Upenieks is an American citizen who was born near Dalgopils. Latvia. on November 15. 1918. He worked hard putting himself through elementary school in Svente and secondary school in Ilukste. not overlooking any jobs which would supplement his income. As a loyal Latvian. he joined the armed forces of his country when he graduated from school. In 1941. he was appointed secretary of the city and township of Ilukste. an important position in the government service of Latvia. The upheavals of the Second World War separated Ludis Upenieks from his family and at the wars conclusion he established himself in Esslingen. Germany as a designer of custom made jewelry. His talents found quick recognition. and he had many customers. But. because of the greater opportunities in this country. Mr. Upenieks migrated to the United States in 1950. When he arrived here he resumed his trade on the west coast. However. because he wished to build and create on a larger scale. he came to the east coast and began to learn the housing construction trade. After a year with a large construction firm in Manchester. Conn.. Mr. Upenieks became a subcontractor for the same company. In 1956 he formed partnership with Mr. Ilmar Ruppner and the firm flourished. Since then. the Upenieks and Ruppner Construction Co. has provided hundreds of job opportunities for Latvian Americans in the home construction field. The success of the Upenieks and Ruppner Construction Co. has meant more than helping his fellow countrymen to find employment. Because of his desire to help his adopted country. Mr. Upenieks had made substantial contributions to scholarships for young Americans of Latvian origin. Because of the generosity of this Latvian American. many young Americans have been able to continue their education and develop their full potential. Mr. Upenieks is indeed an outstanding example for his community. We can be proud that such men as Mr. Upenieks have come to our shores to lend us their courage and their skill in building America.

Finally. I think we have taken care of again a legitimate concern of the President. and so expressed by him in his veto message. with regard to the question of accountability. All three of these matters are vastly different than the bill which was reported out by the HouseSenate conference committee. and which the President vetoed and gave the reasons for doing so as he did. all but one of which we have taken care of. So this is not an illustration the gentleman from Minnesota used of a Senate bill and a House bill being in total conflict. This is a different bill than the bill the President vetoed.

A noted expert on human behaviorDr. Bruno Bettelheim. a psychologist and founding member of the National Academy of Education. and a fellow and diplomat of the American Psychological Associationsays it is a result of the settings in which we are brought up as children. If we grow up in a settingan environmentthat is deeply meaningful to us. and that we can cherish. we will. as adults. treat any environment with respect and appreciation. If. on the other hand. our setting during those impressive years does not have a personal meaning to us. it is not likely our environment will be important to us as adults. This Nation stands on the threshold of a new lifestyle. We are involved in planning cities. combatting pollution. preserving the landscape. and perfecting transportation. We must also concern ourselves with other areas affecting how we live. and that includes the interior spaces in which our citizens spend the majority of their time. There Is no computer in this highly technological society which can measure the influence a home has on the quality of life. Nor is it likely that there ever will be any systematic means of judging the specific effects of the home on \"health of our society.\" However. it is roundly accepted In America. that the home is vital to our way of life. Yet. ironically. it tends to be overlooked in our priorities. I propose a National Home Fashions Week. to begin September 26. 1971. to bring national attention to the importance of the home.

This week marked the 30th anniversary of Soviet mass deportations. in June 1941. of tens of thousands of Baltic men. women. and children to Siberian slave labor camps. Such largescale deportations of Estonians. Latvians. and Lithuanians continued in the postWorld War II period. Lithuania was one of the first countries to experience the aggression of the Soviet Union. On October 10. 1939. a mutual assistance treaty was forced upon that small nation by the Russians. and she was forced to grant air bases and to admit Soviet garrisons. On June 15. 1940. the Soviets occupied the country. and after a \"rigged\" election. Lithuania was declared a constituent republic of the U.S.S.R. just 2 months later. And within a year. Lithuania lost about 45.000 people as they fled. were arrested. or deported. Some 30.000 members of the nations intelligentsia were deported to Siberia on the night of June 14. 1941. and 5.000 political prisoners were executed when the Soviet forces hastily retreated under German attack. Lithuanias suffering is only an example of the difficulties faced by all Baltic peoples. Resistance continues to this day. as a tradition handed down from father to son to grandson. World opinion must be directed at any appropriate international forum to the denial of the rights of selfdetermination for the peoples of Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia. Their fight has been long and bitter and it still continues. As it does. we should help our fellow citizens to preserve their culture and continue their traditions within the framework of American life.",

He was right in saying we need action now and that a constitutional amendment will take a long time to accomplish.

I said in the House recently. and I say again.

The list of uses of the peanut is extensive. and the crop is a vital factor in the agricultural economy of southeast Alabama. the \"Peanut Capital of the World.\" as it is in other States. As a general rule. the peanut farmer is not a large operator. his farm is of limited acreage and his income from peanuts is not great. However. he depends heavily on peanuts as a cash crop. Mr. Speaker. peanut farmers need to be able to participate to a greater extent under the Department of Agricultures rural environmental assistance programREAP. Erosion is a continuing problem for peanut farmers for. after the crop is harvested around midAugust. there is no cover to protect the soil for some 7 months. Even with cotton or corn. there are root systems and grass to protect the topsoil. but not with peanuts. There has been a considerable effort to reduce erosion by encouraging the planting of a permanent cover such as pine trees. but the peanut farmers land is too valuable to convert to forest land. Longrange practices qualify others for a payment of 80 percent of the cost under the REAP program. but winter cover crops to protect the peanut farmers land is funded at only 30 percent. This should be increased to at least 50 percent. I believe. and I have strongly recommended such a change to Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. I have also written to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture of the House Committee on Appropriations and urged that a change in this policy be made. I intend to personally testify on behalf of such a change before the subcommittee later in the year.

The words of the President on the highly emotional issue of busing are tantamount to a new doctrine of nullification. Insteadof offering the moral leadership which the Nation requires at this difficult time. he is catering to those who would roll back the clock on civil rights. The proposed antibusing legislation which would impose a moratorium on all new or additional busing orders is of doubtful constitutionality. To suggest that Congress legislate a ban on the power of the Federal courts to fashion decrees to carry out the Supreme Court desegregation decision is to provoke a confrontation between the judicial and legislative branches.

While the Rehabilitation Administration has made progress through program evaluation in the past. the growing pressure on funding makes it imperative that we get the maximum possible benefit for our dollar. With this in mind I offered an amendment to strengthen the evaluation authority in the bill and establish specific evaluation guidelines for the first time. Briefly. the new title requires that all State plans and direct grant applications contain a clear statement of the goals of the services to be provided. For subsequent evaluation purposes these goals are to be listed in order of priority and stated as much as possible in a form amendable to quantification. The Secretary is directed to establish standards for evaluating vocational rehabilitation projects prior to the release of funds. He is then directed to evaluate the impact. effectiveness. delivery structure and cost/benefit ratio of all programs. The results of these evaluations are to be published and taken into consideration in future funding recommendations.

Under title I. the fiscal year 1972 appropriation was $1.1 billion. The budget estimate was $1.6 billion.

The continuing resolution which we operated under. and are still operating on. is $1.2 billion. The House passed $1 billion under title I. and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a little over $1 billion. By addition of the $100 million which went for the Alliance for Progress. from $50 million to $150 million. that raised the figures from approximately $1 billion in the Senate bill to $1.1 billion. Let us see what this does. It takes out the $175 million which is already in the bill for Pakistani relief. reducing it to $925 million. Then. if the Administration decides to take the $250 million for Bangladesh relief. it reduces it another $250 million. to $675 million.

But if we are satisfied with the overall budgetary situation. in spite of all of our troubles. trying not to be hardhearted or to have the hard feelings of a rich man walking along the streets of the world. which is a lot poorer than we are then we have got to devote something to the cause of world relief and world assistance.

I should point out. on the question of our moral obligation that we should help Bangladesh because we gave arms to Pakistan. that Nigeria. for example. was given arms by us. They had an insurrection there and a lot of people were killed. I guess we should have had an amendment to the bill to pick up the tab or provide some relief for that. We have also given arms to El Salvador. Honduras. and so forthas a matter of fact. I have a list in my hand of 46 countries to which we have given arms. This is grant military aid. Many more countries we have given what are called salesthey are not really sales. but a kind of sales. and so forth. Thus. the idea that we are responsible for everyone does not appeal to me. All my amendment would provide is that if we want the Government to do it. we should give so much money up to $250 million. They may still do so. The difference between my amendment and that of the Senator from Illinois is that mine takes it out of the money available under title I of the bill. That is the only difference. Neither does the amendment of the Senator from Illinois force the administration to spend this money on this problem. It simply authorizes them to do so. If they think. in their idea of priority. that it comes above in importance to other items in the bill there is great and wide power to transfer.

The forums sponsors recently sent me a report of the proceedings which I feel may be of interest. The report follows: On October 3. 1970. the Contra Costa Community Forum on Local Needs and National Priorities was held at Diablo Valley College. Pleasant Hill. California. The purpose of th18 Forum was to stress the need for a review and reordering of national priorities. The goal of the Forum was to establish a positive response between government and citizens as to our mutual needs. Significant statistics were revealed regarding expenditures for the year ending June 30. 1970. i.e.. for each of the 160.000 families in Contra Costa County. the Dept. of Defense spent $625 for defense purchases and $215 for defense payrolls. The total expenditures of health. education and welfare (including Social Security) came to only $345 per family. Thus. we spend $840 for war and only $345 for local social needs. The Forum consisted of six workshops whose objective it was to examine in depth the unmet needs of Contra Costa County. They were: 1) BUSINESS. chaired by specialist Fortney Stark. president of Security National Bank and prominent civic leader. \"Business slowdown in the county is due to the antiinflation squeeze (higher unemployment. hence less buying).

I believe that the Presidents plan to merge a wide variety of volunteer groups into a single agency offers a fresh opportunity and challenge to those who want to build a better America. The Presidents Reorganization Plan No. 1 would do more than simply bring together the Peace Corps. VISTA. SCORE. Foster Grandparents. and other volunteer agencies. It would create a single agency called Action. a central headquarters for all those who want to volunteer a year or several years to helping his fellow man. It seems to me that this is both a more efficient and more effective way to tap the volunteer resources of this Nation. We can give due credit to those in the Peace Corps and in other agencies who demonstrated over the past decade that the volunteer spirit still runs strong. But. as the President pointed out in his message to Congress. it is time to build on this experience and move on to new ways of enabling volunteers to help solve problems of poverty here and abroad. I believe that there are many. many. people that would volunteer on a fulltime or parttime basis if they knew where to volunteer. A single agency ought to make it easier for these people to participate. I think the new Action agency can do this by encouraging local initiative. by backing up volunteers with technical assistance. by marshaling more parttime volunteers. by linking up with other experienced organizations and by enlisting more craftsmen and professionals as volunteers. In other words. I think that Action may be the type of volunteer agency needed for the 1970s.",

If we are unwilling as a Congress to look at a half dozen programs that could reasonably be combined in one agency so that we really would get \"more bang for the buck.\" so that there would be more to help the constituency for which it is intended. unless we are willing to do this. it seems to me absolutely hopeless so far as any meaningful reorganization of this sprawling Government is concerned. Young people and others are asking for a Government that will be more responsive to the needs of the people. Today. nobody in the executive branch and nobody in the Congress really knows the extent of all the various 1.400 or 1.500 programs.

The Governor of Nevada has informed me the State will receive only about 75 percent of the $31.6 million in highway funds authorized for fiscal 1973. This means that although Congress. acting under its constitutional powers. saw fit to provide Nevada with $31.6 million for road construction. the Nixon administration. acting under nothing more than gall. decided that $23.4 million was enough. Not only has the OMB drastically cut available funds. it has also dictated methods of allocating them that will mean millions more cannot be used. Under a new quarterly control system. the State would have to carry over funds from quarter to quarter to use them all. Unfortunately. this is tantamount to kissing the money goodbye. because. as the Governor says. OMB is in the habit of confiscating unobligated monthly balances.

Is it fair to say that this section prevents the court from desegregating vast numbers of segregated schools within city lines and also throws the burden unequally on those white families that happen to live within the congested areas adjacent to the boundaries of those ghetto schools? There are many objectionable features to the bill. but this section seems to cry out. Would it not prevent a court from undertaking to eliminate constitutional denial? To the limited extent relief Is provided. the whole wallop is provided to white families closest to the area of highest segregation. This is wrong clearly on two counts. It seems to disarm the court in its ability to deliver constitutional protection. and it has the effect of aiming a gun at white families that cannot afford to move.",

I realize that it cannot be maintainedthat in fact it violates the Constitutionany more. for example. than the fact that the neighborhood public swimming pool might have been much more convenient. but if admission to it had been conditioned upon race. of course. the convenience would be secondary and the constitutional obligation paramount.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I support the three developmental assistance bills before us today as they continue this country on the path of foreign aid I find most desirablethat of multilateral developmental assistance. I think the United States should devote more of its foreign aid to multilateral agencies and less to its own bilateral program. I am pleased that the administration and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are taking this approach. I think the multilateral approach offers many advantages: First. the United States typically contributes only about 40 percent of the total capital required. In the case of the IDA it is exactly 40 percent of the total contribution by advanced countries and 38 percent of the total share of IDA funds contributed. In contrast to bilateral aid. we are helping to create a dollars worth of development for 40 cents. Second. without the coercion or political pressures often present in bilateral programs. the multilateral agencies can allocate assistance and make recommendations to recipient countries to put their economic houses in order. Multilateral agencies relieve any one country of too great a burden for the development of any one recipient country. Third. multilateral agencies have a pool of talent and knowledge available that no one country can match. I feel that such agencies are the most effective way of funneling aid to needy countries as well as the most effective way of insuring that more countries contribute a fair share to developmental assistance. The record of the World Bank is exemplary and it has superb leadtrship. I strongly support the administration and the Foreign Relations Committee on these bills and agree with the committee in its report where it says: The multilateral is superior to the bilateral method of giving development aid.",

What makes our task easier than it could be is that all Americans. regardless of political persuasion. are united in their desire to reach practical solutions for improving the economy. In this context. we should welcome all imaginative proposals and give them serious consideration before acting on a final package. One such proposal has been made recently before the Finance Committee. and I believe it merits the close scrutiny of Senators. My staff has developed the \"Employment Incentive Act of 1971.\" which would give a tax credit to firms hiring additional employees during the tax year in question. Quite independently. Prof. B. F. Roberts. of the economic forecasting project at the University of California. Berkeley. has developed a similar proposal. linking the credit to a percentage of wages paid to additional employees. Yesterday Professor Roberts testified in favor of this general approach to stimulating the economy and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. Senator BROOKE. testified in favor of the Employment Incentive Act of 1971. Mr. President. the conclusions thus reached by my staff merit the Senates attention. There seems to be general agreement. for example. that a tax credit such as S. 2632 represents. could result in the creation of 500.000 additional jobs over and above current projections by the end of 1972. The cost of the Treasury under one projection would be significantly less than the cost per job of the investment tax credit. the University of Californias projection actually comes out with a net gain to the Treasury from my bill. Professor Roberts testimony also includes some very illuminating theoretical considerations relating to the advisability of a tax credit for additional employment. I believe the conclusions reached in these two excellent pieces of testimony * are convincing. and should add constructively to the current debate.

The privately owned AutoTrain Corp.. will begin operating daily service between the Washington area and midFlorida on December 6. The concept outlined in the advertisement is innovative yet sound. Senators may recall that the autotrain project began as a Federal program. I was among its most ardent supporters. The House of Representatives denied funds for further development of the concept in 1967. and the money already appropriated was used to begin work on the National Transportation Test Center in Pueblo. Colo. The AutoTrain Corp.. sometime later picked up the pieces. changed the design of the train. and went forward in initiating the service. I am very pleased that the private sector went forward to do that which the Federal Government was unwilling to finish. I raise the matter again. Mr. President. because at the time this was still a Federal project. Dr. Robert Nelson. then the Director of the Office of High Speed Ground Transportation at DOT. told me that if the WashingtonFlorida run was successful. the Governments intentions were to plan similar service between Chicago and Denver. Such service would be particularly attractive for skiers and other winter oriented tourists. Now that the matter is no longer in the hands of the Department of Transportation. I want to take this means to express my wishand I know I speak for the State of Colorado in doing sothat the AutoTrain Corp. would also consider a ChicagoDenver operation as its next project.

Should our Government officially provide to South Africa access to sugar allotments. when those who will produce a major part of the sugar are subject to the governmental policy of apartheid? We have known here for many years. all about the policy of apartheid. Let me say first that I do not want to interfere in any way with private trade or investments. Our trade with South Africa is $700 million and their trade with us. is $43 million. The United States has already acted. and has as its declared policy a prohibition upon any army equipment. ammunition. or materiel going to South Africa. Why? Because our country wanted to show its disfavor with South Africas policy of apartheid. We know that there is discrimination all over the world. We might even include Rhodesia. but I do not know of any other country which has officially and governmentally made discrimination its national policy. Not only has it made discrimination a policy both economically and socially. but it has passed laws to prevent the courts from adjudicating or giving due process to all its citizens. What we are talking about today is official policy toward South Africa because of its apartheid policy and not toward private enterprise or private trade. I think the least we can do as a congressional body in disapproval of apartheid is to show in this respect of a sugar quota that we do not have to give to South Africa access to a public program of the U.S. Government. I think we can do that at the very. very minimum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this legislation extends for 3 years the system of pricefixing. quotas. and subsidies for domestic sugar producers. In order to assure the 28.000 U.S. sugar producers of high prices and profits. the Sugar Act imposes a large but hidden tax on 200 million American consumers and hundreds of thousands of U.S. food processors. The continuation of this subsidy flies in the face of sound international economic policy and contains inflexible new expropriation procedures which could cause major foreign policy complications. I cannot vote for a bill which retains benefits for South Africa and Haiti. but which refuses to guarantee housing and fair representation for 150.000 overworked and underpaid sugar workers. The sugar worker protection amendment which I offered would have mitigated the negative effects of the Sugar Act by spreading the benefits of the subsidy to those who need it most. I recognize that if the Sugar Act were to be abolished today. these innocent farmworkers would suffer. For that reason. I voted for a 1year extension which would have afforded ample time for the Government to come to grips with the problem of job loss. but I cannot justify the longterm continuation of inflationary subsidies which this bill calls for. I also recognize that the artificially high U.S. price of sugar works to the disadvantage of U.S. confectioners and food processors. causing them to lose business and jobs to foreign competitors who pay the free market price for sugar. They should be freed from the competitive disadvantages imposed on them by the sugar subsidy. The victory which the sugar lobby will undoubtedly win today is won at the expense of American consumers and farmworkers and grocers and food processors. I hope it is its last victory.",

Mr. President. in adjusting the difference between the Senate- and Housepassed versions of H.R. 7109. the conferees agreed upon $2.603.200.000 for the 12 programs in the research and development section of the bill. The Senate had authorized $2.543.200 for these programs. an amount $124.400.000 less than the House.

I think it is significant that as Apollo XV is on its way to the moon. we in the U.S. Senate are passing an authorization act for 1 more year of activity for the space program. Several things in this bill are worth noting. One is an improvement in the authorization language over what it has been in the past. I refer particularly to the construction. Heretofore. we have authorized. in rather block manner. construction at a certain location. In this bill. the Senate provided for naming specific facilities to be built. modified. or improved. That view prevailed in the conference. and I believe it is a gain toward good Government and more efficient Government. When we stop to consider that in 1966 the space program was spending almost $6 billion and that it is down now to a little more than $3 billion. we can see the benefits of annual authorizations. I regret very much that our authorization bill is not completed each year before the appropriation bill starts on its way through the House of Representatives and the Senate. because in many instances the action of the legislative committees. in a sense. is predetermined by action already taken by the appropriations committees or the House or the Senate as a whole.

Its 2.000 attorneys in 900 neighborhood offices handle more than a million cases per year on behalf of the poor.

This bill is a testament to the value of the program and to the administrations commitment to equal justice for all Americans.

An 11 member bipartisan board of directorsa majority of whom must be lawyersappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

The power to represent the collective interests of the poor before Federal agencies.

But at the same time it preserves the professional independence of the program attorneys. By providing a permanent. independent home for the legal services program. we can demonstrate to those who are poor and powerless that the system does listen and respond to their needs.

Identical legislation has been introduced in House by Congressman BERNIE SISK Of California. In 1967. the Congress enacted the Agricultural Fair Practices Act which established the policy that because agricultural products are produced by numerous individal farmers. and most of the products are perishable. they have very little marketing and bargaining power unless they are able to voluntarily join together in cooperative organizations. However. the 1967 act did not include an affirmative duty to bargain. Thus the 1967 acts prohibition against unfair bargaining practices has not been effective. The legislation which I am introducing today creates a mutual duty for producers and purchasers of agricultural commodities to bargain in good faith. The bill would not. however. impose an agreement upon the parties. This bill contemplates and encourages a goodfaith mutual desire on both sides to arrive at a reasonable solution beneficial to both. The bill defines bargaining as the mutual obligation of a handler and a qualified association of producers to meet at reasonable times and to negotiate in good faith with respect to the price. terms of sale. compensation for commodities produced under contracts. and other contract provisions. In addition. the bill sets up administrative machinery by which the bargalning parties are defined and the policy and procedures are enforced. Finally. this legislation amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act to extend eligibility for marketing orders to all agricultural commodities. Agriculture is the No. 1 industry economically in the State of California producing an annual farm income of $4.5 billion. Farmersparticularly small farmers--face severe economic difficulty given the farmers vulnerability in the marketplace. It is my hope that hearings will be held on this legislation and that Congress will soon enact this or similar legislation designed to insure the continuation of an economically sound and diversified agricultural industry.

Senator CHURCH. a bill to provide more equitable treatment to veterans enrolled in vocational education courses. Under present law. vocational students who are enrolled in educational courses under the GI bill are subject to being counted absent from their courses on some days when the school is not in session. The law provides that vocational students may have 30 days of excused absences during a 12month period. not counting weekends and legal holidays established by Federal or State laws during which the institution is not in session. If the student is absent in excess of the 30 days. he does not receive compensation during any of such days. The difficulty is that most schools have vacation periods which do not consist solely of weekends or legal holidays. For example. it is standard practice for many institutions to allow a 2week vacation period for Christmas. It has been brought to my attention that veterans studying at such institutions may be given unexcused absences for up to 10 days during such a vacation period. This situation seems to me to be clearly inequitable. especially since academic students do not receive similar treatment. The inequity is clearly pointed out in a letter which I received from Mr. Andrew J. Riksem. a vocational student at the College of Southern Idaho.

Would they rather he spent his leisure -hours traveling the length and breadth of the land saying that war is great? Would they have him junket from place to place In quest of pleasure at public expense? . I.think not.

Some fight for peace. others preach for peace. General Haines Is In the unique position of being willing and able to do both. He should not be questioned in this pursuit. He should not be challenged. He should be cheered and supported and helped. We need more men like him in America today. Let us each hope he is successful in bringing about peace through prayer so that he may never again be called upon to seek peace through power.",

I am gratified that the conference committee has seen the wisdom of approving the additional funds for bilingual education which Representative BADILLO and I proposed earlier before the House. The increase provides for an additional $15 million beyond the original House appropriation for the bilingual education program. Spanishspeaking students have continually faced educational problems because schools have been unable to properly meet their educational needs. As a result of these inadequate educational opportunities. Spanishspeaking students have a lower achievement rate. drop out of schools at an earlier age. have poorer reading skills. and tend to repeat more grades than their Anglo peers. Most of these problems stem from the individual schools inability to effectively teach Spanishspeaking students due to the schools failure to tailor its teaching methods to the unique problems and background of the student. Therefore. the Bilingual Education Act was passed by Congress in 1968 as a partial answer to the social problems encountered by Spanishspeaking students. The act provides that the school curriculum be presented in the native language of the student and places emphasis on the tradition and culture of the student. The program recognizes the unique contribution the Spanish language has made to American culture and the need for participants to be schooled in both English and Spanish. Unfortunately. less than 2.5 percent of the eligible students are now participating in this program due to the administrations failure to utilize more than 30 percent of the funds which Congress has authorized for the program. The action we have taken will enable us to fund another 110 projects and help 90.000 more children. This represents a substantial increase in the number of students who will receive the benefits of this unique program and I sincerely hope that the President will consider this in his deliberations on this bill.",

As I told the committee. I have talked with Mr. Shultz. director of the Office of Management and Budget. in company with the Senator from Ohio . and supported also by my colleague from Kentucky . and all Senators -who live in States along the Ohio River. asking that to this amount $10 million be added to meet the revised capability of the Corps of Engineers. I have been informed that this matter is presently under consideration by the Office of Management and Budget. that it is possible it will be approved. But it is too late now. I assume. for this bill. unless the Senator is willing for the Senate to add the $10 million. However. if it is not provided now. and It comes before the committee and the Senate at the time the supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal 1972 is before the Senate.

I did want to say just a word about the appropriation proposal here or the Central Utah project. Bonneville unit. and the other Utah project. It is with the greatest disappointment that I note that the Senate Appropriations Committee has followed along in the traces of the House and has presented a bill for only $10 million on the Bonneville unit. This means that at this rate of appropriation. we will be 50 years building this project. This is the project by which Utahs water from the river. which we are entitled to by interstate compact. will be made available to the State. This is something we have been trying to get for almost 50 years. and now it seems that it will be 100 years before we can realize the return we need. In our country. we need water. The same is true with respect to the Jensen unit. following along with $200.000 in construction. and then nothing at all for Upalco. Provo project. and nothing at all for the Dixie project. on which we have been working for almost 40 years. for which we once had funding. but now there is nothing at all. I express my disappointment because I think that the development of water projects in the West is the single most important thing we need.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in Vietnam. our Nation has been pulled into a quagmire in which more than 54.000 young Americans have died. Many were draftees. plucked from the campus and the assembly line to forfeit their lives in distant rice marshes. The vast majority were in their teens or early twenties. They died in defense not of American shores or interests or liberties. but in an effort to sustain a faraway military oligarchyan effort that has spanned 17 bloody years. Well. that war must be brought to an end. And so should the sacrifice of young men called by our draft. Therefore. I am submitting an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act. Specifically. it will prohibit draftees from serving in any combat zone without prior congressional authorization. This amendment will be a major step toward American disengagement from the war in Southeast Asia. It will be a major step toward restoration of congressional authority over decisions of war and peace. It will be a major step toward preventing administrations from launching expeditionary forces into foreign wars. It will be a major step toward reducing the anxiety of our young that their lives will be wasted in a futile and foolish war. It will be a major step toward ending the tensions now dividing our Nation. Finally. it will be a major step in supporting two other amendments that will restrict the draft and bring it within rational limits. One is by Senator BIRCH BAYH and would limit extension of the draft to 1 year. The other is by Senator EDWARD KENNEDY and would give Congress sole authority to increase the draft quota beyond a ceiling of 150.000 men each year. To me. these amendments make sense. They permit the Nation to wind down the draft as the war in Vietnam winds down. I would support one more amendment to the draft--the HatfleldMcGovern amendment that would do what most Americans want: end American involvement in Southeast Asia by the end of this year.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 2 weeks ago I registered my unequivocal opposition to all bills before the Foreign Relations Committee which would shackle the Presidents ability to defend our freedoms. These bills are collectively known as the War Powers bills because they each profess to place the dominant power over the making and sustaining of war in the hands of Congress. In other words. these measures are aimed at establishing arbitrary and mechanical rules under which. and only under which. the American President can commit U.S. military units to armed hostilities. Not only do these bills purport -to define the sole instances in which the President can initiate military hostilities. but they would avowedly refuse him the right to continue such engagements beyond a brief period unless and until he has obtained specific policy approval and direction from Congress. Mr. President. I have previously expressed my strong view that the constitutionality of any such legislation is highly doubtful. Each President can and probably will simply ignore it. The Supreme Court will likely refuse to consider it. And the American people. as well as the governments of allied and friendly nations around the world. will be utterly confused as to what the United States might do in the event of military emergencies affecting them. Today I can report that the committee has received confirmation of many of the doubts I had raised. For on April 26. Prof. John Norton Moore. of the University of Virginia School of Law. who is a renowned authority on international law. presented to the Committee on Foreign Relations what I believe to be the clearest and most objective testimony the committee has received regarding the War Powers legislation. Though it is evident that Professor Moores personal sympathies lies with the goal of infusing greater congressional involvement in the important political decisions leading up to and out of war. his testimony plainly sets out an exceedingly logical. unbiased. and honest analysis of the problems surrounding the current proposals for limiting the Executives authority over the use of the Armed Forces. Clearly. Professor Moore has undertaken to serve the committee as a frank and unemotional commentator on the issues before it. For this reason. I am deeply impressed with several of the conclusions reached by Professor Moore. For example. in speaking of the proposed legislation introduced by the Senator from New York",

Lithuania has been subjugated to foreign control for all but 22 years of its existence. Yet the spirit which prevailed in 1251. when the Lithuanian principalities were united into one kingdom by Mindaugas the Great. has never ceased to unite these people. Following World War I. a democratic government was established in Lithuania. The taste of . freedom was savored for less than a quarter of a decade. Invading German and Soviet armies crushed the structure of Lithuanias democracy. but force alone could not conquer the spirit of freedom.

Stalin moved rapidly into Lithuania. and the tiny country became a satellite colony of the giant Communist power. No amount of terror and oppression has succeeded in destroying the hope of Lithuanians that they will one day be able to live in a democratic state once again. Individual liberty remains their goal.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to remind the Senate of the continuing threat of foreign fishing fleets which are off the coasts of the United States. There can be no doubt that the fishing activity of nations who fall to meet the standards set for American commercial fishermen is a serious menace to our marine resources. Using techniques that are forbidden to our own fishermen. fishing in areas closed to Americans. destroying gear that has been legally set by our crabbers in reckless forays into American waters. foreign exploitation of our fisheries resources jeopardize the legitimate conservation interests of the State of Alaska and the United States. The economic impact of shortsighted policies which have permitted the United States to decline to a sixthrate fishing power will be felt. not only in the maritime States. but throughout the Nation. However. the economic consequences will be greatest in my State of Alaska. where many depend entirely on the sea for income and whole families look to the Alaska fishery for a large part of their diet. I have been notified by the Alaska Fish and Game Department that the salmon pack this year may be the poorest in an even year in a decade. The threat is there today. just a few miles outside our waters: One hundred and six Russian vessels and 16 Japanese are fishing for herring on both sides of the international date line just off Nunivak Island. Ninetyfive Russian fishing vessels and 53 Japanese are fishing for ground fish in the Unalaska and Dutch Harbor area. Two Russians are fishing above Adak. one Japanese and three Russians are near Shumigan. Between Semedi Islands and Chirikof Islands. 12 Russians are trawling for shrimp. In an area just outside Kodiak. four Japanese and three Russians fish for black cod and perch. Two Japanese vessels are at Cape Yakataga. Ten Japanese are between Cape Fairweather and Sitka. In the future. I intend to notify this body each week of this continuing threat to Americas commercial fishermen and our Nations marine resources. The message should be loud and clear: If the United States is to maintain its sustained yield from our fisheries resources. these foreign vessels must come under the control of at least the same laws that apply to U.S. fishermen.",

President Nixon announced his opposition to forced busing. but offered no plan to put a stop to this outrageous practice. Instead. the President appointed a Cabinet committee to inquire into the matter. Several days after this meeting. I was consulted by representatives of the Cabinet committee. and after a lengthy discussion. I proposed to them a fourpoint plan for dealing rapidly with the busing crisis. As yet. President Nixon has not announced any plan on this subject. The issue is to be voted on today and the time for action has arrived. For the third time. since September of last year. I call upon the President to act decisively. I repeat the fourpoint plan which I suggested -to his representatives last week. They are as follows: First. That there be an immediate legislative rollback moratorium on forced school busing for integration purposes. This means that until a permanent solution to the matter can be arrived at there would be no more busing required by Federal courts. or the Department of HEW. that busing heretofore required would be terminated. and that this would be accomplished through legislation rather than by waiting for this to be done through executive or judicial action. Second. That the President. through the Justice Department. seek a prompt and comprehensive judicial determination of the constitutional issues involved in the busing controversy. Third. That immediate congressional consideration be given to a permanent constitutional and legislative solution which will preserve community public schools. free of racial discrimination. Fourth. That any Federal desegregation remedies hereafter adopted shall be uniformly applied in all regions of the country. Mr. President. the socalled Griffin amendment furnishes an opportunity to proceed in accordance with this 4point plan. I. therefore. urge the President to give an endorsement to the Griffin amendment and that the Senate act favorably on that amendment when the opportunity for voting arises at 12 oclock today.",

I must say I have to admire his courage. even though I think his judgment is pretty abysmal. I say that because as far as I know he is the only Senator who has stood on the floor of the Senate and advocated forced busing. I do not know anyone in this country that wants forced busing. whether he be black. Spanishspeaking. Chinese. or Japanese. The Chinese. as we know. have withdrawn their children from the public school system in San Francisroo and they have set up their own schools in order to avoid having their children bused from one area to another. In our State when this situation came up we had two Democratic school board members running in a Democratic city in favor of forced busing. We had two Republicans running against forced busing. I do not believe a Republican has been elected to our school board in years. On that occasion they were both overwhelmingly elected. They received 4tolmajorities in the Spanishspeaking area. February 29. 1972 COIN They received more than 50 percent of the black vote. They received the ChineseJapanese vote. as well as the white vote. There is no group that I know of. whether if be a minority group or any other group. that believe that to solve the problems of quality education we must simply take children and bus them past the school they may live next to and into an area they know nothing about. and spending the funds for buses instead of educational quality.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am moved also to make some response to this outbreak of debate on this issue which has been signaled by the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from South Dakota. The issue before the Senate is not forced busing. The issue before the Senate is whether the courts shall or shall not be permitted to utilize a particular remedy in given situations which require the use of that remedy. The reason I say that is that almost no one is contending for no amendment. We are contending for the ScottMansfield amendment. The opponents of that view are contending for the Griffin amendment. As I pointed out when I began today. the Griffin amendment is completely regressive. It takes us back far beyond what the Senator from Michigan himself. in my judgment. should seek. He would strike the jurisdiction of the courts to issue any order involving busing. even to correct segregation. For years. there are cases in which black children are bused on long bus trips by white schools in order to get to black schools. The important thing is that what we are contending for is really the determination of the courts in the Swann case. and asserting what is left open by the Swarm case. I am not sure it is left open. but in any case it might be so construed. In the Swarm case the court said where it would interfere with the childs health or welfare to be bused the child will not be bused. even if there is a need to bus to help cure segregation. The court went further and said where it impinges on the educational process of the child. busing must be limited or not required at all. The court left rather unclearalthough some think it is clear. I do notwhether the only impingement to be considered was impingement on the child being bused or impingement as well upon the school to which the child was being bused. What the ScottMansfield amendment would do. and I think it is monumental because it goes to every single substantial complaint that has any validity. would be to state that impingement on the educational process should be double track. It involves the child being bused and the children in the school to which he is being bused. and if the white child is CXVIII---377Part 5",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to take a few moments to bring to the attention of Senators a bill. S. 855. relating to retirement credit for Air Force and Army Naticnal Guard technicians. This bill was reported favorably by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and is now on the Senate Calendar. I support it wholeheartedly. National Guard technicians are civilian employees of the Federal Government who perform essential maintenance and technical services for National Guard units throughout the country. There are a total of 42.000 National Guard technicians. 392 of these in my own State of Delaware. As a result of the National Guard Technician Act of 1968. these technicians were made Federal employees for purposes of retirement and other benefits. However. at that time they were permitted only 55percent credit for their prior National Guard technician service on the grounds that they were covered during that period by social security and State retirement plans. Moreover. only those who continued to serve as technicians after the 1968 act were eligible for Federal retirement computed at the reduced cost. Mr. President. the inequity of this situation became apparent soon after* the National Guard technicians were brought under the Federal retirement program. Thirtyone States. for example. did not include National Guard technicians in State retirement programs. Of those which do. threefourths of the technicians do not have enough service to entitle them to a State annuity or enough quarters to receive social security. For several years I have joined with other Senators to grant these dedicated servants the dignity and security of a full retirement income in line with those received by other Federal employees. S. 855 would grant National Guard technicians 100percent retirement crecit for their service prior to 1968. They would have the option of paying into the retirement fund the amount that would have been withheld or taking a reduced annuity. In addition. technicians who moved to other positions would be eligible for retirement based on 100 percent of their service prior to 1968. and those already receiving annuities would have them recomputed to reflect the increase in creditable service. Mr. President. many technicians who began their work during World War II and the years thereafter are now reaching retirement age. It is of the greatest importance that we act now so that they will be able to enjoy the hardearned fruits of their labor.",

People on both sides of the issue have come up with numerous reasons for supporting their particular view. And there has been sharp divergence on such matters as if. when and how an amnesty program should be established and who should be eligible for this form of dispensation. But on one point. people at both ends of the spectrum have been in relative agreementthat there are tens of thousands of young men in Canada who would be permanently barred from America if no amnesty were declared. Acceptance of the estimate that 70.000 to 100.000 evaders are now making their homes in our northern neighbors cities and provinces has been universal. The 70.000 figure has gained the most acceptance in 1972. An article in the May 9. 1972. Washington Post sheds some light on these estimates. It shows dramatically the way in which all of us have come to take for granted something which apparently is based on little more than speculation. The estimates were given credence not only because of the number of times they were repeated. but by the sources repeating them as well. Members of the media and politicians more and more came to rely on the 70.000 figure. and it thereby became \"fact.\" Mr. Russell Nye in his article offers a brilliant exposition of how we have trustingly allowed ourselves to begin using these estimates without questioning their source or accuracy. This example gives cause to wonder how many other times this kind of gradual misinformation takes place. Will Rogers. of course. was famous for saying. \"All I know is just what I read in the papers.\" They are. without question. an important source of information. but when they get complacent--and when we do as readersthe likelihood of this sort of situation occurring is increased.",

While there was no agreement with respect to a specific piece of legislation. there was a most definite consensus that something has to be done. These Americanbased corporations develop their technology here in the United States. deducting the cost thereof from their income for tax purposes and then take advantage of tax incentives in our Internal Revenue Code to go elsewhere to produce their goods. The disastrous effect which this sort of thing has had on one industrythe garment industryis amply demonstrated by the accompanying charts. prepared by the research department of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. My bill. H.R. 11783. would put an end to the incentives for multinational corporations to go abroad. It would end their tax deferral and accelerated depreciation advantages and repeal sections 806.30 and 807.00 of the Tariff Codethe provisions which permit American manufacturers to produce their products in Mexico at slave wages and then to import them into the United States for sale with almost no duty.

The award is made as a special tribute to the work of the late Justice Harold Hitz Burton. who served with great distinction as mayor of Cleveland. Senator from Ohio. and Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. Clayton Fritchey made a tremendous impact on the Cleveland scene while he served as a reporter on the Cleveland Press in the middle 1930s when Eliot Ness was appointed safety director by Mayor Haiold Burton to clean up Cleveland. Mr. Fitchey. as an investigative reporter. uncovered considerable evidence involving police graft and labor racketeering which became the basis of prosecution and sending a number of police and union leaders to the penitentiary. His reporting of these events won him a Pulitzer Prize. As a journalist. Mr. Fritchey was managing editor of a number of metropolitan newspapers including the Baltimore Post. Pittsburgh Press. and New Orleans Item. He resigned from the Item to become General George Marshalls assistant during the Korean War. when Marshall returned to the Pentagon as Secretary of Defense. Later Mr. Fritchey went to the White House as an Administrative Assistant to President Truman. He was one of the members of Adlai Stevensons campaign for the presidency in 1952. and was press secretary to Mr. Stevenson in the 1956 campaign. He also served as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and editor of the Democratic Digest. From 1961 to 1965 he was special assistant to Stevenson while he was ambassador of -the U.S. - Mission to the United Nations. Mr. Fritchey resigned from the U.S. Mission to become a syndicated Washington columnist. as well as the Washington correspondent for Harpers magazine.

His life was devoted to the teaching of his boys at Deerfield Academy. where he was headmaster for 66 years before his retirement in 1968 at the ripe young age of 88. He was a teacher in the truest sense. not only as a scholar but as a remarkable developer human character. He taught not only by instruction. but by example. and surely thousands of young men became better citizens for having followed the example he set. Dr. Boyden believed in hard work. Students at Deerfield were encouraged to work on nearby farms and participate in community endeavors. Excuses were not accepted lightly. for Dr. Boyden knew that if a boy started making excuses this could become a trait carrying over throughout his life. He had a deep and abiding belief in the role of the secondary school in developing the qualities of leadership. selfdiscipline. sportsmanship. a love of scholarship. and above all a beginning commitment to good citizenship.",

It does this in terms of our position abroad. and our ability to respond promptly and effectively to any outside military threat. Our oversea bases. our earlywarning and communications installations. our military alliancesthe whole complicated system of defenses aimed at keeping war from our shoresthat system depends in large part on how we live up to our commitments. on our reliability. and our determination to see peace prevail. This bill is a measure of our national will to keep that defense system working in a world which is still very changeableand dangerous. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1972 is also important to our friends and allies. For many of them. it means the difference between insecurity and adequate defense. This applies especially to those countries which are exposed to the threat of external aggressioncountries like Turkey and South Korea. Israel. and Free China. and many others. It applies also to a country like Vietnam whichif our efforts bear fruitwill still continue to need outside help to cope with the tremendous job of rebuilding its wartom economy. In a larger sense. Mr. Chairman. this bill is important to the entire free worldto those who are on the firing line as well as to those in the rear. All of themand all of uswant peace and security.

More recently \"Janes Fighting Ships\" any many other knowledgeable experts have been telling us about the threat of Soviet submarines. So this antiAzores provision of the pending bill would cut off our nose to spite our own face. It would be damaging indeed if we were to destroy the arrangements that we have in the Azores now simply because of a hassle as to whether our accord with Portugal ought to be an executive agreement or a treaty.

It has been frequently stated on this floor that the Banks operations are not a form of foreign aid. they are a form of aid to our exporters. Yet the administrations announcement quoted on page 9 of the committee report makes quite clear that the deal included. in effect. a commitment to the government of Portugal that $400 million would be forthcoming in the form of ExportImport Bank loans. Finally. just a word about section 14 with regard to the problem of Rhodesian chrome. Here the opponents of this provision. which would allow the President a say in the matter. display a complete reversal of their own stance with regard to the proper roles of the executive and the legislative branches. In the case of Portugalthose who oppose these lrovisions of the bill say that Congress should have no role. In the case of Rhodesiathe situation is completely reversed. Our opponents are saying that the President should have no role and that the will of Congress should be supreme. I say that this is a government founded on the principle of partnership among the respective branches. the executive branch and the legislative branch. Accordingly. in both cases. there should be a role for the Congress and for the Presidentboth in the case of the agreement with Portugaland in the case violating our treaty obligation in regard to importing chrome from Rhodesia.",

The press release issued by the State Department makes no reference to a commitment at all. There was positively no commitment. There was an understanding at the time the agreement was reached that the ExportImport Bank would be willing to consider the application by Portugal in the same terms that it considers any application. The negotiations and discussions had reached a stage. at the time this press release was issued. which made it possible for the Department of State to say that the Bank has declared its willingness to provide such credit. I do not see how the gentleman can read any commitment of any kind in view of that. It is not a part of an executive agreement. as the gentleman knows. from discussions we have had in our committee.

To me. the inclusion of these matters makes this just another foreign aid billand I am. therefore. opposing it. as I have consistently opposed all foreign aid bills. The bill. for example. would authorize $100 million for refugee relief in Bangladesh. I do not question that there is a refugee problem in Bangladesh. but I do question that spending U.S. taxpayers dollars to relieve that problem can be called military assistance. In addition. the bill would authorize $2 million for war relief in Cambodia. $5 million for assistance to South Vietnamese children. and $700.000 for plastic surgery in Vietnam. Humanitarian. these expenditures may be. but I do not think they can be called. reasonably. military assistance. I may add that I am not opposed to necessary expenditures of a humanitarian nature. but I am flatly opposed to any attempt to disguise these matters as military aid. I also find puzzling some of the bills provisions regarding items that might be called. properly. military assistance. For example. the bill would provide an identifiable $85.6 milion for Thailand in grant military assistance and security supporting assistancewhatever that isbut directs that none of this be spent until the Thai Government has taken \"adequate steps to curb the narcotics traffic. But apparently it contains no provisions for making a determination that the Thai Government has taken those \"adequate steps.\" except to leave the decision in the hands of a President who is opposed to the restriction in the first place. and who might therefore have a lessthanrealistic definition of the word \"adequate.\" If the bill were limited strictly to grant military assistance and military credit sales. it might be acceptable. In its present form. it is not acceptable to me. because in view of our own acutely distressed fiscal situation. I can see no justification for spending the $2.13 billion this bill would authorize.",

To me. this is a grievous personnel loss because I campaigned shoulder to shoulder along with Elmer Brown. who was the reform candidate for vice president of the United Mine Workers of America in the 1969 election which is still being fought out in the courts. When Jock Yablonski. his wife. and his daughter were brutally murdered in 1969. the coal miners lost another man who had the courage and decency to fight for true representation of the rank and file coal miner. Now Jock Yablonskis trusted running mate. Elmer Brown. is also gone. To the very end. Elmer Brown was fighting for justice for those who go deep into the earth in this most hazardous occupation. On October 18. Elmer Brown was in the gallery with 80 coal miners and widows pleading with Congress to give those coal miners suffering from black lung a fair deal in the benefits due them under the law. We were beaten by only seven votes on October 18. Tomorrow we will have another chance to vote for the black lung benefits bill for which Elmer Brown and thousands of coal miners and widows have fought so hard.

If we rely on the other end of the Capitol to set the image of our legislative branch. we can be certain only of capriciousness. posturing. a high absentee rate. and an insensitivity to the public mood.

Foreign aid is only the latest example. Now that I have attracted your attention. I would like to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think about ways in which we can build up the image of service in the House. For too many of our bright younger Members. this body becomes only an anonymous waystation en route to service elsewhere. We initiate most legislation. our conferees dominate the joint conferences. we stay closer to the people. because of our 2year term. we have shown a greater capacity to structure ourselves for decision and to renew ourselves through organizational reform. we seem better to understand the need for teamwork within the twoparty systemin short. we in the House have reason for relative pride in our accomplishments.

Among these was Mr. Andrew Heiskell. chairman of the board of Time. Inc.. publishers of Time. Life. Fortune. and Sports Illustrated magazines. Mr. Heiskell called the subcommittees attention to the first amendment implications of what he regards as the excessivelyhigh postal rates recently adopted by the U.S. Postal Service. He pointed out thatFor magazines the only feasible means of distribution is the postal system. Magazines depend on government for the provision of their means of distribution as surely and as completely as the broadcast media depend on the government to provide a clear frequency or channel for their use. If the cost of this distribution system becomes prohibitive. their magazines will disappear. Mr. Heiskells testimony raises serious questions about the extent to which postal rate decisionmaking takes into account the important role of magazines and newspapers in a free society. I agree with Mr. Heiskell that: Magazines contributing richness and diversity to the life of the average citizen are essential to the good health of our system. In my opinion. neither the Congress nor the Postal Rate Service has given sufficient consideration to the first amendment implications of postal rate decisions. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this term the U.S. Supreme Court. in a unanimous decision. gave a strong indication that they would find all unreasonable sexbased classifications to be in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. In the case of Reed v. Reed. 40 L.W. 4013 (1971). the Court found unconstitutional an Idaho statute requiring preference of male relatives over female relatives for appointment as administrators of an intestates estate. The Court applied the conventional test of reasonableness and found an \"arbitrary preference established in favor of males.\" I firmly believe that the lack of Supreme Court activity in the area of womens rights can be ascribed primarily to the failure of womens groups to challenge forms of discrimination in the courts. I also believe that most of the goals which the advocates of the equal rights amendment would be accomplished if they would bring a series of selected test cases to challenge discrimination against them. Of course. lawsuits will have to be brought to enforce the proposed equal rights amendment so why do not the women begin in earnest by instituting lawsuits under the 14th amendment now rather than wait to do the same thing under an illadvised constitutional amendment. Prof. Paul Freund of the Harvard Law School agrees with me on the significance of the Supreme Court decision in Reed against Reed. Professor Freund stated: The equal protection guarantee. together with the ample legislative powers of Congress. is the best avenue to achieve meaningful equality of the sexes under law. Professor Freund also supports the substitute constitutional amendment which I have introduced as being preferable to the Housepassed equal rights amendment because he says that the Housepassed amendment \"would force all the manifold legal relationships of men and women. from coverage under selective service to the obligation of family support. into a mold of mechanical unity.\" Mr. President.

Under rule XI. clause 10. of the Rules of the House of Representatives. the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs has jurisdiction over mining interests generally and over mining schools and experimental stations specifically. Title XI of the bill authorizes grants to establish 10 mineral resources conservation institutes. The purpose of these institutes is to train mineral engineers and scientists. and to conduct research and experiments of either a basic or practical nature. These institutes clearly are mining schools and mining experimental stations within the meaning of the rules of the House. Title XI of the bill also authorizes matching grants to these 10 new institutes for the purpose of conducting specific mineral research and demonstration projects of industrywide application. These are activities historically carried on by mining school and experiment stations. These activities also relate to mining interests generally. Both subjects are assigned to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. Title XI of the bill further authorizes grants to any educational institution to undertake mineral research and demonstration projects.

Moreover. the purpose of the research and demonstration projects is to promote the interests of the mining community generally. Finally. a separate bill.

It is my understanding that the Coinmittee on Agriculture actually has before it a bill dealing with applying the status of landgrant colleges to these two particular institutions. the College of the Virgin Islands and the University of Guam. I think that. in our desire to see that these institutions receive early benefits of the nature that is here provided in dollars. we may make a serious mistake in the long run.

It uses the same goaround tactic that the committee bill employedto go around the Agriculture Committee in order to give away $6 million more to these two schools. I object not only to the tactics that have been used. but to the very idea behind this boondoggle. Why should my taxpayers put up another $6 million for these schools when our schools in Pennsylvania and every other State could use the money as well? I realize that only $6 million is involved here. I sat on the floor of this House in 1961. I believe. when we established another new unit in Government. At that time we were assured that the $1 million would never grow. but in some mysterious way some leaven got into the mixture.

Mr. Chairman. this title. on pages 220 and 222 and 223. includes authorizations for the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to recruit men and women of certain talent. and establishes entrance grades for personnel at levels- up to two grades higher than the grade levels provided for under the general schedule. and authorizes the Secretary to appoint personnel of the National Institute of Education without regard to the Civil Service or classification laws. The lanaguage in title XIV also authorized the President to appoint a National Advisory Council on Education. Research and Development. and it authorizes the Council to employ and fix the compensation of such personnel as may be necessary to carry out its functions without regard to the provisions of title 5. United States Code. governing appointments in the competitive service. and without regard to the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5 relating to the classification of positions and the General Schedule rates of pay. Clause 15 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives provides that the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service shall have jurisdiction over all matters relating to the Federal civil service. The civil service laws. the classification laws. and the laws relating to the General Schedule all pertain to title 5. United States Code. and are clearly under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. my point of order against title XIV is based on the fact that it contains matters that are clearly and wholly within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. There can be no claim or pretense on the part of the House Committee on Education and Labor to jurisdiction in these matters. Mr. Chairman. I insist that my point of order be sustained.",

I oppose the point of order made by the gentleman from Iowa on the basis that the scope of his point of order is much too broad. The intent of the rule adopted for consideration of the bill now under consideration Is to provide that any \"titles. parts. or sections\" of the bill would be subject to a point of order where the subject matter jurisdiction was in question. In this case. Mr. Chairman. the personnel exemptions to the civil service laws are the only matters in question with respect to jurisdiction. I contend. therefore. that the question of the point of order should be directed to those provisions with respect to which there is a question of jurisdiction. and not to the entire title. Second. Mr. Chairman. with regard to the jurisdiction question. legislation to establish a National Institute of Education was introduced in the House during the 91st. and again during the 92d Congresses. In each instance the bills were referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. Extensive hearings were held over a period of 2 years. and at no time was the jurisdictional question raised. I suggest. therefore. Mr. Chairman. that this bill is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Labor. and germane to the bill before this Chamber. Third. Mr. Chairman. the specific provisions of concern to which the gentleman from Iowa makes reference have been a part of this legislation since the date of its introduction to the House 2 years ago. The only change made by the Committee on Education and Labor was to limit the number of exemptions from the civil service laws. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I hope that the point of order is overruled.",

We absolutely ought not to be cut off from virtually all our supply of the ore and have that supply limited. This is not a contest between committees. It is not a contest between the State Department and the Department of Defense. It is not in any way involved in some of these matters that have been mentioned. This is just a matter of security and commonsense. We have this stockpile. The committee recommended unanimously against letting it go. We are cut off from the supply in this situation. I think the fiscal affairs of this Nation and the soundness of the dollar are a part of national security land a party of this picture. We were paying per ton delivered here when this matter arose in 1965 $25. Now we have to pay Soviet Russia. since the other supply is cut off. $72 per ton. an increase of 188 percent in that brief span. That is a matter of commonsense. Our committee has pressures brought upon it every day because the price of weaponry is going up and up. It is under attack in the press. I think they have a right to call upon us to hold down prices.

The testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations on this matter. testimony from the Pentagon. the State Department. and this administration. is that the stockpile is preserved and is adequate. The stockpile is not an issue in this matter. The question is whether the United States unilaterally uproots an action by the United Nations that sometime ago imposed sanctions on Rhodesia. Strategically the import of chrome from any source at the present time is minimal. The Soviet Union was the source of supply for many years before there were sanctions. It provided onethird of our chrome. It is not an issue in this particular proposal. In the interest of the other factors. in the bigger picture. we are asking that we suspend section 503. at least for the time being for these reasons. First. we were instrumental in initiating United Nations action to avoid a shooting scrap between Great Britain and Rhodesia. and the United Nations handled the matter and imposed sanctions. Are we to become the only nation to formally repudiate a United Nations sanctioned agreement? I think this would be a case of irresponsibility in regard to the world body. Second. in terms of black Africa. whatever we deem our diplomacy toward black Africa to be. the fact is we have other interests over there. such as oil and bauxite. All of them would be called into question if on this issue we rock the boat. Discussions are now underway. and we are told they are very hopeful discussions. to reach a peaceful settlement between the British and the Rhodesians. Those discussions are going on at this time. We all agree if we could negotiate the matter this would be the ultimate for all sides. If we were to keep section 503 in the present bill we would be setting back the chances for those current discussions to reach any successful conclusion.

I voted today to maintain that section of the military procurement authorization bill which would permit this country to buy chrome from the nonCommunist country of Rhodesia and against the effort that would have removed this section and would have prohibited the United States from dealing with Rhodesia. I did this for several reasons. The first is that chrome was selling before sanctions at $25 per ton. Since the sanctions were imposed. the price of chrome. which we are having to buy from Russia. has gone to $72 per ton. It is clear that the Russians have gained a competitive advantage over our country in that they are the only producers of chrome other than Rhodesia and Turkey. We are now being forced to buy chrome at this highly increased rate. I certainly do not agree with some of the practices of the Rhodesian Government but nor do I agree with the way the Russians are treating many of their people such as the Jews and other ethnic groups inside Russia. So this question does not seem to me to be central to this issue at hand. The national security of this country must come before any other consideration. We must never be dependent on Russia for such a strategic material. Russia. by its own policies. causes this country to react to the extent that we feel we must maintain our present arms commitment and current military posture.

While this kind of proposal is unprecedented and has not been done in other departments. it would not bind the Congress.

Mr. President. that we take all steps necessary to prevent a total collapse of medical care in our farm areas and in the inner cities. Almost 5.000 American communities are without any doctors. About 30 million Americans. in both rural and urban areas. it is estimated. lack adequate health services. Many onedoctor communities are in danger of becoming nodoctor towns because their general practitioner is getting on in years. In rural Appalachia. for instance. 65 percent of the physicians are over 50 years old. Replacements are not filing the vacuum as these doctors retire. This amendment offers not only an opportunity. but an inducement to young men and women who desire to serve in areas where the needs are the greatest. Two senior medical students at Wayne State University. Sol Edelstein and Douglas Jackson. have been working on an imaginative plan to cope with the spread of doctorless areas in Michigan. They have been bringing communities in need of doctors in touch with medicaa students who need financial help to finish school. The community provides financial support for the student to complete his training in return for a commitment from the student to open his practice in the community. The Wayne State plan has attracted nationwide attention. Mr. Edelstein has received many inquiries from communities interested in imitating his plan. The problem of the United Mine Workers of America in Pennsylvania dramatizes the desperate need for doc-",

I would like to have the Senate work its will. I should like to reiterate a couple of points. First. this exemption would be put into effect under regulations to be promulgated by the President of the United States. The President of the United States is Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. as well as the President of the United States. and he can strike a balance between the needs of the military and a recognition of the serious domestic problem we have in some areas. particularly rural areas and ghetto areas. where they do not have doctors and cannot attract doctors. A young man coming out of medical school will have an option. if this amendment should become law. of making a commitment to practice 4 years in a doctorshortage area or going into the service for 2 years. Without question. some of the graduates of medical college will prefer to go into service for 2 years and get the training and additional experience that a young doctor can get in the military service. But the belief is that this amendment would provide some incentive which does not exist today for some of these young medical graduates to locate in the small areas where there Is no doctor or where the only doctor may be up in years. or to practice in the doctorshortage ghetto areas. With a commitment of 4 years practice. it is hoped that doctors. once established in those areas. will continue their practice after that. As we are winding down the war in Vietnam and as the draft requirements recede. it seems to me that this is an amendment that can be accommodated to. particularly as long as the President himself is in control of the regulations under which it would be implemented. Thus. I hope that the Senate will adopt the amendment.",

Dinsmore. former editor of the international edition of the New York Times and author of the authoritative book entitled \"All the News That Fits: A Critical Analysis of the News and Editorial Contents of the New York Times.\" published in 1970 by Arlington House. In an address on December 6. 1971. before the American Speakers Forum of Schenectady. N.Y.. Mr. Dinsmore in a scholarly manner recognizes the prime importance of the New York Times in controlling the flow of news to the people of one country. reveals some of its practices that have had disastrous consequences. and calls for a return to truthful reporting. Mr. Dinsmore is not a novice in the task that he has undertaken. In a notable address before the Cosmos Club of Washington. D.C. last year. he spoke on the subject. \"Distorted News Loses Lives and Thwarts the Search for Peace.\" which I of June 4. 1971. His most recent address on December 6 at Schenectady is a splendid sequel to the earlier one. Mr. President. as this address should be of interest to all Members of Congress who read the New York Times and officials in the executive branch who use it in connection with the formulation of national policies.

I think it is constructive to examine continuously the validity of premises from which we proceed in the implementation of a wide variety of social programs. Such a reexamination would seem to be particularly appropriate at this time when we are contemplating launching out into innovative and costly programs of medical care. Dr. Robert C. Patton. a distinguished physician from Mobile. Ala.. has provided me with an article entitled \"Medical Care As A Right: A Refutation.\" written by Dr. Robert M. Sade. and published in the December 2. 1971. issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

Some of the Senators who were not present on the previous occasions have requested an opportunity to also pay tribute to their former colleague this morning.

He spent nearly all his adult life in public serviceas an FBI agent. the Connecticut Director of the National Youth Administration. assistant chief of the civil rights section of the Department of Justice. and as the chief trial counsel at the Nuremberg trials. In 1955 Tom was elected to the first of two terms he spent in the House of Representatives and in 1959 was elected to the Senate. During the 16 years he spent in the Congress. Tom labored hard and long for the issues he believed inissues often considered too controversial by others. I believe that when the history of this era is written. Tom Dodd will be rememberedand honoredfor his courageous efforts to reform our inadequate guncontrol laws. As a former lawenforcement officer. he knew firsthand the need to -regulate firearms in this Nation. Although his efforts were opposed by one of the most virulent lobbying campaigns ever witnessed. he succeeded in seeing the first comprehensive guncontrol law passed in 1968.

I remember well many of Senator Dodds speeches and statements on foreign policy issues.

The death of Senator Dodd leaves me personally saddened. His love of the Senate was obvious and his contributions to it were many.

So outstanding was his public service that there was much speculation in 1964 that he would be asked by President Johnson to be his running mate in the 1964 presidential election. His ability was outstanding and his appearance was striking. With the dignity of his bearing and the gray of his hair and his booming. resonant voice he made an impressive figure on the Senate floor.

His crusades first focused nationwide attention on such issues as juvenile delinquency. civil rights. crime. and drug abuse. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. his vast knowledge helped formulate omnibus legislation to stem delinquency and drug abuse. An internationalist. proud of Americas constructive postwar foreign aid works. Tom Dodd was also keenly aware of the historical value and modern necessity to maintain Americas balance of strength in arms and in diplomacy. He worked for the nuclear test ban treaty because he though that treaty to be in the Nations and the worlds best interest. but he also worked to guard against erosion of our military strength. His fame. justly earned as a Nuremberg prosecutor. was a further highlight of Tom Dodds distinguished and dedicated public service. As chief trial counsel at Nuremberg in 194546. Tom Dodd said that he was privy to \"an autopsy of historys most horrible catalog of human crime.\" He was one of the few to witness firsthand the totalitarian terrors of both the Nazis and the Communists. and the memory of this momentous event in history imprinted upon him the necessity to fight totalitarianism in all its forms.

Yesterday I made a statement on the floor to present the fact that when the General Accounting Office requested information from the Treasury Departmentthe Secretary of the Treasury being Chairman of the Loan Guarantee Boardthe Comptroller General of the United States and his people were in effect. told to go sell their papers. They were just not interested in giving the information to the General Accounting Office. This is getting to be a truly extraordinary situation. As I mentioned yesterday. the General Accounting Office is often called the watchdog of the Treasury. Apparently they want this watchdog to be not only toothless but blindfolded. They want to proceed with the details of this loan any way they decide. without any review. and regardless of the fact the money was both authorized and appropriated by the Congress. I can only again say to the Senator from Wisconsin. who already has done much to protect the taxpayers of this country in this field. that what is going on does not surprise me. This administration wants to operate on its own. without being bothered by the Congress. This is another illustration of what was developed yesterday with respect to the General Accounting Office and the Treasury Department.

In ratifying the Genocide Convention. we will let the world know that the United States does not condone mass atrocities. and we will endorse the principal that such conduct is criminal under international law. There has been a great deal of controversy among lawyers in the United States as to the Genocide Convention. but much of It has been due. I believe. to a misunderstanding as to what is meant by genocide and an unfamiliarity with the international law of crimes. The principal objection which has been raised by opponents of the convention is that it is contrary to our federal system of government because it takes away an important part of criminal jurisdiction from our State governments. In iesponse to this objection. it is essential to understand what is meant by \"genocide.\" The history of the drafting of this convention in the United Nations shows that the United Nations delegates meant by the term \"genocide\" the killing or mutilation of people. or other overt acts specified in the convention. committed as part of a plan to destroy a group. a group in its entirety within a state. and committed on a scale affecting a substanial number of people. Thus. it should be quite clear that the crime of genocide is quite distinct from the crime of homocide. There must not only be killing. as in the case of homocide. but there must also be the element of an intent to destroy an entire national. racial. religious. or ethnic group as that group exists within the territorial limits of a particular state. In addition. the action must affect a substantial number of persons. Our membership in the small community of nations that have failed to ratify this human rights convention is becoming an increasing diplomatic embarrassment. Our friends cannot understand it. Our adversaries exploit it. It is a costly anachronism which should be eliminated without delay. I once again urge this body to ratify the Convention on the Punishment and Prevention of Genocide.",

While I think there are aspects of his bill that I probably would not favor immediately. there are other features that might well improve. on the administration bill. or at least ought to be considered... I refer specifically to the concern indicated about strikes which creates a regionalemergency situation rather than a national emergency. For a long time there has been an unfortunate void in this particular area. Without the TaftHartley Act. as the Senator from New York knows. a State would be in a position to deal with a strike that presented an emergency in the State. But because of preemption by the TaftHartley Act. the power of a State to act in such situations has been taken away. Yet the President can act. under the TaftHartley 1704 Co Act. only where there is a national emergency. . So if there is not a national emergency. it does not matter how serious the situation might. be. for example. in the city of New York ror in the city of Detroit. Nobody can do anything about it at the present time and this is certainly a very . unfortunate situation. Somepersons have suggested that the State have a residual power there. That would be one approach. The other approach is the one suggested by the Sena\"tor from New Yorkthat the President be given authority to act in a situatibn where the emergency is real but cannot be described as a national emergency.

December 5. there was a meeting of the Urban Affairs Council at which the whole question was raised of how better use could be made of some of the resources of the Federal Government in the field of social and economic development and redevelopment. It was pretty obvious that one of the things which loomed large in the Federal budget and In terms of employment and so forth was the construction and the location and leasing of Federal facilities. And at that time. the Administrator described a little bit to us about the kind of resources that would be available over the next five years. We find that something in excess of 100 projects. which have already been authorized in one way or another. will have potential for developing or redeveloping urban areas. These projects will employ as many as 140.000 employees between now and 1975. So It is fairly clear that we had substantial dollar impact and employment impact here. And the question was whether or not the existing authority under which the Administrator made his decisions was adequate to do the job. The decision was that it was not. I call your attention. as he will In more detail. to Section 2(a) (2) on the bottom of page 1 of the Executive Order. This is really the key paragraph for you to pay attention to. Here we say that consideration is going to be given to the impact the selection of the site is going to have on improving social and economic conditions in the area and providing a potential use for the stimulation of new community development as well. I would like to turn the meeting over. first to Dr. Moynihan. who might.explain to some extent how this would fit into a national growth policy. and then to the Administrator. who could describe in more detail how the operation will take place.",

The White House has followed the. progress of this legislation carefully. The issues presented by the bill do not require 13 days of study. In my floor remarks when the conference report on S. 2770 was considered. I urged that the President give the bill prompt attention and forgo the temptation of a pocket veto. One week ago I wrote to the President and further outlined for him the consequences of a pocket veto for the water pollution program and the personnel on the Federal and State levels. In that letter. I pointed out that: The only possible result of a pocket veto will be the termination of the program and the loss of thousands of jobs. Since then. Administrator William Ruckelshaus of the Environmental Protection Agency has written a strong. 33page letter to the OMB making many of the same points made in my letter and urging that the bill be signed.

Senator ANDERSON has. He began his public service in his own State during the depression and continued it again during the war when he served the country so effectively in its time of need for the soundest of wisdom in providing food for the civilian population as well as its more than 10millionman army. In the years between. I remember meeting him as president of Rotary International which is a recognition that his leadership in the field of private business paralleled his public service. When he came to the Senate he brought with him this wealth of experience and wisdom and for the past 20 years it has been my great privilege to serve with him on the Committee on Finance. and and for the past 16 years to serve with him. and occasionally under his direction. as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

Mr. Speaker. the committee held hearings on this bill on July 26. and ordered it reported to the House unanimously by voice vote. It is a simple housekeeping bill designed to make the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act simpler. and is endorsed by the Railroad Retirement Board. the Office of Management and Budget. the Association of American Railroads. and all the railway brotherhoods. In other words. this is a bill on which all parties are in agreement. and should pass the House unanimously. Simply stated. the bill would make simpler the administration of the overall minimum guarantee provision in the Railroad Retirement Act. That act contains a provision which guarantees each person in receipt of railroad retirement benefits that he or she will receive not less than 110 percent of the benefits that would be payable under the Social Security Act if the employee whose service is the basis for payment of benefits had been employed under the Social Security Act rather than the Railroad Retirement Act. This means for the Railroad Retirement Board that in computing benefits. they must employ both social security criteria as well as Railroad Retirement Act criteria in determining eligibility for benefits. Frequently. the computations which the Railroad Retirement Board is required to engage in. and the determinations they are required to make. lead to no change in benefit levels. so that a great deal of the work required of the Board is of no significance in determining benefits. For example. the board is required to send out as many as 300.000 questionnaires. to deal with about one case out of every 150. the majority of which lead to no change in benefit levels even after the Board has received the answers to the questionnaire. This bill would simplify administration of the act by permitting the Board to eliminate technical compliance with all provisions of the Social Security Act. and should lead to streamlining the efficiency of the boards operations. The bill was unanimously reported by the committee and. as I said. is supported by everyone interested in the subject. and I urge its passage.",

Usually these family members would never have rights to railroad retirement. The amendment provides that only family members who could qualify for railroad retirement need to be checked out and counted. Second. When changes are made in social security. the Board must check out every family to see if he might qualify for social security in order to figure the annuity. This is eliminated. Third. Allow taking into account only benefits that family members can actually get rather than possible benefits which might accrue if applied for. Fourth.

H.R. 12383 with amendments was reported unanimously in my Subcommittee on Postal Facilities and Mail and in the full Post Office and Civil Service Committee by Members of both parties. Extensive hearings on this bill demonstrated that the bill is necessary because it will clarify the law. in that it will positively provide an exemption in title 39 of the United States Code for the mailing of samples of narcotics for testing by Government agencies. The purpose of such testing in many voluntary local government programs is to ascertain whether or not a substance is a dangerous drug and what its type is. while providing anonymity to the sender. This is done by identifying a specific sample by number. An anonymous telephone inquiry is sufficient to obtain the results. While this program has been of great aid to parents and others. it cannot develop fully until a means is found for the mailing of such samples. since the personal delivery of such samples breaks down the anonymity of persons participating. It is true that prosecution under Federal legislation has to be based on the intent to commit a felony. and that prosecutions for the mailing of samples would probably never be brought. It is also true that this interpretation is based on an inference. Therefore. it is important to state positively in the law that the mailing of samples of suspected narcotics to Government agencies for testing is within the law and not a violation of the postal statutes. We seek to make the unclear. clear. We believe that this legislation should be enacted because voluntary testing programs depend on public trust. This bill will aid that trust and protect the anonymity of those participating. On behalf of the membership of my subcommittee.

The gentleman from Florida was there when that amendment was adopted. The gentleman from Florida knows that the bill which came out of the subcommittee authorized natives who had villages located within wildlife refuges to make initial land selections within those wildlife refuges. It did not authorize anybody else except those with villages within wildlife refuges to do that. The gentleman from Florida also knows that the amendment which the gentleman from Oklahoma offered as a substitute for the amendment which the gentleman from Pennsylvania had offered provided that when a native group did exercise that right under the bill. the land would be replaced in the total wildlife refuge estate within Alaska by other public lands within that State.

Very frankly. I think the gentleman from Arizona and the chairman of the full committee put their finger right on the pulse and reason for this settlement. The reason the Office of Management and Budget has approved this legislation and the figures that we now have in this bill is because the Federal Government is going to get rid of a tremendous burden which we have. That burden is every year maintaining the facilities of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Alaska. The amount of Federal money now being spent each year in Alaska on the BIA program is approximately $40 million. You heard the chairman of the full committee say that $700 million is now being spent by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. and we spend about 10 percent of it in Alaska. And. very shortly it might get up to $1 billion. So the $100 million which we might spend in Alaska every year on Bureau of Indian Affairs programs for the benefit of the Natives they just will not get. Let me remind you who are wondering whether or not this is a movement of generosity on behalf of the American people. to look at what the Congress did to two tribes of Indians under a policy of termination. We took the two finest tribes in America. as far as their economic development is concerned and as far as their financial resources were concerned. namely. the Menominee. and the Klamath. and we terminated our trustee relationship with regard to their status.

Even though he is a fair and impartial man in his judgment. he has never lost his dedication and his devotion to the Army as an institution. He represented it in the finest of its traditions as well as a soldier out in the field in action. and the years away from the Army have not dimmed one bit his ardor. devotion. and dedication. He is severe on himself. in disciplining his mind. so that his judgments are fair and impartial. Second. as the Senator from Montana has said. it comes at a time when the Army has been undergoing unusual difficulties. strained with a load to carry. in many. many ways. Mr. BeLieu has that basic understanding. He knows a soldier from the day a man first enters the Army and from there on. He knows the realities of life. I have never found a more practical man. who is better seasoned in judgment and in the realities and problems of life. In saying this. I feel as though I know him. because for more than 6 years he and I worked very closely together on the Senate Armed Services Committee. where he was a very highly valuable staff member. in connection with many bills. including military construction bills. SoI know the man and I know the problem. and we are very fortunate to have him. If I may be indulged to this extent.

We have to decide if we want to phase it out in one fell swoop or by degrees. Frankly. I am skeptical about turning all these programs over to multilateral agencies. There is a provision in this legislation that the President may turn these programs over. Assuming the President runs for reelection and is defeated. he could put his successor in a terrible predicament by turning these programs over before his successor takes office. What seems to be charity on our part has turned out in many cases to be a very profitable investment. Perhaps the best example would be the Public Law 480 program. The restrictions on interest on that program have been done away with today to sweeten up the bill. but when we began Public Law 480 it cost as much as $2 billion a year to get rid of our surplus crops and food.products. That is now reduced to $1 billion a year. in rough figures. But while we have been handing out or selling on very easy terms these surplus farm commodities. our export sales for these farm commodities for cash has risen about 300 percent and are now about $8 billion a year. That is largely due to the fact that we began by selling on easy terms at low interest rates. I think what has been done in the Public Law 480 program should also apply to sales of farm machinery. fertilizer sales. and other sales we have made which go to raise the living standards of the people of these other countries.

Before the bill was defeated 10 days ago. it came out of the committee with the following figures: $320 million for economic development. $208 million for technical assistance. $309 million for Alliance for Progress. and $52 million for administration. or a total of $889 million. Then the ChurchAllott amendment was agreed to. and that cut $160 million from the bill. leaving a total of $729 million. Then. at that point. the Senator from California and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Taft) proposed the amendment which was accepted on the floor. That amendment did two things: It added $125 million to the overall authorization of the bill. and it earmarked $125 million for population programs. So the total of the bill. as it was finally defeated. was $844 million. including the $125 million added on the floor of the Senate in the overall authorization. and the earmarking of the money for population programs. The bill now before us. as it comes from the committee. has $250 million for economic development. $175 million for technical assistance. $225 million for Alliance for Progress. and $45 million for administration. for a total of $695 million.

I strongly urge the passage of H.R. 4724. which would authorize a total of $507.650.000 in appropriations for certain maritime programs of the Department of Commerce for the fiscal year 1972. I would like to limit my comments to those two activities of the Marine Administration that requires about half of the total amount. The first pertains to what is generally referred to as the vessel construction activities of that agency. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 provides for the new maritime program that envisions the construction of 30 ships a year for 10 years. The year 1972 will be the second year of expanded ship construction under the new maritime program. and contract awards for 22 ships are anticipated in that year. The level of 30 vessels per year will be reached by fiscal year 1973. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 was enacted to revitalize the U.S.-fiag merchant marine. New vessels are desperately needed to achieve this purpose. The requested authorization of $229.687.000 for vessel construction will permit the Maritime Administration to carry out the new maritime program in this regard. The second activitiy of the Maritime Administration that I would like to comment on is the vessel operation subsidy activities of that agency. Appropriation authorization in the amount of $239.145.000 has been requested for this activity. This sum will provide for the continual payment of operating subsidies to U.S.flag operators in order to enable them to compete with their lower cost foreignflag counterparts. In recent years certain operators have found that they can operate profitably in some trade routes without subsidy. and have voluntarily gone off subsidy. This. however. is the exception. and if we are to have a viable U.S.-fiag merchant marine operating subsidy continues to be required in order to compete in a world market. I strongly urge the House to support this Maritime Administration authorization bill.",

I would like to comment in support of H.R. 4724. the maritime authorization bill. It is a positive piece of legislation in all respects and one of its more important features is the construction differential subsidy funding which will be for the second year of expanded ship construction under the new maritime programMerchant Marine Act of 1970which has as its goal the construction of 300 new ships over the next 10 years. There is another element in this bill. however. which I think deserves attention. It is the authorization of appropriations of $25 million for research and development. This is the second consecutive year that this important \"research and development funding has been at such a high level. Obviously. it is necessary to authorize sufficient funds for viable ship construction and operating programs but these expenditures tend to be wasted if this vessel construction and operation is not buttressed by a sound and forward looking research and development program and with a goal of advanced technology and increased productivity. Unfortunately. in the past. merchant marine development has been inhibited by a lack of funds and interest in a viable progressive research and development program. Since R. & D. funding will be at a high level for the second consecutive year. it would seem that this weakness in our overall maritime posture is being corrected and that we will have adequate funding and sound programing for a healthy R. & D. program which is a bulwark of the U.S. merchant marine.

Today. the privately owned American merchant marine consists of approximately 725 ships and about threefourths of these vessels have a speed of less than 20 knots. It is an unfortunate fact that we have stood by and watched the United States drop from first position as a merchant marine power at the end of World War II to sixth place. and we rank around 15th as a merchant shipbuilding nation. It is a rather sad commentary that while the world merchant fleet has increased enormously in the last 15 years. the U.S.-flag fleet has been dwindling to a dangerous point. It will not be overly helpful to dwell in the past except inasmuch as it points out our past failures. However. we should be interested in the future. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 passed by the last Congress gives hope for the rejuvenation of the U.S.-flag merchant fleet which is necessary for our national wellbeing. For we cannot ignore the fact that the maritime industry is vital to our national economy in terms of high employment and a healthy balance of payments. It is also of great importance to our national defense and the success of our foreign policy. Indeed. we must note in this latter connection that there are few ports today that are not visited by the new and efficient ships of the Russian merchant marine. Last year with the landmark Merchant Marine Act of 1970 we got started on the right foot toward the rebuilding of this national asset. This bill. H.R. 4724. which provides $229.687.000 for construction differential subsidy. is a necessary step in the right direction. If we are able to continue this vital shipbuilding program which seems to be off to a proper start and if we can insure that there will be sufficient cargo for these new. efficient U.S.-flag vessels. we may. in the future. find ourselves in our former position of preeminence in the merchant fleets of the world.

Few men are much better equipped to understand the ocean and to utilize it than those men who graduate from our maritime academies. There are hundreds of millions of dollars that we have invested and many billions of dollars yet to be applied to study and development in. on. and under the oceans and our coastal zones.

How can they better study such a broad spectrum of related subjects. as they must. if they are only going to have 77 men in an entire class? They must have the plant. the equipment and a sufficiently large student body to have the diversity of subjects that will enable them to play a proper role.

As a Representative of one of the greatest maritime States in our Nation. I support this maritime authorization legislation for fiscal year 1972 as reported out of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee under the very able leadership of the distinguished gentleman from Maryland . In the last Congress. we committed this country to dramatically expand our merchant marine fleet. Without question. this expansion is required to meet a great national need. It will require the development and construction of many modern. uptodate vessels and many additional collegetrained maritime officers to man them. Of particular concern to me is the item in this legislation providing assistance for students at our State maritime academies. Because of the nature of their studies. academy students have no opportunity to supplement their funds through parttime summer work. Nor do they have the usual opportunities for parttime. after school work during the academic term. For this reason. we need to continue the Federal commitment for student support. If we fail to do this. then the burden of increased educational costs will fall increasingly on the shoulders of students pursuing their specialized maritime education. This would be unfortunate. Since 1958. Federal support for State merchant marine academies has remained virtually stable. while State investment has increased threefold. The Federal Government should do its full share in supporting the students and the activities of the State merchant marine academies. The Texas Maritime Academy. located in Galveston and operated by Texas A. & M. University. is today graduating many qualified men to meet the increasing challenges of an updated and modern merchant marine.

We are all aware that our merchant marine is in a depleted state and that sealift under the U.S. flag is at a low ebb.

Hardin published in the Federal Registerpage 19505some important proposed modifications in the regulations governing farm subsidy payment limitations for the 1972 crop year. While it is too early to tell just how effective they will be. even a preliminary examination reveals that they represent a marked improvement over the existing regulations. I commend the Secretary for taking these important. if long overdue. steps. Included in the corrective action taken are steps to assure that partnership agreements are truly genuine business transactions. and stricter controls on socalled custom farming which has been an especially popular method of evasion. On several occasions in recent months I protested to the Secretary that his 1971 regulations were largely ineffective. and I was shocked at the news reports of legal evasions of the intent of Congress. The knowledge of their inadequacy and the resulting fact that litle savings were projected from the present $55.000 ceiling was a major reason for the success of my amendment to reduce the individual producer ceiling to $20.000 per crop which passed the House on June 23. 1971. While the Senate regrettably failed to go along with the House amendment. I think all of us who supported this reform can take some credit for these improvements. In my earlier correspondence with Secretary Hardin I was keenly disappointed that his Department refused to make an extensive study of these evasion methods in order to inform itself and the Congress. Failing to get a satisfactory response from Secretary Hardin. I asked the General Accounting Office to undertake a comprehensive study. The GAO is now making such a study. and expects to complete an initial draft of its report by the end of the year. No doubt these changes in the regulations are in part a response to the GAO study. As the current studies are continued. additional amendments to the existing regulations no doubt will be found desirable. I am glad to note that Secretary Hardin has promised that \"further amendments to the regulations may be proposed in the light of those studies.\" A copy of the proposed amended regulations follow: [Department of Agriculture.

The emergencies of the last few months and the testimony of Commissioner Edwards. have raised serious doubts in my mind as to whether the Food and Drug Administration has either the manpower or the resources to assure sufficient protection of the consumer in the food area. Events of the last few months are most disturbing. In Apl l when Commissioner Edwards made his request for appropriations. I specifically asked him whether the FDA needed increased funding over and above the amount requested in the Presidents budget. Commissioner Edwards responded that. \"I think that what we are requesting in fiscal year 1972 is about what we are capable of really responsibly putting into operation.\" Subsequent events have led me to believe that the Commissioner was under severe and unreasonable restraint from the President and the Office of Management and the Budget. Almost immediately after our hearings serious problems began to throw doubt upon the Presidents budget request as testified to by the Commissioner. Mercury residues were found in tuna and swordfish. causing FDA to charge the fish industry with \"grossly inadequate processing to assure safety from food poisoning and disease.\" Commissioner Edwards in response to this emergency called for increased funding and manpower to regulate the fish industry. stressing that \"FDA is probably the most underfinanced and understaffed agency in the Federal Government given its responsibilities.\" Shortly thereafter botulism was found in Bon Vivant soup. Commissioner Edwards. thereupon testified before the Public Health and Environment Subcommittee of the Interstate Commerce Committee. where he then maintained that for FDA to adequately carry out its responsibilities in the food area. it would need somewhere in the range of \"five to six times\" what it presently has been allocated. Under further questioning Commissioner Edwards estimated that the amount of money required to pay for increased personnel would be approximately \"$75 to $85 million.\" If this was not bad enough. Commissioner Edwards pointed out that FDA in meeting these special difficulties was forced to drastically curtail egular food inspections.

Noting that FDA carries out only 51.000 inspections a year of imported foods. he stressed that the \"minimum figure\" he felt would be adequate in this area would be \"75.000 to 100.000 inspections a year.\" Unfortunately at this critical juncture further serious problems began to accumulate. Two types of Campbells soups were found to be contaminated. This necessitated a recall of over 53.280 cans of soupan undertaking further taxing FDAs overworked manpower. Events compounded events. FDA found the hazard caused by the contamination. of food from a highly toxic industrial chemicalpolychlorinated biphenyls. PCBseven more vexing. PCBs were found to have contaminated 50.000 turkeys in Minnesota and to be contaminating a number of goods packaged in recycled paper. In fact. as Congressman RYAN has pointed out. over the course of the summer. PCB contamination has been found in \"chickens. turkeys. swine. shell eggs. catfish feed. broken egg products. and frozen and poultry products.\" Particularly distressing was the admission by FDA that \"overall guidelines\" promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget had placed the Agency in an extremely tight budgetary posture in light of the critical nature of FDAs functions. Clearly the record of these last 6 months shows that an extremely serious situation exists in the regulation of the food industry. Such a potential gap in regulation and inspection cannot be allowed to remain. Only a shortsighted sense of priorities would allow us to wait for any more emergencies before we take action. Commissioner Edwards has now finally and -forthrightly agreed that FDA is seriously underfinanced and undermanned. It would be derelict in the extreme if the administration does not back him up by coming forward with a request for increased funding of FDA. If such a concrete request is brought forward by the President. Congress can act to protect the consuming public. Failure of the President to act. in my opinion. would not only be shortsighted. but it would be in complete disregard of the dangers pointed out by the press and highlevel agency personnel.",

Unless we give them that assurance. we can easily anticipate the crushing increases visited on the real estate and sales tax-. payers which are causing a breakdown in citizen support of even the most basic local services.

But at the same time I had hoped that before we got into these we might finally consider revenue sharing. because it seems to me there should be some continuity between the hearings and the decisionmaking process. As the gentleman in the well has said. we have completed the public hearings. and the executive session consideration of the general revenuesharing measure. and all that needs to be done now is to make the decision which I am sure the .35850 gentleman will agree would take practically very little time in relationship to the rest of the legislative year. and the time assigned for public hearings on the public health bill.

Therefore. yesterday. October 11. was the official observance of Christopher Columbus Day in 1971. Today. October 12. marks the 479th anniversary of that day in 1492 when Christopher Columbus discovered the New World. It took us many. many years to obtain legislation designating Columbus Day as a legal national holiday. The importance is in the national recognition finally given to this anniversary and the movable date is of secondary concern. Indeed. our country has done all too little in recognition of Christopher Columbus. There was an exposition in 1892. a commemorative coin. and. of course. there are statues and monuments erected. streets. circles. and so forth. named in his honor. The vision of Columbus in the face of ridicule in his time is an example of Independence and perseverance that should never be forgotten. I am grateful that at long last Columbus Day is a legal national holidayallowing the peoples of all our 50 States to honor the man who set foot on the shores of America 479 years ago and set the stage for the development of the United States of America. the worlds greatest power today.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Columbus Day is traditionally marked by parades. pageants. and celebrations. Oftentimes. the true significance of Columbus Day is obscured by the activities and the festivities which surround it. Every schoolchild is aware that Columbus discovered America. what the names of his three ships were. and the perils and hardships which the crew faced during that famous transatlantic crossing. Of far greater significance is the fact that Columbus started in motion a chain of events which has culminated in the 20th century in the development of the United States as the greatest Nation in the world. Historians have told us that Columbus discovery of America was quite accidental. that Columbus actually intended to reach the Far East and thus chart a route which would lead to the riches of that part of the world. Instead. he stumbled upon a wilderness possessing not the riches of the East. but far greater riches in terms of natural and geographic potential. Columbus brought with him to America the spirit and enlightenment of a European age of rediscovery and scientific exploration. His voyage across the Atlantic in illequipped and tiny vessels serves as the prototype of the American spirit of energy and purpose. Thousands of Americans were to follow -in his footsteps in the fields of science. government. business. and labor. in overcoming great odds to achieve a seemingly impossible goal. Each has contributed his share in making Americas greatness possible. However. on Columbus Day. 1971. I think It is proper to remember and ponder the original spirit and determination of that great Italian born explorer and scientist in order that America face the coming decades with the same resolve and resource with which we have faced the last 500 years of our growth as a nation. Amid the pageantry of Columbus Day let us not forget that the mission which Columbus began in 1492 is still to be completed in many ways. And with that view toward the future. I believe that we can more fully appreciate and understand the significance of Columbus Day in 20th century America.",

I am pleased to speak in support of the human experimentation amendment which it is my privilege to cosponsor with my distinguished colleague from the State of Massachusetts. Senator KENNEDYS amendment to the military procurement authorization bill is another clear indication of his concern with matters involving the health of our population. The declaration of policy which is contained in the proposed amendment is much broader in its meaning than is involved in the operations of the Department of Defense. However. it should serve as a basis for providing the impetus to all Federal agencies which are engaged in research involving the citizenry of our country to insure that their physical and mental health is adequately protected. There have been instances reported in the press involving the Department of Defense and the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare where some doubts were raised concerning the procedures employed in the conduct of research on human beings. It is important that when the Department of Defense undertakes to contract for such research with individuals. corporations. institutions. or other organizations outside the Federal Government. any risks to the physical or mental health of the subject be made known to that subject before research is conducted. In that case. the person involved will have an opportunity to have considered all aspects of the research before he agrees to participate. The additional provision which would establish a formalized procedure involving the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. who will review such proposed research before the Department of Defense may proceed. represents another positive means for insuring the intent of this amendment is being properly implemented. I am informed that the Department of Defense has reviewed the language of the proposed amendment and has no objection.

I think we all realize that Californias economic health is vital to the Nations. That is one of the reasons why I worked so hard for the space shuttle program. and it helps explain my dismay that the democratic national committee would criticize the award of that program to North American Rockwell Corp. of California. Our space program has provided the greatest incentive to scientific and technological discovery in this Nations history. and already practical. everyday application is being made of dozens of advances made in metallurgy. communications. medicine. meteorology. and other scientific fields. I believe Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Jean M. Westwood was wrong when she called the contract \"an outrageous misuse of this Nations tax revenues.\" Our continued involvement in the Vietnam war surely Is such a tragic misuse. but our space program is an essential extension of our Nations relentless quest to improve the basic tools of science. Clearly. I favor reconstruction of our national priorities to eliminate poverty. build schools. reduce pollution. fight crime. and rebuild our cities. At the same time. I do not believe we have to sacrifice prudent efforts in space. The space shuttle clearly is not a partisan program. but rather a bispartisan effort of a number of Senators and Representatives. Frankly. I am proud that North American Rockwell won the contract. It will mean more than 60.000 jobs for California and upward of $4 billion to her economy. And. of course. it will mean that the Nation will continue to improve her scientific and technological skills. Mrs. Westwood concludes her statement with an attack on the Presidents reelection committee for not revealing contributors to its reputed $10 million kitty. In this.

That is only true insofar as they really say that they prefer the administration proposal. and I would imagine that it is not un usual for them to prefer their own bill to different approach. however. similar it might be to their own.

The ceiling set by the committee is restrictive enough in reference to Cambodia. Fortunately the Cambodian people have responded to this invasion and are eager to defend themselves. Why then should we refuse to provide them with sufficient aid to do so? Mr. President. the funds in this bill provide essential items such as ammunition. clothing and personal gear. oil and fuel. communications equipment. and about $15 million for aircraft. There are no frills allowed under these expenditures. all are essential to help this small nation defend itself. Mr. President. a word should also be said about U.S. involvement in Cambodia. We have no troops there. The total number of official Americans are 143 and they are stationed at the American Embassy at Phnom Penh. Thus. one can see this program is merely to aid our allies and these funds will not involve the United States in an escalation in Cambodia such as witnessed in Vietnam. Mr. President.

Mr. President. just to review what has happened a bit. what we have ended up doing is appropriating nearly $400 million more for military and related assistance than we did for economic and humanitarian aid. showing once again where the emphasis of our policies. as determined by this body. lies. I very much regret that. I had hoped that after the defeat of the bill before. the Senate would take a different approach. and that we could give emphasis to nonmilitary aid programs. I am prompted to read one paragraph that I think sums up the action taken today by this body. It is a quote from the great playwright George Bernard Shaw: In the arts of peace Man is a bungler. I have seen his cotton factories and the like. with machinery that a greedy dog could have invented if it had wanted money instead of food. I know his clumsy typewriters and bungling locomotives and tedious bicycles: they are toys compared to the Maxim gun. the submarine torpedo boat. There is nothing in Mans industrial machinery but his greed and sloth. his heart is in his weapons. This marvellous force of Life of which you boast is a force of Death: Man measures his strength by his destructiveness. I think our actions today have demonstrated that. I think it is a great tragedy that this country. after all it has wrecked in Southeast Asia and in the world by emphasis upon its capacity for destructiveness. shows no disposition to mend its ways and begin to devote its resources and its energies to the reconstruction. not only of foreign countries. but of our own land as well.",

One of the bad features is section 9. which represents the socalled Mansfield amendment. We have been over this ground repeatedly before. A majority of the Senate has voted for it while a majority of the House has rejected it. The result has been a compromise worked out by the conference committee between the two houses. I anticipate this will be the case again. The fatal defect of this section of the bill is that it proposes to fix a date certain for withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Indochina contingent upon the release of all American prisoners without insuring that. at least. our prisoners will be returned on a phased basis as our troops are phased out. The date certain is. for all practical purposes. 6 months after date of enactment of the bill. Section 9 properly calls upon the President to negotiate an agreement under which there would be a series of phased releases of American prisoners concurrently with a phased and rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops. But the fixed date is not dependent upon such an agreement. Are we supposed to withdraw our troops at a rate which would have them all out within 6 months even though at the end of 2 months. or 3 months. or 4 months. or 5 months there have been no releases of prisoners? I have pointed out many times before that the only sure way of approaching this problem is to make clear that any fixed date is contingent upon more than just a hope that our prisoners will be returned. U.S. troops in South Vietnam. especially those providing airpower. is the principal bone in the throat of North Vietnam. and the sooner the leaders of that country understand that the only way to get rid of that bone is to undertake an exchange of prisoners of war. the sooner our prisoners will be returned home. Section 9 of the bill. without amendment. will only prolong the agony of the prisoner of war problem. and all of the good faith in the world behind that section will not change the situation.",

There have been abuses in human rights and of human liberties.

The United States. of course. has aplicyand rightly soof not intervening in the internal affairs of another state. Yet many of us here in this Nation and in the U.S. Senate are seriously concerned about the internal problems of Ulster. There we have a nation with 500.000 Catholics and approximately 1.000.000 Protestants. The elected government. since 1970. has consisted of all Protestants. because of the resignation from the government of the few Catholics who earlier had been able to take part. There have been violations of civil rights and of human rights. with the majority denying to the minority certain basic rights. There has been rampant dis. crimination in housing. in employment. and in political life. As a result of this. there have been serious uprisings. In order to protect the minority from the majority. and specifically at one time from what was alleged to be police brutality on the part of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. British troops were sent in. at the request both of the government and of the Catholic minority. as a neutral peacekeeping force.

This legislation provides that the Secretary of Interior may acquire the home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow at 105 Brattle Street in Cambridge for establishment as the Longfellow National Historic Site. The Longfellow home is not only an outstanding example of colonial architecture. but it served as George Washingtons headquarters in 1775 and 1776 and was the home of the poet. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. from 1837 to 1882. It is only fitting that this home be preserved in public ownership for the benefit and inspiration of all the citizens of the United States. We are indeed fortuante that through the centuries the Longfellow home has been maintained with great care and despite some alterations the structure remains intact architecturally and is in a state of good repair. Those members of the community who realized long ago that they were in possession of a great national historic resource determined to keep the home in excellent condition for generations to come. And for this we can only feel a very deep gratitude. In July 1775. the Longfellow home became George Washingtons headquarters for 10 months during the seige of Boston. Longfellows association with the house began in 1837 when he rented a room there. In 1843 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his bride were given the home as a wedding present and enjoyed life there until 1882.

    "speech": "Mr. President. some people oppose American ratification of the Genocide Convention because they believe that the Conventions definition of the. word \"genocide\" dangerously distorts the true meaning of the term. They maintain that article II of the treaty would require each signatory to prosecute any. person demonstrating the intent to destroy or harm a single member of a specified ethnic. racial. or religious group. This mandate they consider too broad. However. this concern is unwarranted. First. article II of the treaty rather explicitly states that only the intent to destroy the \"whole\" or part of such groups would require Government action. In 1950 Deputy Under Secretary of State Dean Rusk drew the distinction between crimes of genocide and homicide by noting that the former designated the intent for largescale violence against members of a specific group while actions against one or two members of a racial or ethnic group would fall in the latter category. Furthermore. ratification of the Genocide Convention would not increase the number of prosecutions for violence against individuals because the U.S. legal system already considers. such violent actions to be criminal offenses. Violence and persecution in any form has long been abhorrent to those upholding the principles of freedom and democracy for all men. Ratification of this document would merely reaffirm our commitment to those principles. After more than 20 years of debate such a reaffirmation is more Important that ever. \ufffd Finally. the Convention allows for each nation in agreement to devise Implementing legislation consistent with the constitutions of those nations. This provision would allow the United States to make a stand of moral opposition to genocide while maintaining criminal statutes against homicide and discrimination. Mr. President. I ask the Senate to ratify the Genocide Convention as quickly as possible. and make clear Americas position against mass violence.",

I think we should go back to the colloquy between the Senator from Kentucky and myself on this particular subject. What is involved here is similar to the reservoir situation in Korea. Where it is not possible at the end of the 30day period to totally disengage the troopsand when the Congress has not acted affirmativelythen the President merely certifies the necessity to continue to the Congress. Again. however. I emphasize that the President would be expected to act in good faith. I do not know that the words in the amendment are so ambiguous. We certainly know what \"unavoidable\" means. I suppose the Senator from Arizona would be more of an authority on military necessity than I am. but the fact is that if the President finds that Congress has not acted affirmatively. that there is no specific authorization for him to continue. and that the 30 days have ended. the position of the proponents of the legislation is that the Constitution would not allow us to cut off his duties as Commander in Chief. so long as he was acting to protect U.S. troops or pursuant to situations which could be construed as coming under section 3 of the bill. In the debate that we have had. the proponents of this legislation have maintained from the beginning that we do not seek to cut off any constitutional powers of the President as Commander in Chief. Through the use of this certification. if pursuant to sections 3(1) and 3(2). and in acting to forestall an imminent attack or to repel an attack. there is a military situation where more time is necessary to bring about prompt disengagement. we merely affirm. through this provision. that he has that constitutional authority. He merely needs to certify to Congress that the situation is such as described in the amendment. I cannot define \"unavoidable military necessity\" any better than can the Senator from Arizona. The sponsors of this legislation do not want to see the lives of Americans. soldiers. and sailors. who have been used pursuant to section 3(1) or 3(2) imperiled because 30 days have passed.

But the point is. I can see eliminating the language \"unavoidable military necessity\" because. as the Senator has suggested. it is a rather difficult point to define. and merely substitute. in the next few words. \"the safety of the United States or of the Armed Forces of the United States engaged pursuant\" et cetera. et cetera.

If Congress chooses not to act. they are saying by inactionor they might even do it by affirmative actionthat they do not approve of what the President did. We have to go back in history a little. but the Senator will recall that in this debate we had the example of the President going into Mexico. and then there occurred the debate in which I think former President John Quincy Adams engaged. and later President Lincoln. and they both stated as Members of Congress that what had been done should not have been done. This bill would also allow the Congress to act during the 30day period.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on line 2. page 6. we entitle the bill the \"National Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.\" The intent of this amendment. of course. is to call it the \"Magnuson Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.\" All of our colleagues have been personally indebted to the contributions made by many Senators. including the Senator from Delaware. in the coastal zone management bill some 3 years ago. on which we had hearings. The Senator from Alaska has given outstanding leadership to this particular measure. The senior Senator from New Hampshire has been very helpful. But in going over the record of the past 12 years. the reason this bill. as controversial as it is in nature. has gone through the floor so smoothly this morning has been due to the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Washington . Some 12 years ago he started in this particular field. It was under his leadership. in the mid1960s. that he introduced legislation instituting the Commission on Marine Sciences. Engineering. and Resources. resulting in the Stratton Commission report. It was under his leadership that the temporary Oceanographic Subcommittee was established and the Oceans and Atmosphere Subcommittee was instituted as a standing subcommittee under his Committee on Commerce. and through the past 21/2 years now. we have had hearings and different discussions with respect to moving forward in this particular field. It was the Senator from Washington who gave us the leadership. spreading oil on troubled waters. and we finally got a bill. I wish to mention his role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health Appropriations. which encompassed hearing some 427 witnesses. I do not see how an individual chairman can listen that long and not abolish the whole Department. but he has given leadership there. He had an executive session this morning. He had other witnesses scheduled. Rather than try to be here. after he had worked out this language. he went forward with those witnesses. I think this body would like to recognize his leadership in this field. and I hope my colleagues will join in supporting the amendment.",

Out of a field of 20 nominees. this top State honor went to Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Freeman and their two daughters and two sons. I report briefly on the Freeman familys achievement because it portrays the effectiveness of the Farmers Home Administration program which many of us have supported for years. In 1958. though the Freemans had very limited resources. they negotiated their first Farmers Home Administration loan. Wise use of their credit and diligent work by the family enabled the Freemans to operate a 500acre farm. 124 acres owned and the rest rented. Their major crop has been peanuts. raised by irrigation. and their efforts have raised their yield considerably above 100 bushels per acre. They have also raised beef cattle. Mr. and Mrs. Freeman have been active community leaders. as have their children. both at home and at college. The honor that has come to th. m is clearly earned. Their friends and neighbors will honor them at a dinner in Floresville. Tex.. on April 28. The main speaker is to be James V. Smith. our former colleague who is now national FHA Administrator. I hope to attend that event. but I want my fellow Members to share with me gratitude for the Freeman family for their splendid achievements.

Total gross national product--GNP---soared more than $30 billion. at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. This advance of almost 12 percent far exceeds the 7 6percent increase during the previous quarter. While the real growth of the economy at 5.3 percent was somewhat below that in the fourth quarter of 1971. it is still a healthy increase and well above the trend rate of growth over the last 5 years. All sectors participated in the advance. Business expenditures on durable equipment rose 7 percent and purchases by all levels of government rose almost as much. The consumer sector showed unusual strength as residential construction spending soared 10 percent. Consumer spending on durable goods also rose substantially. As further evidence of strengthening consumer demand. the savings rate dropped to 7.4 percent. Developments on the price front are admittedly difficult to appraise. but I note with considerable hope that the March seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index did not rise at all for the first time in over 5 years. Key food prices leveled off or declined. These are preliminary figures and are subject to revisions. However. this initial data is quite encouragingthat we are in the midst of a strong and sustainable expansion with increasing stability of price levels.",

I presently and for many years have represented the district which encompasses the busiest airport in the world. OHare International. It has operations every 37 seconds. I think I would be remiss if I did not at this time make as a matter of record my comment with regard to the pending amendment of my good friend from Illinois. This problem of establishing curfews and going to the FAA seeking regulations which provide for relief from the noise problem in the area is nothing new. I served on the Aviation Subcommittee 15 years ago when we were dealing with this very problem. But I think we ought to get one thing straight: We have a curfew at Washington National Airport because Washington National Airport and Dulles are in a totally unique position. They are not municipally operated but instead under control of the Federal Government. OHare International Airport is operated by the Chicago Municipal Airport Authority. There would be not one plane going in or out of OHare field after 11 oclock at night if the local airport authoiity did not approve it. So it is well and good to suggest bringing the complaints to Washington and have the FAA do the job when in reality the responsibility presently exists with the local airport authority. So let us not beat around the bush here. If we want this job done. I suggest that if you have an interest in providing this relief. you should go to the Chicago Airport Authority. which is an arm of the city administration of Chicago. get relief at the source. They have the power to stop any flights after 11 oclock if. in fact. we want a curfew. I think that ought to be made eminently clear. and I hope we have done so today.",

I have had to wrestle with the problem of air jet noise as it affects the average citizen perhaps more over the years than any other Member of this body. I realize. however. that many of my colleagues with districts adjacent to busy commercial airports can appreciate the deep concern and the aggravation of their residents in this regard. I am not seeking to make any major changes. and in fact I laud the committee for what I think is a sound and sensible approach to this problem. but I do think that my amendment would accomplish one thing: I think that. if nothing else. the residents in an area adjacent to an airport should be apprised of any construction that is likely to increase the impact of noise upon their everyday lives. What my amendment does is to say that where any commercial airport installation engages in an expansion. an extension of runways. or anything that would basically change the impact of the noise on the people in the area. they should at least be entitled to advance notice that this construction is going to be taking place. through a public hearing where they would at least have their day in court. This becomes essential because we have on two different occasions experienced situations in my area where construction was commenced with no knowledge on the part of the local officials. no knowledge on the part of the people living in the area. They subsequently engaged in litigation seeking to get an injunction. but they failed. So this merely says that where an airport installation does expand. where they make changes. then have them give advance notice. 30 days before they commence work. and to notify the local officials so the people can at least come in. find out what is going to happen to them. and have their say in public hearings. That is all it does. I hope that this body would see my amendment as a sensible amendment. and one that they could support. Thank you.",

There was so much opposition at that time to an airport being constructed at a certain place that the FAA gave it up and said that they would not construct it there and that they would have to select a better place. Well. when they came up with another place. another hearing was held in the courthouse and everybody had their say. There were a few who were opposed to it there. but the majority were for it.

They are designed solely to give the industry the time to retire all aircraft with excessively noisy engines. In the meantime. the people who live in the vicinity of airports and under flight path approaches to airports will continue to suffer near unbearable levels of noise. Congress passed the Noise Abatement Control Act in 1968 authorizing the FAA to set noise limits and require the installation of jet noise suppressors on existing aircraft. In November of 1970almost 2 years after receiving the authoritythe FAA issued an announcement of proposed rulemaking to require installation of noise suppression devices on existing jets. At the time. I lauded this action as a definite step forward in reducing noise pollution in metropolitan areas such as New York. Had the FAA continued on its plan of action at that time. a rule could have been formulated by now and citizens could have looked forward to less noise in a few years. But no. the FAA buckled down under the pressure of the airlines industry and in the spring of this year announced an 18month delay in the rulemaking procedure. I can only presume that this Agency intends to wait until such a rule is no longer needed. The present bill would only grant authority once again to reduce jet noiseauthority already granted in the 1968 bill. What we must set up is a deadline for the installation of jet noise suppressors. This is clearly necessary after almost 4 years of delay and procrastination by the FAA. My amendment would establish a 3year deadline from the date of enactment. Earlier this year Congress authorized $2.5 billion in loans to bail out corporations supposedly operating in the national interest. All it did was bail out the directors of these corporations and preserve annual dividends for the wealthy stockholders.

When we consider also the middleaged population. those between the ages of 45 and 64. which rose from 4.6 million. or 11.6 percent. to 41.8 million. or 20.6 percent. we can see that nearly a hundred years of growth have produced a total population five times as large. a middleaged population nine times as large. and an older population an unprecedented 17 times as large. Mr. Speaker. we cannot afford either to neglect the problems of this growing proportion of our population or to fail to utilize their skills and abilities. We must also recognize and respond to the fact that 4.7 million Americans over 65 live in households below the poverty line. The income and service needs of this group must be met. In addition. we must recognize that many individuals reaching this age are healthier and can expect to live longer than in the past and want to make their own contributions to society.",

It was my honor to serve as National Commander of the American Legion. and in that capacity I had the opportunity to observe our Legionnaires in action. playing a vital role in building and protecting this. this great Nation. Listen. if you will. to the words of some of the great men of our time who were not privileged to membership in the American Legion. John Edgar Hoover said. and this is a great tribute to the men of World War I: Had it not been for The American Legion. subversive forces within would have destroyed our country while the flower of her youth was fighting for her preservation on foreign battlefields. The late Bernard Baruch. a great statesman who was not given to wild and rash statements. said: Within the American Legion thrives the greatest corps of Americanism alive anywhere in the world today. The American Legion may take pride in the splendid chain of Veterans Administration hospitals that ring our land. and for which the organization is primarily responsible. The Legions youth programs. designed to instill in our leaders of tomorrow a sense of appreciation of the rich heritage they enjoy under a representative form of government. Is also a matter of great pride. The AmerIcan Legion has unremittedly supported that immortal document known as our Constitution. the greatest experiment ever devised by man for the governing of itself. along with the Bill of Rights which builds fences around individual liberties which governments may wish to take away. The American Legion has consistently remained public enemy No. 1 on the list of the Kremlin because of its relentless fight against international atheistic communism. I am proud that the Legion is now sponsoring a religious emphasis program designed to bring all our people close to the Creator who has blessed us all so bountifully. The accomplishments of the American Legion are recorded history. and a proud history it Is. In my judgment. the Legion will face up to the challenge of today with the same zeal and vigor that have marked its accomplishments for the past 53 years.",

Endicott Peabody. The resolution calls for establishing a special commission on the method of selection of the Democratic nominee for Vice President. The commission will hold hearings and make studies and submit Its report by January 1. 1974. That report. with any revisions made by the DNC. will become part of the temporary procedural rules of the 1976 Democratic National Convention. It is particularly appropriate that the DNC action resulted from a recommendation by Governor Peabody. who truly made a pioneering effort this year. As you know. he was himself a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Vice Presidentthe first ever to actively campaign for the officeand he conducted a vigorous 7month campaign in 37 States. He entered the only vicepresidential primary available to himNew Hampshires. in Marchand he got 85 percent of the vote. In his campaign. Governor Peabody set forth these principles on the VicePresidency: That the Vice President belongs to the people and should be elected in a free and open convention. That selection o. the vicepresidential nominee by the party leader demeans the office and the man. That. considering that the Vice President historically has one chance in three of becoming President. he should have a \"mandate from the people\". and That vicepresidential aspirants should campaign for the office. and the convention delegates \"should have a choice. not an edict.\" Mr. Speaker. there is no one else in our Nation as well qualified in this area as Chub Peabody.

But this will not be simple. especially since any solution will impinge upon many of the important policy issues facing our Nation. including national security. environmental protection. and economic growth.

We must also develop more efficient means for transmitting energy to locations where it is needed.

Shapp and as a result of the visit to the Commonwealth by President Nixon and General Lincoln. of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. it would appear on the basis of incomplete information that damage to highways and bridges alone is in the neighborhood of $550 million. that the latest count is that 126 bridges are out in Pennsylvania. that as of noon yesterday. damage to schools is in the area of $40 million to $50 million. with no reports yet in from colleges and universities. that whole cities are inundated and have suffered extraordinarily heavy damage. that the downtown district of WilkesBarre. Pa.. is entirely under water. that the principal industry of Bloomsburg. the Bigelow Carpet Co. is half under water. that the Bethlehem Steel plant is totally under water. that 150 to 200 major factories have been disabled in the State. and that more than 50 sewage systems are out. It is estimated that somewhere between 40.500 to 50.000 houses have been damaged in Pennsylvania. The Office of Emergency Preparedness has assured the Commonwealth that It will furnish all assistance within Its power. subject to its authorizations and the funds available. That may not and probably will not be nearly enough. The water is stagnant there. Unlike damage in other areas. the water remains. It has not flowed off. It has not acted as a flash flood would in most cases. When water stays 5 or 6 days in a community. it means the virtual destruction of that part of the community so inundated. Mr. President. it may well be necessary for us to ask for an emergency authorization and appropriation providing for a substantial sum to aid the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to recover from this terrible disaster. I have discussed with the Governor the advisability of meeting with the Pennsylvania congressional delegation. probably tomorrow. and if it is necessary to ask for emergency funds. we will appeal to our colleagues in both bodies for sympathetic understanding. and expeditious action on this request.",

President Nixon has made it clear that he does not wish to enact a welfare reform bill. I am deeply disappointed that President Nixon does not wish to work with those of us in Congress seeking meaningful welfare reform. In the past the President has asked to be judged by his deeds. not his words. He has failed his own testdelivering words on welfare reform but little else. As a result of his lack of commitment to secure passage of reform legislation. the prospects for reforming our Nations welfare mess are growing dimmer. For some time it has been evident that the only possibility for enactment of worthwhile legislation lies in accommodation between those of us supporting improvements to H.R. 1 and the President. I fail to understand how the President can say that moving in the direction of compromise is wrong on the merits. The fact is that in the past he has supported virtually every element of the proposed compromise bill. In 1969 and 1970. President Nixons welfare reform guaranteed benefits no lower than under the present system. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to optional work registration for mothers with preschool children. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to require State supplementation of families headed by unemployed males. Now he rejects that principle. He agreed to Job suitability provisions. eligibility based on current need. simplified. efficient administrative requirements. Now he rejects these principles. In short. by rejecting an accommodation with those of us seeking meaningful reform. he is turning his back on all the principles he has supported In the past. He is left with H.R. 1a regressive. inhumane. and unacceptable welfare bill. It should be obvious to him by now that there are no -supporters for H.R. 1 as it passed the House. Not one Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee supported it. Instead. they supported a subpoverty makework program. which is completely incompatible with the concepts of the family assistance plan. A large group of Republicans and Democrats remain committed to passage of worthwhile welfare legislation. Without the Presidents support. however. welfare reform is dead.

I find myself called upon as chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights. as a Member of the House of Representatives. and as a concerned citizen to speak out against the actions of the House Internal Security Committee. specifically H.R. 16742. Over the years. I have repeatedly questioned the existence of HISC as a functionary of the legislative branch of a democratic government. I have also repeatedly opposed every attempt by the committee and the House to broaden its scope. I have found it necesary. too many times. to object to actions of the committee which threaten the first amendment and constitutional rights of Americans. Characteristically. H.R. 16742. \"Restrictions on Travel to Hostile Areas.\" is representative of the unacceptable manner in which HISC operates. In drafting this bill. HISC has gone beyond its scope. Jurisdictionally. according to the rules and traditions of the House. it has usurped the area of passport legislation which falls under the Judiciary Committees jurisdiction. It has violated its own jurisdictional area of control which encompasses only matters of internal security. not those involving travel to foreign countries. In further violation of House procedures. this bi2l was heardwithout critical witnessesmarkedup. discussed. and voted on in less than 2 hoursrecord time considering the significance of the problems involved and the questionable tone of the proceedings. Additionally. H.R. 16742 is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has stated in a number of cases that the right to travel is one of which a citizen of the United States cannot be deprived without due process of law. This very argument is the basis for the outraged opposition of most Americans to restrictions on emigration of Soviet Jews from Russia. Typical of actions initiated by the committee. this bill allows HISC to crack down on those they do not like. the antiwar movement and its leaders. while at the same time endangering the rights of every American. H.R. 16742 would provide the President with a tool for control of citizen actions which is more usually associated with repressive governments. Clearly. the intention and the actions of HISC with respect to this bill are \"unAmerican.\" I urge my colleagues to protest this violation of civil liberties and to vote against H.R. 16742.",

The purpose of the legislation. we are told. is simply to provide penal sanctions. which presently do not exist. in support of existing restraints on travel to countries engaged in hostilities with the United States. I agree with the necessity of providing penalties for people who violate existing law with respect to these travel restraints. I vigorously defend the right of our citizenry to travel but clearly this individual freedom is not absolute. During periods of hostility. the unfettered right of U.S. citizens and nationals to visit countries with whom the United States is engaged in armed conflict most certainly raises the most serious possible questions of national security. My reason for voting against this bill today is simply that I consider the subject matter far too important to be considered under a House rule which limits debate to 40 minutes and prevents so much as a single amendment from being offered. The questions of both substantive and procedural due process are real ones and so is the issue relative to the appropriateness of the penalties involved for violation of travel constraints.

I rise in support of the committee amendment to provide $7 million in additional funds for the operation of the 57 Veterans Administration regional offices. The Baltimore VA regional office. which has about 140.000 active files. needs 11 more positions than it has been authorized for fiscal 1972 in order to meet anticipated workload increases. Present levels of service are not goodveterans have. an average wait of almost an hour to speak with a contact representative. GI home loan applications are delayed 4 to 6 weeksbecause there are not enough personnel to handle workload& The longterm absence of just one file clerk. such as on extended sick leave. places a heavy burden on the other employees. I have also been advised by the office of the Director that peak seasonssuch as the fall enrollment period for education benefitsare contributing heavily to the overall backload. because funds available for overtime have been slashed. In 1972. the Baltimore office will be authorized $13.215 for overtime1971s authorization was $36.000. and that did not do the Job. The Baltimore office foresees increases of 8 to 25 percent in various categories of assistance for fiscal 1972s workload. From the complaints I have received about slow service. delayed payments. and nonpayments (which always seemed to result from cursory. rushed review of the claims). I can see a very grim picture during the next 12 months for the veterans in Baltimoreand from the reports of other regional offices. for the entire United States. Our veterans deserve better service. We must provide the means to deliver to them the benefits we have promised. For many. veterans benefits are the only source of income. From my experience with the regional office which serves my constituents. Mr. Chairman. I think that this additional $7 million is necessary.",

A time when more and more servicemen are being discharged and therefore becoming eligible for veterans benefits is no time to cut back on the services provided in administering veterans programs. The caseload of all VA offices will undoubtedly increase substantially in the coming months as thousands of veterans readjust to civilian life. They will be seeking Jobs. education. housing and medical care. A lengthy delay in processing the paperwork could severely compromise the value of the programs we in the Congress have created for their benefit. In my own area. in southwest Texas. the VA office in Houston already requires five employees to be assigned fulltime to answering telephone inquiries. the director of that office is seriously concerned with the mounting backlogs and delays in handling veterans problems. The VA Hospital in Houston has done a tremendous Job of caring for veterans in that area. but is always crowded and the staff overworked. I dont think reducing administrative funds is going to help the situation. Adoption of this amendment to restore $7 million of the reduction will enable the VA to carry out its program functions with more expedience and more effectively.",

The committee. under Mr. BOLANDs perceptive leadership. has approved the full $279.45 million estimated in the budget for this item. but that amount had been reduced by $15 million prior to its submission to the Congress. The amendment seeking to restore nearly half that amount. is absolutely essential if the VA is to keep pace with the increasing number of veterans and their increased needs. There are now approximately 28 million living Americans who have served in the Armed Forces and their ranks are expected to grow by slightly more than I million this year. Significantly. 1.5 million of the total are veterans of World War I whose average age is 76. And the largest blocsome 15 millionare World War II veterans with an average of 52. And then there is the increasing number of Vietnam veterans. All of these have special problems. requiring specific handling. And the touchpoint for most of them with the Government they have served is one of the 57 regional VA offices throughout the country to which they turn for assistance and guidance. The demands on these offices has risen 25 percent in the last 2 years. whereas their personnel has increased only 312 percent. A continuation or enlargement of the imbalance can only result in a breakdown in service to veterans. And that is selfdefeating as far as the national interest is concerned. Therefore. Mr. Chairman.

Each shuttle will be operable for 100 missions. so it is a tremendous advance in space operations. It can be used both for civilian purposes and for military purposes. We are moving into a new field. The Air Force is talking about manned orbiting interceptors as a substitute for groundbased Interceptor jets. because it can give us quicker defense and quicker reconnaissance. So we are really talking about one of the most strategic things that this country can do here. in discussing the shuttle program.

    "speech": "I yield myself 5 minutes. It would be my hope that the distinguished author of this amendment might accept my amendment. I will explain what it does. The amendment of the Senator as now written provides that the Secretary shall submit to Congress no later than October 1. 1973. his recommendations regarding appropriations to be authorized for the continuation and expansion of the program under this section. Mr. President. keep in mind that this is a pilot program. The committee has held no hearings on it and the amendment as written would require the Secretary to make recommendations for the authorization of appropriations for the continuation and expansion of the program. That is the pilot program. Now. what my amendment would add to that would provide this: The Secretary and the Comptroller General shall submit preliminary evaluation reports to the Congress not later than October 1. 1973. and not later than March 50. 1974. submit reports containing an evaluation of the program provided under this section and making recomnnendations with regard to its continuation. Again. Mr. President. I point out that here we are not asked to authorize. at a cost of $40 million. a pilot project. and direct that at the end of that time the Secretary shall recommend authorization of legislation for its continuance. but my amendment says that the Secretary and the Comptroller General shall submit a preliminary evaluation report by October 1 next year and by not later than March 30. 1974. submit reports containing an evaluation of the program and making recommendations with regard to its continuance. I believe the amendment that I have offered speaks for itself. I think it represents a sounder legislative process. It will give Congress information and an evaluation that should be of material help if Congress decides to continue this program. and I believe that if the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota is advanced and accepted by the Senate. this amendment ought to be in it.",

A recent conference on the supplemental food program. held in Detroit. came out in support of the very thing I am talking about here. The Supplemental Food Conference. in which the Department of Agriculture participated. asked for this improved type of nutritional aid.

This program is the result of a request by a conference on this subject in which the Department of Agriculture participated.

As I understand the bill as it is written. the local school authorities may. if they choose. add certain items to those already prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture to be served in school cafeterias or on school premises. Let me give Senators an example. if I may. In suburban Maryland we have two very large school districts in Prince Georges County and Montgomery County. Those two school superintendents. as well as those in the three larger school districts in my State. have come to my office and asked if we could do something about the authority that the Secretary of Agriculture exercises over their school lunch programs. It has been pointed out to me that in the largest county in our State in the year 196970 the school system lost $239.000 from the school lunch program mainly because the students were not buying the food prescribed. They were leaving the school or were not buying at all because they did not like the menu being offered. The next year the school authorities allowed the students to have an a la carte menu in addition to the lunch prescribed. so a student had a choice of two menus. He could buy the lunch prescribed by the Department of Agriculture or could go through the a la carte line and buy a hamburger or hotdog and a Pepsicola or whatever else he had in mind.

It would offer Federal cost sharing with individual land users to install conservation measures over a period of time in accordance with technically sound conservation plans. The proposed South Atlantic Basin environmental conservation program is modeled in principle after the Great Plains conservation program authorized Congress in the 1950s. which has proven to be a successful approach to improving the quality of the environment in that region of our Nation. In the Great Plains conservation program the land owner or operator: First. Develops a conservation plan suited to his land and to the kind of operation he desires. Second. Works out a schedule for applying the plan. Third. Enters into a contract with the Secretary of Agriculture to apply all needed conservation work on the entire unit within 3 to 10 years. Fourth. Gets help from the specialists of the Soil Conservation Service as he needs it. Fifth. Receives the Federal share of the cost as he completes each conservation step. An intensive program of soil erosion prevention. conservation. and landuse adjustment is urgently needed in the South Atlantic Basin because the soils in this high rainfall region are highly susceptible to erosion.

I am introducing a bill to amend the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 so as to provide that elections for membership on boards of community action agencies do not take place on a Sabbath day. In New York City recently a great dispute arose because poverty elections were to be held on Saturday which is the Sabbath Day for Jews. and those Christians belonging to the Seventhday Adventists Church. The third largest ethnic group to be counted among New York Citys poor are the Jews. And yet. theelections for representation on the local CAP boards. responsible for the expenditure of antipoverty funds in their neighborhoods. were scheduled on Saturday. thus effectively barring many from participating in the election. Fortunately the New York State Legislature and the New York City Council intervened and required by legislation that such poverty board elections not be held on a Sabbath Day. I do not believe that the Federal Government through inaction should allow similar situations to arise depriving segments of the poor from participating in such community elections. Today. this can happen if a city or State is not as disposed to intervene to protect all sections of the poor as was the city and State of New York. Therefore I have introduced the bill which simply provides that no election or other democratic selection procedure shall be held on a Sabbath day which is observed as a day of rest and worship by members of the poor in the area served. In the case of a dispute as to whether or not a particular day is a sabbath day for some of such members. the Director is authorized to make a final determination with respect to such day. Surely it is in the interest of the country and the poor that the large number of qualified voters participate in these elections. Unfortunately for whatever reason participation in these elections is very low. in New York City only 3 to 5 percent of the community members eligible to vote exercise their right. It would be unconscionable to make it impossible for orthodox observers of any religion to participate in such elections by holding them on their Sabbath.",

Mr. Speaker. when David Brinkley says. as he said on NBC radio on Tuesday night. that if the North Vietnamese \"refuse to take this offer. they must be half crazy\" one does tend to sit up and take notice.

Virginia scored 1.485 out of a possible 1.600 in the ratings. according to information provided by DOT and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Commonwealth achieved a perfect score in six of the 16 national highway safety program standards. These include periodic motor vehicle inspection. motor vehicle registration. motor cycle safety. driver education. driver licensing. codes and laws. traffic courts. alcohol in relation to highway safety. identification and surveillance of accident locations. traffic records. emergency medical services. highway design. construction and maintenance. traffic lighting and control devices. pedestrian safety. police traffic services. and debris hazard control and cleanup. This is the second consecutive year that Virginias highway safety program has achieved this distinction. and I wish to commend the division of highway safety in the Governors office. and the Virginia Department of Highways for their efforts and initiatives. Mr. President. an April 26 news release of the Department of Transportation explains the program in considerable detail. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.",

As we know. foreignproduced items ordered during the import surcharge period last August 16 through December 19 did not qualify for the tax credit unless the President waived this limitation. Mr. Nixon has decided that it is in the interest of our countrys farmersand in the general public interestto grant the credit on dutyfree farm equipment. Because of the Presidents action. Americas farmers will now be given the tax credit on many foreignproduced items which they normally buy and which they usually order at the time of year when the import surcharge was in effect.

Under our capitalist system. the consumer votes with his dollars for the kinds of products he wishes to purchase. The jury of American business is not a court of law or a legislative chamber but the millions of free citizens who judge its products and services as they choose between them. Unfortunately. many businessmen have failed to respond to those who urge increasing governmental intervention into the economy. Writing in the May 1972 issue of the New Guard. Robert Bearce points out thatThere is no reason for industry to apologize for profit. No reason to grovel before humanitarian zealots because. it has not created utopia by 1972 nor rid man of his basic human nature. The guilt complex of the entrepreneur today is the seed of surrender by default. To the extent that industry and business allow socialistic slander and falsehood to go without hardhitting rebuttal. to that extent it will be easier to clamp bureaucratic stagnation upon the free market. In this sense. the real threat to the rights of the consumer is not the businessman but the socalled consumer \"advocate\" who would stifle economic freedom in order to \"protect\" those whose freedom is eliminated.

These are for areas of urban and industrial development. or other areas where there are water quality problems. Obviously this part of West Virginia has such a water quality problem. Thus. the State in implementing an areawide water quality management plan must consider this problem. Also let me point out to my good friend. the gentleman from West Virginia . that under that requirement for areawide waste water management plans there must be a process to identify. if appropriate. minerelated sources of pollution. including new. current. and abandoned surface and underground mine runoff.

In 1968. for example. the profit and loss picture for major world railways excluding subsidiaries. was as follows: Millions United States (All class I) ----------$565 Canadian Pacific Railway ------------21 Netherlands Railways ----------------(41) Canadian National Railways --------- (116) British Railways ------------------- (354) Japanese National Railways --------- (376) Italian State Railways --------------(578) German Federal Railway (704) French National Railways ----------(901) During that same year. freight revenue per ton mile was as follows: Cents Canadian Pacific Railway -----------1.28 United States (All class I) -----------1.31 Canadian National Railways ---------1.32 Japanese National Railways ---------1.66 Netherlands Railways ---------------2.07 Italian State Railways 2.40 French National Railway -------------2.83 German Federal Railway ------------2.88 British Railways -------------------3.34 In my judgment. nationalization would be a colossal mistake. I believe that it is far preferable for us to implement policies which would permit the railway industry to regain its competitive posture and regenerate itself. Since March of last year I have repeatedly pointed out the extent to which unproductive branch lines sap the vitality of our railway systems. Others have pointed out the extent to which other discriminatory policies adversely affect our railway systems The American taxpayer does not need to be saddled with the burden of operating or subsidizing our railways. if we can only provide the type of economic climate in which an intelligent railway management can operate. The General Electric Corp. has recently issued a statement with respect to Americas railways entitled \"The Spirit of 1776.\" I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this past month. the United States suffered its second highest trade deficit in history. Imports exceeded exports by more than $597 million dollars in Februaryan increase of $278 million over the January deficit. Despite the rhetoric of rosy promises. the administrations approach of currency devaluation. negotiations and more studies is not going to bring us out of the trade crisis. save American industry nor find jobs for the hundreds of thousands of Americans that have been thrown out of work because of imports. Despite the evident exporting of hundreds of thousands of American jobs. there have recently been a host of studies that purport to show that transnational companies have created domestic jobs. Most of these have come from private associations of transnational firms. It is no surprise that these studies and surveys have been selfserving. Relevant questions are not asked. the firms covered by a survey remain anonymous so that an independent check is precluded and the figures are usually not corrected for acquisitions. What is shocking is that the U.S. Department of Commerce has become involved in similar manipulations of data. Mr. President. Mr. George Meany. president of the AFLCIO. recently wrote to Commerce Secretary Peterson pointing out distortions in the Commerce Department study of transnational firms. Although a Government department is supposed to be on the side of the public and a servant of the truth. the study questioned by Mr. Meany involved ignoring damaging data to make transnational firms look good. As Mr. Meany put it. Commerce simply \"omits half of the iceberg.\" Because Mr. Meanys letter so clearly points up a distortion in this area of growing public debate.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on April 26. the Senate Committee on Post Office and Civil Service will begin hearings on several long overdue proposals to reform the Hatch Actthe statute which has restricted the political activities of Government employees for the past 30 years. The purpose of these reform measures is twofold: To permit Government workers greater participation in our democratic processes. while at the same time protecting the same employees from pressure to make financial or any other politically related contributions. in order to maintain their status in the Government service. For a long time. now. I have been concerned primarily with the first of these goalsthe liberalization of the Hatch Act to permit Government employees their fullest rights of citizenship. including the right to participate actively in political organizations and campaigning. Reform would be incomplete. however. if it failed to take account of the second goal. Existing law has proved itself inadequate in protecting Federal employees from pressure to make financial contributions to the political activities of the incumbent administration. Early this year. six ranking executives in the GSAs Federal Supply Service were charged with Hatch Act violations. They were accused. specifically. of pressuring their subordinates to buy $7.000 in tickets to a nationwide \"Salute to the President\" dinner staged on November 9. A number of serious unanswered questions surrounding this case demand investigation by Congress. First of all. why did the Civil Service Commission. which is responsible for enforcement of the Hatch Act. fail to take any action whatsoever in this GSA matter until November 24. and then only after the story had already appeared in the newspaper? Second. why has the Justice Department failed to take criminal action against those indicted by the Civil Service Commission even though the actions with which they are charged also constitute infractions against Federal statutes prohibiting the solicitation for political purposes on Federal property? A more interesting question revolves around the quota system itself. Why has the Justice Department failed to investigate the Governmentwide implications of the Federal agency being pressured into buying a certain number of tickets to the Presidential dinner? These are among subjects related to the GSA case which should be taken up in the Hatch Act reform hearings.",

Although I have often disagreed with their interpretation of the facts. until now I have not had occasion to question the accuracy of those facts. I must now. The API has printed who knows how many thousands of booklets containing Dr. Richard Gonzales testimony before the Subcommittee on Priorities and Economy in Government of the Joint Economic Committee and distributed them as an accurate assessment of the facts relating to the oil industry and the oil import quota program. The API has done this knowing full well that Dr. Gonzales has radically changed his analysis in response to some staff studies of his \"facts.\" Dr. Gonzales in the testimony which the API is distributing originally estimated that the natural gas consumers of this country received benefits of about $3 billion from the oil import program. This seemed much too -high a figure to me so I had my staff look at his figures. They came up with a benefit figure of about $314 million using Dr. Gonzales analysis. Dr. Gonzales responded that. yes. his first analysisthe one the API is now distributingwas inaccurate. that the gas consumers only received a benefit of $1.3 billion from the oil import quota program. This still seemed high to me so I had my staff look at his new analysis and we concluded the best benefit that his facts would support was $220.6 million. or about 4.4 percent of the cost of the oil import quota program. Putting aside for the moment the question whether Dr. Gonzales second estimate or my staffs estimate is correct. I think the important fact here is that the API is now distributing information it knows to be inaccurate. Even Dr. Gonzales admitted the first analysis he presented was erroneous. Yet. the API continues to distribute it. I think in the interests of fair play and accuracy the API ought to distribute to all those who got the original testimony a revised version reflecting Dr. Gonzales subsequent discussion.

D.C.. by the Water Resources Council on the proposed new standards and principles for planning water and related land resources. I am informed that none of the statutory members of the Water Resources Council were present at any of the hearings. This lack of attendance could be attributed to one of two factors: either the Water Resources Council is so bureaucratically arrogant that the views of the public. the planners. the engineers. the users. the local officials. and most important those whose dreams and aspirations depend upon the control and beneficial uses of our limited and essential water resources were of no interest to the Council. or. the decision to publish the proposed standards and principles was tantamount to publication for implementation. and therefore. the hearings were merely a formalityan empty gesturea hoax. Perhaps a more accurate conjecture would be that the Water Resources Council had little voice in the conjuration of the proposed principles and standards. and thus robbed of its statutory responsibilities. the members boycotted the hearings in silent protest. Whatever the reason for the conspicuous absence of the Council members. in order that the Nation can be aware of at least some of the comments of witnesses.

    "speech": "Mr. President. unemployment remains a serious national problem. On Friday. the Department of Labor reported that the Nations jobless rate. long predicted to decline. had climbed to 5.9 percent of the work forceits highest monthly level since 1971. These March jobless figures must have come as one more blow to the employment prospects of those Americans out looking for work but unable to find it. To the administration. on the other hand. the report offered just one more opportunity to exercise unemployment \"doubletalk.\" For 21/2 years. Nixon policymakers argued that a high jobless rate was the necessary sacrifice for price stability. The only way to fight inflation. they argued. was by cutting back on employment. Now the administration economists have come up with a new excuse. Unemployment is high. they argue. not because of their own mismanagement. but because of the influx of so many women and young people into the work force. The logic of their new argument leaves a lot to be desired. Joblessness is no less severe because it affects women. most of whom are their familys breadwinners. than when it affects men. As Hobart Rowen. financial columnist for the Washington Post. put it yesterday: The administration has been trying to grapple with the unemployment problem by redefining it. Mr. Rowen maintained thatThe honest thing for [the Administration] to say. if thats [their] policy. is the country cannot afford full employment for a couple of years. Of course. they dont have the nerve to put it that way. Mr. President.

I think this is a rather unique situation and a rather interesting situation because to some extent I believe we are legislating after the fact. You will remember. Mr. Speaker. we had the original bill here some time ago to extend for 2 years the Public Broadcasting Corporation. and I believe it had some $65 million in it rather than the $45 million. The administration objected to the 2 years. and to the amount. We had quite a bit of discussion about Sander Vanocur. and about some other individual. and it was quite an interesting operation. In any event. the President vetoed that bill on June 30. 1972. I do not believe there was any effort to override the veto. and the Senate prepared this bill clearly in accordance with the request of the President of $45 million and for the 1year extension. I voted against the original bill. although I support the Public Broadcasting System. Then last week. Mr. Speaker. we had an appropriation conference report that had the $45 million in it. So we have already appropriated the $45 million. So what we are going to do today is to make legal what we did last week in appropriating the money. I voted against the conference report on the appropriation because I thought it was against the rules. I did it technically. but on the bill here today. to make everything legal.

Amendments were offered in various ways to limit the authorization and were defeated by very narrow margins. Many of the misgivings and dissatisfactions voiced here were also noted by the administration and its suggestion for a 1year authorization allowing an increase of $10 million over 1972 levels. many people felt that this was a 30percent increase. a very generous increase. Of course feeling on the opposite side was evidenced by the vote. Based upon the actions taken here during consideration of the original bill. it became obvious that there were considerably less than twothirds needed to override a veto forthe 2year funding. Therefore. it is not surprising that when the President did veto it that there has been no attempt to override it. I think it is important that we understand at this point also that the situation is a little bit different than it was bcfore. I think at this point we had the resignations of the chairman of the board. the president and vice president of the corporation. and we will have new appointments to this. I believe also there are appointments to the number of 15 made to the board of directors. It also will have a different caste to it.

Comptroller General o/ the United States. General Accounting Office. Washington. D.C. DEAR Ma. STAATS: On Thursday of last week (June 1) the House of Representatives considered and passed H.R. 13918. a: bill which. among other things. authorizes the appropriation of funds for fiscal years 1973 and 19\"4 for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Corporation is a private. nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (Public Law 90129). During its existence the Corporation has been principally funded with monies appropriated by the Federal Government. Section 396(1) of the Act (47 U.S.C. 396(1) provides that the accounts of the Corporation must be audited annually by independent accountants having certain prescribed qualifications. That section also authorizes an audit of the financial transactions of the Corporation by the General Accounting Office for any fiscal year during which Federal funds are available to finance any portion of the Corporations activities. During House consideration of H.R. 13918. I was informed that no audit of the Corporation has even been conducted by the General Accounting Office. In view of the substantial amounts of Federal funds being appropriated to the Corporation. I believe that an audit of the Corporations financial transactions by the General Accounting Office is desirable. Accordingly. I request that the General Accounting Office conduct an audit of the financial transactions of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal year 1972. Sincerely yours.",

I have served on the House Committee on the Interior and Insular Affairs for 6 years. As an inevitable result of this service I am very comfortable in expressing outrage at the totally unfair and ridiculous charges that have been repeatedly leveled at the chairman of the full committee. WAYNE ASPINALL. He has been designated capriciously. unconscionably. and in absolute error as a \"foe of conservationists.\" \"a tool of public land permittees\" and a whole lot more. He has been labled a member of the \"Dirty Dozen.\" those Members of Congress who allegedly would destroy our environment. Recognizing all the inequities in the political process. I can simply not remain silent in the face of this blatent. ludicrous. and vicious lie. As a member of the opposition party to WAYNE ASPINALL. I have found myself in disagreement with him on occasion. But to overlook Mr. ASPINALLs achievements in the fields of conservationgenuineenvironmental protection and ecological concern is so damnable it simply must be stopped. Under his leadership the Congress has passed the Wilderness Act. the wild rivers bill. national trails. and literally hundreds more. To allow the spleen of a few professional activists to be vented unchallenged is to do truth more harm than it deserves. History will show that WAYNE ASPINALL was the lynchpin that turned the Nations concern for the environment from verbiage to solid. national action. He is entitled to the respect and gratitude of those who are similarly concerned. not their meaningless. blind attacks.",

He exposed torture in the prisons although none of the 100 cases of torture he brought to court were successful. Increasingly. he. his family. and his staff were harassed. intimidated and physically threatened. and he faced probable arrest himself by the security police. His passport was removed in 1969 for defending the family -of a prisoner -who died after electricshock torture. Mr. Carlson felt that his effectiveness as a lawyer was severely diminished by these incidents. Last week. he renounced his South African citizenship and left the country with a British passport to which he was entitled by birth. Now in seclusion in England. Mr. Carlson expects to come to the United States shortly to assume a law lectureship at New York University. Mr. Carlson is a man of infinite courage. of principle and commitment.

They are living proof that Mr. Morleys words strike a truthful note. The subjugation these nations have been forced to suffer has few parallels. Likewise. their clever and courageous resistance to cultural domination has been unequaled. Bricks cannot hold back tanks. clubs cannot silence machine guns. unarmed people cannot repel soldiers. However. a nations ideals and principles. hopes and dreams are not easily thwarted by tyranny. Czechoslovakia may have lost her chance for an independent socialist course. but her people have not lost the will to resist foreign domination. The Soviet Union is no longer able to conceal the fact that the Czech people detest their presence and are as uncooperative as possible. The Communist regime in Poland has not been able to turn people from their religious convictions. and at least one nation. Rumania. has been able to attain some release from the Soviet grip. The nations of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania were briefly independent following World War I. Though they are now assimilated with the U.S.S.R.. many people there still struggle to retain their national identity. The people of America applaud the valiant struggle of these people to pursue an independent course. Despite some encouraging signs of a detente with the Soviet Union. let us not forget the cross of captivity now borne by the nations of Eastern Europe. Hopefully. the captive nations of Eastern Europe will soon be free to choose their own course among the nations of the world.

This year. from July 18 through July 24. the people of the United States and 17 other free nations will again mark that anniversary. This observance is a reminder to all the people of the world that America and the American people are dedicated still to the ideal of freedom for all people. That this desire for freedom still burns in those nations presently held captive was dramatically shown during the past year. when the proud people of Poland last December took to the streets in protest against their low standard of living. The disturbances led to the fall of the leader of the Polish Government. but more than that. these uprisings again brought into sharp focus the inability of communism to satisfy either the spiritual needs for freedom. which is part of each human being. as well as the failure of that form of government to provide for the material necessities necessary to make freedom a reality. Living as we do with a guaranteed freedom. as well as in a country capable of providing the material necessities to make this freedom meaningful. we sometimes tend to forget what a priceless possession we have in this country. Yet. the revolts of Hungary and Poland in 1965. the tragic crushing of a liberalizing movement in Czechoslovakia. and finally this most recent upheaval in Poland. must remind us all how much those people held under Communist domination desire freedom. The sacrifices of those brave people who die in these uprisings illustrate to us all how valuable is the priceless possession we. too. often take for granted. This weeklong observance of Captive Nations Week gives us all an opportunity to reaffirm. not only our efforts on behalf of all repressed people. but also the chance to ponder the danger and suffering that can occur through freedoms loss. Let us this week rededicate ourselves to the principle that all men should be free. and strengthen our spirits with that love for freedom that has marked us as a nation from our birth.",

Furthermore. the Secretary supported adjustments in the proposal President Nixon has sent to Congress asking for the establishment of a Department of Natural Resources which match my own thinking completely. and are incorporated in my bill.

In an article entitled \"A Guide to Seven Spots Where America the Beautiful Can Still Be Found.\" written by Marion Lynn Clark. the Sawtooths were described as \"still everything one imagines wide open spaces and room to breathe to be.\" This spectacular mountain range was chosen by a panel of experts assembled to select areas in America which are the best. ecologically. in which to live. Some of the other areas chosen were the Flagstaff. Ariz.. area. the Big Sur. Calif.. and the CulpeperWarrenton. Va.. area. Although the Sawtooth Range is still untrammeled. still resplendent under the big sky. it is attracting ever larger numbers of people.

The dream of a real world community was to be given a chance of realization. The United Nations is concerned with peace and cooperation between states. but it is also concerned with peace and cooperation between men. Absolutely basic to this goal is that all men. regardless of race. religion. nationality. or culture be allowed to live as they wish. providing they do not impinge on the rights of others. The world has seen many instances of attempts by one culture to eliminate another. Among the worst of these were the slaughter of the South American Indians by the Conquistadors. the attempted elimination of the Armenians by the Turks. and the horrible slaughter of the Jews of Europe during World War II. These acts have always been morally repugnant. The time has come to see that they are made illegal as well. The aim of the Genocide Convention is to do just that. It takes a long time for any great goal to become a reality. The documents in the history of the world that potentially had the greatest good to offer have also been among the hardest to effectively implement. This does not mean that the effort should not be made. The Magna Carta and our own Constitution are both great documents in the history of individual freedom. Both were established only with great difficulty. Neither of them were perfect as they were promulgated and they have been changed. None of these things reduces their net worth to the cause of human freedom. The Genocide Convention is not a perfect document either. But its goal of guaranteeing the right of existence to all peoples is essential. While it may not guarantee an immediate cessation of genocide. it will establish the principle that the nations of the world will not condone it. and will open the way to the eventual total elimination of this crime against all humanity.

Studies have shown that the hearing and nerves of persons who work around loud machinery on the job can be affected by the noise. Now. a study conducted by the environmental design department of the University of Wisconsin. Madison. for Koss Electronics. Inc.. of Milwaukee. shows that people who spend a lot of time in a normal residential kitchenand that would be primarily housewivesmay be similarly affected. The research report \"The Auditory Environment in the Home\" points out that people in the kitchen are under constant bombardment from the groan of the garbage disposal. the din of the dishwasher. the bleat of the blender. and other noisy alliterations. This study represents seminal research in an area which undoubtedly will come under close examination in years to come. I congratulate the staff members of the university and the Koss firm who worked on the project. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that some remarks by Mr. John Koss and an article about the study. published in the New York Times. be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am voting to invoke cloture in the debate on H.R. 13915. which seeks to limit massive. enforced busing of public schoolchildren. The time is past due for Congress to address itself to the busing issue. For years. there has been rampant confusion over what school districts are required to do in order to provide equal educational opportunities for all children. This confusion has resulted from conflicting court decisions. from various governmental actions. and from differing pronouncements by Government officials. The Congress now has the opportunity to confront the issue and failure to do so will. I believe. only leave our people more confused and bewildered. With the possible exception of the economy. there is no domestic issue of more importance to more people in our Nation than that of busing. It is an issue which burdens people. which frightens people. which imposes hardships upon their children and which costs them money. It is a requirement which has been ordered for some. but not for others. It is a requirement whose educational value has been questioned. It Is a matter which the people of this Nation expect their representatives to deal with. I believe that most Americans are fairminded. that they want all children in our Nation to have access to the education and opportunity which will enable them to develop their poteritialities. But. I also believe that Americans find it difficult to accept massive. enforced busing when it is uncertain that it produces educational benefits and when it imposes special hardships on young childrenblack and white. The legislation before the Senate is of particular importance to the people of Virginia. There has probably been as much litigation over public schools In my State as in any other State in our Nation and Virginians have been forced to provide the proving ground for almost every new approach to the complex problem of providing equal educational opportunities for all children. I believe they should have relief. especially in view of the very serious questions which have recently been raised about the educational value of massive busing. Consequently. I believe it Is imperative that the Senate vote on this bill during this session of Congress.",

The difficulty with this bill is that it is a complete reversal of all the policy of the United States since 1954. If anything was needed to give it away. it is the socalled reopener clause. Mr. President. we in the Senate of the United States must elevate our sights to the country. I realize the problems of the Senator from Michigan. the Senator from Virginia. the Senator from Florida. and a few other Senators. but we are dealing with a nation. About 11.5 million attend school in the 11 Southern States. The desegregation of those schools has now resulted in millions of those children having reversed their previous course. being given an opportunity to lead a decent life. The maximum estimate of children bused because of desegregation is some 600.0003. percent of all the schoolchildren in the countryand the Department of Transportation estimates that twothirds of those would travel by bus. anyway. So that would be 200.000 childrenriding buses solely because of desegregation. Yes. the shoe pinches in State A or State B or State C when some judge might have made errors which will be reversed by a conservative Supreme Court. which we have today. But this bill proposes to turn the clock back to pre1954. and the reopener clause gives it away. Mr. President. if we fall for that. then we are not looking at the country through the right end of the telescope but through the wrong end. I repeat: This doctrine of desegregation was long overdue in this country. under the Constitution and under morality. The Supreme Court has given us a good doctrine. let us not forsake It now.",

This is a simple and easy reformbut a long.overdue one. .. Last year 1.-testified before the Subcommittee on .-State Department Organization and.-Foreign Operations of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the need for legislation of this sort. At that time. I reported -a situation which I had been observing for some time in the Federal Office Building in Cleveland where one of my District offices is located. During the entire spring of 1970and of this yearthere have been lines out in the hallways of the building of 20 or 25 people waiting. long hours. to have their passport applications reviewed and have the oath of allegience taken. Naturally. with my congressional office right across the hall. some of these people have come into my office to make some very formidable protests about the terrible delay and the congested condition of the passport office. This delay is not the fault of the Cleveland passport officials. They have worked hard to meet the load of work .thrust upon them. They have done a good job. There is simply too much work for this small staff of two people to handlelast year they handled over 22.000 applications in a single. year. As a result the service which has been provided is totally inadequate for the Cleveland community. the Same problem exists throughout the country. This is why I support this bill which will enable the Department of State to expand the program for acceptance of passport applications from a few \"experimental locations\" like Detroit to post offices in the areas of heaviest. application load and eventually to firstclass post offices everywhere. At present. passport applications are accepted. generally. only through the Department of States 10 passport offices located at various principal cities and by clerks of court in certain select courts. This is obviously inadequate when one considers that the volume of passport applications rose 140 percent between 1960 and 1969. Since the Postal Services workload is lightest in the spring and summer when passport applications are heaviest. the service will easily handle the extra workload. I hope. Mr. Chairman. that this bill will pdss today.",

As a member of one segment of this vast Spanishspeaking segment of the population. I have urged for many years that the Federal Government consider the Puerto Rican. the Cuban American. the Mexican American. and other Latin Americans in this country as constituting a single minority. Whereas our national political institutions in the past have preferred to identify the various elements of the Spanishspeaking community as regional problems to be left to the care of the States. the time has come for our Federal officials to view this group as a subject of nationwide concern requiring comprehensive Federal programs. Certainly no greater evidence of this need for a comprehensive Federal view of the Spanishspeaking minority is required than reference to the fact that both the Puerto Rican and the Mexican American minorities receive both the least education and the poorest paying jobs of any groups in our society with the Puerto Rican averaging less than 5 years of schooling with 70.6 percent of them in lowincome occupations and the Mexican American averaging 8 years of education with 76 percent of its men working as manual laborers. The unique language and cultural barriers confronting both these groups dictate a form of Government assistance which aims at improving the socioeconomic status of this national minority while respecting their unique cultural attributes. In conclusion. I Join with my Puerto Rican colleague from New York. Congressman BADILLO. in calling for greater efforts by the Federal Government to alleviate the continuing problems of Puerto Ricans. Mexican Americans. and all other members of the Spanishspeaking population who together comprise the second largest minority in this Nation.",

The bill would have special impact on American Samoans who. unlike natives of other unincorporated territories of the United States. are still considered U.S. nationals. Natives of Guam and the Virgin Islands were brought under the citizenship umbrella through the organic acts and similar legislation. but nothing has been done to change the status of American Samoans. The committee was informed that this has had an adverse effect. particularly on those American Samoans working in the United States or for the U.S. Government as civilians or members of the Armed Forces.

They are additionally denied exemptions for their wives or husbands. because the law limits them to only one personal exemption.

American Samoans. as my colleagues may know. are subject to the military draft.

By permitting the claiming of American Samoans as dependents. and by removing the artificial limitation on the number of dependent exemptions an American Samoan taxpayer may claim.

Under existing law. veterans organizations are exempt from taxation either as social welfare organizations under section 501(c) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code or as social clubs under section 501(c) (7) of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to 1969. organizations exempt in these categories were not subject to the unrelated business income tax. However. the Tax Reform Act of 1969 extended the unrelated business income tax to social welfare organizations and social clubs. Social clubs and employee beneficiary associations were also subjected to tax on their investment income. However. in the case of employee beneficiary associations. the Tax Reform Act does not impose the unrelated business income tax on investment or other nonbusiness income that is set aside either for the payment of life. sick. or accident insurance or other benefits or for charitable purposes. Veterans organizations sometimes provide one or more types of insurance to their members and dependents as a part of their overall activities. Whether the insurance is financed through a separate company or the veterans organization acts as a selfinsurer. the organization derives some income from this operation. It was felt appropriate to amend the law to make it clear that the unrelated business income tax applies to these activities of veterans organizations on the same basis as it applies to similar activities of employee beneficiary associations. The present law is ambiguous in this regard and the committees action. in providing clarification is not intended as an inference as to the treatment of this income prior to the effective date of the change in the committees bill.

Second. income from insurance plans operated by those organizations would be exempt from taxation to the extent that it was used for payment of insurance benefits or for charitable or religious purposes.

In community property States. if an employee who is entitled to receive an annuity under a tax qualified plan is predeceased by his spouse. the spouse is determined to have an interest in the annuity that the surviving employee is entitled to receive. In the case of common law States. this is not a problem since if the employees spouse predeceases him. the deceased individual is not determined to have an interest in the pension rights of the surviving spouse.

I am sure you are aware of the economic sanctions the U.N. imposed upon the Government of Rhodesia in 1966 after Rhodesia broke away from British rule and created a separate government. But you may not be aware of the chromeplated fantasy that has resulted from these sanctions. According to our State Departments interpretation. under section 25 of the 1945 U.N. Participation Act. each member nation \"is obligated to accept and carry out the decisions of the U.N. Security. Council.\" The State Department confirmed this interpretation at a recent Senate hearing on the Rhodesian situation. This interpretation is. to some degree. hampering one of our key industriesthe ferroalloy industry. The ferroalloy. and in turn the steel industries. are dependent upon chrome ore. which is vital to the production of stainless steel. tool steel. structural steel. and other items. including an impressive list of defense applications ranging from jet aircraft to nuclear submarines to conventional armaments. Chrome ore is not found in the United States in commercially acceptable deposits. We must therefore import chrome ore to serve our industrial needs and our defense needs. The main producers of chrome ore are the Soviet Union. Rhodesia. South Africa. Turkey. and the Philippines. Of this group Rhodesia has an estimated twothirds of the world supply of highgrade chromite ore. Russia. while being the largest supplier today. has less than onetenth the reserves of Rhodesia. Even though Rhodesia has the largest chrome reserves in the world. because of U.N. sanctions our Nation is dependent upon importing our highgrade chrome ore from the Soviet Union. Thus. a Communist nation is supplying our free enterprise society with a key ingredient for one of our major industries. I While the Soviets are selling us chrome. we- continue to be the patsy as can be seen by the high prices our country and its industries pay for chrome ore. In 1965. the last year Rhodesia sold chrome to the United States. they supplied about 40 percent of our metallurgical needs at a price of about $25 per ton. Today. the Soviet Union supplies about 60 percent of our chrome needs and since they dominate the market the Communists have increased the price to $72 per ton or a 188percent increase.

My good and dear friend. the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate. has served in this body continuously since January 3. 1937longer than any other Senator. Through all those years he has provided dedicated and talented leadership in a host of Important positions. We in North Carolina feel we have a special claim on ALLEN JOSEPH ELLENDER. For many years he served as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. and it was through working with him on this committee that I got to know him best. Agriculture is an important business in North Carolina where we have more farmers than any other State ir the Union. So in P. way. while he was chairman of the Agriculture Committee. North Carolina provided Senator ELLENDER his largest constituency. No man was ever more in tune with the needs of that constituency than the senior Senator from Louisiana. And he still is. as the ranking Democrat on that committee. But agriculture is not the only common bond between Senator ELLENDER and the people of my State. Until recently he also served as chairman of the important Appropriations Subcommittee on Public Works. a position he retained until he became chairman of the full Appropriations Committee at the death of our beloved mutual friend. the late President pro tempore of the Senate. Richard B. Russell. As chairman of this subcommittee Senator ELLENDER always worked closely with me to see that funds were provided- for the water improvements projects which have been so important to the overall development of North Carolina. I am grateful to him for the interest and dedication he brought to this post. Senator ELLENDER and I also share in common the fact that we will both be running for reelection next year. It can be said without exaggeration that Louisiana has never sent to the Senate a more dedicated and capable public servant than ALLEN JOSEPH ELLENDER. I have no doubt whatsoever that he will be returned for continued service by the same overwhelming mandate which has characterized his previous elections and reelections. North Carolinians across the State join me. I am sure. in wishing for him a happy birthday and many years of continued service to his State and Nation.",

It is not an empty phrase when I say that no one works harder than ALLEN ELLENDER. He is on the go constantly. putting in long hours at his desk. attending committee sessions and taking an active role in floor debates.

Senator ELLENDER is a particular expert on appropriations for public works projects and on agricultural legislation. Throughout the United States are many flood control. navigation. and power installations which would not exist except for his interest and his belief in them as necessary to the wellbeing of the citizens of the United States. to a sound economy. and to the national security of this country.

His experience gained over many years in public service is tremendous. He began as a city and district attorney and then moved to the State legislature and graduated as speaker of the house. This local and State service fitted him well for the outstanding contribution he has made to our Nation the past 35 years in the Senate. What he has experienced. he learned and has remembered. His mind is a storehouse of knowledge and. like a computer. it can recall. analyze. and resolve the problems with facts and wisdom. His energy is boundless and his dedication to duty unlimited. He is the hardest working Member of the Senate. In spite of his national responsibilities. he has maintained close contact with his people and is thoroughly conversant with their problems. Better than this. he is adept at solving them when they relate to government. I have served with him closely and long on the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry and I know he is the friend and servant of the farmer. My State. and every State in our Nation. is a beneficiary of his wonderful grasp of the needs for flood control. water resource development. navigation. and harbors. Monuments to his leadership in public works are innumerable and their contribution to safe homes. water for jobs and transportation affect the pocketbook and the level of living of every American family. He is perhaps best known as a watcher of the public purse. His study of every appropriation has eliminated unnecessary and wasteful spending. His inspection of overseas military facilities and evaluation of foreign aid programs runnnig above $100 billion has saved this country billions of dollars and retarded the erosion of the value of the dollar. Every American should acclaim his service because he has served every American well. I congratulate my friend ALLEN ELLENDER today. He begins a new year on his long tenure of faithful service.

The Senator from Louisiana represents his State. All the 100 Members here represent their respective States. and they represent the thinking of the people of their States. their philosophy. and their ideas.

Ideas shift and ideas change here as the constituencies of this Nation change. The Senator from Louisiana combines the great qualities of hard work. integrity. and knowledge. I have listened to many heated debates on this floor in which the Senator from Louisiana has been a participant. I do not recall the Senator ever once casting any aspersion or personally slighting any Member of this body. He always discusses an issue under debate to the fullest extent of his knowledge. which is deep and great.

About ALLEN ELLENDER we can truly say. \"He is 81 years young.\" In the 12 years I have been privileged to be a Member of this body. I have seen my good friend from Louisiana shoulder an ever heavier burden of responsibility here in the Senatein the field of agriculture. public works. national defense. and Federal expenditures. An example of his diligence and efficiency can be seen in the record the Senate Appropriations Committee compiled this year under ALLEN ELLENDERS chairmanship. Since he became chairman in February. the committee has handled a total of 15 money bills for the 1971 and 1972 fiscal years. Because he prodded committee members to hold hearings and do their preparatory work well in advance. nine of these bills were reported to the Senate either the same day they were received from the House or 1 day later. When Congress recessed on August 6. only four bills had not passed the Senate. All four are still in the House Appropriations Committee. which cannot act until Congress passes the necessary authorizing legislation. To the best of my recollection. never in recent years have these very important money bills been handled so expeditiously. As a member of the Appropriations Committee. I take my hat off to my chairman. I should like very much to know the key to my chairmans energy and longevity. But I shall not ask him to disclose his secret in this public forum in advance of the next election. Probably he would say. \"Because I keep healthy and I was born so long ago.\" All I can say is that anyone thinking of challenging ALLEN ELLENDER had better be in top physical and mental condition.

I am speaking of the observance of the Polish May 3 Constitution Day. This Congress has had a tradition of participation in the observances of the past but it appears to me that at no time was it more important to make our feelings and concern known. than during this years commemoration. The adoption of the May 3. 1791. Constitution stated Polands objective of granting the power of government to the people. It was an assertion of spirit and independence. of liberty and foresight. Now we. with our hindsight. see that this rebirth was too late. and that it was followed by the ruthless third partitioning by Russia. Prussia. and Austria In 1795. But the harbinger was there. and periodically the independent spirit of the Polish people is rekindled. We recently witnessed a resurgence of rebellion against dominion. Just last December. the wrath of the Polish people extended so far and so deep. as to grasp. possibly for the first time. the very heartbeat of their government. Since then I have heard. from firsthand reports. of the force of feeling and of the tide of emotion that swept the country in this. their latest attempt to achieve equality and equitability for the people. We in America see examples of the indomitability of human spirit daily in our youth. in our cities and across the Nation. It saddens me to think that we do not often widen our sights to include our brothers in other lands. who ask only the right to rule themselves. It is my sincere hope that every Member joins me today in expressing our hope for the hastening of the day that these brave people will at last be granted the rights they so earnestly seek. and have so consistently been denied: the right of assembly. the right of selfexpression. and the right of selfgovernment.",

Secretary Hardin comments on the barriers erected by the Common Market to U.S. farm products: The United States is continuing to press the Community to modify those aspects of its policy that are unfairly harmful. We favor European integration. but we dont believe that American farmers should be forced to pay unduly for the unification of the European Economic Community. Having seen these walls repeatedly threaten American agricultural products over the years. I certainly want to commend the Secretary and urge his Department to persevere in this area for the benefit of all our farmers. I also was interestei to note the Secretarys comments in support of the Farm Credit Act of 1971. We share the Secretarys view that the bill will enable the cooperative farm credit system \"to meet the growing credit needs of farmers in years to come.\" Secretary Hardin says he looks forward to \"favorable House action in the near future\" on the farm credit bill. In that this bill has been passed by the Senate and hearings have been completed by the House Agriculture Committee. I too hope that we can move this bill to the House floor for action as soon as possible. There is great support in most of rural America for the main provisions. and I believe that this bill merits our earliest attention.

This program. which has received the highest marks in several consecutive years of OEO evaluations. as well as a clean bill of health from the GAO in recent months. is if anything an example of the excellent work which OEO is doing in the area of assisting the poor people of America. The statement seems to take the position that the OEO amendments coming up this week should be opposed because of the agencys funding of the Urban Law Institute. I would submit just the contrary. The Antioch College grant. which goes only for the planning of a new public interest law school. is a model of the kind of reform in legal education which the poor people of this country must have if legal redress is to mean anything to them. The need is not only to increase the number of lawyers who will serve the poor. but also to create new institutions to develop the field of poverty law and to build acceptance for this field within the legal profession generally. I think the OEO grant is doing just that. and I commend the agency for its innovative and constructive use of research funds to that end. I am confident that if my colleagues read the GAO evaluation of the Urban Law Institute they would see that OEO was entirely justified in making its award. and that the untimely termination of former sponsorship of the program by George Washington University was hardly justified.

A study recently released by a group of scholars at Cornell University indicates that while this countrys overall military involvement in South Vietnam has decreased. its air activity is continuing at an unacceptably high level. The report shows that almost 300.000 tons of bombs will be dropped this year. bringing the total amount expended during the course of the war to more than 6 million tons. These grim statistics highlight the truth that our progress toward peace in Southeast Asia cannot be measured solely in terms of the number of American troops withdrawn. we must also look closely at the intensity of our air effort and here we find that no progress has been made. In a recent issue of the New York Times. Herbert Mitgang set out the conclusions of the Cornell study. conclusions which I think will be of interest to all Senators. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Mitgangs November 21. 1971. article. entitled \"Changing the Color of the Corpses.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

What makes the story of the A7D so dramatic is the fact that its predecessors in the A7 line left a lot to be desired. As a matter of fact. I was inclined to oppose the A7 a few years ago and so informed the Senate Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Tactical Air Power. But. since then. I have had a chance to watch the A7D perform at Luke Air Force Base and am convinced that it is one of the best airplanes our country has ever come up with. In this connection. Mr. President. the Armed Forces Journal recently set out to discover what the men who fly the A7D and the A7E--the Navys versionthink about this plane. The result is a very timely and informative article in the December issue of the Journal entitled \"They Call It Sluf--Short. Little.

Morton and top members of his Secretariat were kind enough to come to Capitol Hill today to brief Members of both Houses of Congress on the situation relating to the potential oil and gas resources of the Outer Continental Shelf off the Atlantic coast. Despite having been subjected to a certain amount of political sniping. the Secretary emphasized that if this Nation is to develop its own domestic energy policywhich must be geared to its foreign and national defense policiesthe Interior Department must do as thorough a job as it possibly can in developing a reliable inventory of energy resources and a capability of putting them on the line when needed. Secretary Morton also emphasized very clearly and strongly that undue alarm is being voiced by some persons that oil wells are about to sprout near the beaches of the east coast in the near future. This will not happen. Secretary Morton stressed the fact that because of problems. and lack of sufficient geological and environmental information at this time. it would not be possible to make a decision to lease any area off the Atlantic seaboard for 2 years or more. He noted that the National Environmental Policy Act would be followed scrupulously. but that even the initial steps toward making a decision under that act could not be taken until the States claims to the Outer Continental Shelf are resolved. or at least some interim agreement can be made with an individual State or States to proceed. Mr. President. I hope this will lay to rest the overexcitement voiced by some of our friends. The Secretary very candidly said. as he has said previously: No decision has been made. nor is such a decision now planned. Now let us allow our executive branch to proceed with the work mandated to them by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 so that a wise decision can be made when the necessary information is in hand.",

The middleincome community of Forest Hills is about to have thrust upon it a lowincome housing project of major proportions. This federally funded project consists of three 24story buildings. which it is estimated will eventually house some 4.000 lowincome tenants. This represents a massive infusion of new people which most observers agree is beyond the capacity of the community to absorb. The project. therefore. represents a direct threat to the stability of the neighborhood. Many other factors strongly indicate the inappropriateness of this particular projectschools overloaded to the point of triple sessions. poor soil conditions resulting in exorbitant construction coststhe per unit cost will exceed $35.000--overcrowded transportation facilities. excessive aircraft noise. the impact of a twofare zone on the prospective lowincome tenants. and so forth. It is for all of these reasons that the residents of Forest HillsRego Park are so deeply opposed to what they can only conclude is an incredibly misconceived plan which will on balance do little for the poor while threatening to disrupt one of New Yorks most stable areas. The opposition is not based on bigotry. It is not racial in its concern. as is testified by the broad support which it has attracted from black residents of the area and from responsible New Yorkers of every political persuasion. I would urge Senators to give the most careful consideration to this particular controversy. because it seems well on its way to becoming a classic demonstration as to how not to go about the business of creating lowincome housing. It particularly emphasizes the critical need to consult community opinion and enlist community support before proceeding with projects of this sensitive nature. Mr. President. it is not often that I find myself in agreement with either the New York Times or the Village Voice. Yet both publications in recent days have spoken out eloquently and effectively on the Forest Hills situation. In order to shed further light on this issue.

It is our job as lawmakers to reinforce these norms. to lend some substance to these visions by supporting them with the force of law. Certainly if a mans property were plundered. we would want appropriate action to follow. If a mans house is burned down. it is natural human instinct to want some kind of action to redress the situation. In short. we want to see justice done. The function of law is the institutionalization of justice in such a way that justice flows in regular. predictable channels. The members of a community respect this system of justice as the price of receiving benefits from the community. So it is with the world community. the community of nations. Offenses against a group of individuals are just as reprehensible as offenses against one individual. As with individuals. there are certain offenses which the nations recognize as punishable crimes.

May I state that the reason for this question is that I am committed to a generic bill. though I am not yet committed to this particular bill. which is only for Lockheed. So the question is. Would the Board have the authority to recommend an increase of the guarantee amount if it felt that the economic situation required it? As the language of the bill does not say so. the legislative history. in my judgmentif the manager feels that the Board could and should do that kind of thing and the occasion should call for it--should make that clear. Would the chairman care to reply?",

The term \"bad management\" has been used frequently and I think rather loosely as applied to Lockheed. I suspect It has been used by persons who are really not in a position to judge the management capability of Lockheed. We must take into consideration the very valuable contributions that Lockheed has made to our defense establishment. we must take into account that they have developed an airplane. the C5A which is literally the envy of every air force in the world. These contributions have been most important to our Nation. and I think that those who loosely use the term \"bad management.\" would do well to reconsider their terms. I think one of the things the Board would have to consider. if you are on the Board or a member of the Federal Reserve. System. is the conclusion of the reports on the airplane now under discussion. the L1011 TrStar. The reports now In front of me. were submitted by the various airlines. They show that the L1011 is competitive in price with the DC10. show that it has certain attribfites of efficiency. of quietness of operation. of nonpollution factors. which give it an advantage over the DC10. Now. a company that can develop an airplane that can meet these criteria obviously is not practicing bad management. I think the product is the proof of the pudding. so to speak.

In other words. in 2 years. the military aspects of the foreign aid bill have doubled. It was $815 million in 1970. that is for military aid. supporting assistance. and military sales. The amount in the continuing resolution is $1.515 billion. It Is almost double the amount. When we talk about the huge deficit we have and of being concerned about trying to bring it under control. what is the justification for doubling the amount of foreign military assistance? In other areas. we are told that we are making progress around the world in alleviating some of the old antagonismsfor example. the Presidents policy k ith regard to Russia and China. Why must foreign military assistance be doubled in 2 years? I submit that the Senator from Hawaii. for whom we all have the greatest affection. has been extremely considerate in his attitude toward the committee. but he does not answer the question as to why they did not go to conference on the two appropriation bills. the House and the Senate. on authorized items. and bring back a regular appropriation bill.

I do not expect to prolong this evening session. but I think we do need to cover one or two points in order to make the record to override the veto. I think the essence of the Presidents veto message is contained in the following language which I read: Legislation which would continue our efforts to raise water quality. but which would do so through extreme and needless overspending. does not serve the public interest. There is a much better way to get this job done. For this reason. I am compelled to withhold my approval from S. 2770. the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972a bill whose laudable intent is outweighed by its unconscionable $24 billion price tag. Mr. President. the language I have read from the Presidents veto message states quite plainly that he believes this bill represents overspending. May I say to the Senate that the amount authorized in the legislation by the committees is based on a very careful evaluation of needs. including estimates submitted by the administration itself. I now read from a letter sent to the President yesterday by Mr. Ruckelshaus. the Administrator of the Enviromnental Protection Agency: The total amount of contract grant authority contained in the enrolled bill is formulated from the Administrations estimate of construction needs as submitted to the Congress in February of this year. The total estimate amounted to $18.1 billion. The Federal share at 75% would amount to $13.6 billion. This needs estimate did not include any allowance for inflation. nor did it include funds for combined. storm. and collection sewers. or for recycled water supplies.

If the President received legal advice to the contrary. I believe that such legal advice was misguided. The Senator from Tennessee also stated in his letter: The bill vetoed by the President strikes a fair and reasonable balance between financial investment and environmental quality. Study after study. public opinion poll after public opinion poll have revealed that the economy of this Nation can absorb the costs of cleaning up pollution without inflation or without a loss in economic productivity. Finally. the distinguished Senator stated: Mr. President. the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 have twice been approved unanimously by the Senate. They are genuinely a bipartisan product. I am proud to have worked with members of both parties in the evolution of this legislation. I hope that the vote to override the Presidents veto will. again. be both bipartisan and unanimous. Mr. President. another point the President raised in his veto message is found in the following language on page 3: It should be noted that doing so would by no means terminate the existing Federal water quality programs. because the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to operate those programs until the merits of a new water bill can be dealt with as a first order of business in the new Congress.

Now. 6 years later. matters have only worsened for the inhabitants of Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia. Natives of these regions continue to be deported to all parts of Russia in the Soviets effort to liquidate their cultural identity. Freedom continues to be denied to the people of the Baltic states. and Balts around the world decry Soviet domination of their compatriots? who have remained in their homelands. June is a particularly historic month for the Baltic people. for it was in June of 1940 that the Soviets overcame Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia by force. and a year laterin June of 1941the massive deportations to slave and labor camps in Siberia began. Later that same month. Lithuania succeeded in regaining its independence. though the free government lasted only 6 weeks before the Nazis overran the new nation.

It is time for the captivity of Latvia. Lithuania. and Estonia to end. For the interest of my colleagues. I insert a copy of the 1966 concurrent resolution in the RECORD:",

The arms race will go on. With the passage of H.R. 15494. the American people will be forced to pay for the building of weapons of the past. not of the future. The big strategic weapons provided for in this bill are like the obsolete battleships which continued to be built in World War II after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. There were too many vested interests in building these ships to warrant the halt of their construction. A lot of money was wasted. and such will be the case with the building of the Triton submarine. the B1 bomber. and the ABM complex around Washington. D.C. There is a price on everything in the political bargain basement. but it is too bad that the cost of the SALT agreements will be so high. However. it is somewhat of a consolation to realize that $8.8 billion a year is a lot more palatable than a nuclear war:",

Most of these 23.5 million families deliberately decide to rent an apartment or house. yet many others have no choice. This latter group is comprised largely of the elderly and the poorpeople who are so often the victims of situations over which they have no control. When things go wrong or there are problems with their landlord. these people are left with little financial or legal recourse. An article in this weeks Village Voice points this out admirably. The situation described by Joanna Mermey is duplicated far too often. not only in New York City. but across the Nation. It is time we stop treating tenants as secondclass citizens. We must develop ways for these persons to gain redress of their grievances.

I share that concern. Without going into the language of the amendment. I would like to iterate that as noted in the Senate report. the amendment is intended to exempt towing vessels engaged in servicing the offshore oil and mineral exploitation industry. primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. The report stresses that these vessels differ substantially in their operations from the inland water towboats by operating in waters having relatively little vessel congestion. I would assume. and indeed insist. that in administering H.R. 6479. the Coast Guard will be guided by the principles mentioned above with respect to the exemption clause and will be very careful that the amendment language is not misconstrued so as to provide such a broad exemption that the purposes of this legislation might be defeated In promoting safety upon our waterways. I would like to point out that in the past several years my committee held extensive hearings on the entire subject of towing vessel safety before laying H.R. 6479 before the House in April 1971 for passage. The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee did not find any compelling reason to exempt any specific segment of the towing vessel industry from the general safety operation requirements of H.R. 6479. However. in recommending concurrence in the Senate amendment on June 29. 1972. I was persuaded by the knowledge of a special study of offshore operations being conducted by the Coast Guard also noted in the Senate report. I am sure that the Commandant of the Coast Guard will keep my committee advised during the course of this study as to further Coast Guard recommendations with respect to the amendment in the event the exemption proves to be too broad or is otherwise insufficient from the standpoint of maritime safety for our waterways.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing two pieces of legislation to help preserve the private charitable institutions which are so important to America. One of these bills is designed to rescue the privately endowed homes providing longterm care to the aged. the disabled. and children. The second bill will firmly establish the principle that private foundations are not to be taxed for revenue raising purposes. by renaming the levy on them from \"excise tax\" to \"service charge.\" and reducing it from 4 percent to 1 1/2 percent. During recent years. Congress has passed quite a bit of legislation designed to benefit a multitude of deserving groups and desirable purposes. In particular. in addition to legislation to benefit our senior citizens. we have enacted legislation and appropriated significant sums of money for improved hospital and extendedcare facilities across this land. Many of these programs. all of which must be paid for by the taxpayers of this country. have been quite expensive. In view of this situation. it seems somewhat ironic that a majorthreat to the very existence of private homes providing needed longterm care for the aged should be a result of action by Congress in another field. In enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1969. one of the intentions of Congress was to close some of the socalled tax loopholes. At the present time. we are hearing a lot of noise from Democratic presidential candidates about tax reform. In vlew of the fact that it has been 18 years since the Republicans have controlled either House of Congress. it is fair to point out that these Senators who are running for another office are running against their own handiwork. The fact is that all \"loopholes\" are in the tax laws in order to encourage people to do what Congress has determined to be socially desirable. Some of these exemptions. deductions. and credits may have outlived their usefulness. and ought to be abolished or modified. But we ought not forget that they were originally created to accomplish desirable goalslike encouraging private universities and hospitals.",

The administration has rationalized this increase in defense spending by calling it a necessary \"bargaining chip\" for future SALT talks. I however find such an argument to be unconvincing. Both sides now have more than enough nuclear weapons to serve as bargaining chips for future arms limitation agreements. The way to limit weapons is not to build more of them.

Cyrus Vance who was Deputy Secretary of Defense in August of1964. This excerpt contains an exchange over the question of North Vietnamese territorial seas between Secretary Vance and Richard Fryklund of the Washington Evening Star. The interview took place over the Voice of America on Saturday. August 8. 1964 (one day after Senate approval of theSoutheast Asia Resolution). RICHARD FRYKLUND. Is there any dispute about the Tonkin Gulf being international waters? Do. for instance. Communist China and North Vietnam claim the gulf as their territorial waters? Secretary VANCE. Not to my knowledge. I think that they do claim a 12mile limit as opposed to a 3mile limit. but there is no claim that the Gulf of Tonkin is territorial waters. RICHARD FRYKLUND. Does the United States recognize the 12mile limit? Secretary VANCE. No. it does not. The United States recognizes 3 miles as the territorial limit. RICHARD FRYKLUND. Do our naval units ever sail closer than 3 miles to the shore? Secretary VANCE. They do not. RICHARD FRYKLUND. Are they under specific orders not to? Secretary VANCE. They are. JACK RAYMOND.

I rise in support of this amendment and feel it is absolutely essential if in this bill Congress will truly solve all the problems caused by arbitrary courtordered busing plans. School District 151. Cook County. Ill.. in my district. has been subjected to a very strict courtordered busing program since 1968. The district has had nothing but growing problems traced primarily to the adverse effects of the arbitrary court order. which was concerned only with busing for racial quota purposes and not at all concerned with improving educational facilities or standards. I believe some statistics on the adverse effect of courtordered busing on this one school district are in order. and I am sure these statistics can be substantiated by other Members who are aware of similar problems in their own school districts. The districts racial composition has changed from 30 percent black to 45 percent black with an adverse change in enrollment from an anticipated enrollment of 2.800 to only 1.760 in September 1972. For every five homes constructed in the area since the court order. the district receives only one student. clearly indicating that parents are enrolling their children in private schools. The reduction of staff. the closing of buildings and the possibility of reducing school programs has negated the positive aspects of a quality school program. which the Board had hoped to implement. Mr. Chairman. time does not permit me to go into much more detail except to reemphasize that unless this amendment is accepted there will be no relief .under this bill for school districts. such as the one I refer to. which have already been feeling the adverse effects of courtordered busing.

If you will examine section 402. you will see the different types of remedies involved and the specific order of priority set forth. Reopening and modification of prior orders depends on whether prior decisions complied with this bill. Otherwise the case \"shall\" be reopened and the decree shall be \"modified.\" That is a very farreaching provision. How many existing court orders will be jeopardized. how many are vulnerable to modification? Mr. Chairman. during hearings before a Judiciary subcommittee then Acting Attorney General Richard Kleindienst testified concerning the socalled reopening provision of H.R. 13915. The Attorney General asserted that all desegregation cases. even where busing was not an issue and though completely litigated and a final decree issued. could be reopened. Under the reopening provision. the Attorney General further stated that the courts could order busing where none had been ordered earlier. Indeed. HEW has advised the committee that 154 school districts assignment plans in 19 States would be vulnerable to reopening under the provisions of this proposed amendment. What a waste.

Two years ago. I wrote in a weekly news column that we in the South are not asking for special handling and special treatment with regard to desegregation of our school system. Now. as then. we are merely asking that laws which we deem unworkable. especially concerning busing. be applied equally throughout the United States. We are sick and tired of being the scapegoat. If the laws being applied in the South are just and equal. we demand that they also be applied justly and equally to all sections of the country. I had hoped that the Education and Labor Committee would report a bill to the House of Representatives which would finally give the South equal treatment in the busing controversy. but once again we are being asked to vote for a bill which grants relief to the North while the South continues to suffer. This bill will allow a moratorium on busing for northern States like Michigan but will continue busing in the South. I know the people of my home State of Alabama are not willing to give this type of help to our northern neighbors who were all too eager to refuse us such help a few years ago. Certainly. if legislation is not passed now to remedy this situation in the South. we will never be rid of the menace of busing. If busing is the least desirable remedy for alleged denial of equal educational opportunity or of equal protection of the laws. as the committee bill states. then why is it allowed to continue in the South?

We. therefore. have a close affinity to the nature of the work which is done by the legislative counsel and we have occasion to know the quality of the work which is performed. We all wish Ed Craft Godspeed and a well deserved rest and relaxation upon his retirement. and hope we can take comfort from the fact that he will remain here in Washington and that we can have the opportunity to see him from time to time.",

In my time here I have known no other person who has served this body and this Nation with greater dedication. expertise. and loyalty than Ed Craft. For some 31 years. Ed Craft has labored in the Office of the Legislative Counsel. over a decade of that time as head of that Office. There would be few. if any. offices in this House which carry a greater burden in terms of workload and deadlines than the Office of the Legislative Counsel. They often work around the clock in drafting the measures that come to this floor. In this respect. Mr. Speaker. let me say that Eds surname is appropriately representative and descriptive of his calling and his career. as a craftsman par excellence. a legislative draftsman. whose products over the past 30 years have consistently reflected the complete objectivity and general excellence that have become hallmarks of the House Legislative Counsels Office and for which that Office is known throughout the world. We shall certainly miss Eds great service to this Body. but we take gratification from the realization that his is such a singularly welldeserved retirement. and we hope a very long and happy one. We are sure that whatever his new endeavors may be he will pursue them with that same great spirit that has characterized his superb service to the House of Representatives. the Congress and the United States for these past three decades.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is becoming increasingly clear that since President Nixon inaugurated his new economic policy last August 15. consumer confidence in the economy has been rising dramatically. Growth in consumer installment credit is one of our best indicators of what consumers are thinking. The months of September through December 1971 saw strong rises in consumer credit. During the month of September. installment debt outstanding. as seasonally adjusted. increased by almost $1 billion. During October the rise was $924 million. followed by rises in November and December of $11/4 billion and $900 million. respectively. Although the rise in December slowed somewhat from that of November. when installment credit had a record surge. the December credit growth was still brisk and generally reflects strong retail sales in December. There is good evidence that this strong December performance was matched last month. Our major retail chain stores reported large sales gains during the month of January. For example. Sears. Roebuck & Co.. the Nations largest retailer. reported sales at a level last month which was 9.6 percent above sales in January 1971. The volume for J. C. Penney Co. rose even faster. having been reported at 15.7 percent over the sales rate a year ago. Two other important retailers. Montgomery Ward & Co. and F. W. Woolworth Co.. reported sales gains last month over the comparable period a year earlier of 11 and 13 percent respectively. Mr. Speaker. I think that we should be especially encouraged by the fact that these strong performances in consumer credit and in retail sales have not been merely one month results. but are showing a consistent pattern of growth over a period of several months. reflecting continuing consumer confidence in the economy.",

As reported in the New York Times of November 27. two Roman Catholic priests in Soviet Lithuania have been sentenced to a years detention for preparing children to make their first communion. The Reverend Juozas Zdebskis of Prienai and the Reverend P. Bubnis of Raseiniai were arrested on August 26. The children the priests had been teaching were brought to the ensuing trial. and used to testify against the two men. The clergymen have now been found guilty. and will be forced to give up a year of their lives in prison. The deprivation of individual liberty which this incident reveals is shocking. and it indicates that the Soviet Union is less than frank in its claims of giving its citizens the freedom of worship which is their inherent right. The Soviet Constitution grants the \"freedom to perform religious rites.\" This language now stands disclosed as a sham.

I want to wish her well and commend her before my colleagues in the Congress for the honor she has brought to Lancaster. Ohio. The pageant judges could not have made a better choice. For the interest of my colleagues I would like to submit a series of articles from the Lancaster EagleGazette highlighting Colleens selection over 54 finalists for the title of Miss Teenage America.

The AP says: The Washington Post. in the wake of a dispute with the White House over naming the source of a background briefing. says the newspaper henceforth \"will make every reasonable effort\" to pinpoint the source of information it receives from Government officials. Post Executive Editor Benjamin C. Bradlee said Wednesday night he wants \"to get this newspaper once and for all out of the business of distributing the party line of any official government without identifying that official and that government.\" \"We are convinced.\" Bradlee said. \"that we have engaged in this deception and done this disservice to the reader long enough. \"Therefore. it shall be the policy of this newspaper to make every reasonable effort to attribute the information to its source.\" Ever since the New York Times Sullivan decision. when libel became almost an impossibility in this country by a public official. there has been a spreading tendency in American journalism to publish stories attributed to unidentified sources. Very often people in Government and out of Government had no recourse and no idea of who these sources were and what their purpose or intention was. I congratulate the Washington Post. I hope that every newspaper in this country will voluntarily adopt the same policy. instead of the idea of attributing stories to wellinformed. or usually reliable sources. This has become a vehicle for accusing the American press of indulging in propaganda. I congratulate the Post. and I hope that every newspaper in this country will follow this historic decisi6n by the Washington Post.",

We were elected. as you will remember. in November of 1936. and we came down here to Washington in 1937. and there was no patronage. and everybody looked at everybody else. and said. \"What. no patronage?\" Because practically all of us had brought at least one friend from the home district. hoping to give him some kind of an appointment down here. either as a policeman. or to run an elevator. or something of that kind. Well. as it happened. we had a chairman. and I presume they have the same kind of setup today. and this chairman announced to all of us. we new Members. \"Unfortunately. there are no patronage jobs available.\" As a matter of fact. we found out later he had seven of his own. But that did not help us any. Fortunately. they did. later on. recognize the man I brought with me from San Diego. and he was put in the document room. and there he served with distinction for over 30 years. and he has just recently been retired.

I introduce for printing and appropriate referenqe a bill to cancel any indebtedness for excess leave of. a serviceman who is killed in. action. . introduced the same 1i.as S. 4099.on July 17 of last year. and my .introductory statement appears on page. 24821 of theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD of that day. The situatibn which prompted the bill is one which I believe needs legislative correction. It involves an IOwa serviceman who had used 9 days more leave than ie was entitled to. When he was subsequently killed in action in Vietnam. his final paycheck was reduced to recoup the excess leave. The money involved is not really Important. itis theprinciple of the matter. To make such i deduction amounts almost to an insilt to the surviving family of the serviceman. Under the present law. the Secretary of the Army has the authority- to cancel an enlisted members indebtedness to the United States. However. the Comptroller General has ruled that this authority may be exercised only as to a member who is on active duty and it may not be used for the remission or cancellation of anenlistedmans indebtedness to the Government after his status as an enlisted nian has terminated upon his death. The bill I am introducing would simply i!6vide that a setoff may not be made against an amount for. pay and allowances due . serviceman who is killed by enemy action. This bill would be retroactive to January 1. 1964. which reflects Executive COrder 11216 by which President Johnson designated Vietnam and the waters adjacent thereto as a combat zone for the purposes of section 112 of the Inkrterial Revenue Code. .The bill.covers only servicemen killed by \"hostile action.\" It. has been suggested that it ought to be expanded to cover those deaths by nonhostile action also. I have considered this point but have decided to leave the bill as originally introduced. There might be some situations where it would seem equitable to cover a serviceman who dies by nonhostile means.I can also think of situations wherethis Would not be equitable. I do believe. however. -that the Armed Services Committee might wish to explore this particular point. I urge that prompt consideration be given to this measure.

The District of Columbia. like almost all major American cities. faces both an immediate and a longrange fiscal crisis. To help meet the great and growing gap between local revenues and necessary expenditures. my bill proposes an automatic annual Federal payment to the District. pegged at 30 percent of general local revenues and miscellaneous receipts for fiscal 1973. 31 percent for fiscal 1974. 32 percent for fiscal 1975. 33 percent for fiscal 1976. 34 percent for fiscal 1977. and 35 percent for fiscal 1978 and thereafter. Through this escalator approach. the District would be assured of rising Federal support during the next 5 years. until the citys own tax base can be strengthened and such national programs as revenue sharing can be established. To meet the capital outlay needs of the District. my bill incorporates the Presidents proposal for public works bonds with a Federal interest subsidy. and for capital grants to the District for higher education. The central theme of this bill. of course. is effective selfgovernment for the people of the District of Columbia. President Nixon declared in his message to Congress on the Nations Capital: One of my most pressing goals for this Nation is to place local functions under local control. and to equip local governments with the authority and the resources they need in order to serve their communities well. Home rule for Washington is fully consistent with that overall objective. As the Congress and the Commission on the Organization of the Government of the District of Columbia seek ways to make the District of Columbia government more efficient. we should also work toward making it more democratic. I. therefore. introduce this bill to reemphasize my personal commitment to that goal. and to promote informed discussion of alternatives within Congress and the community. ExnBrr 1",

I propose to exempt $208 per month from benefit reduction. Our retired citizens. perhaps more than others. are suffering from the pains of inflation and recession. My bill will ease the economic crisis for retired people and encourage many talented retirees to seek work that will supplement their pension income. The retired man or woman who works and earns a little money is penalized with reductions in social security payments. I think it only fair that we encourage senior citizens to work and that we remove the unreasonable limitation on the amount one can earn without reduction in payments. My bill raises the limitation ceiling to a more realistic level and offers the kind of incentive required to encourage active healthy citizens to continue working on a parttime basis. At this time. I also introduce a bill to amend the Social Security Act to increase from $70.40 to $100 the minimum monthly insurance benefit payable thereunder. As the Members of this body know. we passed a social security bill during the closing days of the last Congress providing for the $100 minimum payment. Unfortunately. this measure died last year.

On March 29. the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service started public hearings on several bills designed to establish a new wage board pay system.

The steamboats were specially designed. with very narrow beam and a paddle wheel set inboard so as not to scrape against the bank when rounding the sharp bends in the Oklawaha River. Part of the trip involved an aweinspiring voyage at night with the jungle lighted fantastically by fatwood fires burning in iron baskets slung out from the boats forecastle. The exotic beauty of the cruise called forth extravagant praise from a number of famous people. including Gen. U. S. Grant. Harriet Beecher Stowe. William Cullen Bryant. and Lafcadio Hearn.

They called the river \"OckliWaha.\" the Great River. Perhaps conservationists are the spiritual kin of those long gone Indians. for they too feel it is a \"great river.\" Some strongly suspect that Charlie Brown might even give up kite flying to save the Oklawaha and its beautiful forested valley. -D.B.C.",

Cleon Skousen. author. lecturer. teacher. former law enforcement officer. and former FBI agent. among other related professions. and author of the best seller. \"The Naked Communist.\" has now written his latest contribution to thinking Americans who want to understand the intricacies of the Communist conspiracy and remain free.

A descendent of a noted frontier Texas family. she lived a full life which. among other things. was devoted to the preservation of frontier history. In that respect she was preeminent. Except for her alertness and dedication many significant names and events. which figured prominently in the history of the Southwest. would have gone unrecorded. Her contributions was truly invaluable. While her pen has been stilled and her voice silenced by death. both the spirit and the writings of Florence Fenley will live on and on. to be read and enjoyed by generations of the future. Florence Fenley was a woman of the soil. of the sagebrush. of remote spots in the brush country. about which she wrote so brilliantly. She knew the smell of saddle leather. the loneliness of the coyotes howl. the crackle of the campfire. the cowboys yodel. and the sacrifices and heroism of those stalwart people who braved the frontier. Her firsthand knowledge of hitherto unrecorded events seemed inexhaustible. This distinguished lady left her mark indelibly. But she is gone and thousands will mourn her passing and revere her memory. To me she was a valued personal friend. to be remembered for her strong character. her warmth and her delightful personality. Above all. she was a truly great American. who loved her country and its institutions. She typified the very best in womanhood and the finest of oldfashioned patriotism. She was a part and parcel of the community where she lived. and dedicated her everyday life to the wellbeing of her friends and associates.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in a little while the Senate will vote on the Presidents reorganization plan. The proposed reorganization would combine a number of volunteer organizations into one organization called Action. I support that reorganization. It would mean less confusion. more efficiency. and a better operation for the general public as well as those who partake in its services. I might mention one change which particularly appeals to me. The VISTA program at the present time usually results in having people desirous of serving going to some distant point and attempting to help disadvantaged people there. Oftentimes it ends in friction. the volunteers are not accepted. and the accomplishment falls far short of the aim. Under this new reorganization plan. the program will involve the local people. the States. and the localities. the universities and colleges right in the State where the Action people will serve. I think that would be a great step forward. It would bring this activity closer to the! people. The people in a given State would direct their project. rather than having it subjected to the criticisms that are now voiced toward the VISTA program. It was at the University of Nebraska last fall that President Nixon. in addressing the student body on many of the problems of the future. outlined this program of reorganization. It has met with enthusiasm. among not only young people but colleges and universities. State Governors. and others. because they would like to see more for their money. and they would like to see these volunteer activities be subject to local control. In my opinion. a vote to support the reorganization is a vote for local control of the operation of these projects. as contrasted with what we have now in such programs as VISTA. Mr. President.

That does not change the constitutional mandate. or the denial on account of race. or busing on account of race. Let us get back to fundamentals. That is what we have left. In leaving that fundamental right in the Constitution. we do not need any constitutional amendment. Someone should put in the 14th amendment as a statute and see if we can pass it. No one should be denied the benefits of the Constitution. Once the Court leaves to the legislative branch the proper administration of the schools. once the money is given. not for busing but for building better schools and facilities. we will be able to solve this problem.

Mr. President. the Supreme Court says that notwithstanding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides thatNo court shall order the transportation of students to overcome racial imbalance. The court said further: The legislative history of Title IV indicates that Congress was concerned that the Act might be read as creating a right of action under the Fourteenth Amendment in the situation of socalled \"de facto segregation\". where racial imbalance exists In the schools but with no showing that this was brought about by discriminatory action of state authorities. In short. there is nothing in the Act which provides us material assistance In answering the question of remedy for stateimposed segregation In violation of Brown I. The basis of our decision must be the prohibition of the. Fourteenth Amendment that no State shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Mr. President. what do those words mean? They mean that the court held that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied only to de facto segregation. In other words. the Supreme Court of the United States held in the Swann case. which has been extolled here. that Members of Congress were such asses that they passed a law to regulate something they had no constitutional power to regulate. and did not intend to pass a law to regulate the only thing they had the constitutional power to regulate.

The loss was also the keener because it was so totally unexpected. at least for those of us who were working closely with Salvatore up until just a few weeks ago. Because of my position on the Ways and Means Committee I probably had opportunity to work more closely with Salvatore than would be the case with most Members of the serious economic problems facing this Nation and the State of Massachusetts in particular. It was always a comfort to have the unswerving support of such a longtime crusader for industrial and economic justice as Salvatore Camelio in your comer. If the effectiveness of the head of the most important organization representing a key sector of the economy such as labor is measured at least in part. by the degree of rapport such a leader has with leaders in other segments of society. such as the political field. then Salvatore Camelio has to be ranked as one of the most effective spokesmen and leaders of organized labor we have had in Massachusetts. In a real sense. both the body politic and the economic life in Massachusetts will be that much poorer without the active participation of this great man.

Congressman Moss. it was reinstated 2 months ago and came to the floor of the House under the suspension of rules procedure which required a twothirds vote for passage and without the privilege of amendments on the legislation. Last year we were in violation of the Federal law. but through the good graces of Secretpry of Transportation Volpe we were allowed exemptions pending the consideration of this legislation. Six counties in the Evansville area of Congressman ROGER ZION were affected similar to six counties in northwest Indiana. including my district and parts of Congressman LANDGREBES district. Both Congressman ZION and Congressman LANDGREBE. along with Congressman ROUSH and the other members of the Indiana delegation collaborated in winning this great victory for our affected areas caused by the split time zone in the State of Indiana.

The bill was considered by the committee together with a similar bill which had passed the House of Representatives. H.R. 13361. and the Senate bill has now been substituted for the House language. I would simply point out that at the time the House Committee on Agriculture was holding hearings on this subject. I did go over and testify. on February 8. because I was concerned that one of the bills before that committee included burley tobacco. That bill. which was not approved. would have permitted leasing of quotas across county lines. and would even have permitted the sale of tobacco allotmentswhich I have consistently opposed. I was assured at that time by the distinguished chairman of the Tobacco Subcommittee. Congressman .WAT ABBITT. that the committee did not intend to change the burley program in any way. and would not approve the sale of tobacco allotments or transfers across county lines. Since that time. Congressman WATKINS ABBITT. chairman of the House Subcommittee on Tobacco. has announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection. He will be greatly missed. for no Member of the other body has been more stalwart in representing the interests of rural areas and tobacco producers. his knowledge and long experience have been valuable to all of us. The bill before the Senate today permits the leasing of Fluecured tobacco quotas throughout the marketing year. rather than requiring that any leasing be made before planting time. In this respect the bill extends to Fluecured tobacco the same procedure already being followed in burley tobacco. under the poundage program enacted last year.

The boundary proposed in my bill generally would include the land surrounding Lone Peak southeast of Salt Lake City in the Wasatch range.

It is a beautiful wild area and is adjacent to the heavily populated towns and cities of the Wasatch Front where 70 percent of Utahs population resides. It is so close to city dwellers that it is within reach of everyone seeking a wilderness experience. There is considerable interest in Utah in the establishment of the Lone Peak Wilderness Area. Some conservation groups in the State want a much larger area set aside. My purpose in introducing the bill is to have a vehicle for hearings in Salt Lake City where various interests can be heard and all aspects of the proposal examined carefully.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation which would require the Federal Government to withhold city income taxes from its employees. This legislation would benefit directly hundreds of thousands of Federal workers. Because local income taxes are not withheld from the wages of Federal employees. these workers are forced to pay the taxes in lump sums on a quarterly or annual basis. The obligation to pay a substantial amount in local taxes at one time presents a serious hardship to many Federal workers. One third of Clevelands postal workers have not been able to meet this obligation. and now owe the city hundreds of dollars per person in back taxes. This legislation would allow Federal workers to pay their city taxes in the same convenient manner as other workers. by making the payments in even installments throughout the year. The legislation would also provide some extra money for the cities. Because the cities tax collection departments will no longer have to devote extra attention to Federal workers. administrative costs will decrease. In my own State of Ohio. the cities of Akron. Columbus. and Toledo expect that they could each save $20.000 to $35.000 in this manner. The major new source of income. however. would occur as a result of a reduction in tax delinquencies and an increase in the cities ability to collect delinquent taxes. Clevelands tax department estimates that because of fewer losses in uncollected taxes. the citys income could be increased by $300.000 to $400.000. The city of Cincinnati expects the enactment of this bill to save its taxpayers about $100.000. Similar savings would be realized by cities in other States. The measure would apply to cities which have 200 or more Federal employees. In addition. the Secretary of the Treasury would have the discretion to apply it to other cities where he feels that its potential benefits outweigh the expenses to be incurred by the Federal Government.

Because of the deteriorated and bad logistical situation of our Nation. it Is my contention that our Nation is very highly vulnerable. At this very moment in Cuban waters there is a Russian nuclear submarine that does not even have to surface to send off a multiple warhead reentry vehicle that could send out as much as two megatons of destructive material throughout this country. either at will. or on thoroughly good planning or welldefined instructions. In February. we had the occasion of a false emergency signal in the Nation. Radio stations and television stations suddenly received a national alert. They did not know what was going to happen. so they just followed instructions. The television station in my area did not know What to do. and they did not know whether to go off the air or what. So they went to this little box that they were supposed to open only in the case of this kind of an emergency alert. They opened the box and saw the instructions. It said. \"Open envelope.\" They opened the envelope and it said. \"Wait until further instructions.\" Suppose that had been a real emergency? Our country at this time. in my opinion. is vulnerable. I am not in a position to be knowledgeable at this particular point to say that I would know what amendment to offer so as to bring about what we need.

Harold Byrd. the former Mattie Caruth. was a civic leader and philanthropist whose leadership and presence will be sorely missed in our city. She was a patron of the arts and in business was chairman of two major corporations. Mattie was the granddaughter of William Caruth who owned a plantation just north of present day downtown Dallas. Much of University Park is built on land once owned by Mattie Caruth Byrds family and the sensational new shopping development. North Park. is located on land leased from the family. Her father contributed the land for Southern Methodist University. In 1935. she married Brig. Gen. D. Harold Byrd. a successful oilman who began as an oilfleld roughneck in 1918. Mrs. Byrd had two sons. David Harold Byrd. Jr.. and Caruth Clark Byrd. As a patron of the arts. Mrs. Byrd commissioned a 124foot long painting of more than 200 personalities of the Bible for her church. the First Presbyterian Church of Dallas. The mural depicts the coming of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. It is reported to have cost in excess of $500.000. Mrs. Byrd traveled widely and during her travels acquired a collection of oriental antiques which is considered to be one of the best of any private citizen in the West. Always active in the business interests of her family. Mrs. Byrd held corporate posts and directorships in various Dallas business enterprises. Her activities and memberships included the Colonial Dames of America. Daughters of the American Revolution. Daughters of the Republic of Texas. the Dallas Womens Club and the Dallas Garden Club.

I am afraid that most of us would immediately confess that it is an exceedingly complex problem. I think. though. that a bipartisan group in this Congress is today offering at least part of the answer. You have before you our amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. We propose a very simple thingto open up many. many new foreign markets for American agricultural and industrial products. Essentially. this will be done by offering the American businessman \"free\" access to these new markets by paying his import duty expenses with Americanowned foreign currency. He must agree to pass his savings along to his ultimate customer. thus making his product more competitive on the world market. We are talking about the utilization of some $30 billion in Americanheld foreign currencies. Foreign import duties average about 10 percent and at that rate. we can afford to finance about $300 billion worth of American exports over the coming years. New markets trigger a classic economic cycle. As our exports rise. we will in turn need increased raw materials from many of the developing nations. With this additional foreign exchange. they will turn to American business for goods to speed their development. You can readily see that the U.S. Governments initial investment would be repaid in the form of increased U.S. tax revenues. More important to my friends back home is the sure knowledge that the local economy will receive a tremendous boost from the creation of new jobs and the raise in corporate profits which will result.",

VicePresident Spiro Agnew chose Des Molnes to start his campaign against the \"Eastern establishment press.\" \"liberal\" TV network news broadcasters and other imagined enemies of the Nixon Administration. Earl Butz. the new secretary of agriculture. who seems to be taking a leaf from Agnews book. came to Des Moines to the Farm Institute to attack some of the same targets. If Butz had confined himself to blaming the press (he called it the \"Eastern establishment press\"). nobody would have thought much about it. After all. that Isnt very original. Every politician blames journalism once in awhile. and politicians with the weakest arguments do it practically all the time. But Butz didnt stop with the press. He repeated his attacks on labor unions for the dock strikes and seemed to be blaming the strikers for all the troubles facing farmers. Prices of corn and soybeans. the leading export crops. have declined in the last several months. The obvious reason was the huge 1971 crops. Of course transportation strikes ought to be ended. and we favor the Presidents bill to establish an arbitration procedure for stopping crippling tieups. But it is deceptive to place as much emphasis as Butz does on the dock strike as a cause of lower prices.",

Prices have not fallen more than would be expected if there had not been a dock strike holding up export movement of grain. This is not guesswork but based on the longestablished relationship between corn supplies and prices. Market prices now are around $1.05 a bushel in central Iowa. which is not out of line with a 5.5million bushel corn crop and an Increase in total feed grain supplies of 15 per cent above a year ago. Prices averaged $1.40 a year ago with a crop of 4.1billion bushels. If. however. prices of corn and soybeans were thought to be too low because of the dock strike. the Butz Department of Agriculture had a remedy at hand.

During the course of the years. the Baltic peoples have suffered for centuries from the \"accident of geography.\" From the West they were invaded by the Teutonic Knights. and from the East by the Russians. The remarkable spiritual and ethnic strength which has been essential over the centuries for the survival of the Baltic States is still very much alive today. This vitality is reflected in the Baltic peoples eontinued resistance to their Soviet oppression. Although armed guerrilla warfare ended in 1952. nonviolent resistance continues still. This same dedication to the ideals of freedom is reflected today in our own citizens of Baltic extraction as well. Their worthy contributions to the American way of life are well known.

First. the amendment offered by the gentleman goes far beyond the language of H.R. 13120. which modifies the par value of the dollar with respect to gold. The gentleman proposes to amend the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. which is not contemplated to be changed by the bill we have before us. Of course. both propositions are related to gold. but it is well established that two subjects are not necessarily germane because they are related. As is recorded in Cannons Precedents of the House. volume VIII. section 2965. where an amendment is more than an amplification. and brings in additional subject matter. it is not germane. Most recently. on February 23. 1972. the Chair ruled an amendment was not germane on the basis that there was no reference in the pending legislation to the provisions of the act to which the amendment referred. Second. on more general grounds. this proposal is nongermane because it is not related to the fundamental purpose of the bill before us. The scope -of this bill is quite narrow: it modifies the par value of the dollar from one thirtyfifth of a fine troy ounce of gold to one thirtyeighth of a fine troy ounce of gold. The purpose of the legislation is simply for the Congress to give its formal consent to the Presidents action taken to change the par value of the dollar. as required. by section 5. of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act. The gentlemans proposed amendment would clearly depart from this purpose and embark upon a new pursuitthat of the rights of U.S. citizens to own. buy. or sell gold. In the gentlemans individual views in the committee report. he has characterized his objective as a question of individual rights and freedoms rather than one of monetary policy and operations. Indeed. he has implied that the restoration of this right would not alter our economic situation. I shall not speak to the substantive merits of the amendment. but only insist that the purpose and content of the gentlemans proposal differs so substantially from that of the legislation before the House as to make it nongermane.

I have reported this bill on behalf of the Senate Commerce Committee which held hearings on the bill last June 22. The bill was unanimously recommended by the full committee in executive session on September 15. The bill was redrafted with substantial revisions by the Department of Commerce and the other governmental agencies concerned. It is the product of Intense effort by a large number of people. The bill is designed to prohibit the use of vessels obtained at auction under a repurchase program by the CanLdian Government. This program is carried out particularly in British Columbia. Under this program excess boats are repurchased by the Canadian Government at a fair market price. then resold at auction for a fraction of their original purchase price. A large number of them are inundating the Western American fisheries at the present time. Fishermen. however. throughout the Northern States on both coasts are concerned. At least four auctions have been held this year and several hundred boats have been put on the block. More auctions are scheduled and at least 850 boats will be sold eventually. This is a most serious problem requiring immediate attention by Congress. I particularly appreciate the prompt reporting of this bill favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee and hope that this body will move rapidly to pass this bill. I am informed that the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee has already held hearings on this bill. I hope that the House of Representatives will act equally rapidly.

The resolutions at their annual conventions have gained a reputation for thoughtful consideration of major issues facing this country. At the 54th annual national convention of the American Legion. the Legionnaires endorsed many resolutions. but there is one in particular that I would like to single out at this time for Its concise statement of a complicated problem. This is resolution 280 on the Panama Canal. As is evident from the daily press. the present Government of the Republic of Panama is more and more directly threatening U.S. rights in the Zone. They are attempting to diminish or even abrogate an agreement freely arrived at in 1903. and reaffirmed in 1936 and 1955. The American Legion resolution. therefore. is extremely timely. Among other things. it points out: First. Under the 1903 treaty with Panama. the United States obtained a grant in perpetuity of the use. occupation. and control of the Canal Zone territory with all sovereign rights. to the exclusion of any such rights by Panama. Second. The United States has an overriding national security interest In maintaining undiluted control over the Canal Zone and Canal and its treaties September. 28. 19.72. with Great Britain and Columbia for the efficient operation of the Canal. Mr. President. these and other overriding factors have led the American Legion to an inescapable conclusion. The Legion reiterates \"Its uncompromising opposition to any new treaties or executive agreements with Panama that would in any way reduce our indispensaable soverei&n control over the Panama Canal or the Panama Canal Zone.\" The Legion further goes on record against the proposals for a socalled sealevel canal. with all its attendant pitfalls. I congratulate the American Legion for displaying such wisdom and effort in the public interest. It is typical of the Legion to be so farsighted. . Mr. President.

As well as providing $20 million from the highway trust fund for Federal aid highway projects in Alaska in 1974 and 1975 and authorizing nearly $59 million for reconstructing portions of the Alaska Highway. the bill will authorize for the first time $75 million in 1974 and $100 million in 1975 for Indian reservation roads and bridges. The definition of \"Indian roads and bridges\" is modified so that Alaska Native villages will be eligible for funding under chapter II of title 23. This authorizes Federal assistance for nonFederal aid highways. The importance of these authorizations for Indian reservation roads and bridges and the expanded definition of this term can best be illustrated by two pieces of correspondence I received a few days ago from Mr. John Sackett. president of the Tanana Chiefs Conference. Mr. Sacketts letter and the enclosure from Mr. B. A. Campbell. commissioner of the Alaska Department of Highways. graphically illustrate the plight of the village of Tetlin. The State of Alaska cannot fund a road to connect Tetlin to the Alaska Highway. Only if this provision remains in S. 3939 will Tetlin be authorized for Federal funds. The Senate wisely passed the bill with this section intact. I urge the passage of this portion of the bill by the House when it takes up the legislation. Once these funds are authorized and the money appropriated. the people of Tetlin and countless other Alaskan villages as well as other Indian reservations across the country will have vastly improved communications with the outside world.

There appears to be two possible routes that could be considered for a road. One would parallel the Tetlin and Tanana Rivers. connecting with the Alaska Highway midway between Tok and Tetlin Junction. This would avoid building any major structures but would be approximately 17 miles in length. The other route would be more direct. paralleling the Tetlin River. crossing the Tanana River just below its confluence with the Tetlin River and connecting with the Alaska Highway west of Midway Lake. This latter route would require a major structure across the Tanana River. Rough estimates have put the cost of either route between $2.000.000 and $3.000.000. At the present time the only highway funds available for village roads are those made available under the Local Service Roads and Trails Program. Funds available under this program are allocated on a population and area basis and there are not sufficient funds available for a project of this magnitude. However. we understand that federal legislation has been Introduced which would allow more latitude in use of BIA road funds.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. once again it is the season for economic forecasts. What is encouraging is that virtually all economists expect 1972 to be a very good year. In a recent issue. Business Week magazine listed 26 economic projections for 1972 by private economists and seven economic projections resulting from the use of wellknown econometric models. The consensus of this group was that 1972 gross national product would approximate $1.148 billion. an increase of almost $100 billion over 1971. This is an increase of approximately 9 percent over 1971 GNP. Of this 9 percent. approximately 5.7 percent would be real growth and 3.4 percent would constitute price increases. According to Business Week. these forecasters attribute their optimism to several factors. many of which stem from President Nixons vigorous and farreaching economic initiatives during 1971. Some factors mentioned include the dollar devaluation. wage and price controls and tax reductions. This agreement among private economic forecasters and econometric models is shared by the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers. In this months report by the Council to the President. the Council predicted that GNP would probably increase in 1972 by about $100 billion. compared with an increase of about $75 billion In 1971. The CEA predicted further that the real increase in output would be about 6 percent and the increase in prices would be about 31/4 percent. This prediction is very close to the consensus of the private forecasters. In support of its prediction. the Council listed several factors. including probable increased business inventory investments and U.S. net exports. and increases in Federal Government purchases during 1972. Mr. Speaker. I think that we should be most encouraged by this optimism and near unanimity of agreement among both public and private economists as to our probable economic performance during 1972.",

Forand. who died Those of us who shared Aimes concern know how long and hard he worked over the years for medicare. We know of his tireless and taxing efforts for medicare and other \"people\" legislation. We know how well he represented his people of the First District of Rhode Island. along with all other Americans who were the \"havenots.\" Today. many words will be entered into the RECORD in praise of this great and good man. But I think we owe Aime Forand still a greater tributethis is to continue the great work he started. I feel sure if Aime was among us today he would be grossly dissatisfied with the state of our national health delivery system. Despite the immeasurable benefits that medicare has broughtand I am certainly not belittling themit is incongruous that in the richest Nation in the world. hundreds of thousands of our citizensincluding many childrendie each year. because they either cannot afford the high cost of medical care or it is just not available for them where they live. And anyone who believes that our medical insurance system is adequate just has not experienced illness recently. Our late colleague Alme Forand started this Nation on the correct direction for adequate medical attention for all. We can best pay tribute to his memory by pledging to continue the fight he startedto pledge to ourselves and each other today that we will not rest until the people of the United States have the medical attention they deserve at prices they can afford to pay.",

He was born in Massachusetts. educated in the parochial schools. served in World War I in Europe. was a successful reporter in the news media in Rhode Island. and had served as secretary to two different former Members of Congress from Rhode Island.

He viewed that which became known as medicare as a socialwelfarehealth measure. I viewed it as a way in which the average American could protect his savings and protect himself against unknown. possibly devastating. medical bills in his retirement. I am proud to know that. while most of his life was spent as a citizen and a Congressman from the great State of Rhode Island. Aime Forand. by birth. was a native of Massachusetts. His understanding of the problems of the less fortunate commenced at the age of 14. At that time. as one of 16 children whose father had gone blind. he became a mill laborer to help support his family. This meant that he had to quit school in the seventh grade. It did not mean. however. that his education ceased. He continued itin night school and. later. through Columbia University correspondence courses. Aime Forand knew well the meaning of hardship and sacrifice. and working his way up the ladder under the American system of competitive opportunity. and its rewards. He also knew the sting of momentary defeat. and the joy of fighting back to ultimate victory. In short. his determination was strong. his dedication deep. his service outstanding. his contributions many.

Boating accidents often involve a chain of avoidable circumstances which include the boatman. the boat and its equipment. and the environment in which the boat operates. Operator fault is most often considered as the principal cause of boating accidents. since the boatman is the last person who can avoid an accident. But by breaking the chain of contributing events. accidents can be avoided and their consequences reduced. A major part of a balanced program is education. The boatman must know safety rules and his responsibility to others for safe operation. Once he knows these responsibilities. effective enforcement is necessary to assure his continued awareness. Good engineering safety standards for his boat and its equipment will reduce the contribution of his boat to accidents. Finally. uptodate and pertinent environmental and weather information will help him to avoid circumstances which are dangerous. Taken together. these four points offer a balanced and effective boating safety program. This bill provides incentives for greatly increased state enforcement and education programs. and broad authority to establish required engineering safety standards. I urge your support.",

An instrument or mechanical failure may have been at fault. but in all probability. the investigation will disclose the pilot was attempting a belowminimum landing. The statements which appeared in the press indicated that perhaps this accident would not have occurred if an instrument landing system had been installed. and this further disturibs me. This gives the impression that by merely spending millions of dollars at airports around the country these horrible accidents could be eliminated. Unfortunately this is not the case. As long as pilots continue to disregard minimum requirements and as long as they attempt landings below these requirements. these tragic accidents will continue to occur. I recently wrote to the Department of Transportation concerning this matter. and have now received a reply from Mr. Shaffer. the Administrator of Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA is hard at work on this problem and should be congratulated on the development of a system which will expose the pilot who disregards the rules. thereby bringing about greater safety to the general commercial air traveling public.

Most of the legislation introduced to date has had a broad scope. targeted at national and local elections. for President. Senators. and Congressmen. It is my opinion that my colleagues and I. as Members of the House of Representatives. should set our own spending and disclosure policies. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I have introduced H.R. 7299. the \"Campaign Expenditure Disclosure Act of 1971.\" a bill designed specifically for campaign spending disclosure and limitation in the House of Representatives. This act. presently being considered by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. of which I am a member. has three parts. I will mention them briefly today and discuss them fully in subsequent weeks.First and most importantly. my bill provides for full and complete disclosure of any campaign contributionspublic or privatein the amount of over $10. There will be two reporting dates10 days before the election and 28 days after the election. This will insure each candidate sufficient time to assemble and submit complete and thorough reports. Second. my bill would place a limit of $100.000 on the amount any candidate may spend in a general election. There is to be no stipulation on how this money is to be spent. Finally my bill provides for the establishment of a Registry of Election Finance. attached to the General Accounting Office. to be responsible for keeping financial records of elections and making them available to the public on demand. Further. the bill provides for each candidate to designate one bank within his State as the campaign depository to hold. register. and record all campaign funds. My bill also includes stiff penalties for failure to comply with any of the above provisions. Mr. Speaker. it is important that the House act as swiftly as possible to enact campaign spending limitations. We all know too well how expensive the last two elections have been to all parties involved. and how expensive future elections will be if we do not act promptly. Mr. Speaker. I earnestly believe that if the House of Representatives passes a campaign spending bill. responsive to its own particular characteristics and needs. it will set a strong and positive example to the Nation. proving that Government is a servant of the Nation. capable of honorably policing its own affairs.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. to cite Dr. Frank Stanton for contempt of Congress is a direct challenge to the first amendments longstanding protection of press freedom. The House should reject the charge for several reasons. First. there mulst be a clear and compelling national interest which cannot be served by any other alternative before a congressional subcommittee can demand to see a reporters notes. Certainly there is not such national interest involved in \"The Selling of the Pentagon.\" This principle was reaffirmed last yeas in the decision on Caldwell against United States. Second. the grounds cited by the subcomnittee are insufficient to support the charge of contempt of Congress. In support of its subpena. the subcommittee contends that although a reporters notes cannot be reached by subpena. as stated in Caldwell against United States. unused film outtakes can. since they \"pertain to actual events\" and are \"not the private thoughts of the reporter.\" However. outtakes are in fact televisions counterpart to a reporters notes. A film interview is constitutionally undistinguishable from an interview in which a reporter makes his own written notes or uses a recording device. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the first amendment prohibits compulsory disclosure of confidential associations and private communications obtained in a context analogous to a newsmans situation. These decisions have placed the broadcast and print journalists on precisely the same footing. Whatever the test applied. the general rule is that the first amendment protects a newsmans sources and notes from compulsory disclosure by a court. Congress or any other investigating agency. The first amendment provides broadcasters with the same protection as other forms of the press. And this protection is sufficient grounds to reject the charge of contempt and withdraw the subpena.",

I conducted hearings in the cities of Woonsocket and Providence on the problems confronting older Americans in Rhode Island. At those hearings. Rhode Island senior citizens presented moving and compelling testimony on the need for a substantial increase in social security benefits. Partly as a result of those hearings. I cosponsored the amendment to provide a 20percent increase in benefits. There are those. Mr. President. who believe our senior citizens should wait a bit longer for this overdue adjustment of benefits. I disagree. Lockheed was not asked to wait a little longer when it faced bankruptcy. the PennCentral was not asked to wait a little longer when they asked for help. They got help. and they got help promptly. Our senior citizens need help. and they need it now.",

I am among the strongest advocates of this legislation and voted .for it when it reached the House floor last Thursday evening. As you know. the most urgent provision of the bill provides the necessary funds to allow the summer feeding program for underprivileged children to continue and expand. Almost 1.160.000 children now benefit from the breakfast program. Under the provisions of the extension bill. the number will climb rapidly to 2.200.000 before the year is out. Still further. Mr. Speaker. the bill removes the limitations on the amounts that can be appropriated to expand the school. breakfast program. and. going even one step further. it explicitly clarifies every schools eligibility for the program. All needy children will participate no matter what kind of school they attend. .The legislation is one of many landmarks throughout the history of the school feeding program. The Federal Government first recognized the need for a. national school lunch program in the 1930s. At that time only cafeteria workers. salaries were provided. In 1946. we witnessed the passage of the National School Lunch Act which provided cash and commodities for school lunches. Thirty. years ago. this act provided a broad *program to provide nutritious lunches to every Ameican schoolchild. It was a broad program but not generous enough to meet our cirrent needs. More recentlyin fact. in 1966--the NSLA was amended to provide money for breakfast programs and luncheon equipment. I cite these facts to show that historically we have made great headway toward the goal of providing for our Nations children. Last week we passed another amendment to bring us closer to that goal. Our authorization amendment of H.R. 14896 requires a breakfast program to be instituted in every school that applied for it.",

An increase in social security benefits is long overdue and I earlier cosponsored legislation to provide for a 20percent increase. I oppose any motion to reduce the increase to 10 percent. because such an increase simply is not adequate to assist our senior citizens at this time. I am confident that the 20percent increase will be approved by a wide majority in this House. I regret that I will not be present for the rollcall vote when it occurs today. Several months ago. I accepted an invitation to be the main speaker in Buffalo on this date as 149 new U.S. citizens take their oath of allegiance in a Federal district court ceremony.

This percentage of salary contribution has been increasing over the years and further increases are provided. Rather than the present 5050 by the employer and the employee. it seems to me we should consider seriously making it an equal threeway setup. that is. onethird by the employee. onethird by the employer. and onethird by the Federal Government.

When one couples this pollution by city and industry to the damages to the eastern Mediterranean from changes in Nile flow caused by the Aswan Dam. there is cause for considerable alarm. All this pollution of one of the worlds true beauty spots is bad enough. However. what really shocks is the complete lack of any widespread recognition of how serious the problem really is.

Still. there must be some way. if not to solve at least to keep the great questions of the world before the peoplethe world of the future rather than the world of the past or the present ... I share Mr. Restons concern that we have not always kept these fundamental issues where they belonged. and I hope that as this Congress proceeds with its business. we will try harder to consider the impact of proposals on these three issues. So far. I am afraid. discussion of them has been largely obscured by what Mr. Reston calls \"the immediate questions and personalities.\" While these latter questions are certainly demanding of our utmost attention. it would seem that we may ultimately deal with them more effectively if we are able consistently to keep in mind the more fundamental issues as well.

Now I have pointed out the size of the deficit estimated for 1972 and that in 1968 the deficit was $28 billion. But there is a difference. In 1968 we had full employment. The war was going on and there were some 500.000 troops in Vietnam. We are now shifting our economy from war to peace. We have been winding down on the war in Vietnam. We do have a situation of unemployment and we have to do something about it. So an effort is now being made to submit a full employment budget based on 4 percent unemployment. But that condition did not exist in 1968 when inflation was running away because of large deficit spending. At that time we had full employment. Now. Mr. Speaker.

It is regrettable that we cannot get a better handle on this.

Although no hearings were ever held on this legislation or a related bill introduced by the Department of Transportation. I feel that the goal of this bill is such that I must reintroduce it. At a time when various modes of our transportation industry are undergoing radical changes and problems. we must start looking for new ways for better transportation. Proper legislation can help the transportation industry innovate new streamlined. more efficient methods of serving the public. There are many problems with regulations affecting freight shipments. The Equipment Interchange Act attempts to reach some of these difficulties. My bill would provide a way to expedite containerized shipments which utilize more than one mode of transportation. The bill would allow carriers of different classesrail. motor. water. and air. to obtain authority for agreements with a carrier or groups of carriers in another class on the interchange of cargo containers. highway trailers. and related intermodal equipment. This would include establishment of procedures to determine per diem rates on such interchange equipment and the controlling regulations. To assure that the agreements would not be subject to antitrust violations. the Equipment Interchange Act would grant immunity when such agreements were approved by a joint board composed of members each from the ICC. FMC. and the CAB. This approach would be a substantial step in simplifying our administrative proceedings on those transactions which cut across the lines of more than one regulatory agency.

The justices certainly did not intend to grant welfare benefits to illegal aliens. Mind you. I said illegal aliens. I am not referring to those who have entered this country through lawful means. Nevertheless. HEW has construed the decision to apply to illegal aliens. This amendment would merely require that. if that is done. then the agencies should report the illegal alien to the authorities. This would thus provide an additional method of detecting persons illegally in this country. In most areas of the country. the welfare rolls have grown so large that taxes can no longer support the number of people in poverty. Local communities have rebelled against further expansion of these payments. As a result. reduced benefits. in many cases. must be paid. In Texas and New York. for example. where substantial numbers of Illegal aliens may go on welfare. the problem is even more acute. In fact. it is depriving those who legitimately need welfare of a reasonable benefit. The thought that an offender of law can enjoy the benefits of this countrys largess is repugnant to the American taxpayer and really appears to be an invitation to the impoverished of the world to seek entry into this country by illegal means to either deprive an American of employment or to join the rolls of welfare recipients. It would not be a question of persons traveling to a welfare haven from State to State but from nation to nationan intolerable prospect that must be stopped immediately. As I remarked during debate. the illegal alien problem will not be solved by this bill alone. This amendment does provide yet another step further toward a solution. I hope that this amendment will prompt HEW and the other agencies to eliminate similar inconsistencies in the laws and regulations.",

They license them to do business and to do certain things. The question raised in my mind is whether we should set up a standard separate and apart from the States. I listened with interest to the reading from the almanac from the Parker School by the Senator from Massachusetts. It reminded me of a medical school that used to advertise over the radio from Mexico and it beamed all over the Southwest ready cures. I note that they have a big building down in Texas. so I am not at all sure that it might be related to it. But I also noted. in examining the book. that the first edition of it was back in 1951. This is 21 years ago. so I think perhaps the procedures may have been changed or modified over that period of time. My point is. I myself find it very difficult to explain to some why they are not covered under Federal legislation when the States see fit to license and regulate them.

This kind of study has been made ever since chiropractic came into existence and the medical associations have always found. in their view. that chiropractic had no value or. if any. very little. Thus. if we have another study made. even if done by the American Medical Association. I am sure they will find the same thing. But. again. I go on the findings of the judgment of thousands and thousands of people that they have received some help from chiropractic. That is the judgment of thousands of people. else they would not be practicing today or be licensed in the respective States. This debate has been going on for years. I recall in 1928. when I was a member of the State Legislature of Kentucky. I was one of the sponsors of a bill which permitted their licensing. So. year after year. we have gone through this kind of debate. For myself. I believe that the committee has reached a position which leaves it to the States in a narrow field and that to postpone it I do not think will accomplish anything.

A soundly conceived public works project is a tremendously valuable capital investment which will yield benefits year after year to the local area in which it is situated. In so doing it strengthens the Nation. When we can combine with that type of longrange value the additional shortrange value of desperately needed immediate economic aid. we are doing something doubly valuable. This is a crash program of Federal grant assistance to enable economically depressed areas to make public works facilities improvements needed to create lasting job opportunities. It is a concept which has proved sound and workable in other times of high unemployment. The district which I represent is heavily dependent upon the lumber and plywood industry. When there is a decline in housing starts. such as we have recently experienced. employment in southwestern Oregon is sharply affected. Although the homebuilding industry has begun to show signs of recovering. it will be a long time before many of the unemployed are back on payrolls. In the meantime. they are available for other work and their skills could be put to use on public works projects that this legislation would make possible. By enacting this needed legislation we will prime the labor pump. help depressed communities make permanent public improvements. and stimulate economic expansion.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. an accelerated public works program is the only one that creates employment opportunities directly and immediately. of all the resources in the repository of public policy designed to emulate unemployment. Such a program draws workers into gainful employment and releases them from the need to depend on unemployment compensation and relief. It strengthens their selfrespect. pride of work. and dignity In a society that continues to give them an opportunity to participate in useful functions. Payment under the Public Works Acceleration Act is for work accomplished. not for unemployed persons. The existing 6percent rate of unemployment clearly demonstrates that public works employment is needed to provide jobs and income for the far too many Americans who have fallen into unemployment because of the current economic decline. Therefore. the high rates of unemployment makes the need for this legislation abundantly clear. It will provide the funds to build needed public works in the communities of our country which are suffering from high rates of unemployment. Such public works construction will create needed jobs for many of our unemployed constituents. who desire work but who because of the current recession cannot find work. These jobs will bring monetary gains into our districts. and help prime the economy of our Nation to enable it to recover faster. The importance of the need for the Public Works Acceleration Act should not be underestimated. The citizen out of work cannot eat. clothe. and shelter his family on the administrations promises and experts predictions of economic recovery later this year. He needs and wants employment now. This legislation will provide employment for many of those now unemployed. I. therefore. ask all my colleagues to support the Public Works Acceleration Act. H.R. 5376.",

Unemployment is insidious and is destroying the pride and vigor of millions of Americans. We can now count 51/2 million Americans on the unemployed rolls. Factories are running at much less. than full capacity. And while these millions. of unemployed Americans are spending idle and unproductive hours. many of our communities are stagnating for want of public services. This bill will not solve all of the economic problems of this country. but it will contribute to the resolution of these ills and provide productive employment to hundreds of thousands of people whose talents are being wasted. In my own district public works programs could provide much .needed water and sewer systems. improved lighting. and aplethora of other much needed services. The problem of unemployment is cyclical and as the unemployment rolls in i community grows. tax revenues decline. and public services are the first area to feel the bite. The committee has spent long and fruitful hours in hammering out a bill that will greatly stimulate the economy and lessen the psychological -and physical effects of unemployment. The response to this bill has been overwhelming as is manifested by the fact that over 150 Members of this House have cosponsored it. We recognize the great need for this legislation as a substitute for Federal handouts and the dehumanizing aspects of such relief. The bill calls for much needed public services as a vehicle for providing work for these unemployed. Not busy work. as some would suggest. but essential projects utilizing the talents and skills of thousands of Americans who have spent dreary months in enforced idleness. I commend the committee for the excellent bill that is being considered today and I urge full support for this essential legislation.",

However. at that time I had no idea that the bill would come to the floor in a much modified condition and hooked on to the sectional Appalachian bill and the public works and economic development billa plan for more federalized control over the soverign States. In the public works acceleration bill I had cosponsored. the triggering clause was nondiscretionary and fixed at a rate of unemployment of at least 150 percent above the national average for the 2 preceding calendar years. The triggering phraseology of the Public Works Acceleration Act we are today considering is relegated to the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce and to the Secretary of Labor without clearcut guidelines. Furthermore. section 4 of the bill we are now entertaining contains a double standard in Federal contributions favoring projects in the State or local government which has \"exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity.\" This preferential type treatment to some areas over others was not in the propased bill and should not belong in any public works bill of national coverage. Likewise. the soughtafter appropriation of $950 million as a spurt to the economy has now been increased to $2 billion. Other definitions and limitations which were in H.R. 4402 have not only been omitted or watered down. but the entire thrust of the bill before us seems bent on delegating the entire authority to the discretion of members of the Cabinet. I disapprove of this and do not feel this is wise legislation or good law. I am interested in helping alleviate unemployment in critical areas. but not at the cost of more inflation. reincreasing the entire national debt and setting the stage for more bipartisan battles between the Congress and the executive branch.

At a time when several economic indicators are offering more optimistic outlooks for the future of our economy. we must strengthen and improve programs which will contribute to the growth we anticipate.

For that reason.

It was a great victory when the House by a substantial majority defeated the amendment to strike out title I of this legislation which would have emasculated at least 60 percent of the projects to be authorized under the provisions of this bill. Millions of American families are in desperate need as a result of the present administrations failure to combat the problems of unemployment and inflation.

It is estimated that this part of the public works legislation alone would create about 420.000 jobs.

The sad reality is that many students who graduate this Juneand others who will never reach graduation at allwill be barely able to read or even do simple arithmetic. These young people represent the failure of the public school systems and other institutions to meet their needs. they are the dropouts who have been \"pushed out\" along the way. In my view. one of the most exciting educational endeavors is a school housed in a renovated supermarket in the middle of Harlemwhere educational prospects have at best been dimwhich is making an effort to reach these pushouts and prepare them for college. Harlem Prep recognizes that the difference between the collegebound high school graduate and the \"pushout\" is often not ability. but motivation. As a testimony to the success of the schools philosophy. Harlem Prep recently graduated 116 former dropouts of all agesall with scholarships to colleges and universities in the United States and abroad. Mr. President. I read with pleasure in a recent article by Barbara Campbell. and published in the New York Times. that Harlem Prep has survived a financial crisis which threatened to close its doors this spring. I commend the students and faculty of Harlem Prep for their outstanding achievements. I ask unanimous consent that this encouraging article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. as the furor continues over the Pentagon papers and unreasoned recriminations continue to be leveled in connection with our involvement in Vietnam. I feel it would behoove all to restrain from making rash judgments based on inadequate data and inadequate research into this period of our Nations history. The Washington Post today published a column by Henry Owen devoted to this very point. In his column. entitled \"A Deadline for Declassification?\". Mr. Owen devotes his attention to the history of the publics view of the origins of each major conflict of this century. He states the publics view has been marked by three successive phases. The first phase is when the wartime official view is readily accepted. The second phase is when \"a spate\" of memoirs and other secret documents \"persuaded people -that it was largely the fault of their own wartime leaders.\" The third phase is when the professional historian \"showed the truth to be a lot more complicated than any of these devil theories would suggest.\" Mr. Owen points out that we are presently in the second stage of this sequence of historical events. The final analysis. more than likely. will be completely different. It is more than likely that the final analysis will be completely different. if history holds true to form. than the verdict currently being rendered by many who have chosen to twist what little information they have to fit the confines of their own unreasoned view of Vietnam. I have long advocated that history. and only history. can be the true judge of a nations actions. That is why it is so very important that all of us leave the final judgment of Vietnam to the historians. It can serve no purpose to make that judgment at this time when highly speculative impressions are running rampant. I ask unanimous consent that Henry Owens column be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last June 30 I reported to the Senate the status of the transcript of the Senates secret session on Laos which was held In that report I presented that the Committee on Foreign Relations had been informed on June 25 that a memorandum detailing the points of disagreement between the committee and the executive branch was being cleared within the executive branch prior to its presentation to the Secretary of State. Yesterday. Mr. Joseph Wolf. the Secretary of States designated representative for matters having to do with the Laos transcript. informed the committee staff that the memorandum in question had been cleared by the appropriate officials within the executive branch and was now awaiting action by the Secretary of State. Let us hope that the executive branch will agree to final publication of this transcript at an early date. The people of this country are entitled to know far more about U.S. operations in Laos. In the meanwhile. I have written to the Secretary of State in effort to secure additional background information regarding past and present U.S. financing of Thai troops in Laos. My request for this information was prompted by a public statement on U.S. financing of Thai troops made by the Department of State spokesman on the very afternoon of that Senate secret session. This statement contained specific assertions as to the origins. the nature. and the legality of U.S. financing of Thai troops in Laos. and my letter asks the Department of State to provide the Senate with the facts regarding the actions in question. so that the Senate can examine those facts and draw its own conclusions before voting additional funds for Laos. also before deciding whether a ceiling. such as the one I have proposed. should be placed on U.S. expenditures in Laos. I ask unanimous consent that my letter of June 29 to the Secretary be printed in the RECORD.",

The article makes the point that: What everyone must realize is that no system provides \"free\" care for the public. And thatThe public must pay for that care. whether the money comes out of the individuals pocket. is withheld frorm his paycheck for health insurance. is withheld from his paycheck for taxes. or is a part of the hidden costs of each product he buys.

    "speech": "Mr. President. Life magazine for July 2 has published. in the form of a book review written by Senator GEORGE MCGOVERN. a nostalgic view of life in the Dakotas. Reminiscing about his childhood on the prairie. Senator McGOVERN recalls: It was a hard life In a hard country. but our family not only endured those hardships. -it seemed to thrive on them. But the review also looks ahead and urges us to preserve \"the spirit of individualism that gives our Nation strength\" especially by making \"life in rural America attractive to young Americans.\" Here is an eloquent appeal for the preservation of our family farms and our small townsin short. those places in America where a sense of community is the strongest. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent .that Senator MCGOVERNS review be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently I expressed my strong opposition to proposals advanced by the Nixon administration to license the recreational use of public lands by the American people. through the sale of annual. individual permits. In my opinion. this plan is no more than a proposal for dogtagging the American camping public. In reaction to my statements in opposition to the plan. I have received many letters of encouragement and support from concerned Idahoans. One letter. which I feel is representative of the strong feelings expressed by those who have written me. was sent by Mr. Edward C. Herr of Grangeville. Idaho. Mr. Herrs letter is excellent and points out in no uncertain terms the sentiment of the people of my State in opposition to this new proposal. I commend Mr. Herrs letter to the attention of the Senate and ask that it appear at this point in the RECORD.",
