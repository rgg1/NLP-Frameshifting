He says. also. that we are attempting to undercut the committee system. The distinguished Senator from Alabama knows better than that. He knows that the committees are the servants of the Senate as a whole. and the Senate as a whole is now and has been and will be. if need be. considering this measure. After all. when we think of committees. we think of them as the creatures and the servants of the Senate. They are nothing special. They are subordinate to this body. That is the way it is. and that is the way it will be. because no committee is going to tell the Senate how the Senate as a whole is going to vote.",

Basically. I am persuaded that it is the issue we are talking about. not the precise details of how it is to be done.

The Constitution states that the majority of the Congress will work its will. and that if the President disagrees. he may exercise his right of veto. However. the Congress may vote to override that veto and the bill then becomes law. The attempt to tack on unrelated legislation to a measure vital to the fiscal integrity of the United States is. to me. unconscionableespecially when there is not even the excuse of urgency. We have heard a lot of talk in this Chamber about the low esteem into which the Executive has fallen. We should take cognizance of the fact that. if anything. the Congress of the United States has fallen to an even lower level. The people of the United States are well aware of this appalling exercise of legislative irresponsibility on the part of Congress.

This measure. if its time has come. can withstand congressional hearings. It can withstand debate on the floor. It can be enacted on its own without riding piggyback on a piece of must legislation. Mr. President. I am going to answer the challenge that has been made. because it has been said that the Senator from Alabama and the others alined with him are holding up a vote on this important matter. I would like to point out that the Senator from Alabama on one occasion asked for unanimous consent that we recede from our amendments and pass the bill.

Those who would have us pass the bill in its present form. and those who favor the campaign subsidies have prevented that issue from coming to a vote on the floor of the Senate. The Senate will not send the bill to the President and recede from its amendments. Why should the Senate not be allowed to vote? By obstructive tactics on the part of those who favor the campaign subsidy. that issue has not been allowed to be presented to the Senate. Therefore. I issue this challenge: that after the vote on cloture. if cloture is rejected. there be a vote on the motion to recede. I hope the Senate will not be blocked by filibuster. as it was yesterday. or by a motion to adjourn. as it was yesterday. but that the matter will be brought to a vote. Mr. President.

On the 14th day of May 1948 in the museum of Tel Aviv. he read a brief declaration which told the history of the Jewish people. a history of exile. a history of persecution. a history of survival. When he concluded that proclamation. a proclamation based on the United Nations resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Israel. the audience recited an ancient Hebrew benediction and then left the museum to face war. As Abba Eban has written: Israel was. experiencing the Joy of birth and fear of death in a single taste. and the physical danger was deepened by political isolation. David BenGurion led his people in their fight for survival and in their struggle to rebuild the land of Israel. It was an impossible dream but it was a dream that now has lived on for a quarter century. BenGurion said: In Israel. in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles. For David BenGurion. there was only one miracle still left undone. the miracle of peace. He believed that the future of Israel could be based only on peace with and respect for its Arab neighbors. He led the nation of Israel as prime minister in its war of independence. and in the first 15 years of its existence. But he believed that its future rested on peace and he worked in behalf of that goal. He was a great leader and we mourn his passing.

In the 41/2 years which I had the opportunity to chair this Houses temporary Select Committee on Crime I developed the strong convictions: First. that there should be one committee to deal with all aspects of crime. second. that no legislative committee of the House. under the present rules of the House. has complete jurisdiction over all facets of crime and. therefore. the investigative work or the legislative work of the several committees now. of necessity. must be fragmentary. and third. that to create one legislative committee with jurisdictions over all aspects of crime would take away very important legislative jurisdiction from a large number of the important standing committees of the House. I have concluded. therefore. that the only way that the subject of crime can be treated as a whole without depriving the legislative committees of important aspects of their respective jurisdictions is to have a permanent select committee with comprehensive authority to investigate all aspects of crime but which would have no legislative jurisdiction and would make its recommendations to the respective legislative committees.

It occurs to me that if the concept were for a temporary select committee. perhaps initially with a two. four or sixyear plan in prospect. that then one could work out an arrangement whereby the burdens on the individual members would not be so onerous as they are when they have a committee that is so active already before they are involved in the select committee and there could be Some understanding as there is in the Senate. As you well know from your experience in the Senate. Senators have 18 to 25 committee and subcommittee assignments. It results to a large degree. with no derogation to the Senate. that it is a staff operation. I am not saying that is bad. I am saying that it exists. One of the Houses virtues -is that there is a great deal of investigation In the legislative process. I would hate to see us lose that. If you have a permanent select .committee and you have the problem of dual assignments. it seems to me you are building into the system almost the impossibility for a member who wishes to keep his important permanent assignment. to fully do either job on a longrange basis. I would like your comment on that particular problem because I am sure you have had some experience with It.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing today a resolution disapproving the Presidents alternative plan for pay adjustments for Federal employees as submitted to Congress on August 31. 1973. For the third time in 3 years. now. the President has come up with an alternative plan to what Federal employees need in the way of pay raisesand deserve under the law. When Congress passed the Federal Pay Comparability Act. it surely did not foresee that a President would systematically try to cheat Federal employees out of a few months of increased payor grant them less than economic statistics indicate they deserve. But. at least. under the provisions of that legislation. either House of Congress can disapprove of the Presidents action. After discussing the continued circumvention of the Comparability Act with Federal employee groups and associations. it was decided that a disapproval resolution should be introduced in each body. but with the realization that the Senate clearly offered the better opportunity for early and favorable action. Indeed. I understand that the Senate may act as soon as this week on its disapproval resolution. But. Mr. Speaker. even if the disapproval resolution is passed the problem of a President being continually able to subvert the intention of the Pay Comparability Act will remain. For this reason. my Subcommittee on Employee Benefits will hold hearings in early October to consider needed changes in the current law. For instance. even if the Congress forces the President to grant a pay raise on October 1 rather than December 1 of this year. the President would still appear to have discretion over what percentage that raise would be. Indeed. the President evidently has until the very day before the effective date of the salary increase to announce the adjustment figures. In any case. it is now time that the Congress reevaluate the Pay Comparability Act in light of its obvious inadequacies to prevent the President from dealing inequitably with Federal employees. Mr. Speaker. the text of the disapproval resolution follows: Resolved. That the House of Representatives disapproves the alternative plan for pay adjustments for Federal employees under statutory pay systems recommended and submitted by the President to Congress on August 31. 1973. under section 5305(c) of title 5. United States Code.",

The present hospital has been there since 1923. It has been enlarged sort of piecemeal from time to time. and I know that this is not a satisfactory way to produce the proper kind of hospital.

I had the opportunity during World War II to serve on an aircraft carrier operating off Culebra. and we were using the island for bombing practice. I also had the misfortune to see a very serious accident occur during World War II. when pilots from our carrier. by mistake. in bad weather conditions. bombed the observation tower. killing a number of men on the island of Culebra. This event did not receive wide publicity at the time because of war conditions. It did receive a Navy board of inquiry. It seems to me that this is good. graphic proof of what can happen when somebody makes a mistake and you are near a population area. Fortunately. this did not affect civilians. but the fact that we bombed our own observation post. killing a number of officers and enlisted men at the time. shows how a bombing incident near civilians endangers civilian population. I can well understand that the people who live there are concerned about It. So I am glad that we have bitten the bullet. and that we have. in fact. set a target date for phasing out the bombing operation there. I hope. as the distinguished majority leader has said. that the House will listen to our point and will agree that this is a better way to proceed.

This bill represents an increase of approximately $61 million over that approved by the House Appropriations Committee earlier this month but is nearly $300 million under the budget request. It was pleasing to me that the Senate Committee approved a $1.3 million project at the Naval Station in Charleston. S.C.. for a communication facility badly needed by naval forces there. This facility would provide fleet broadcast communications and improve harbor control. The present transmitter buildings are overcrowded and in poor condition. Mr. President. unfortunately the Senate committee did not approve about $6 million for enlisted and bachelor officer housing in Iceland. This request was taken out because the United States is presently negotiating for an agreement to insure retention of our forces there. Whlle this money could be used only if suitable agreements are reached. it nevertheless would appear wise to provide the funds in the event a suitable agreement is reached. Iceland Is a very isolated area and our personnel there remain indoors most of the time.

This transfer was ordered by the Secretary of Defense on May 24. 1973. and it represents the fruition of efforts by many to end the Navys use of this tiny island east of Puerto Rico as a target for naval weapons. For years. the Navy claimed that Culebra was essential to the national security as a target for shiptoshore and aerial bombardment until 1972. when two studies conducted by DOD concluded that there were other islands in the general vicinity that were uninhabited and that would serve the same purpose. Thus. Senator HUMPHREY and I introduced legislation. cosponsored by 38 Members of this body. to force the Navy to move elsewhere for their target practice. and I was very pleased to see Elliot Richardson. in his last action as Secretary of Defense. order the Navy to complete such a transfer by July 1. 1975. The questions of how to effect the transfer and how to protect Culebras unique environment from uncontrolled development remain to be answered. However. I am confident that the Department of the Interior. the Navy. and the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico can work out these details in the near future and that the transfer can be brought about as quickly and smoothly as possible.

Mr. President. U.S. violation of international sanctions against Rhodesia has seriously undermined some of our most fundamental foreign policy goals: The United States is committed to the rule of law throughout the world and to upholding international treaty obligations. At a time when we are seeking binding international agreements in many areasfrom international monetary reform to strategic arms limitationswe must do everything possible to make our own commitment to treaty obligations credible and to strengthen the international legal system. Yet in violating sanctions we are breaking a treaty obligation to the United Nations and refusing to comply with international law. Article 25 of the U.N. Charter states that all member states are legally bound to comply with sanctions. The United States is a member state. and in fact we were the leading force in bringing about the United Nations and in securing the adoption of the charter. Section 5(a) of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 gave the President express authority to implement sanctions when imposed by the United Nations. The United States strongly supported the imposition of sanctions against Rhodesia in the Security Councilboth in 1966 when the Security Council voted unanimously to impose partial mandatory sanctions and in 1968 when it voted unanimously to impose full mandatory sanctions. So there it is. Mr. President. the law of the land. And a treaty is regarded as the supreme law of the land. just as is our Constitution. We are the only nation in the world to first support sanctions then pass a law requiring that we violate them. This action can only weaken the international legal framework. It should be clearly understood that the United States has more at stake in complying with international law than almost any other country in the world. For us to violate the law and abrogate international law in defiance of our treaty obligations is to invite international disorder and catastrophe.",

If the money were well spent. there would be few who would oppose the expenditures. But. there is a general feeling here in Congress and in the public at large. that both programs are clouded with massive fraudulent practices involving physicians and the proprietors of facilities such as nursing homes. whose bills are paid by these programs. We have ascertained from the Social Security Administration that since 1966 there have been a total of seven referrals to the Justice Department of alleged fraudulent practices. In five of the cases. the U.S. Government refused to prosecute. in one there was a conviction with a $5.000 fine and a four year suspended sentence. and one case Is pending. We have also been advised by the Social and Rehabilitation Service of H.E.W. responsible for medicaid claims that they have not compiled statistics of any kind concerning fraudulent cases in their program. We believe that it would be salutory and of enormous assistance to the Congress if there were a GAO audit conducted of both medicaid and medicare programs. to ascertain what internal auditing procedures exist within those programs to uncover fraud and to prosecute those who commit such frauds. We would also be grateful if you would provide us with a general overview as to what is lacking in these programs with respect to the inhibition. detection and prosecution of those engaging in fraudulent practices. Next year the Congress will in all itkelihood be considering a comprehensive national health program. The information which the GAO can provide would be invaluable.

Years before he came to Congress. HUGH CAREY was writing his own success story. A combat war hero in World War II. and graduate of my alma mater. St. Johns University. he was predestined to be a leader among men. As chairman of the New York delegation I have known his hard work and dedication to be an inspiration to both friends and opponents alike. If not for HUGH CAREY we may never have passed the Federal aid to education law. It was HUGH CAREY who led the fight for passage of Federal revenue sharing and brought a billion dollars back to New York. It was HUGH CAREY who never gave up on the mass transit bill or Soviet Jewry or our senior citizens. Mr. Speaker. the list goes on and on. For HUGH CAREY time and work were never obstacles. but challenges. Brooklyn. too. can be proud of their Governorelect. He never forgot their needs or wants. For HUGH CAREY there was always time to go home because it was always his first priority. In the weeks and months ahead I will look forward to working with the new Governor.

Once he got himself and his record before the voters there was not much doubt about the outcome. Congressman CAREY has built an outstanding record in his 14 years in the House. His contributions in the field of Federal aid to education are particularly noteworthy. Millions of schoolchildren are today receiving a better education because of his work.

I can say that it is a great loss to this Congress but an even greater boon for the citizens of New York. He is a remarkable man. A discussion of ethnic politics is always precarious. particularly when one engages in stereotypes or uses such a discussion to malign. But let me say forthrightly without guile that I have concluded over the years that among the most successful politicians. and I mean this in a positive and not a pejorative way. is the Irish Catholic liberal who oft times has the best of all possible worlds. One might say why? Well. the answer is that so many of the Irish truly have a lyrical wit so that much of what they say borders on the poetic. And being Catholic very often connotes a conservatism with which a majority of voters identify while being liberal invokes a human response to the needs of the people which the majority of New Yorkers in fact share. Indeed in the last election. these qualities are exactly what made it possible for HUGH CAREY. who when first a candidate was known only by about 4 percent of the voters in the State. to ultimately win. When his virtues became known. and television is the best way for an honest person to be identified because there is no phoneybaloney coming through the tube that is not detectable. the people chose him. HUGH CAREY took these assets. made them known and was elected in an unbelievable landslide victorywelldeserved but certainly not expected at the time his campaign commenced. I have served with HUGHIE for 6 years In Congress. I look forward to serving with him on behalf of the people of the State of New York for many more years.

It has often been referred to here in the House that there is a small group that does get together and looks at the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and I happen to be a member of that group. Let me just say to the Members: Do not be overtaken by the frenzy that would seem to indicate that there is some sinister force at work trying to undermine governments around the world. The simple fact of the matter is that the Central Intelligence Agency is trying to do its best to protect the best interests of the free world. including our own. It just is not possible for a large group of people to know all of the activities that are going on in the Central Intelligence Agency. and I would urge the Members to be fair and to put their faith in some of the Members who do know some of the things that are taking place. Let me assure the Members that what is being done is being done in the best interest of our country. I dread to think what could have happened in the Manhattan project during World War II. That project resulted in the atomic bomb being developed that brought the war to a conclusion. At that time there were a very small handful of Members of this House and of the Senate that knew some of the activities that were going on in that project. It was just not possible for all of the Members to know what was going on. and it was not because people were not competent to know them. it was just the fact that the more who know about certain things that take place the easier it is for the enemy to know those things too. When I go into a meeting concerning the Central Intelligence Agency I try to do the best that I know how. and when I walk out. I try to do the best I can to wipe my brain free of what is going on. But. I do want to assure the Members that we are looking into these things and if they were not in the best interest of our country we would not participate in them.",

CXIX2269Part 28 This legislation requires that the President report to the Congress within 48 hours after a commitment of U.S. troops to combat abroad. It also would require that such troops be withdrawn within 60 days. unless the Congress specifically approved the action. It encourages. rather than discourages. consultation between the two branches on vital matters of war and peace. Some opponents charge that. through this bill. the Congress is giving up some of its power by statute to the President. It is said the President has a 60day mandate to commit troops to hostilities. I find this reasoning difficult to fathom. The fact is that under the provisions of House Joint Resolution 542. the Congress can halt military action anytime prior to the 60day period by the passage of a concurrent resolution. The bill provides a definite procedure for preventing future \"Vietnams.\" I can only interpret this as a reassertion of congressional prerogative. rather than a relinquishment. Ironically. other critics argue that the bill goes too far. Mr. Speaker. there is nothing in this bill which inhibits quick fulfillment of the constitutional obligations of the Commander in Chief. There is nothing in the bill that would prevent the President from taking prompt action in response to a crisis anywhere in the world as recently he has done brilliantly in the Mideast. There is nothing that would impair our treaty obligations with other nations. To say otherwise assumes an irresponsible Congress. There is nothing that would reflect. either favorably or unfavorably. on our deterrent posture. What this legislation signifies is a long overdue attempt by the Congress to share responsibility for warmakingits clear constitutional role. What is implicit is a confidence in the collective judgment of the Congress.

I entered into the RECORD responses to my questionnaire from four banking agencies. One of the critical questions asked of each agency in my survey of the most affected Federal agencies concerned how many of their 1972 final decisions were appealable to the courts by anyone. Under two of the three CPA bills now before a subcommittee on which I serve. the CPA would be able to appeal the final decisions of another agency if anyone else could appeal them. This grant of power is the major difference among the three bills. Only H.R. 564. the bipartisan bill introduced by Congressman BROWN of Ohio and myself. would not grant such an extraordinary power to the nonregulatory CPA. The Federal Reserve Board originally did not answer this question concerning appeals. before I included their response in the RECORD. Subsequently. the Federal Reserve Board. with its usual high degree of responsiveness to congressional inquiries. filed with me an answer to this question which I shall share with the Members because of the great importance of this agency to our economy. Counting the decisions referred to by the Fed as being listed in its 1972 Annual Report. there were 2.430 actual decisions of the Federal Reserve Board last year which could have been appealed by the CPA under all bills except the FuquaBrown bill. I say \"actual\" decisions. because failure to actinactionis also an appealable matter by the CPA under all bills except the FuquaBrown bill. Mr. Speaker. to complete the response of the Fed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is shockIng to realize that slavery still exists in this modern and supposedly enlightened age. Slavery is an ugly memory of a period many years ago when human beings were chattels to be bought and sold and whose lives were subject to the will of their owners. Yet the custom of slavery is known to have continued to persist and the Christian Science Monitor recently spelled out specific acts of slavery stating that tens of millions of people are held in some form of servitude in at least 40 countries of the world. Three specific examples were listed. and I include them in this statement: The services of a child reportedly can be bought at \ufffd15 (about $37) for 10 years in many Eastern lands from Lebanon to Indonesia. Fifty schoolgirls from Ghana were officially conceded earlier this year to have been sold to buyers in Lebanon. Four 16yearold Asian girls of Persian descent have endured three years of forced marriage to members of the revolutionary council in the East African island of Zanzibar. Slavery is outlawed in every nation of the world and the United Nations is on record against slavery. In 1956. 85 nations in the U.N. ratified a resolution abolishing slavery. Yet there has been no international policing of the practice of slavery. The only world organization of official stature is the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. Five representatives of the Subcommission now propose to meet 3 days a year to receive evidence of slavery. However. privately financed and organized antislavery groups. which are active against slavery. are very skeptical that anything will come of these meetings or that the U.N. will take any action against slavery. It has been urged. without avail. that a permanent adviser of world stature be designated by the U.N. to probe slavery full time. The forms of slavery which still exist include debt bondage. which is reported to be widespread in India and Burma. serfdom. where people are bound to the land. is said to be practiced in Afghanistan and on some large South American estates. exploitation of children is reported in Latin America. the Middle East. West Africa. and Southeast Asia. including Hong Kong. servile forms of marriage in which forced and bought marriages are said to persist in some 30 Islamic and partIslamic countries.",

This. together with certain revenue actions. would have the effect of raising the estimated deficit for fiscal year 1974 by more than $3.4 billion. The excerpts from the report which I am inserting here include the highlights of completed legislative action. and point up the major areas of pending action which may materially affect the final impact of congressional action in this session. These excerpts follow: ExcERPTS FRom 1974 BUDGET SCOREKEEPING",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. HR. 8480. the impoundment control and expenditure ceiling legislation. is a proper and necessary response to an unprecedented campaign by the Nixon administration to override the will of Congress in establishing national :.)rlorities through the legislative and appropriations processes. It has come about because this administration set itself up as the sole judge of how Federal funds were to be spent and which already enacted programs would be allowed to function. Unlike the temporary and limited impoundments undertaken by previous administrations. which largely took the form of funding deferrals. the Nixon administrations policy has been massive and permanent impoundmentsitem vetoes of congressional appropriationsand largely among urgent domestic programs aimed at meeting human needs. The administrations impoundment estimates total $8.7 billiona frightening figure under any circumstances. A more accurate estimate. however. was prepared by the Library of Congress. whicr found that. in addition to the impoundments acknowledged by the administration. there was an additional $9 billion impounded. including: The sum of $6 billion in Environmental Protection Agency contract authority for water sewage treatment facilities. $382 million in rescissions in fiscal 1973 appropriationsproposed in the fiscal 1974 budgetincluding $283 million in manpower training funds. $1.9 billion in Labor/HEW funds appropriated by continuing resolution but unspent because of the Presidents decision to hold spending by those departments $1.9 billion below the amount provided by Congress in the vetoed fiscal 1973 appropriation. $1 billion held up by administrative actions such as the recently declared illegal moratorium on subsidized housing. manpower enrollments. cutoff in FHA emergency loans. and changes in social service regulations. These impoundments have affected the entire Nation. but aimed as they were at social programs based on human needs. they have had the most devastating impact in the central cities. Unless H.R. 8480 is enacted without crippling amendments. the urban fiscal crisis will be worsened to an inhuman extent. In my own city of New York. the dimensions of the administrations impoundment policies are mindboggling. Members of the New York City congressional delegation received this week a breakdown of the impoundment impact in the current fiscal year by program area. As a dramatic illustration of how the Nixon administrations arrogance is affecting the Nations largest city. I present herewith that memorandum. PROGRAM AREA AND ANTICIPATED Loss IN",

As a matter of fact. Senator ERVIN stated that you cannot change an onion into a flower by calling It a flower. Just as you cannot change a joint resolution into a concurrent resolution by calling it a concurrent resolution. Because of this constitutional question. and because we have ample precedents. as in the case of the Executive Reorganization Act. where one of the two bodies may veto the action of the President. we of the Rules Committee thought it would be better that we provide for either one of the two Houses with the power to veto.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. it seems to me there are two very cogent reasons why this compromise resolution that the committee reported out and sponsored on the floor here today should be adopted. They are. first. the President has the authority to make recommendations to the Congress at any time he wishes under the Constitution. What in substance he does under this resolution is if he disapproves of an expenditure that the Congress has authorized. if he thinks that the law justifies withholding of the expenditure. if he thinks the circumstances have changed. if he thinks that the public interest dictates that the money is not to be expended. he in substance recommends to the Congress that he not spend the money. If Congress acquiesces. after due notice. In the Presidents recommendation. the legislative authority has not been flaunted. it has not been disdained. If the Congress is silent. by neither House disapproving the Presidents action. it acquiesces by its silence in the recommendation received from the President. Second. the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois in requiring the Congress to enact a concurrent resolution to disapprove the Presidents action in impounding funds will require the Congress in substance to repass the appropriation. Another possible burden this amendment might impose arises from the difference in the procedures of this and the other body. I do not believe that the able gentleman has provided in his amendment against the filibuster in the other body. which often occurs or may occur there. So the gentleman by his amendment would impose upon the Congress. in order to get its will carried out by the Executive. the necessity of passing the appropriation impounded again. which encounters the possibility of delay that prdcedurally may occur in the other body. So the compromise offered by the majority of the Committee on Rules providing that the disapproval of either House voids the impounding of the President is a very desirable compromise. I hope the amendment will not be agreed to.",

I have a feeling. however. that the constitutional issue cannot be resolved through the enactment of this bill. I do intend to vote for the bill in its present form or as it is amended. because I think we need to move this bill through the Congress. The question remains. how are we going to make the President expend the funds that are being impounded? The committee bill proposes a disapproval resolution passed by either House. If we want to make it abundantly clear what the congressional intent is. it would be better. in my judgment. to provide for a concurrent resolution. This procedure provides for action by both Houses in the confrontation with the President. Action by both Houses would make crystal clear the position of the Congress in regard to the matter in dispute. I do not think that under the committee bill or under the amendment we are going to make the President necessarily expend the funds. But some procedure is needed to help us move toward a better resolution of the question of impoundment. In his original approach to this question. Senator ERvIN provided for the veto by approval of a simple resolution by just one House. but he has thought better of that. The bill that has passed the Senate now provides for the concurrentresolution approach. I think the bill before us today has met some other problems very well. It prevents strategic packaging of impoundments by the Executive in a given \"special message\" by requiring that each impoundment be treated separately. I think the committee is right. also. in recommending that we should not undertake to amend the impoundment action. because we would run into the argument that positive legislative action requires the signature of the President. In my view. the amendment before us is flawed somewhat by providing for such amendment. We should provide for a vote up or clown either by one House or by two Houses. I am inclined to favor action by both Houses on an impoundment as being more compelling in a confrontation between the Congress and the President.",

When the electron and positronparticle and antiparticlecollide head on in the ring. they annihilate each other in a flash of energy which can create other particles. As the energy of the colliding beams was raised to 3.105 Gev. the SLACLBL physicists saw a sudden. enormous increase in the number of heavy particles produced. Then. as the beam energies continued to rise. the excess production of heavy particles vanished. The newly created particle decays into other heavy particles. called hadrons. or leptons in a time which may be one hundred billionth of a second. On a nuclear time scale. this is a remarkably long life. totally unexpected for a particle of such large mass. This indicates that it must have some novel. as yet not understood properties. which prevent it from decaying in the much shorter time which would have been expected from a conventional particle. Measurements are continuing at SLAC. BNL and other laboratoriets to detect and pinpoint the new particles lifetime. spin. charge. and decay modes. The MIT group is also searching for additional particles at BNL and is preparing a new experiment at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. extending the search to much higher energies. The energy of SPEAR has recently been increased from 2.7 Gev to over 4 Gev. which will allow searches for such particles of much higher energy to be made there also.",

    "speech": "Executive Director. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. BAUSER: We. at Babcock & Wilcox. were surprised and dismayed to learn of President Fords veto of H.R. 15323. the bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act to revise the method of providing public remuneration in the event of a nuclear incident. The President. in his veto message. supported the purpose of the bill and urged its prompt reenactment without the provision which. in his opinion. created a constitutional infirmity. We wholeheartedly endorse the Presidents recommendation. The need for prompt action cannot be overemphasized. Because of the impending expiration of the PriceAnderson Act. nuclear power plants for which we are now proposing to furnish equipment will not be subject to the limitation of liability and government indemnity provisions of that Act. We have therefore made those proposals and any resulting contract conditional upon enactment of H.R. 15323 or its equivalent. A contract recently concluded between Babcock & Wilcox and The Power Authority of the State of New York for the supply of a nuclear steam system allows either party to cancel in the event that protection from liability claims substantially equivalent to that now afforded by the PriceAnderson Act does not apply to the facility. These provisions have been necessary because Babcock & Wilcox has not yet decided that it is willing to maintain its present role in the nuclear power industry in the absence of PriceAnderson type protection. As the period of uncertainty over the extension of PriceAnderson continues. the disruption to our business and that of our customers and suppliers increases exponentially. As a consequence. this will seriously interfere with the construction of sorely needed nuclear plants. These plants are required to meet the publics demand for electric energy and their completion will contribute significantly to reducing our dependency on Mideast oil. Accordingly. we urge the Joint Committee to promptly report out a bill incorporating the substantive provisions of H.R. 15323. Sincerely.",

His remarks discussing the influence of the Jewish community in the United States were distasteful. intemperate. and worst of all. inaccurate. and they have raised serious doubts about his capacity to fill the second most important position in the Department of Defense. I believe his resignation would be in the Nations best interest. As the highest ranking military officer in the United States. any remarks made by General Brown must be looked upon with credibility by other nations of the world. His statements about what he feels to be undue Jewish influence in the financial and publishing institutions of the Nation came at a time when tensions in the Middle East were high and the Arab world had to be convinced that U.S. support of Israel was a strong and steadfast as ever. They represented an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of state by an officer of the military. and I am pleased that President Ford and Secretary of Defense Schlesinger acted promptly to repudiate them. Frankly. General Browns subsequent apology. which stopped short of a retraction. does not ease my doubts about his ability to effectively function in his current position. nor do I believe that it has sufficiently soothed the hard feelings his original statement caused. We as a nation have experienced enough division in the past 2 years. and we do not need at the top echelon of our military establishment an individual whose private. outmoded prejudices promote continued division.

I understand that this is the agreement that was made between our side of the House and the Senate in order to get the approval of the President that the bill would be signed. But. if the economy deteriorates and unemployment increases substantially. we may not want to accept all the rescissions the President recommends. We will look hard at the recommendations in light of the general economic situation to see if these budget cuts are really warranted. So I think we ought to point out at this particular time. while we support the reductions in the conference report. we may find in the months ahead that .e need to stimulate the economy to increase employment and production.

Only two persons have ever been granted honorary American citizenship. Lafayette was honored by our Founding Fathers for his guidance in our own struggle for liberty. Sir Winston was honored by the Congress and the American people for keeping the spark of liberty alive through the darkest days of World War II. The remembrance of the life of this man who resisted tyranny and aggression when the odds seemed utterly hopeless and who went on to rally the democracies to victory should give us new courage and new resolve to face the crises of our times. As in Sir Winstons time. there appear to be gathering storms which threaten our alliances. our economies. and our liberties. There may well be trying times ahead. Sacrifices may be required. These trials can be overcome. these obstacles can be surmounted. As in Sir Winstons times. I believe that with sound and courageous leadership. the world can move into the broad. sunlit uplands of peace and prosperity for all men. As the life of Sir Winston reminds. this struggle will never be easy. There will always be tragedies with the triumphsbut the inspiration of Winston Churchills life is proof that man can overcome against the most impossible obstacles.

I would bring to the gentlemans attention the language contained on page 2. line 4. of our bill under \"Military Construction Army\": \"as currently authorized in military public works or military construction Acts.\" This clearly makes the use of these appropriations for nev projects dependent upon enactment of annual authorizing legislation. There are similar provisions in each of the other appropriating paragraphs in the bill before us. There are in each of these paragraphs small amounts of funds for items such as planning and minor construction which are authorized under permanent law. but these amount generally to only 10 to 15 percent of the total amount appropriated for each of the services.

I particularly wish to referand perhaps this will make some legislative historyto the construction of new. permanent facilities at Fort Stewart/Hunter Army Airfield. Ga. As the committees report shows. the Armys longrange plans for Fort Stewart/Hunter Army Airfield are ambitious plans. There is every reason to believe that by the end of the fiscal year 1979 the total personnel strength to be stationed at Fort Stewart/Hunter may well be in excess of 24.000 military and civilian personnel. As the distinguished gentleman in the well knows. this is a strength nearly equal to or possibly in excess of the base population to support a full Army division. The Army plans. as presented to the subcommittee and to the committee. call for new and permanent construction to house and care for a division. minus one brigade. It is my understanding that the committee. in its wisdom. decided that for the fiscal year 1975 appropriation bill for military construction. the new.permanent construction plan would be geared to the approximate strength of a reenforced brigade. It is my hope. in the event that the Department of Defenses budget request for fiscal year 1976 renews the request for new and permanent construction for a division. minus one brigade. that the Subcommittee on Military Construction Appropriations will see fit to augment the amount appropriated in this years bill to provide new and permanent military construction to take care of a division. minus one brigade. as opposed to a reenforced brigade. It is for this reason that I asked the chairman of the subcommittee. the distinguished gentleman from Florida. to yield to me. At this time. Mr. Chairman.

The CIA gave Howard Hunt. a former CIA employee. alias identification gear. disguises. and other technical materials for purposes having nothing to do with the CIA mission. We all know what purpose these were put to. Howard Hunt used them to contact an individual who was peddling material on the Kennedy family and in the unlawful break into the office of Dr. Fielding in the search for the psychiatric records of Daniel Ellsberg. They were also used in connection with the Mrs. Dita Beard and the ITT affair. They were used during the actual Watergate breakin attempt.

But I am pleased to announce today that the fans in this great Chamber will not have to wait until next spring to see topnotch baseball played as it has rarely been played before. Yes. Mr. Speaker. I am referring to that annual exhibition of Capitol talent. that refreshing exercise of brain and brawn. that storied struggle of titans. that summer outing that causes flutters in the hearts of little children and grown men alikeyes. Mr. Speaker. I am referring to the annual congressional baseball game. The mere fact that there will be no major league games in Washington this year is not a big enough obstacle to block the annual congressional battle. Once again this year. the game will be playedif that is the right term. Tl7e memorable night will be July 30 at Baltimores Memorial Stadium. and the game will be a prelude to a major league contest between the Baltimore Orioles and the Detroit Tigers. While this will necessitate a short bus ride up the BaltimoreWashington Parkway. all the traditional hoopla and outstanding talent that have marked previous congressional games will again be provided. Despite losing the last nine consecutive games to my slick fielders and heavy hitters. my colleague from Pennsylvania and opposite number on the diamond. Mr. CLARK. promises to field enough Democrats to fulfill at least the numerical requirements for a team. If they can do that in spite of their recent adversity on the ballfield. surely every Member of this body should match their sacrifice by coming out to the game July 30 to see the Republicans 10th consecutive victory in this glorious series.",

Two. it simplifies administration of the social security minimum guaranty provision contained in section 3(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act. and three. it extends kidney disease medicare coverage to railroad employees. on the same basis as such coverage is now provided for persons insured under the Social Security Act. The provision extending kidney disease medicare coverage is an amendment to the Social Security Act which is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. However. the committee report contains a letter from the Committee on Ways and Means approving this provision with the understanding that by doing so the Ways and Means Committee does not give up any jurisdiction which it now has.

In addition. he won widespread respect with his keen questioning and lucid f reasoning during Senate debates and during hearings and meetings of the committees and subcommittees on which he served. In addition to the Senate Labor and Welfare Committee. these included the Armed Services Committee. the Select Committee on Small Business. and the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. He also played key roles as a member of the Office of Technology Assessment and the Republican Policy Committee. As my colleagues are aware. PETER DOMINICK served as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II and. for his gallant efforts while flying over the hump between India and China. won the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal and Cluster. His interest in flying has been maintained as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Until recently.

In the autumn of 1973. Senator DOMINICK and I worked in particularly close harness. developing and presenting the McIntyreDominick amendment to the Defense Authorization Act. holding a joint news conference on the amendment. and carrying out the floor effort for its adoption. Our amendment called for an orderly more careful development of the Trident submarine. a vessel the administration and the Pentagon wanted to rush into production. Senator DOMINICK and I were convinced our defense posture needed the Trident. but we were also convinced that our plan for its development would save on initial costs. save even more in the long run by reducing costly errors. and even. perhaps. put a reliable Trident submarine into operation earlier than the speedup plan because it would avoid errorcorrecting delays. The good Senator from Colorado and I lost that fight by only two votes.

Senator DOMINICK was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1957 and served until 1961. He was a member of the National Commission for the United Nations Educational. Scientific. and Cultural Organization during 1960 and 1961. Senator DOMINICK was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1960 and to the U.S. Senate in During his 12 years in the Senate.

He has been a dedicated and effective member of the Armed Services Committee. where I have had the pleasure of serving with him. All of his efforts in the Senate will long be appreciated by those who believe in sound government and a strong national defense. I am particularly pleased that President Ford has recognized the outstanding qualities in PETER DOMINICK and plans to name him as an Ambassador.

I take pride in having served with Senator DOMINICK and will especially miss him because of the consideration and kindness which he has shown to me during our careers in the Senate together.

Mr. Hennessy contends that the increase in the crude oil price. plus the increases in the costs of food and fertilizers. has placed a heavy burden on the \"least developed\" countries and thus demands that we Americans continue our generosities from now until at least 1980. And why us? Mr. Hennessy has a ready answer. Unless we keep ladling out our tax dollars to loan funds for development projects. we may aggravate the problems of these other countries and also undermine our efforts to get the new oilrich nations to contribute more than they are doing now to alleviate world poverty. Put another way. this debttroubled. deficitfinanced Nation. now facing internal economic problems of great magnitude. must. in Mr. Hennessys and the administrations view. borrow more money at staggering interest rates in order to contribute this money to International Development Banks to be loaned at low interest rates1 percent for exampleto other countries.

This Is the real meaning of the \"followon.\" To quote again: The idea that each weapons system must have a followon has become selfperpetuating. Each corporation has a planning group whose soul function is to choose suitable successors for weapons currently being produced and which maintains close contact with consorts in the military.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I almost had to pinch myself to wonder whether I was in the land of the living when I picked up this rule and found that all points of order to this omnibus deficiency appropriation bill are to be waived. It is my understanding that there are some 100 provisions in this bill that would be subject. in the absence of this rule. to points of order. I simply do not understand what has come over the House of Representatives that they would even think of considering an appropriation bill of this magnitude. an omnibus deficiency appropriation bill calling for the spending of more than $2.8 billion. under a waiver of points of order. It is hard for me to conceive that this could happen in the House of Representatives. I can understand a rule making in order an appropriation bill under emergency conditions. with limited points of order. But what has become of the rules of regular and orderly procedure in the House of Representatives when this sort of thing can take place? What is the necessity for the harsh procedure here proposed? The ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations when this bill was reported to the House reserved all points of order which. of course. would have made points of order in order if the bill was considered under ordinary procedures. Why go through that charade if the Committee on Rules is to come forth with a rule waiving all points of order? Read this bill. It is scarcely a deficiency appropriation bill. It is a transfer bill. Money is transferred all over the lot. and the transfers are made under the cloak and protection of waivers of points of order. This is a sad performance. and in a way I regret that I am here on this day.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I think it is true. as the gentleman from Iowa has just pointed out. that there are some 109 instances in this bill in which one or two clauses in the House rules: namely. clauses 2 and 5 of rule XXI would be violated if this rule had not specifically waived points of order in each of those instances. I can give the gentleman from Iowa the explanation that was presented in the Committee on Rules by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations as to why this request was made. The gentleman explained that it is not unusual for a supplemental bill. particularly one that reaches the floor shortly before the conclusion of a fiscal yearand we are. of course. less than 2 months from the conclusion of the current fiscal yearto require appropriations either where there is no authorization or to require appropriations in excess of authorized ceilings. So we do have a situation in which we have unexpended balances in one account and deficiencies in another. Therefore. it was the argument of the Committee on Appropriations that it did make very good fiscal sense to permit the transfer of funds from one account to another to make up these deficiencies rather than simply appropriating new moneys. Many of the deficiencies in this bill. as I understand it. are due to unbudgeted pay raises which have since taken effect. One other example that we were furnished is the general provision section of the Department of Defense supplemental in which there is an excess in the procurement account and deficiencies in personnel and operation and maintenance accounts due to the devaluation of currency. increased food prices. and increased activities in Southeast Asia above the levels that had originally been programed. Those are the reasons. in short. why those of us on the Committee on Rules were inclined to go along and grant the request of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations for the waiver.",

    "speech": "As the gentleman from Iowa knows. we raise the pay of civilian and military personnel usually at least once a year. and that calls for additional funds over the original budget. So in prior years. without exception. insofar as I can remember. we have had to provide in the supplemental bill the additional funds for the pay raises which were mandated by law. We try to squeeze the money already available. In other words. we try to get the agencies to absorb as much of the cost of the pay raise from the appropriation previously made. instead of providing additional new funds to pay these increased costs mandated by Congress. In some instances we can transfer available funds between appropriations and thereby hold a tighter rein on the purse strings. We have some 80 instances in this bill where we have made transfers of available funds. This is the way we did it last year. and the year before. and the year before that. It seems to me to be the most prudent way to do it. It is better than to appropriate new money. increase the budget. increase the deficit. and subject ourselves to criticism for failure to adequately control the purse strings. I think the gentleman from Iowa will be one of the first to agree that this transferral of funds procedure is desirable under the circumstances. and I think the gentleman would agree that it is rather strange that the rules of the House would deny the committee authority to transfer these funds. I think it might be recited that in prior years. quite a number of years ago. it was in order. It was not held to be in violation of the Rules of the House for the Committee on Appropriations to bring in a bill transferring funds which had previously been approved by Congress.

The proponents of reform say they want to eliminate the large contributions. I believe the $250 limit is going to eliminate the socalled large contributor. The $100 contribution for the House and Senate is going to eliminate the large contributor. That would put the incumbent and the challenger on exactly the same basis. This whole process can be solved inside the framework of private financing. by the small contributor and still allow Federal matching. It seems Members of the Senate are going to insist on having their campaigns subsidized by the taxpayer. That vote is quite evident here in the Senate. Members of the Senate want to see the taxpayers finance their campaigns. because I had an amendment knocking Members of the House and the Senate out of the subsidy. and that amendment was voted down. So it is evident Senators are going to want public financing. Therefore. let us limit the public financing to the amounts set out. $250 and $100. but let us chop off all amounts above that. because there seems to be something evil or sinister about contributions that are over $250 for the President and over $100 for the House and the Senate. because we are not allowing the Government to match these excessive contributions. So if Senators want reform and not just public subsidy. let us cut these contributions down to where the campaigns can be financed by the average citizen of our country. which will encourage citizen participation in our election process. That is what the amendment does. It drastically cuts the amount that can be contributed. We have heard a lot from Common Cause to the effect that. \"Well. we want to cut these contributions down.\" Let us see if Senators who seem to be influenced by that pleaor demand. would be a better wordby Common Cause-",

However. we do permit contributions up to $300 limit per person so that the person can get seed money and have an opportunity to start his campaign which is so important. as pointed out in the editorial from which I have Just quoted. One of the suggestions he made yesterday was to increase the tax credit or tax deduction and to make possible a gift tax deduction for this purpose. We did not go that far on the gift tax. We did under title V. that has now been taken out of the bill. and I support the doubling of the tax deduction and/or the tax credit. and doubling the checkoff. I might say the distinguished Senator from Alabama has found some fault with the checkoff provision by saying that in order not to bethat you have to check if you do not want the money used. I agree with him on that. I think it ought to be an affirmative action on the part of the taxpayer. so that if he wants his money used for that purpose. to go Into the political fund. the $1. which I support Increasing to $2 per person. then I think he ought to have the affirmative obligation of making a check to so indicate. and have that money go into the fund. But I hope the Senate will not support the Allen amendment on this particular issue. even though I find myself in agreement with him to a very high degree on the basic principles of what we are trying to do.

Secretary Shultz stated: It is difficult to see any persuasive signs of broadlybased or cumulative reduction in demand for the economy as a whole that might call for added fiscal stimulus. The continued basic strength of the economy is reflected in numerous ways. One favorable factor is the capital investment boom. which continues unabated. If anything. businesses are still revising their investment plans upward. Another is strong inventory demand. and modest ratios of stock to sales in most sectors. Government spending is on the rise. too. at both the Federal and local levels. Furthermore. it appears that housing. hampered last year by mortgagemoney shortages. should soon enjoy an upswing from the improved flow of funds into the mortgagegranting institutions. Further. Prof. Murray L. Weidenbaum. former Assistant Secretary of Treasury. has stated that the administrations proposed budget may be much more expansionary than its basic numbers indicate. Professor Weidenbaum points out that the $9.4 billion estimated deficit could easily turn out to be more than twice that size. Mr. President. if this estimate is partially correct. a tax cut at this time would be disastrous to our economy. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a March 24. 1974. article from the New York Times entitled \"Springtime in the Economy\" be printed in the RECORD.

It was to preclude any argument that the destruction of a sizable percentage of a group was not genocide because members of the group still existed. The section on individual rights and liberties of the American Bar Association had this to say: In the context of this Convention. there can be no doubt about the distinction between intent to destroy a national. ethnical or racial or religious group and intent to destroy some individuals belonging to the group. Nothing In the history of the United States since the early Indian wars quite adds up to genocide within the meaning of this convention. If any race riot. lynching or comparable event ever grew to the scale approaching genocide as defined in the Convention. the international obligation would surely add nothing to the determination of our own state and federal authorities tobring the perpetrators to full justice.

President after President and Congress after Congressbut not with my votehave recommended and approved bilateral gifts of U.S. taxpayers dollars to foreign nationsto the tune of more than $130 billion. Despite this massive generosity. the United States has usually failed to earn either the respect or the friendship of those nations so lavishly assisted. We are generally considered a \"soft touch.\" With inflation gnawing at us from all sides. it is time to stop this wasteful use of such revenues as we have.

Although marihuana is regarded as a weaker or milder drug in comparison to the \"hard stuff\" such as heroin. I can see no logical reason for the Government sanctioning its use. In my mind. this would serve as a signal to thousands of impressionable youths throughout the country that the Government had put its stamp of approval on this drug and that it was alright to use without any harmful effects.

Especially is this so when Zambia continues to be the recipient of U.S. foreignaid dollars. and her one party dictator. Kenneth Kaunda. remains the darling of the liberal news establishment and the \"great new leader\" of the African continent to the international U.N. crowd. This occurs while the peaceful. nonaggressive people of Rhodesia are treated as an outcast under some pseudointellectual theory of their being a threat to international peace. The entire Victoria Falls incident is especially repulsive to me. As a tourist in Rhodesia in 1968. my wife and I were taking pictures of the falls from the Victoria bridge when a Zambian border guard attempted to apprehend me for \"violating Zambian territorial integrity\" by crossing a white painted stripe in the center of the bridge. I refused to be taken into custody and the guard did not draw his gun. although other militia on the Zambian side of the bridge set up a machine gun and forced all of the tourists by direct intimidation to leave the scenic overlook. The American financiers. church people. and bleeding hearts who send encouragement in the way of dollars and political support to the present Zambian regime should understand that they are just as responsible for the murder if tourists in Rhodesia as is the Zambian racists at the present helm of that country. It is ironic that while the State Department giveaway specialists are gearing up to invest large amounts of American capital in Red China in the interest of assisting that \"emerging nation.\" the Chinese Communists have already emerged enough to spend great amounts of their money in their own \"foreignaid programs\" to subvert Africa. I include an evaluation of Chinese Communist subversion in Africa from Asian Outlook. the publication of the Asian Peoples AntiCommunist League of Taipei.

I urge the adoption of the FlyntGiaimoAddabbo amendment as a necessary first step in not only reasserting the congressional role in foreign and military policy. but also in terminating finally all aspects of our tragic military adventure in Southeast Asia. Let there be no doubt that Congress will have to go well beyond rejection of this transfer authority. Defense Secretary Richardson has made it abundantly clear that the Nixon administration intends to continue the air war in Indochina and will find the funds to do so regardless of what action may be taken on this particular bill. Such arrogance cannot go unchallenged. In the first place. Congress has an obligation to make good on Richard Nixons broken pledge to end the war in Indochina. In the second place. there simply is no constitutional basis for the continued prosecution of the war without specific congressional assent. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was repealed. Mr. Nixons claim that as Commander in Chief. he had the authority to pursue military actions to protect U.S. troops in Vietnam is no longer valid. since those troops have been withdrawn. It is clear that the continued air war over Cambodia and Laos is purely punitive in naturea careless and savage attempt to achieve militarily what could not be achieved politically. This air war really is more than carelessit is reckless. It represents reckless disregard of the consequences of U.S. crews being shot down and captured. thus establishing a new POW dilemma. It represents reckless disregard of the commitment to peace the American people thought they had been given by their President. And with the daily rate of some 60 B52 bombers and 160 fighterbombers over Cambodia alone. it represents reckless disregard of the need for fiscal restraint. for reliable estimates put the cost of the air war at $5 million a day.

I have become increasingly concerned about the need to devote a more adequate share of our resources to the development of existing technology in the field of rail transportation and to the research and development of new technology for highspeed ground transportation of passengers and freight. Recent events have demonstrated to the American people the need for a healthy rail transportation system for the movement of both passengers and freight. and the shortcomings of our current system are becoming more evident. In order to avert what may be the movement toward outright nationalization of rail transportation facilities in the United States in the face of inadequate service. I am becoming convinced that we must develop adequate legislative mechanisms to divert sufficient resources into our rail transportation system to assure its health and viability. The selfevident wisdom in the decision made by many countries. such as England. to allocate resources to the development of a strong and healthy rail transportation system is now becoming clear. their investment is now paying substantial dividends. Not only can freight be transported efficiently and reliably. giving good service to customers. but the quality transportation of passengers by rail is becoming increasingly desirable. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in what must constitute substantial legislative efforts in this regard in the near future. Mr. President.

Mr. HUGH SCOTT was a leading voice in the Copyright Subcommittee and in the full Judiciary Committee when it considered this provision in S. 1361. It is now embodied as Section 114 of S. 1361. The section represents a considerable compromise from the performance royalty rate as originally proposed. Initially. it was suggested that 2 percent of annual gross revenues of broadcast stations would be a fair basis for unlimited use of copyrighted recordings. This was approved by the subcommittee. The rate. as reported. now would require 39 percent of all stations to pay only 1 percent with the remaining 61 percent paying lesser amounts.

House Resolution 456 provides for an open rule with 3 hours of general debate on House Joint Resolution 542. a resolution concerning the war powers of Congress and the President. The joint resolution provides that the President make a formal report to the Congress whenever. without a declaration of war or other prior specific congressional authorization. he takes significant military action. by either the commitment of U.S. Armed Forces to hostilities outside the United States. the commitment of combatequipped U.S. forces to any foreign nation. or the substantial enlargement of combatequipped U.S. forces already in a foreign nation. House Joint Resolution 542 also denies to the President the authority to commit U.S. Armed Forces for more than 120 days without specific congressional approval. The Committee on Foreign Affairs does not expect any new costs as a result of enactment of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. the framers of the Constitution were explicit in their desire that the ultimate warmaking powers be in the hands of the Congress. the representatives of the people.

It should be pointed out at the outset of this discussionand I hope we have a reasonable discussionthat the reason for the concurrent resolution was an awareness on the part of the proponents that if a joint resolution were the mechanism with which to express disapproval. the President would have to participate. This is a deliberate attempt to bypass the necessity of an operation which would be legislative in effect. The assumption is a situation which involves a President who would be presumably in an opposite camp. opposing what the Congress is trying to do. It is this aspect of the resolution which disturbs me most of all. The feeling is that there has to be independence from the President with respect to these judgments.

I cannot imagine that at a time when the President commits troops a resolution would not be introduced by one Member of Congress in either body which would require either the affirmation. the approval of the Presidents action. or a resolution disapproving it.

I did not think we should enact into law an agreement applying particularly to the situation in the Northeast corridor. and thus make it applicable all over the country. That was the reservation I had about that particular provision of the bill. Also. I had some reservation about the precedent established by the new provisions that apply to this collective bargaining agreement. In other words. I was concerned that other people who have been caused to endure some hardship as a result of reallocation of national priorities might. at some future time. consider this a precedent set by Congress. and come to us and ask for the same kind of consideration we gave in this bill.

One is a limitation on the amount of money which can be expended by the Government for displaced persons. That is $250 million. That is a limit which tends to holdthe mileage at a certain level.

From the landing of Christopher Columbus in 1492. the human resources of these islands have been exploited just as those of other \"colonized\" areasthe mineral and agricultural riches of the islands were plundered while the inhabitants were forced into slavery in their own land and carried off to work in the mines and on the sugar plantations of neighboring islands. Through the centuries colonial powers sought to rule the people and the land. using them as pawns in power struggles and international imperialism. Between the first enslavement and todays independence. history has created a mutuality of interests for blacks across the face of the globe. and woven ties between peoples of African descent on all continents and inhabited areas. Today. 85 percent of the population of the Bahamas is directly descended from African peoples. Our concern for the Caribbean and Latin America is enhanced by the cultural. social. and philosophical ties which bind many of us. History demands. then. that we actively and constantly support the liberation movements in the Caribbean as well as the continent of Africa and in other third world nations. The people of the Bahamas have voted. and chosen their government. Today the rule of others is ended and liberty begun.

The reason there is a shortage of food in Russia is because the people are refusing to produce. hoping to use this as a leverage for freedom. They are even refusing to bear children except for one or more children per family. and this was told me by four different employees of the Russian Government in England. So. Mr. Speaker. would not the gentleman from Missouri tend to agree with me that we are playing into the hands of the Communist rulers when we come to their rescue with food and other products of this great free Nation. when their whole problem is the fact that the people are trying to lift the Communist domination and pressure from their shoulders by refusing to produce? I would say that America is walking right into this situation and actually prolonging the control of the good people of Russia. and the Russian people are good people.

For example. if we did nothing. the State of Maryland would make money. however. since under title I. a State only channels funds to the local educational agencies as directed by the formula. the State has no ability to provide relief in hardship cases. Whether the formula is right or wrong is not the issue in my judgment. The issue is do we allow the change to take place after the school year has begun and the local districts budgeted on the assumptions such funds would be forthcoming. This announcement was made to the State of Maryland after the school year had begun. so that our school districts found themselves in a quandary. On the one hand. we have large school districts which were told that they would receive more money. School had started. and their problem was how they would spend the additional money. On the other hand. we have smaller counties in our State. For example. one of them was receiving $142.075 a year. had budgeted on the basis of $142.075. and. 1o and behold. a week after the school year began. HEW told them they were not going to get $142.000. but $51.000a cut of over 60 percent. This is a county with a small population and all of a sudden it has a cut of over 60 percent in its title I funds. As a result. they will have to lay off schoolteachers. which will damage the educational process there. We cannot allow this kind of situation to occur. Because of that situation. as one whose State would gain. I think it is only fair that the gain be postponed or reduced temporarily and try to make an accommodation so that the school districts would not be penalized to the extent that it would do irreparable harm to their educational system.",

What the Senator from New York is saying Is that that is where the children are under a very complicated formula that really provides that States that have more affluence. with more money. In no way does that correlate to where the children of the disadvantaged are located. I think the Senate will change this very inequitable and unfair formula. The problem is that many States in the South and many States in -the North do not have much in the way of AFDC payments. that is. much over $2.000 per family. whereas there are States like New York. New Jersey. and California. where there is a great increase in children that qualify under that kind of complicated formula. The other point made is that 28 States would benefit under the formula. That depends on the tables we are using and the expenditures being considered. If we are talking about current expenditures. which run about $1.6 billion. then under the Que amendment. 32 States are disadvantaged in this regard. If we are talking about $1.8 billion. the authorization level. it is an entirely different story. But we should be talking about what is being spent. $1.6 billion.

To meet this provision known as the Que amendment. which the House put in the continuing resolution. would merely mean that it would prejudice many of the school districts throughout this country. In fact. there are approximately 22 States that would have their budgets put into imbalance by virtue of this particular provision. So the Appropriations Committee wisely thought that it should not interfere with this strange situation and especially at this point in the fiscal year. Naturally. and perhaps properlyalthough I do not agree with it--we have the HEW bill coming before the Senate tomorrow. And I am not in agreement with the Que amendment. I am not in agreement with any amendment that would do away with the hold harmless provision we had in the bill last year and that we should have in the bill this year because it would prejudice the fiscal integrity of the school budgets for this particular year in 22 States.

Under present law. life insurance companies are not permitted to file a consolidated return with their affiliates. even though a sufficient stock ownership exists. because the unique method of taxing such companies makes it difficult. from an accounting standpoint. to consolidate their income with their affiliates which are not life insurance companies. As a result. members of the affiliated group receiving dividends from a life insurance company may find the dividends being treated as personal holding company income. This would not be the case. however. if life insurance companies were permitted to file consolidated returns with the other affiliated companies. The Senate amendment treats dividends received by members of an affiliated group from a life insurance subsidiary in the same manner as they would be treated if the life insurance company were permitted to file a consolidated return with\ufffd the group. The effect of this will be that dividends received by a holding company from a life insurance subsidiary will not be treated as personal holding company income. The House conferees accepted this amendment. Another amendment. No. 7. that was added to this bill by the Senate would postpone from January 1. 1975. to January 1. 1976. the requirement that Federal employees health coverage be coordinated with medicare as a condition of medicare reimbursement for services provided to persons eligible under both programs.

A number of amendments were added by the other body. and the managers on the part of the House accepted these with a few changes.

The conferees felt this was fully in keeping with the purposes of the original DISC provisions. A fifth amendment has to do with housing rehabilitation expenditures.

But a House substitute. adopted in conference. would extend the period for special tax treatment only where expenditures were made under a binding contract entered into prior to December 31. 1974.

This amendment is intended to correct a situation In which a taxpayer who has acquired the assets of a liquidated corporation may deduct an unanticipated loss. in the year incurred. just as the liquidated corporation would have been able to do if it had remained in existence. More particularly. the change would permit a deduction of a loss occasioned by a contingent liability which resulted from the unforeseeable reversal of a U.S. Court of Appeals decision. .

Section 106 of this measure requires major fuel burning installations to convert to coal. in place of oil or natural gas. provided that these plants have the capability to do so and where the use of coal will have the least adverse environmental impact. While this is a necessary step. with coal being our most abundant natural resource. we cannot ignore the environmental concerns. Coal can be effectively and safety converted to environmentally sound methods of usage. Research on the governmental level and in private industry has made some real breakthroughs in the conversion process. But our research has been helterskelter and we are not fully apprised of the present status of coal conversion efforts. What we need is an extensive. comprehensive plan. stepping up our research on coal conversion so that we can safely avail ourselves of the 390 billion tons of known recoverable coal. Upon receiving this report from the President. as proposed by my amendment. we would be able to then determine where and how we should proceed in further efforts for converting coal to a safer burning fuel. Our purpose in considering this legislation today is twofold. We are dealing with the immediate energy shortages and at the same time taking a longer range look at the road ahead. making certain that we do not find ourselves the victims of recurring energy crunches. As we look to the future. we are hopeful that we will be able to tap some of the more exotic energy sources: solar energy. geothermal energy and hydroelectric power. But as a more immediate solution to our energy problems we should certainly look to our most available resource--coalwhich comprises 88 percent of all our known recoverable fuel reserves. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment so that we might make use of our abundant coal reserves. safely and without any environmental hazards.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Americans are being forced to learn economics the hard way. Perhaps the recent shortage of beef. and the dramatic rise in food prices of all kinds. will convince those who have advocated wage and price controls and other forms of Government intervention in the economy to rethink their position. It is clear that such controls have not only failed. but have made the situation far worse. Discussing the prospects for the phase IV program. Dr. Beryl W. Sprinkel. senior vice president and economist for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. notes that: Phase IV promises much but will deliver little. except shortages. supply disruptions. reduced output and ultimately higher inflation. Writing in the Los Angeles Times of August 5. 1973. Dr. Sprinkel points out thatHistory teaches us the lesson at lesser costs. Throughout recorded history countries have tried various forms of the current experiment and have inevitably been forced to abandon controls after failure and at great sacrifice of economic efficiency. In the long run. Dr. Sprinkel believes. we have the option of returning to a system of free enterprise. He declares thatPrudent Federal spending control and less monetary growth can bring our inflation under better control. However. the lags between tighter budgets and less money are exasperatingly long .... There is no better time to start than now. I wish to share Dr. Sprinkels remarks with my colleagues and at this time insert his article from the Los Angeles Times of August 5. 1973 into the RECORD.",

Agriculture. with its roots in the family farm. is once again recognized as the No. 1 mainstay in the U.S. economy. Fortynine percent of those employed in Nebraska are engaged in agriculture or farm related industries. compared to 20 percent nationally. The percentage of people who actually work on farms and ranches in Nebraska is four times the national average. I am most proud of the fact that I was born and raised on a northeast Nebraska farm which I now own with my two brothers. Since I came to Congress 21/2 years ago. I have worked hard to increase net income for farmers. I will continue in these efforts as long as I am in Washington. It is good to know that farmers realized net income this year in America will approach $24 billions. up from the record $19.2 billions set last year. The new 4 year farm act needs to be fully understood by all of agriculture. Following is a brief summary of major features of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act as I see them.

It is estimated that 700 people marched. men. women. slaves. and children. Armed with whatever they could find. sticks. knives. hatchets. and bottles. they marched together with their leader Ramon Emeterio Betances in hopes to abolish slavery and declare independence for their island. Puerto Rico. The battle was won. the Republic of Puerto Rico was formed and the people were at peace. Their peace was shortlived. the Spanish army marched into Lares and killed and jailed innocent and guilty parties alike. Ever since. the people of Lares and other town in Puerto Rico come together in Lares and commemorate the holiday and pay homage to the great leaders whose lives were lost for this cause. This celebration of freedom strikes a responsive chord in the hearts of all of us who know what it is to struggle against the oppressor for the right of selfdetermination and fulfillment of our destinies. El Grito de Lares symbolizes the eternal quest for freedom and thus is an important day to be commemorated by freedomloving people wherever they live. On Sunday. September 23. the people of Puerto Rico and the people in Puerto Rican communities in New York joined together in remembering this day. An explanation of the origin and meaning of El Grito de Lares appears in the current issue of the newsletter Puerto Rico Libre.

America has not been as fair as I think our country should be. I think we have ignored the Palestinian refugee problem for all too long. These people have lived in camps over there for more than a generation. My heart goes out to them. Mr. President. I think that for reasons that are not clear to me. all too little is said about the more than 1 million persons who were uprooted and who have never been permanently settled anyplace but just kept hostage at camps where they have had no chance to aspire to the traditional role of family life. which ought to be afforded every human being. I am deeply concerned with the seeming indifference that all too many of us display toward the plight of these people. I must say that before we can expect that real peace will come to the Middle East. that is a problem which has to be addressed. which has to be faced realistically. and a solution must be brought about. Mr. President. I share the deep dismay which has been expressed by the Senator from South Dakota in connection with the action that has been taken. Certainly. there is plenty of blame to go around. whenever terrorism characterizes the activities of any group of people. But to think that the action that was taken is an appropriate response for earlier acts of violence seems to me to fail completely to understand the plight of these poor Palestinian refugees. I hope we can become aware of their right to aspirations as humans. that we can become more sensitive to the ways in which their problems can be resolved. and that America will take the lead in trying to see that that problem is disposed of in a manner that will square with the conscience of humanity.

I think it is well past time when the United States of America and its people consider that the way to stop the fighting. to stop the terrorism. and all the other violence in the Middle East. is to deal with the Palestinian people as a refugee people. Until such time as they are allowed to find some home. following their dispersal by Israel in 1948. there will not be peace in the Middle East. nor in the world. As you know. the United States is in danger of being drawn into that situation with each commitment we make to involve ourselves in the Middle East conflict. Mr. President. I would like to say one more thing with regard to the refugees. themselves. Last year. at the same time that this body voted $2.2 billion in military aid to Israel. another $50 million was added by way of an amendment to resettle Soviet Jews into Israel. They were not even going to stop off in this country on their way. That was just a direct contribution to resettle Soviet Jews in Israel. At the same time that that happened. I offered an amendment to increase our contribution to the UNRWA Palestinian refugee fund controlled by the United Nations. which was accepted here in the Senate but which was knocked out in the conference committee. As a result of the shortage of funds for the United Nations Refugee Works Agency. the Palestinian refugees are going to find some of their schools closed down. and some of their food rations cut short. With the additional daily bombings. the daily pounding of American bombs in the refugee camps themselves. the problems will be multiplied many times overthe problems of food. the problems of health care. Their problems are serious enough now. without the addition of this kind of devastation. I thank the Senator for his remarks.",

I wonder how he justifies giving the depletion allowance to the major oil companies. in view of the fact that they are getting into areas which have absolutely nothing to do with research and exploration.

Education and Welfares National Center for Health Services Research and Development has also funded a replication of this program at the University of Alabama (for medex in Alabama. Mississippi. Tennessee. South Carolina. and Georgia) and at the Charles Drew Postgraduate Medical School/University of California at Los Angeles. The University of Utah School of Medicine deployed its first class of medex in September 1971. Approximately 200 medex are working with physicians in 27 states. Additional MEDEX programs are in the final planning stages at four other medical schools. The basic elements of the MEDEX Program (collaborative model. receptive framework. deployment system. competencybased training program. practitioner involvement. and continuing education) have provided new perspectives in health as well as a technological tool for strengthening the delivery of health services. This tool can be used not only to train former military corpsmen to be medex. but can also be used for training new types of needed health manpower who may or may not have had previous medical training. It is possible now to adapt the concepts techniques of training and deployment of health personnel to the existing needs and available resources in many geographic locations.",

While earning lasting prominence as one of the most influential men to serve as Chief Justice of the United States. he had already built a nationally recognized reputation in public life in his native State of California before coming to the Supreme Court in 1953. Republican nominee for Vice President in 1948. threeterm Governor of California. State attorney general. and Alameda County prosecutor. he was a man of politics. an administrator. and citizen who gave his entire life to public service. But above all he was a man of absolutely unquestioned personal integrity and unshakable committment to the public good as he saw it. Of course. Earl Warren will chiefly be remembered for his 16 years as Chief Justice and his leadership in shaping some of the most dramatic changes in American society that have ever been set in motion over so short a period. School desegregation. legislative apportionment. the balance between police authority and individual rights and a host of other vital issues were dealt with the \"Warren Court\" in important and often highly controversial decisions that frequently bore the unmistakable stamp of the Chief Justices leadership. The Senator from Kansas is one of those who often found himself in substantial disagreement with the Courts decisions over that period. Far too often the majority exceeded the bounds of what many Americans viewed as reasonable and prudent judicial policymakingparticularly in the area of criminals rights. However. these disagreements and concerns were always with the underlying philosophy of the Court and its Chief Justice. and never were the motives. integrity or sincerity of those decisions questionedeven by their most vigorous critics. As administrator. politician. and jurist. Earl Warren will long be recognized as one of the major figures of the Supreme Court and the highest tradition of public service in America. The Nation mourns his passing. not because everyone always agreed with his views and decisions. but because he was a man of honor and great achievement who served America faithfully throughout a long and distinguished life.",

America was changed by the decisions rendered by the Supreme Court under Earl Warrenand I believe that it was changed for the better. This quiet and strong mans contribution to our system of justice will long be remembered. Earl Warrens role as Chief Justice was one that certainly strengthened the prestige and public regarT for the Supreme Court. President Eisenhowers appointment of Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1953 led to a judicial career marked by a resolve to right wrong. to protect the weak. and to strengthen the American commitment to individual liberty and equality. The landmark decisions he wrote will serve as monuments to an American jurisprudence of the highest calibre. In the Brown against Board of Education decision in 1954. and later decisions on onemanonevote. the rights of arrested suspects. and on many other decisions. Earl Warrens role in adapting the law of the land to a fastchanging America was preeminent. These decisions which had such a tremendous impact on American life reflected the thinking of Chief Justice Warren that the Supreme Court was a force for good. Indeed it was. and Earl Warrens integrity and commitment to the Court were integral parts of this force. The decisions rendered by the Warren Court generated great controversy. But Chief Justice Warren never waiveredhe became wholly indifferent to popular favor or political influence. He was a leader. Not in the political sense.

Until recently. the details of our efforts and those of the State Department had not been publicly discussed. During these months. the most hopeful sign that some progress was being made was an indication by the Cubansgiven on three separate occasionsthat they would be willing to exchange Mr. Lunt for one of their own men. a military officer being held by the Portugese. The first indication of a willingness to exchange the men came in the form of a pledge by Fidel Castro to Pope Paul 3 years ago. The recent change of governments in Lisbon has resulted in pressures from some groups within Portugal to return the Cuban officer without regard for the commitment of the government in Ha.vana to release Mr. Lunt.

It is my hope that the government in Havana will live up to its promise to exchange Lawrence Lunt for the officer held by the Portuguese and I join his family and friends in urging that a message be conveyed to the Cuban government that any failure to honor their previous commitment would be regarded as a breach of faith and an indication that they are not worthy to be considered a member of the international community.

My opposition to this amendment is based on the fact that it would give the Secretary of Agriculture a tremendous club to control prices. He could easily. if the reserves were going out of control. find an excuse to dump them on the market. as we have seen in the past. If we had a Secretary of Agriculture who was oriented more toward the consumer than toward agriculture. as we have had in the past. he could dump those commodities and take credit for lowering food prices. at considerable harm to agriculture.",

I have seen the grain reserve bill come in various different forms. It always has represented a great hope for the American farmer. It was always presented. until this year. at a time when prices were very low. We were told that by adopting a grain reserve bill it would increase farm prices. Now we find this year. and certainly the projections are that it will be true next year and possibly for the next several years that prices are and will continue at high levels. Finally. sooner or later we have to dispose of the reserves. Sooner or later they end up in the market. whether it is this year. next year. or 5 years from now. and when that happens market prices will suffer. In the meantime. in order to get that reserve. as the distinguished chairman of the committee has pointed out. it is going to cost the taxpayer a great deal of money.

We can wish as we might that other national farm groups who did testify had voiced to the committee the concerns which they now voice to many of us.

Second. while none of us can speak for the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. it is my hope that the committee would be in a position to conduct hearings. at which time those who have been privately voicing to us their concerns. including the Department of Justice. could have the opportunity to fully express their views. If that occurred. we would then have a record on which the committee could report back to us its conclusions and we could act in a much more informed and responsible fashion. one that will give greater confidence to the people of this country that we are legislating on the record. on what the facts are. and nothing else.

This summer. the Cost of Living Council decided not to allow the countrys 200.000 gasoline stations operators to pass along to the public the higher prices granted to gasoline wholesalers. The anguished cries of our service station people went unheard at the Cost of Living Council. Now. the refiners who produce fuel oil are the same ones who produce gasoline. Gasoline consumption during the summer months was maintained at an unnaturally high level as a result of unnaturally low gasoline prices at the pump. so the refineries quite naturally delayed their conversion to the refinement of fuel oil. Now the Cost of Living Council and the Congress are mystified that there will be a fuel oil shortage this winter. So fuel oil will be rationed because the retail price of gasoline was frozen last summer. If the Cost of Living Council had allowed the retail price of gasoline to riseif it had allowed the free market to establish the retail price of gasolinefewer persons would have driven their automobiles quite so much. gasoline consumption would have been reduced. and the refineries could have converted to the production of fuel oil at an earlier date. There is no better allocator of goods and services than the laws of supply and demand. Since we have decided to repeal those laws. we have had to substitute a mandatory allocation program. The punishment for violation of the laws of gravity comes with speed and with certainty. thus they are universally obeyed. The law of supply and demand is no less inflexible. yet the price fixers do not seem to be able to learn its lesson.

The designation of wilderness carries with it certain restrictions. The designation bars logging. construction of roads. use of motor vehicles. and any type of development. Wilderness status is intended to protect these wild lands for public uses such as hiking. camping. fishing. and sightseeing. The foundations for this national wilderness preservation program were established in 1964. when the original Wilderness Act was signed into law. I have reoently sponsored action in Congress which will. if passed. expand the size of our current wilderness system. The purpose of the original Wilderness Act was to establish a national policy and to lay the foundation for a practical program to preserve areas of wilderness. That initial act began the program by designating 9.1 million acres of wilderness in 54 different units. It also outlined a process for studying additional areas for later addition to the system. and specified the areas to be studied. Increasingly. attention has focused on the importance of providing wilderness areas .or the eastern half of the United States. The bill I have introduced designates 28 new wilderness areas in the East. the South. and the Midwest. If passed. this proposal will bring the benefits of wilderness closer to home for the large part of our population concentrated in these regions. Each of the 28 new wilderness proposals found in my bill are within a national forest. Sixteen States are represented. and the areas total 471.186 acres. Our population needs wilderness areas. They provide wholesome primitive recreation opportunities. places where you can camp beyond the roar of traffic. hike without dodging cars. fish without hooking a friend or an old shoe. A wilderness area can relieve tne stress and strain of our crowded. fastmoving. highly mechanized and raucously noisy civilization. They are areas of solitude and quiet where we can keep in touch with some of the basic facts of life. The Wilderness Act emerged from the deep feeling of millions of Americans who rallied to save Americas wilderness. I hope that Congress will give my legislation early consideration and act to expand our wilderness system.",

That bill was passed by the Senate on June 25. It is currently pending before the House Committee on Government Operations. Provisions. in the Alaskan pipeline bill. which would remove OMBs control over the information requests of independent regulatory commissions. have been approved by both the Houses and Senate. The Senate Committee on Government Operations has approved budget control legislation. The House Rules Committee is nearing completion of similar legislation. Some of us have sought for years to restrict executive impoundment. Legislation in this area has been approved by both Houses and differences can be resolved in conference. In previous years the only way Members received impoundment figures was to extract the information. after considerable delay. from OMB officials. The Federal Impoundment and Information Act. approved a year ago. now requires public. quarterly reports of all impoundments. The most recent Executive report on impoundments shows that approximately $7.446 billion in \"budgetary reselve\" exists as of September 30. 1973. It shows that funds are impounded in every Cabinetlevel department except the State Department. and also in the Atomic Energy Commission. General Services Administration. NASA. Veterans Administration. National Science Foundation. and the Small Business Administration. Mr. President. each Member should carefully review this unheralded. yet vital. report. I ask unanimous consent that the October 15 report. along with Director Ashs letter of transmittal. be printed in the RECORD.",

After months of painstaking work by members of Congress and the Administration. the major provisions of this legislation have been approved by both Houses. and. after a long and difficult conference. the differences have been successfully resolved. * At the eleventh hour. however. an effort is being mounted by certain private interests and by some members of your Administration to send the measure back to conference for deletion of two provisions which they find objectionable. The general effect of these provisions would be to grant modest but muchneeded new authority to the Federal Trade Commission to enable it to enforce more efficiently the laws under its jurisdiction. and to transfer from OMB to GAO the administration of the Federal Reports Act insofar as the independent regulatory agencies are concerned. The merits of these provisions. both from the standpoint of the individual taxpayer and businessmanand particularly the small businessmanwho stand to benefit. and from that of sound governmental organization. seem obvious. However. even more obvious to us is the fact that should the campaign to recommit the bill to conference succeed. many questions which were previously settled will inevitably be reopened. and we will be faced with the likelihood of substantial delay in obtaining final passage of the entire bill. .

For example. for the first time. those who use public lands for pipelines are required to pay compensation to the Government for the use of that land. As another example. the owners of a pipeline crossing public lands must not only carry the oil produced on adjacent Federal lands but also carry the oil produced on adjacent nonFederal lands. This can be a definite advantage to the owner of a field on private land. Additionally. the Federal Trade Commission provisions. which were mentioned by the distinguished chairman of the committee. the Senator from Washington . are a definite forward step. They allow the FTC to seek preliminary injunctions to stop deceptive or unfair trade practices. So. all in all. Mr. President. it seems to me the bill is a step forward in regulating pipelines on public lands and I would support it. I would. however. invite attention to one provision which I voted against in conference and which I think went beyond the will of the Senate and the will of the House. That section prohibits judicial review not only under NEPA but also under any other law whatsoever pertaining to the issuance of a permit. a lease. or anything else. in connection with the construction of the line. Judicial review is cut off unless a constitutional question is raised or unless an official takes an act beyond the scope of his authority. I have serious question as to whether this is constitutional. But. whether it is constitutional or not. I think it is bad practice not to have administrative officers subject to judicial review.

However. if it does not appear as though. after a reasonable period of time. such study can be quickly accomplished. then I would say the authorizing committees should go right ahead and make their own decisions. based on their own expertise. because after all. they have been involved in these matters for a long time. The Senator from Illinois is really quite sympathetic with the argument that the ExportImport Bank should be included in the Presidents budget. But the Senator from Illinois determined that we really did not have enough facts. as of this time. There was a presumption on my part that it would be a good idea. but there was strenuous objection from respected sources. and for that reason the committee of conference decided that a study would be desirable before decisions were made.",

I would hope we would not have to wait until the budget committees could be organized and staffed. and spend some time making a study.

I agree with the principle objectives of the 1961 legislation which created Piscataway National Parkthe preservation and protection of the historic. cultural. and recreational values of the lands situated along the Potomac River. which may be viewed from George Washingtons Mount Vernon. My major objection is that H.R. 4861 does not address itself to the issue of developing the park for general citizen use. In the 12 years since the creation of Piscataway Park. there has been no development of its recreational and cultural aspects for the general public. In fact. the Park Service has apparently retreated from its plan to develop the park and is now calling Piscataway an \"ecologically fragile\" area. There have been repeated objections by the owners of adjacent private land to the development of the park. The local property owners have even objected to a proposed 5car parking area within the park. The public is largely unaware of their right to gain access to Piscataway Park to view Mount Vernon because adequate guide signs are rare. The general public should have easy access to Piscataway Park before we spend over $10.5 million on acquiring new land. much of which is out of the sight of Mount Vernon and is not contiguous to the original park. The purchase of new property in fee may be justified. if Piscataway Park is to be developed into a recreational area with trails. picnic sites. and camping facilities. But if the park will be merely a scenic background for Mount Vernon and a private domain of the local property owners. then scenic easements of the kind now imposed on some of the property proposed for acquisition in fee ought to be sufficient.

The International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was drafted to protect that right against systematic abuse. This accord. ratified by more than 75 nations. defines genocide as an international crime. and obligates its signatories to act against violators of the treaty. One of the more controversial aspects of the convention is its prohibition of \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide.\" Critics of the agreement have argued that this provision is subject to loose interpretation. and that it could be applied in a manner that infringes upon Americans first amendment liberties. An unsympathetic international tribunal. these critics assert. could accuse American citizens of genocidal conspiracy for making the sort of outlandish statements o1.2 Bill of Rights seeks to guarantee their right to make. But these fears are unfounded. First. it is clear that the Constitution is supreme. no treaty can override the clear commands of the first amendment. Second. our own Supreme Court has. in the wellknown Brandenburg against Ohio decision. established a definition of incitement that former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg has called \"perfectly consistent\" with the Genocide Conventions terms. That definitionthat incitement is action directed toward. as Justice Goldberg put it. \"producing imminent lawless action\" and \"likely to incite or produce such actions\"-would not clash with the conventions more general description. We must not. as we plod through examinations of the legal intricacies of the genocide accord. lose sight of Its real purpose.

However. developments that tend to show what Britain and France may have achieved through the development of the Concorde are invariably relegated to specialized publications. A fascinating article on the Concorde was written recently by Richard D. Fitzsimmons who is employed by the Douglas Aircraft Co. and who formerly worked as an aeronautics specialist in the National Aeronautics and Space Council. In an article written for the magazine Astronautics and Aeronautics. Mr. Fitzsimmons raised some pertinent questions regarding the future market for aircraft. He described a situation in which the Concorde could place the British and the French far out ahead In this aspect of future international air commerce. In other words. he did not accept the argument that because the Concorde has developed some \"bugs\" here and there that it is a dead concept. He also went into the subject of air travel costs and how they might affect the future of the European SST. This is the way Mr. Fitzsimmons put part of his arguments: All kinds of groups. and eventually Congress said \"no\" to the SST. Only the passenger has not been heard from. When the Concorde goes into service. we think he will say \"yes.\" If the British and the French continue the present program to measure passenger response. and then step up to an aircraft economically superior to the present Concorde. they stand alone as being able to offer an economical supersonic transport to the Free World. at least for 10 years. Then the U.S. may well find itself standing on the outside as In 1952. but this time with no military development to save its commercial position of world leadership.

My final point. Mr. Speaker. as I look at the gentlemans own chart. is there is really not a great gap between authorizations and appropriations and has not been in recent years. The gentleman himself acknowledges that in 1972 and 1973. respectively. the appropriations figures came very near to being 100 percent of the authorization and. indeed. the latest figure may prove to be. although I do not know if the appropriations bill has been signed yet. close to 80 percent.",

Fiscal year 1974 was 81 1ercent over fiscal year 1973. Fiscal year 1975 will be up 38 percent. and fiscal year 1976 will be up 26 percent. Let me put it still another way.

On an international level. with all due plaudits to the administration. it seems that the art of communication is currently reaching one of its highest levels in this century. In general. a large majority of Americans applaud this emerging spirit of ddtente but there are those who would say that because of it. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty should be abolished for they represent embarrassing symbols of the cold war. With that I disagree. Optimistically. I would think that as basic forms of communication. their very existence would complement detente in the growing spirit of exchange in ideas and cultures. Regrettably. however. this spirit of cooperation is seemingly not shared in certain sections of Eastern Europe and I must urge full and continued funding of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty until all efforts to jam and interrupt broadcasts cease. There are countless thousands of Eastern Europeans who depend on the radios for information and entertainment. I see no reason why they should be denied this. especially when certain powers that be would attempt to impede this free flow of communication. I would also like to commend the House Foreign Affairs Committee for the comprehensive bill its members have brought to the floor today. A key section of this measure clearly lifts Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty out from under the control of the Central Intelligence Agency. I favor the concept which places the radios under the direction of a \"Board for International Broadcasting\" for I believe it will allow for a continuing assessment of the quality. effectiveness. and professional integrity of the onair programing. I also feel that the Board. through its involvement. can be the best judge as to how the $50 million authorized in the bill can be effectively utilized. In all. if there is to be peace. the peoples of the world must understand one another and in my view.

Consequently. the FHA authority was separately extended to September 30. 1973. The conference report would extend that authority to June 30. 1974. The conference report also makes specific dollar authorizations for several HUD programs. orders the secretaries of HUD and Agriculture to reactivate the Federal housing subsidy programs. and expands the authority of HUD to correct defects in homes financed under certain FHA programs where a reasonable inspection of the property would have disclosed the defects. The statement of managers accompanying the conference report contains a full explanation of these provisions. The Senate conferees simply would not recede on these provisions. and after extensive discussion the House conferees receded with amendments. The Senatepassed dollar authorizations were reduced by nearly half. and the HUD authority to correct defects was clarified and tightened.

Since it covers sales under all FHA mortgagessubject to mortgage size limitsmade within 3 years. it could affect thousands of sales. including those already made and about which buyer and seller have no knowledge. It contains an unstated and unknown appropriation to cover costs of insurance on such sales. If ever there were a case of unwarranted backdoor spending. this is it. However. the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is also authorized to force payments to cover insurance from sellers of homes. Sellers would never know what their liability might be. This authority could restrict the sale of homes more seriously than the high cost of mortgage money. Finally this amendment opens up a \"lawyers paradise.\" It is pretty difficult to prove whether defects existed at time of sale. or not. One persons definition of a serious defect may be considerably different from anothers. especially if one is a buyer and the other is a seller. Because of these defects. but mostly because the Senate has overdecorated our simple FHA extension. I urge this House to support the motion to recommit this report to the conference committee. There. the extraneous amendments can be excised. and our FHA extension can be reaffirmed.",

The conference report we have before us right now would extend that to all FHA mortgages. If anyone were to buy a $40.000 house. with $16.000 down. 2 years later they could attack that sale and say there were serious defects existing at the time and be reimbursed by the FHA. I can tell the Members there is no program that has been a greater disappointment than the 235 program. and now we are going to extend reimbursing families for defects in homes covered by regular FHA mortgages.

Second. I suppose there is no reason for surprise that there is embarrassment for many of us here with respect to the caliber of FHA inspections. When we talk about reimbursement. Mr. Speaker. let us make it clear that we are talking about reimbursing families earning between $6.000 and $12.000 for the cost of structured defects that FHA inspectors should have caught and in many cases would have caught if it were not for the fact that they were dishonest. Mr. Speaker. those are strong words. but the fact of the matter is that FHA inspectors in many parts of the country. particularly here in the East. are under indictment at this very time. Court cases are proceeding because the inspections these men have performed have been deliberately dishonest and fraudulent. Is it the position of this body that the victims of fraud and deception in such cases should have no recourse other than to the dishonest conspiracy that existed between the FHA inspector and the beneficiary of the fraud? What we say. Mr. Speaker. is that whether the FHA inspection was deliberately or unintentionally ineffective and bad. the families earning between $6.000 and $12.000. families who cannot afford to come back after the fact and make good on the structural defect. should have and should be provided this measure of relief.",

Many of these enlisted men serve throughout their naval or military careers working simply as a servant and that is all they do. That is their fulltime job. It is that kind of thing that is wrong especially when they belong to a particular general or a particular admiral and are assigned to them on a permanent basis.

I have heard more talk about unemployment. depression. and poverty here this afternoon than I have heard elsewhere in a long. long time.

Where is the evidence that you realize by your past votes that you are even approaching a depression in this country? Where is the evidence. aside from this bill. which has all the appearance of the 1930 depression. the good old WPA. and the leafraking days. So you are getting ready for a depression. Yet you vote with the greatest of ease for every appropriation bill that comes here and every one of them above what we spent in the last year. If you mean business. why do you not vote against a few of these appropriation bills. no matter what they are. or who they affect. if you really mean business about stopping inflation and a depression.

It deals wtih title IX. which is the title that the administration asked for. It describes the program that the administration asked to have put in this program to give them the flexibility to deal with areas in anticipation of high unemployment and economic distress. to ward off that problem and head it off before it actually occurs so that we will not have to return to make adjustments after the distress has already occurred. The language on page 22 requires that the administration cannnot even entertain a project or an application for a project unless that plan or application contains a program which includes the payment from the grant of extended unemployment assistance for a period not to exceed 1 year. irrespective of the causes of the distress or unemployment irrespective of any other benefits that the unemployed may have. and irrespective of the length in time of service that he may have passed on the job. or the time that he had on the job prior to unemployment. This would needlessly create an expensive program. It would be exceptionally difficult to administer and would result in an inequitable and fragmentary program of unemployment assistance. The projected expense of such a provision is so great compared to the amount that is provided for authorization In this title IX that most of it conceivably could be used for unemployment compensation rather than for longterm and overall economic development. thereby rendering the entire title useless and ineffective in dealing with the announced purpose of the title IX program. Additionally the administration has sent up from the Secretary of Commerce a letter setting forth all of his objections to it. and while I shall not read those objections now I will include the letter in my remarks on this amendment.

To Polish nationals and people of Polish ancestry everywhere. this day Is comparable to our own Fourth of July. As citizens of a nation where similar liberties have been guaranteed since 1789. it is sometimes hard for us to realize how important this historic document was. In most countries at that time. the rights it provided were unheard of and it was Poland who led the vanguard of democracy Into Central and Eastern Europe. History sadly records that only 4 years after this remarkable Constitution was adopted. Poland was conquered and partitioned by her autocratic neighbors. Russia. Prussia. and Austria. While this and subsequent invasions have prevented Poland from developing her democratic ideals into a permanently viable form of government. they have failed to break the spirit of her people. Down through the years. the sons and daughters of Poland have made great contributions to western civilization. The names of Copernicus. Frederik Chopin. Madame Marie Curie. Thaddeus Kosciusko. and Casimir Pulaski. who fought in our own revolution. spring to mind. America owes thegreatest debt to the millions of Poles who imigrated to the United States. bringing with them their rich cultural traditions and passionate love of freedom. They came seeking the freedom they were denied by Polands oppressors and their determination and hard work have helped to shape our country into the great Nation that it is today.

The Polish people adopted their constitution without a bloody revolution or even a disorder. and they succeeded in reforming their nations public life and in eradicating her internal decline. Unfortunately. this assertion of faith in democratic principles came too late to the Poles and could not forestall the third partition of Poland in 1795 by Russian. Prussia. and Austria.

It is particularly flttifig that the ceremonies should be held at St. Stanislaus Parish and Social Center. St. Stanislaus. which celebrated its 100th anniversary last year. is the \"Mother Church of Polonia\" in Buffalo. and has been a center of influence for Polish immigrants and their descendants since its founding. The main speaker will be Casimir Lenard. executive director of the PolishAmerican Congress. After a mass at noon at St. Stanislaus. there will be dedication of a plaque created by Prof. Jozef Slawinski. commemorating the 30th anniversary of the battle of Monte Cassino. in which Polish soldiers fought so valiantly beside American soldiers. In the afternoon the parish social center will be the site of an Academia. Detente is progressing. trade barriers have already fallen. but the goals of democracy set for May 3. 1791. are not yet within reach for the citizens of Poland. Still. the spirit of freedom lives. and it is brought to our attention again as Poles around the world pause to commemorate this significant date in the history of a gallant nation.",

There are many PolishAmericans In my congressional district. and their contributions to community life are truly outstanding. In many of the cities and towns in western Pennsylvania this holiday Is observed with appropriate exercises throughout the month of May. and thus I am pleased to participate in this special order. It was on May 3. 1791. only 2 years after the adoption of the Constitution by the United States. that Poland. without a bloody revolution or disorder. succeeded in reforming her public life and eradicating her internal decline. Although this great event did not forestall the third partition of Poland in 1795 by Russia. Prussia. and Austria. it is a landmark in Polish history. It is especially significant that the Poles raised this great moment to the forefront of their tradition rather than any one of their anniversaries of glorious victories or heroic revolutions. Special mention should be made of the key words in the 3d of May Constitution: All power in civil society should be derived from the will of the people. its end and object being the preservation and integrity of the state. the civil liberty and the good order of society on an equal scale and on a lasting foundation. The philosophy of government discernment throughout the 3d of May Polish Constitution leads one to believe that both the American and Polish people drew the inspiration for their constitution from the same sourcea belief in the inherent dignity of all people. Mr. Speaker. America is a great country. and much of its strength is derived from the contributions of those who emigrated from their European homelands to our shores. PolishAmericans are in the forefront of American culture. and I salute them on this historic occasion.",

Va.. is deeply concerned over the dual standard employed by the State Department. The TimesDispatch editorial of Wednesday. April 3. 1974. entitled \"No and Yes.\" discusses the matter of trade with two nations and the attitude of the State Department. The two nations are the Soviet Union and Rhodesia. The State Department advocates trade concessions to Soviet Russia and this very same State Department advocates an embargo on trade with Rhodesia. This embargo on trade with Rhodesia is advocated even though such an embargo would mean that the United States would become dependent on Communist Russia for a vital war material. namely. chrome. All of U.S. needs must be imported. There are only three nations in the world with large deposits of chromium and those nations are Rhodesia. South Africa. and Russia. The largest of all the deposits are in Rhodesia. When Rhodesian chrome is embargoed. that means that the United States must rely for the largest part of its chrome needs upon Russia. yet. it is because of Russia. it is because of the potential threat to world peace posed by Russia. that the American taxpayers are spending some $80 billion a year for defense. Thus. to many Americans. the attitude of the State Department makes little sense. It says on the one hand that we want to embargo trade with Rhodesia. which by no conceivable stretch of the imagination can be considered a threat to world peace but. on the other hand. we want to give special trade concessions to Soviet Russia which we all recognize is a potential threat to world peace. Incidentally. I put this question to Secretary of State Kissinger when he appeared to testify before the Committee on Finance. I said this to him: In your judgment. is Rhodesia a threat to world peace? Secretary Kissingers reply was one word. \"No.\" Mr. President.

I believe you will agree the accomplishments speak highly of the Governments ability to respond quickly and effectively to the energy crisis. As you may recall. the Federal energy conservation program was initiated in June of 1973 by President Nixon. The President directed the Federal Government to take immediate action to conserve energy consumption. His intent was for the Federal community to take a leadership role in energy conservation and set an example for the rest of the Nation to follow. He quantified his objective by establishing an energy reduction goal of 7 percent. In the fall of 1973. he revised the goal to 15 percent after studying the initial progress. The direction and supervision for the Federal program has been ably provided by Energy Administrator William Simon. and Arthur F. Sampson. Administrator of General Services. Through their leadership. Federal buildings summer cooling temperatures were raised and winter thermostats lowered. Nonessential light bulbs were removed from Federal buildings in order to reduce electrical use. A Governmentwide policy of reducing total motorpool mileage by 20 percent was implemented and enforced. Compact cars were purchased instead of the larger sedans. Federal employees were encouraged to use longdistance phone calls in lieu of official Government travel. In an effort to encourage employees to carpool. 90 percent of Federal employee parking spaces are now reserved for carpoolers. GSA is to be congratulated for its swift implementation and effective management of each program. The 6month total energy savings overwhelmingly surpassed the Presidents initial 7percent and revised 15percent goals. The final figures indicate a total energy savings of 23.3 percent over the year before. There is no question this accomplishment would not have been achieved without a spirit of cooperation and personal sacrifice on the part of every civil servant. They are to be congratulated on a job well done. Also. special accolades should be given to Energy Administrator Simon and GSA Administrator Sampson for management of this program. Mr. Speaker.

Alexander Lerner. a leading Soviet scientist in the field of cybernetics. and a former member of the Communist Party. believed that Jews would assimilate into Soviet society. But the Soviet requirement to have a nationality listed on ones identity papers. the rise of discrimination against Jews in the academic field. and the assertion of Jewish national consciousnes displayed by defendants in the Leningrad trials changed his mind. In September 1971 Lerner applied for an emigration permit to Israel. One month later. he was dismissed from his position at the Institute of Control Problems in Moscow. He was also expelled from the Communist Party. Alexander Lerner has been waiting for an exit visa for 2 years. The reason given for the delay is that he needs security clearance. This rationale is rejected by Lerner who asserts that the classified work he did 15 years is no longer secret. Nor is Alexander Lerner intimidated by authorities who say he will not get permission to leave because he is a very valuable scientist. His answer is: But I am a free man. I am not a slave. All the members of Alexander Lerners family hope to emigrate from the Soviet Union soon. These are: His wife. their son Vladimir. their soninlaw Boris Levin. both engineers and both now employed at unskilled work at a doll factoryand finally Boris wife. the former Sonya Lerner. a brilliant mathematician.

This is an open rule with 2 hours of general debate. and in addition. waives points of order for failure to comply with clause 4. rule XXI. dealing with appropriations on a legislative bill. The primary purpose of H.R. 11104 is to increase the overall public debt limit from the present $465.000.000.000 to $478.000.000.000. Existing law provides for a permanent debt limit of $400.000.000.000. Effective through November 30. 1973. existing law also provides a temporary additional limit of $65.000.000.000. This bill provides for an increase in the temporary additional limit to $78.000.000.000. It also extends the temporary additional limit from November 30. 1973. to June 30. The administration has requested an increase in the overall debt limit to $480.000.000.000 through June 30. 1974. The committee report also makes it clear that the Committee on Ways and Means intends that existing law be interpreted to allow the interest rate on U.S. savings bonds to be 6 percent instead of 51/2 percent. The Committee on Ways and Means estimates that there will be no additional cost to the Government. as a result of this bill. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of this rule in order that the House may begin debate on this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I support the effort of the gentleman from Wisconsin to open up this bill to tax reform and social security amendments. It certainly seems to me that it is a legitimate function of the debt management to consider the need for revenue raising tax reform. If we had a little more revenue. the need for new debt legislation would disappear. It is also appropriate that this opportunity to provide a meaningful and immediate social security increase be taken. Frankly. we can be sure that the President will veto almost any tax reform legislation. When the Secretary of the Treasury was asked in the Ways and Means Committee whether the President would veto the weak minimum tax amendments he proposed this spring. the Secretary could not answer with immediate and definite certainty. We saw last year how the President threatened to veto the social security increase unless it was scaled downbut later he took credit for that same increase. Now that he cannot stand for election. I believe that he will veto any kind of social security increase which occurs prior to July 1. 1974. the next fiscal year. It is clear that if we really want tax reform and adequate social security. we must attach those provisions to a vetoproof bill such as this public debt ceiling bill. During the past week. I understand that many Members have been deluged with complaints from the oil industry about the effect of this legislation on their industry. It is time that we look at the record of \".he oil industry. If an industry is facing shortages. Government investigations. and possible antitrust suits one would think that its profits would go down. However. the reverse is true with the oil industry. For the third quarter of 1973. at the same time that the petroleum industry was begging for price increases from the Cost of Living Council. the major oil companies were posting profit increases of 59 to 91 percent over the same quarter a year ago. This is not a onetime phenomenon. Following is a table showing the second quarter profits of the Nations 10 largest oil companies compared with their profits in 1972:",

In April 1972. at the then Treasury Secretary John Connallys ranch to which the great tax avoiders of the Nation were invited. the President solemnlyand I am speaking from the White Houses own tapes on thispromised them that the only thing wrong with the oil depletion allowance and the rapid depreciation loophole was that they were not big enough. With a White House attitude like that. the Members can see a veto surely attending any serious efforts by this body. So. the way to achieve tax reform. and the way to begin to plug loopholes. is by voting down the previous question today. and thus sending to the White House in vetoproof shape a debt ceiling bill with the responsible addition thereon of tax reform. which is truly related to the debt ceiling. because the more we can make tax avoiders pay at least a pittance to the treasury. the less it is necessary to stand still for these additional endless increases in the national debt. Therefore. I would urge Members who are genuinely concerned with tax reform to give us a break. and go along with us on the motion on the previous question.",

I have introduced nine bills in this vital area which have been cosponsored by 65 fellow Members of Congress. and have received a great deal of support from firefighters nationwide. To keep you abreast of recent developments in fire safety I would like to bring to your attention an article appearing in the March issue of International Fire Fighter. It appears that Dr. Dressler. of Harvard University. and his team of researchers are near a major break in the mystery surrounding death by smoke inhalation. Their research has shown that modern fibers and plastics produce colorless. odorless fumes when burned which cause a dramatic rise in the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Not only do these fumes create a deadly atmosphere in less than a minute after ignition. but also make most smoke detector systems obsolete. Dr. Dresslers tests have also shown that the present method used by plastics manufacturers to determine flammability and burning rates of their products is invalid. This article reinforces the reasons for toxicity standards or other regulations that would require labeling for a fabric. related material. or product that may be needed to protect the public against unreasonable risk of death or personal injury from toxic byproducts by burning of thermal degradation of the fabric. related material. or product. My bill. H.R. 116. would provide the means. for not only safeguarding the public from the occurrence of fire. but also address itself to the clear and present dangers associated with the burning of todays highly toxic materials.",

I commend him for a fine statement in support of efforts to restore fiscal sanity in Federal spending. Indeed. the Senator is correct in warning Senators that the American people will render a harsh verdict on those who. in the days and weeks ahead. continue to cast votes which unquestionably churn up a new spiral of inflation. For Senators who may be unaware of it. I would like to call attention to a poll conducted last month by Lou Harris. By a.margin of 59 to 28 percent. the people agree that \"President Nixon is right in saying that inflation cannot be controlled unless Federal spending is cut to the bone.\" An earlier Harris poll found that 74 percent of the people believe Federal spending is the greatest single cause of inflation. Obviously. Mr. President. the people know where the responsibility lies. They know that it is up to this Congress to hold the line on spending. The Harris poll. in February. indicated that the public thinks. 51 to 37 percent. \"Congress is wrong in opposing the Presidents spending program and should cooperate more with him.\" Senators should be mindful. in casting their votes this spring. that this same poll found the public giving Congress negative marks for its performance by a margin of 45 to 38 percent. while giving President Nixon positive marks for his first 4 years in office by 59 to 37 percent. Mr. President. the American people are sick and tired of extravagant. wasteful Federal spending. They are sick and tired of seeing their tax dollars being squandered by the legions of Federal bureaucrats who administer those ineffective and other worldly programs which have been so heedlessly enacted over the years. And the people are sick and tired of their representatives in Congress who cling to the old bureaucracybuilding philosophy of spend. spend. spend. I said that the American people are going to render a harsh verdict on these Members.

I have noticed here that every day the word \"impound\" Is referred to.

What my old high school teacher is pointing out is that the Congress is striving to create a credit card government. I think she is quite accurate when she says that perhaps the word we should use is \"save\" rather than \"impound.\" Furthermore. I would say that if we look at the enormous Federal debt already run up that represents money borrowed and spent by Congress and by various administrations. the interest on the money already borrowed and spent is $40.000 a minute. which comes to over $666 a second.

Earlier I asked that that be stricken because I noted in the comments I made last week that it was pubone word. namely. worthless. What I said last week was that the dollar was worth lesstwo words. I do not imply that the dollar is worthless. Of course. it is not. But I do say that is is worth less. After today. I shall try not to use that expression because it is susceptible to misuse particularly when the typesetters put those two words together instead of spacing them cut. But the dollar has become less valuable. It has become less valuable. in my judgment. because of the policies of the Federal Government in running these smashing Government deficits.",

I cannot condone a requirement that the surface owner consent to surface mining where that ownership has been severed from ownership of the underlying coal. Protection of the rights of a surface owner is important. but I believe if the committee bill goes unamended. the mere fact that a surface owner holds such rights over a coal deposit would result in large windfall benefits from property that he does not own. His veto over the right to mine someone elses coal will be worth whatever a mining company will pay for it. The people of America need the energy which comes from coal. The people of America own vast resources of coal in many western States. title being in the Federal Government. Language now in the bill gives a lucky surface owner a veto over the peoples right to mine their own coal. Language now in the bill provides unjust enrichment to the surface owner at the expense of American consumers. It will add to the scarcity of coal and the high price of coal. The Johnson amendment will not only provide more coal and help keep coal prices down. but will prevent an Inequity. will prevent windfall profits to a lucky few at the expense of all American citizens. The Johnson amendment. which I support and urge adoption of. does two things: First. where the rights in the coal have been severed and held by another party. this amendment removes any requirement that the consent of a surface owner be obtained. Second. where the coal has been reserved to the United States. the amendment requires consent of the surface owner or the posting of a bond to cover the damages to a surface owner caused during the mining process. This amendment will make it possible to mine coal where the land can be reclaimed and where the surface owner can be repaid for an injury he may suffer. But it will keep the cost of the coal so mined reasonable and uninflated by unjust enrichment.",

I speak of written consent in the East where the focus is on private minerals and private property owners. This amendment would overturn law in the East. both case law and State law. The question of written consent is handled either by law or by the courts in a number of these StatesOhio. Kentucky. and Pennsylvania. for example. So the bill as written would overturn State law in a number of Eastern States in the United States and overturn court decisions where this problem of written consent has already been resolved. I cannot help but add my comments to those of the gentleman from North Caroline regarding lands in the West. The legislation as it is on the books today would certainly require the consumers of this country to pay a second price for the minerals to the surface owners in the West. The value of those minerals is rising. The amount of money a surface owner in the West will collect from minerals he never owned is going to be a stupendous figure in years to come. The Western surface owner who never owned those minerals is going to be paid more and more and more for the mineral values he did not own. and those moneys are going to come out of the hide of the American taxpayer. They are going to come out of the hide of the utility consumer. This is a great bill for the surface owner in the West who never owned the minerals. but God help the American taxpayer.",

I do not believe Congress or any State government has ever given eminent domain of such broad scope to a private individual. to a private company. against the property rights of a landowner.

I would hope that the Presidentand he can do it under the broad authority he hasin connection with the implementation of the mandatory amendment that is now pending. would provide. in his discretion. for relief of stripper wells. I make that as a part of our colloquy here and a part of the legislative record. I hope that the President. in the fulfillment of the legislative intentas expressed by the Senate previously. when the Bartlett amendment was adoptedwould implement it in the context of the discretionary authority that he now has under existing law. All I am trying to do is to avoid bogging this amendment down with amendments which will not be acted upon by the House. The House is going to act on S. 1570 in September. What is critical is what is going to happen in the month of August. in the peak of the period when we have real fuel shortage problems facing many parts of this country.",

It is my hope that the administration. or whoever is responsible for administering any allocation program. and I believe it is Governor Love who is now the energy czar. so to speak. will bring about what the Senator from Oklahoma seeks in his amendment to be done. My concern is. and I have to rely on the Senator from Washington. that in light of the rules in the House. unless we stay with the kind of trimmed down. shortcut measure that the Senator from Washington would sponsor here. without the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. we will get nothing.

I asked the Senator to yield because the question of the FTC authority has been raised and the question of expiration has been raised. and there are two expiration periods. one under section 105. which is the expiration date for the authority to enforce and to allocate. That expiration date is February 28. 1975. very clearly spelled out. but the limitation on the authority of the FTC. which also has been brought into question. is simply contained implicitly in the language. and not explicitly. It says the FTC has authority during the 45day period. beginning with the effective date of the regulation. to do the things that are set forth in that section. Then we provide further that at the expiration of 60 days. it shall report its findings based on what it found in that 45day period.

My staff and I have benefited greatly from the experience and it has given me the opportunity to communicate more effectively with the elderly in my district. For 2 weeks this spring. Mr. and Mrs. Chester Edwards of Anderson. Ind.. served as congressional interns in my Washington office. In addition to attending briefings and meetings with committee and individuals involved with matters relating to the elderly. the Edwardses became acquainted with the everyday happenings in a congressional office. They became a part of my staff and reported each morning to their desk and proceeded to work on their assignments. Upon their return to Indiana. my interns wrote a report on their thoughts and experiences while in Washington. (It was printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 22. 1974.) This report is now being mailed to senior citizens in my district and distributed by the Edwardses when they meet with senior citizen organizations. We need to involve ourselves with the elderly and allow them to involve themselves with us. Parceling them out to old age and retirement homes is not the answer. All over this great land of ours. citizens are complaining about the lack of community. the lack of caring in our towns and cities. Maybe one reason is because we are not utilizing the experience and wisdom of all our human resources. particularly our elderly. A community where the elderly do not play an important and central role is not really a community. Our elderly have lived where we have not. have lived when we have notthey can teach us much and we should begin to listen. The elderly in this country are assuming a new importance that they have never known. Nationwide. those 65 and older make up 10 percent of our population. This amounts to well over 20 million people and this figure has grown seven times since the beginning of the century.

A broad consensus exists. in and out of Congress. that major reforms are necessary. and a variety of such reforms are pending in legislative form. Yet. the Congress is strangely reluctant to act. This preoccupation with symptons at the expense of remedies stands in sharp contrast to the impressive record of constructive activity in most State capitals. According to the June 11 Wall Street Journal. no less than 67 campaign reform measures have been enacted by 40 State legislatures in the past 18 months. Those same 18 months have produced exactly nothing from the national legislature. Despite the persistent myth that the Nations talent and brains and concern are headquartered in Washington. this record once again illustrates the contrary fact: that the States have more than their share of these qualities and. more importantly. possess the indispensable commitment to respond positively to the wellfounded concerns of their citizens. Lest the Congress become forgetful of the fact. Mr. Speaker. those same citizens are also citizens of the United States and constituents of those who represent them in the Congress.

These loans are vital to feed lot operators. I also concur in the recommendations that the Federal Government introduce a beef purchase program for military and school lunches. Most importantly. I ask that you exercise your authority in reimposing strict import quotas on beef and livestock products which compete with those in this Country. As you know. I have consistently supported this safety valve and the present situation underscores the need to reimpose these quotas. Your cooperation and assistance in this matter are vital.

They say that until last year. the number of independent producers has been going down and down and down. despite the fact that they have had subsidies. So subsidies are not the answer.

How can that be. when we are so far ahead of the other nations of the world in the amount of exploration and development? We have gone to other countries and have assisted them with our technology. That has come about because we have had the financial incentive. The depletion allowance was one of the greatest incentives to the wildcatter. to the small independent. and that is why he has drilled 75 or 80 percent of the wells. When the Senator says we do not need it. I think he is talking about an entirely different picture. If he is talking about the major oil companies. I know that one of the major oil companies made a statement that they did not need it. But they said they did not want to be harassed any more. so they would just as well do without it. We do not know what the prices are going to be in the future. This is not an offagain. onagain program. We are in a difficult situation today. I think the Senator agrees that we face shortages next winter. We do not know what is going to happen. We have to import 35 percent of our petroleum. If we had handled the FPC on the same basis we handled the depletion allowance. we would not be in this fix today. because we would have greater drilling. we would have deeper wells. we would have natural gas at a decent price. we would have coal. and the other products would have come forward along with these fuels.

Prior to the time it was lowered the price was in a plateau. and the price of crude oil in 1957 was $3.09 a barrel. Then it went down and did not regain that $3.09 a barrel until 1969. at which time Congress saw fit to reduce the depletion allowance which had the direct effect of reducing the price equivalent by 17 cents a barrel. This is why we had the decline in the number of independents from 20.000 to 10.000. profits were not there. The majors went overseas and explored because there was a chance to make a profit there.

Individual crimes are well cared for under the domestic law in the United States and our ratifying this treaty will not help much in other countries. Since complicity of government is not required. but only the act of a single individual. what occurs is that domestic crimes become international offenses and immediately politics and racism- enter the picture. The Black Panthers and other extremists wili be wanting to bring charges in international courts against the President. against a Governor. against an Attorney General. This will stir up unnecessary misunderstandings and not work in the best interests of the Nation. We really need no proof that the United States opposes genocide. I served 3 years overseas in World War II against genocide and many an American has given the supreme sacrifice. This is the best proof of Americas commitment. much better than a treaty. We could welcome a treaty if it were clear and convincing but to ratify a document that is confusing. that is looked upon by reasonable men as meaning different things but clearly appears to me to make international offenses out of domestic crimes and opens the door for racial. ethnic. religious. and nationalistic embroilments would create an atmosphere for genocide rather than clear the world of this scourge.",

It takes only 20 nations adopting the convention for the convention to be operative. and they have 78. So if it is such a good idea. why have they not gone forward with It? I challenge them to show one single constructive act done under this convention--one single instance of the crime of genocide being punished in any of these nations that have adopted the convention and that have defined genocide. Apparently it is serving no useful purpose in the other nations of the world. and I see no occasion for the United States putting the necks of our citizens in a noose to subject them to possible penalties under such a court. when. as. and if it is set up.

When a program decreases by about 35 percent. that means that many youngsters who were getting loans are no longer receiving them. From correspondence we receive. it appears that many youngsters could well be dropping out of college. This was and still is an emergency situation. That is why we took the unusual action of acting on the Housepassed bill as we did. I can assure those who are concerned that the Senate does not intend to allow the authority under the Tydings amendment to lapse. Indeed. I said this on the first day of this session in a record statement. However.

As the chairman indicated. there were some 53 stated allegations being investigated by the staff. and I was somewhat dumbfounded as a newcomer on the committee to learn that the Committee on the Judiciary had not itself first voted to instruct the staff to investigate these allegations before the staff selected and took off on them of their own volition. When I learned that the staff had gone into these 53 areas without committee instruction or direction. I could hardly believe it. They might have gone into 153 or 253 areas if they had had sufficient taxpayers funds to pay for their investigations. I think this procedure was wrong and that the Committee on the Judiciary was derelict In not specifically instructing the staff as to the allegations it wanted investigated. The committee as a whole did not so instruct the staff. It was no wonder that the staff informed the committee at our last meeting that some of the allegations were not worthy of any more of the staffs consideration. Hopefully. after we vote this money. which we will. the staff will get some instruction from the full Committee on the Judiciary as to which allegations the elected members of the committee wish to be pursued by the staff.",

It also directs that the FEA shall \"assemble. evaluate. and analyze\" such information. Most importantly it provides for public disclosure of such information in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. 5 U.S.C. 552. The conference report states on page 30: The conference substitute incorporates a provision authorizing disclosure of confidential information under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to persons performing functions under this act. or in court proceedings. It also requires public disclosure. upon request. of information of the type which could not be excluded from public annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In other respects. the Freedom of Information Act will govern. The Administrator may withhold matters within the exemptions provided by that act. but there is nothing in the conference substitute requiring him to do so. In determining whether to disclose information under the Freedom of Information Act. the conferees expect that the Administrator will -give consideration. among other things. to his affirmative duty imposed by section 14(a) to keep the public Informed. - At this juncture. I think it important to note subsection (c) of .5 U.S.C. 552 which reads as follows: This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public. except as specifically stated in this section. This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress. That subsection makes it clear that the nine \"exemptions\" in the act do not apply to Congress.

Persons with medium sized and larger cars will be penalized most by this action. inasmuch as a number of smaller cars have only 10gallon tanks. Nothing will change for smaller car owners. But as sensible as the trend to smaller cars isand it is sensibleeveryone who drives a larger car cannot be expected to Immediately go out and trade his vehicle for a compact or a subcompact. The 10gallon limit seems to me another piece of evidence that the administration is floundering badly In its belated efforts to deal with a crisis that the administration was warned months ago was coming.",

Where is there a shred of evidence that the men who were alive are now dead? For our government to presume that men who were known to be captive are no longer alive relieves Hanoi from the responsibility of any accounting and we will be left just as the families were in Koreanever knowing what happened to our loved ones.

    "speech": "Mr. President. thousands of jobs in California and elsewhere may be lost if energy and fuel shortages impact on American business and industry as many economists predict. The new mandatory fuel allocation program gives us some breathing room. But only a little. Without it Los Angeles County could lose from 100.000 to 200.000 jobs almost immediately. Here is how: Contingency plans drawn up by the administration in event of severe fuel shortages include limiting industrial operations to 50 hours a week. The ripple effect of massive layoffs could create social and economic chaos with many thousands more unemployed. and incredible hardships for workers. families. and businesses. Fortunately that will be forstalled by the allocation program which will insure that Los Angeles gets its fair share of whatever fuels are available. We must add additional supplies of oil for consumer use and new sources of usable energy. Just before the Christmas recess. the Senate passed a measure opening up the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve near Bakersfield to supply 160.000 barrels of oil a day for civilian use. Both Senator TUNNEY and I have long fought for this move. I think we can take this amount from our military and defense supplies for 1 year without adversely affecting overall defense needs. Producing oil from from Elk Hills in the amount I mentioned for a year would deplete the total supply by less than 5 percent of its total 1 billion barrels in reserve. A bonus with the Elk Hills oil is that it is low in sulfur and will not aggravate the smog problem in the Los Angeles basin. There are already mounting layoffs in many southern California industries. particularly in plastics and other \"petrochemical\" dependent enterprises. There will probably be many more layoffs next year. with or without an Arab oil boycott. We must make proper use of the conventional fuels in reserve. And we must begin a crash program for developing new sources of energy. I am particularly interested in the potential of solar and geothermal energy. Most important. we must keep our factories and manufacturing producing at full capacity to avoid a terrible wave of joblessness on top of an energy crisis.",

I undertook an extensive public information program. I responded to the scores of letters concerned with my three proposals with a cogent analysis published in the Catholic University Law Review entitled. \"Toward A National Growth Policy.\" In the last few months we have all seen the fruition of those efforts. The Congressional Research Service will soon hold its second series of seminars on national growth policy.

India is the largest and the most powerful nation in the subcontinent and also happens to be the largest democracy in the world. The Prime Minister of India has made It very clear that her country needs this outside assistance. For the United States at this point to cut off all aid to India would not affect Indias nuclear program in any way and it would serve no real useful purpose. Beyond that. we lose any leverage that we might have with India in trying to help her to restrain development of nuclear weapons. There has been no significant transfer of economic resources by India from domestic purposes to nuclear explosions. India has an overall budget of about $60 billion and the total cost of the nuclear explosion was about $10 million. That is about onetenth of 1 percent of Indias budget.

This bill permits the CIA to engage in covert activities only after the President reports about these activities to the House and Senate committees dealing with foreign affairs and the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Despite the improvement. I still think these provisions are seriously deficient.

Thus. the President is empowered to authorize CIA actions to subvert foreign governments basically when he thinks it would be desirable.

My amendment would permit the CIA to engage in nonintelligencegathering activities only when such activities are \"vital to our national defense.\" My amendment would thus limit the instances in which the CIA would run afoul of international law. and also we would be limiting the instances in which foreign policy is in essence being created by the President. the CIA. and four committees of Congress.

They have rejected the pleas of the United Nations. rejected the pleas of our State Department and have also rejected the pleas of this Congress. Now. the Drug Enforcement Administration says that as a result of this. we can expect from a 10- to 30percent increase in opium on our streets of New York. There are no safeguards to the resumption of opium in this country. and it seems to me that we have gone through enough in crime and loss of life in the military and in the cities. Now is the time for us to stand up and be included and tell the Turkish Government that until our President can certify that they have some safeguards to protect us. then we should cut off aid to the Government of Turkey.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. our commitee has spent considerable time on the issue of narcotics. We were the first to propose languagewhich is now lawdirecting that aid be cut off from countries which refuse to cooperate in putting an end to illegal traffic in narcotics. Our special subcommittee did very thorough investigative work in this field. Our committee is deeply concerned about illegal trade in narcotics. and we have authorized substantial funds to help in the fight against such trade. For these reasons. I believe we should wait and negotiate with the Turks. not try to put permanent blocks in the way of mutual cooperation. May I explain a bit more to the Members: I supported the resolution which expressed the sense of Congress to cut off aid to Turkey if they went back to opium poppy production. The problem we have under the language of this amendment is that it tells the President to cut off aid unless the Government of Turkey is implementing effective controls to prevent opium grown in Turkey from illegally reaching the United States. either directly or indirectly. The real problem is there is not a government in Turkey with which one could effectively negotiate. They have a caretaker government. They cannot make a serious decision of any kind. and. as a result. one cannot implement the intent of Congress either with this amendment or as it affects Cyprus. The Government of Turkey is a daytoday operation. Until they resolve their present problems. the President cannot negotiate. even if they have intentions of good faith. because they are not in a position to do anything with us. There are enough other safeguards. enough other bills in this Congress. and I urge the defeat of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today Congressman CHARLES RANGEL and I have introduced legislation entitled \"The Federal Grand Jury Reform Act of 1973.\" Because of the extreme importance of the grand jurys role in our criminal justice system. I wish to take this opportunity to call my colleagues attention to the bill. During the last few years there has been growing concern among those involved in the judicial process that the grand jury has ceased to serve its traditional role as a guardian of individual rights and an instrument of truth. and instead has become an instrument used to harass political dissidents and quash opposition to governmental activity. As a result. there have been calls for both the reform of the grand jury and for its complete abolition. The Grand Jury Reform Act of 1973 answers these calls. Both Congressman RANGEL and I believe that the grand jury can serve a vitally important role as an arbiter of governmental prosecution. and as such it should be preserved. But .changes must be made in the current grand jury system. and our legislation would make the necessary changes. The fifth amendment to the Constitution states: No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime. unless a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.... At the time the Constitution was adopted. the grand jury had become accepted as a screening device to allow prosecution of only those persons whom it had probable cause to believe were guilty of a crime. Given the Founding Fathers fears of an oppressive Federal Government. it is not surprising that they would include the grand jury requirement in the document designed specifically to protect individual rights. Unfortunately. the grand jury of today bears little resemblence to the grand *jury of 1789. Then. the grand jury was a truly independent body initiating prosecutions through presentments based on the personal observation and knowledge of its members. The royal prosecutor was not only allowed into the grand jury room. Today. the prosecutor is not only allowed into the grand jury room. he totally dominates the proceedings. Rather than an independent body conducting inquests and preferring charges on its own initiative. today we have a grand jury that is used as an investigatory tool for the prosecutor. The grand jury hears the witnesses asked questions the prosecutor wants to ask. The grand jury witness. denied benefit",

I wish to make my feelings known to you as I am a veteran of the Vietnam conflict and served during the 1968 Tet Offensive. It is my opinion and that of the V.F.W. that amnesty is not a matter for the Congress to decide. Laws govern cases of draftdodging. desertion and leaving the country illegally. These men must face the courts. I am opposed to the granting of any general amnesty. No American should expect more than justiceno American need settle for anything less. Amnesty means forgiveness.

A 21cent postage stamp is being issued today in honor of Amedeo Peter Giannini who was the founder of regional branch banking in America. Mr. Giannini. like myself. was the American born son of Italian immigrant parents. He retired from active participation in his family produce business to establish a branch of the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. Calif.. in 1904. He actively solicited the business of small depositors and offered liberal terms for loans to farmers and small businessmen. He was able to salvage sufficient gold and securities after the earthquake in 1906 to make a significant contribution toward the rebuilding of the city. In 1909 he established his first regional branch bank in San Jose. Calif.. and within 1 year. he had doubled the size of his bank through mergers and purchases. In 1928. he organized the Transamerica Corp.. as a holding company for the stock of all Giannini banks. and this corporation went on to become the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. By 1948 this had become the largest bank in the United States with 517 branches and assets of more than $6.000.000.000. It is only fitting that the stamp bearing a portrait of Amedeo Giannini will be printed in banknote green. It will create a living memorial to a man who made such an important contribution to our American economic system.",

The first portion$650.000will be in preparing for trial and in the acquisition of a computer based data retrieval system for use in the antimonopoly litigation now pending against the eight major oil companies. The FTC lawyers handling this litigation estimate that they will receive some 3 million documents or approximately 25 million pages of material. The Commission assures me that if they do not have this system. they will function with a severe and potentially decisive disadvantage. This request for $650.000 is not one for an experimental system. It has been carefully planned and researched by the FTC for several months. This litigation against Exxon. Texaco. Gulf Standard of Indiana. Standard of California. Mobil. Shell. and Arco will involve millions. It is probably the most important antitrust litigation since that which broke uP the Standard Oil \"trust\" in 1911(U.S. v. Standard Oil. 211 U.S. 1. By comparison. Control Data in its recent case against IBM spent an estimated $15 million on such a system. That litigation did not involve the economic interests which. the oil litigation presents. I am informed that the defendants in this case will have such a system. Not to give the consumers representative adequate tools to. effectively present the Governments case is indefensible. Further. this failure of the appropriations committee to approve this request affects a particular litigation effort. This is. a dangerous precedent. It is policy making of the highest order. a power that is not in the Appropriations Committee. The second program is the energy study mandated by Congress last year. $364.000 is needed to. complete this study. This is a study of the gas. coal. and nuclear energy industries. We are asked daily to enact legislation which would affect these alternatives to oil. To do so without hard data is to my mind irresponsible. Thbe Congress voted for this program last yearLR. 8616.

Exhaustive public hearings were held last spring and many hours were spent in executive session in an attempt to report a comprehensive and coherent bill which would have bipartisan support. I believe that we have been successful in this endeavor. Under H.R. 9142. a nonprofit Federal National Railway Association would restructure a new northeast system froln the remnants of the six bankrupt carriers. and would provide financial aid for the purchase and upgrading of rail facilities. A privatelyheld Federal Rail Corporation would operate the new system. This legislation represents a middle ground between a completely private reorganization and Government operation of these lines. During the hearings. it became clear that any restructuring based solely on the profit motive would necessitate the abandonment of most of the service in the northeast. The legislation further provides that the preservation of vital shortline railroads will be a major goal of the restructured system. While the input for the final bill came from many sources. the House owes a special debt of gratitude to two members of the subcommitteethe gentleman from Washington and the gentleman from Montana . Through their diligent work these members provided a bipartisan stewardship for this legislation. with the result that the bill has been endorsed by both rail management and rail labor. as well as by the overwhelming majority of the members of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Last night the President addressed the Nation on the grave energy crisis which we are facing. The imminent shutdown of the bankrupt railroads poses the threat that millions of tons of railroad freight would be diverted to gasolinepowered trucks. From the standpoint of the energy crisis. from the standpoint of the environment. from the standpoint of the countless shippers and passengers who rely on this essential service. H.R. 9142 must be enacted. I urge my colleagues to give prompt approval to this urgently needed legislation.",

Recently. I had a long conversation with one of the people in the administration who is resigning because of his disgust over this policy. He has had some responsibility for keeping in close touch with it. He said that we have evidence the enemy insurgents in Cambodia know about the B52 strikes before they take place. It is information that comes from the Cambodian general staff when they request an air strike. and where the requirement that there be some precaution taken in the strikes does have the effect of providing leaks. Almost invariably. the military forces on the other side. who are supposed to be interdicted. get out of the road. All they have to do is to move into another quadrant. The B52s come in and do their bombing over a certain quadrant. but the insurgent forces are gone long before they get there. Any military personnel are out of that area. What are left are the innocent civilians who do not have that information in time. so that their homes are destroyed. their rice paddies disruptedand this is an area where a tremendous amount of rice is grown. so that supplies of rice become deficient. As the Senators Subcommittee on Refugees has demonstrated. we have driven well over a third of the people out of their homes to get away from the bombing.

He refused. during that exchange. to give absolute assurance that this might not take place in the North. I am wondering whether the Senator from South Dakota believes that the American people really understand the danger as much as they should. that there really is. at least within the administration. of an open attitude toward perhaps losing additional planes and additional American flyers and additional American prisoners of war.

It is very important that without any undue delay. we move to put some restrictions on the administration so that we do not have to take steps that could reinvolve us in another major war in Indochina. If American planes are shot down over Cambodia. or we renew the bombing of North Vietnam and our planes artf shot down. as they inevitably would be. then we have the same old dilemma again. that of American prisoners of war being taken. and the argument being made again by our policymakers that we cannot ease off our bombing until we achieve the release of our prisoners of war. as happened several months ago.

I suppose we could be bombing parts of the Philippines where the insurgents there have made statements in opposition to American Government policy. or we could be involved in bombing any number of places that I can think of in Southeast Asia.

These children have been termed \"autistic\"-and although they may appear normal outwardly. they live in a world apart from others. seemingly inaccessible. These children are multihandicapped in their ability to receive and communicate information. Although some display amazing feats of memory. their robotlike insistence on daily routine makes this condition one of the most puzzling of medical mysteries. There is no known cause or cure for autism. although a large and growing body of research indicates that a biochemical error may be at the root of this disorder. The Maryland Society for Autistic Children describes these children as \"seemingly unresponsive to the usual give and take of parentchild relationships.\" They said: Like deafblind children they are often hyperactive. their behavior hard to manage. Public outings. even for such necessities as buying shoes. can leave a wake of upset and angry shopkeepers who believe the child (who looks so normal) to be Just a \"spoiled brat\" and berate the parent for the childs unacceptable social behavior. Some scream for hours. No amount of effort on the parents part can comfort them. Many can go for days with little sleep or food. A few are so disruptive they require permanent hospitalization. The last 10 years has brought success in reaching these children. Special education and vocational training efforts suited to their needs have benefited autistic children. However. these children are victims not only of an illness. but of a neglectful society when they are deprived of opportunities provided normal children. By setting aside this week we can further educate society to recognize autisms signs. and make a renewed effort to learn more about the cause and cure for autism. Mr. Speaker.

Many of the jobless have families to support. children to educate. shelter. and clothe.

We have a responsibility to the people we serve to help them in times of temporary difficulty. Recognizing this responsibility. my colleagues and I introduced the Emergency Jobs Act of 1974. legislation we are addressing today. The intent is to provide job opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed. to place over $2 billion at the disposal of State and local governments to help jobless Americans.

Certain public sector departments. such as hospitals. police departments. and libraries. readily lend themselves to this concept which has proven successful in the private sector and as an ongoing experiment in the Social Security Administration in Baltimore. Flexible. fulltime hours would benefit working parents. especially single working parents. who must coordinate the opening and closing of day care centers or schools. or babysitters arrival. with bus schedules and still work an 8hour day that might start precisely at 8 a.m. Under flexible hours provisions an employee could work any continuous 8 hours. with the understanding that flexible hours employment should not be used to undermine overtime and other benefits to regularly scheduled employees.

The only thing that my amendment does is to delete the first group of workers from benefits under title II.

My amendment has been carefully coordinated with the Ways and Means Committee bill and reflects agreement between the Committees on Education and Labor and Ways and Means.

Therefore. to suggest that by having unemployment compensation. the family needs are totally covered would be a misinterpretation. I think. of what actually exists within many family units in certain parts of the country. For that reason. I would suggest that the gentlemans amendment is faulty. The second factor is that when you consider the relationship of the family unit. there are some cases in which there may be one spouse or another spouse employed. Therefore. there is another variable there. in terms of one or two spouses within the family unit working. in which the gentlemans amendment may be faulty. As the bill is now drafted. we recognize that preference should be given to those individuals who are the longterm unemployed. and to a degree. to those who are the most needy. and we took into account those individuals whose unemployment insurance coverage expired. However. to suggest that we should mandate in this restrictive manner would be counterproductive to particular individual cases which I have described. For that reason.

Mr. Chairman. earlier this afternoon we voted on a bill which would extend benefits to those who had exausted their unemployment payments. We passed an entire piece of legislation to extend their time of eligibility. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New York is totally consistent with that concept. and it is very important to keep that contention in mind. If we do not adopt this amendment. we are approving the furtherance of the \"cousin George\" situation. Mayor X has a cousin George who has been out of work. and he wants to give cousin George a job. Unless this amendment prevails. Mayor X can use this program almost as a personal fiefdom for jobs for his friends. Actually. how many people would be affected by this particular amendment? I am told that depending upon the amount of money appropriated and the length of time the jobs last. there may be 140.000 to 280.000 people who may come under this program. Yet. there are millions of people unemployed. That is why we should be talking about helping those who are most in need. If this amendment is not passed. there is no absolute requirement in the bill that would guarantee that these jobs will go to those most in need. Even those of us who are concerned about the basic concept of the bill know that if the bill is to be passed. we ought to help those who need it the most. It should not be political. it should not be discretionary. it should be mandatory to help the people who need it the most. Lastly. this amendment fulfills the Biblical admonition that the last shall be first. It should not be the first who get preference. This is an amendr.ent we can all support. and it should be supported. I hope the Members who voted earlier today for the bill to extend unemployment coverage will now be consistent and support this amendment.",

So. we adopted the language that is in the bill. The word \"preference\" is very clear. Prior to this. we had \"special consideration.\" We did not think that was strong enough. so we went to \"preference.\" We have to give some flexibility. as the gentleman from Washington was talking about. to the prime sponsor in handling this.

We will pay the price for that mistake far into the next century. We can thank Senator FULBRIGHT that its cost was not higher in every regard. Senator FULBRIGHT was the first American leader to oppose our foreign aid program. He recognized it for what it is: A massive military aid program we cannot afford. We know now that he was correct. And it is my understanding that Senator FULBRIGHT was first to oppose the excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the dark chapter he wrote in the Nations history.

Is it any wonder why Congress has received a positive rating of only 21 percent of the American people? If the people were aware that Congress for years has had absolutely no formal mechanism through which it could make the rational fiscal decisions which need to be made. they would have surely voted its Members out. and well they should. For Congress has flatly ignored its constitutional responsibility to manage the taxpayers money. The 93d Congress. Mr. Speaker. deserves much credit for recognizing the danger of this blindmans approach to fiscal matters and for doing something to correct it. The special joint committee developed a comprehensive plan for reform that will force Congress to make the necessary fiscal decisions which it has long ignored. Both Houses of Congress deserve the highest praise for passing this legislation. Now. only one final hurdle is left before this historic reform can be put to work for the people of America. Further delay is inexcusable. Denial of final passage is unthinkable. We have gone a long way toward filling the tremendous void of fiscal irresponsibility in the Congress.

It has done so without the benefit of the perspective full budgetary consideration could provide. In that year the Federal debt has increased by billions of dollars. I. for one. believe that this is an unfortunate fact.

In the scope of its misinterpretations. omissions. and mistakes. it Is incredible. The total purport of the argument is that the House conferees abandoned the position of the House. particularly as reflected in the 17 amendments to H.R. 7824 adopted by the House last June. As the author of 11 of those 17 amendments. and as a House conferee. I take absolute exception to that implication. The truth isand I believe my fellow House conferees will support me in this statementwe maintained the substance of the House position in the great majority of vital issues. including most of the critical issues involved in those 17 amendments. I can fully appreciate that some Members will vote against the conference report because either they oppose a legal services program or oppose carrying it on in the form proposed by both the House and Senate bills. But I think it would be a tremendous disservice to the public. and to the Members of the House. if any Members voted against the conference report on the basis of a wildly distorted and almost wholly inaccurate account of its provisions. Accordingly. I shall in these remarks repeat the anonymous factsheet allegations in their entirety together with my commentwhich will be labeled \"comment\"-in order that all Members and the general public will be able to judge the issue fairly:",

This relationship has accorded NWRO such benefits as: free use of office space and facilities. \"house counsel\" services. organizing assistance. drafting and preparation of model legislation. aid for demonstrationshelp both in kind and personnel and resources. I pass over the hundreds of court cases undertaken by legal services seeking liberalized welfare benefits. Our concern is accentuated by the very radical nature and character of NWRO. I am disturbed. but not too surprised. unfortunately. that so few members of the press seem to understand this problem for what it is. I have seen an excellent compilation of news clippings.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. who would think that patients in nursing homes are interested in organizing themselves into disciplined. politically active units? I. for one. would not imagine it. since it is my impression that people in nursing homes are generally there because of their age or general incapacity. And I would be correct: inmates of nursing homes are not organizing themselves into political units. they are being organized. It is an important distinction. because it represents the gap between voluntariness and being used. Our old people are being used by Legal Services attorneys for political purposes. That is a strong charge. but I do not say it carelessly. The AugustSeptember 1972 issue of Clearinghouse Review. an OEO Legal Servicesfunded publication from Northwestern University School of Law. published a lengthy article on the organizing of nursing home occupants. explaining \"why and how nursing home patients should be organized into selfgoverning groups.\" It explained how to approach the patients. \"an organizer simply assumes the role of a friendly visitor.\" Problems may arise like administrators or proprietors will oppose organization. The article went on to tell organizers how to defend themselves against administrators seeking to save their clients from this latest invasion of their peace and quiet. Somehow. Mr. Speaker. it seems unnatural and unkind to try to turn old people into political pawns. That our federally supported Legal Services attorneys and thinktankers engage in and encourage such activities indicates a rather low level of respect. A confidential memo of October 1972. from within OEO. discusses some other problems with nursing home organizing. from a frankly political point of view. I think my colleagues should read that:",

As we vote on the conference report on Legal Services. it should be made clear that I. for one. am not opposed to Legal Services assistance for the truly needy. However. I believe there is a much better way to go about it than by supporting the conference report. My preference. over all. Is for an alternative to the staff attorney system which would be perpetuated by the Legal Services Corporation bill as drafted. Such an alternative is known as judicare. It would permit attorneys full freedom of action. while allowing clients freedom of choice of attorneys. With some effective guidelines regarding political activities. and outside activities. a system like this could conceivably satisfy most major criticism of Legal Services. It would do that by eliminating the poverty law offices. the Legal Services offices. whose only purpose is to seek out business to keep themselves justified in the eyes of their funding source. With a system of judicare. those unable to afford legal attention would receive it. and would be able to choose their attorneys from among the regular. practicing lawyers in the community. There are other alternatives besides judicare. but since judicare has been around the longest. it has been tested already and seems the best bet at this point. John Satterfield. a former chairman of the American Bar Association. circulated a letter earlier this year expressing his preference for the judicare system. Some of his remarks are not appropriate at this time. since they urge support of S. 1990. a bill which failed to receive action in the Senate. In submitting Mr. Satterfields remarks to the RECORD.

During the recent debate in the Senate on daylight saving time. several points were raised about the effects of energy conservation on the frequency and severity of automobile accidents. During the recent Thanksgiving holiday period. the rate of fatal accidents was 20 percent below the statistical predictions for that period. This may prove to be the forerunner of more substantial and permanent reductions in serious and fatal accidents on our Nations highways. It seems quite possible that yearround daylight saving time. reduced gasoline supplies. limitations on Sunday driving. and lowered speed limits. will have some beneficial results. If accidents are reduced. insurance companies will have fewer benefits to pay. If that occurs insurance company savings should no confer windfall profits on those companies. but should be shared with the purchasers of insurance in the form of refunds and lower premiums. I am pleased to learn through this Journal of Commerce article that Allstate Insurance Co.. the countrys second largest automobile insurer. has acknowledged this changing picture and anticipated its possible impact on the insurance industry. Allstate says that if energy conservation measures do result in savings. the company will amend existing policies to permit the company to pay dividends to policyholders. In this way. the consumer may reap some economic benefits from the energy crisis. Allstate does not predict when. or even if. any savings will be realized. What it has done is to voluntarily take a positive step in the interest of the consumertheir own policyholders. I hope the Government will not have to become involved in this effort and that other insurance companies will quickly follow this lead. Mr. President.

The Selmon brothers. described in one national magazine as \"18 feet and 737 pounds of Oklahoma defense.\" are believed by many to be the greatest defensive line ever to come out of one bassinette.

Lucious later explained. \"He was my brothers keeper.\" Oklahomans are justly proud of the Selmon brothers. and I am especially pleased at their accomplishments. because they come from a small rural community in eastern Oklahoma.

President Johnson appointed Nick. then only 29. as administrator of the Maritime Commission where he rapidly gained a reputation for intelligence. integrity and hard work.

His efforts have ranged broadly from lower telephone rates and better service to equal employment opportunities for women and minority groups in broadcast journalism. Perhaps his best known efforts were in reducing the violence in childrens TV programing and prodding the industry to adopt more constructive programs for children.

But I rose to comment on the remarks of the distinguished Senator from New York. the ranking member of the committee who makes valid points with regard to legislation. I think the point in this case is particularly valid because the squaring point under HillBurton for many years has outlived its usefulness. There was a day. in my opinion. when the legislation was first enacted in 1946 or 1947. whenever it was. that statistics showed there needed to be some favored treatment given the less populous areas of the country because there was a deficit of hospital beds in those areas. but figures available on page 42 of the report indicate quite clearly that such is not the case today. We have had a change in the beds per population across the country and now. rather than suffering as they did over 20 years ago. the rural areas of the country have caught up with the more populous and. indeed. have surpassed the more populous areas because they do not need this kind of favorable treatment provided under the squaring bill any more. In this bill. the practical situation was that we could go 50 percent of the way. so now 50 percent of the funds will be divided according to the squaring rule and 50 percent divided by project and population. The House went all the way. so there is an opportunity. perhaps in the conference. to go all the way. but that remains to be seen. In any event. we are moving away from an antiquated formula. As I said. I think the Senators objections are quite valid. Hopefully. one of these days we will go further than half the way from something not quite needed.",

I think it should be pointed out. on page 68 of the report: The total obligational authority in fiscal year 1974 under existing programs is $391.3 million compared with $254 million authorized under S. 2994 for fiscal year 1975. This reduction is made possible through savings achieved through the coordination of planning activities. elimination of duplicative efforts under several different authorities. and a refocussing of priorities under the program to assist in facilities construction. So I think this is a very specific example of how we can save money by taking several categorical programs and dividing them. There is the possibility it will effectuate feasibility to achieve them in this case.

Yes. the FB111 won both competitions. Yet the Air Force has concealed that fact. Why? Because Congress has said we ought to keep the F111 line open so that when we have to make a decision next year about a longrange new bomber we can have a meaningful choice between the FB111 at $17 million a copy and the B1 at $100 million a copy. Secretary Schlesinger was in Germany the other day.

I have a unique opportunity not afforded many Americans. to say what I think about an incidenb that has bothered me and has been mentioned to me by many others this weekend. College football is an American tradition and a tradition at Ohio State University. On Saturday. the game had at stake the Big Ten championship. the trip to the Rose Bowl. and national ranking. The importance of the game was recognized by national television coverage. The national television audience saw a truly great football game. but I do not rise to talk about what was seen. but what was not seen either by the television audience or by 88.525 fans. the largest crowd in the history of the stadium. Part of the pageantry in the stadium and part of the tradition of Ohio State football is the raising of a huge American flag. However. on Saturday. that flag was not raised. and no flag flew from the staff during the game. The reason the flag did not fly was that it might have blocked a shot of one end zone camera. I question whether a slightly less advantageous camera position would have been noticed by the national audience. Far more important. however. it raises the question of whether television was there because of the game. or the game there because of television. The American flags importance lies in its symbolism. The decision not to fly the flag served as symbolism of another sort. It disturbs my sense of value and was a mistake I hope is never repeated. Congressman DEVINE and I are today introducing a resolution commending Ohio State University and its football team for exemplifying those qualities which have made our Nation great.",

Cattle in my own Fourth Congressional District were sold last week for as little as 8 cents per pound live on the hoof. with top calves being sold for around 20 cents per pound. At the same time. hay is being sold for $1.50 per bale. It takes simple arithmetic to realize you cannot buy too many $1.50 bales to feed $80 cows and still remain in business. One avenue of relief proposed and supported by the USDA has been the stepped up purchase of beef for the school lunch program. I heartily join in this increased buying. However. I am somewhat skeptical as to whether or not it will really help domestic producers. On October 17. the USDA bought 5.890.500 pounds of frozen ground beef for the lunch program. Of that total only 529.000 pounds were purchased at noncoastal locations. Over 90 percent of the beef was bought at sea coast locations. The week of October 23 over 95 percent was again purchased at similar locations. This certainly raises a question as to whether this was in fact American beef. Not one pound of beef was purchased in such producing States as Texas and Oklahoma. Only three carloads of beef Were purchased in Nebraska. USDA purchase specifications require the use of meats which originate from animals slaughtered in U.S. plants. I have only the utmost regard for the Department of Agriculture. But can it be that Los Angeles is now the center for cattle raising and slaughter? Have ranchers relocated their operations from Texas to Massachusetts? If American meat producers are going to survive they must have support from their Government. the best support being that it buy their products.",

I say \"fortunately.\" because I believe it is imperative for the United States and the Soviet Union to refrain from a new arms race in the Indian Ocean. Many Americans are concerned that the prospective reopening of the Suez Canal will lead to a significant increase in Soviet naval power in the Indian Ocean. This may prove to be so and. if so. might require an appropriate U.S. response. Yet it is important in the meantime for the United States to refrain from taking any action that would make it more likely that the Russians would take such a destabilizing action. In time. some U.S. naval facilities in the Indian Ocean. along the lines of that proposed by the administration for Diego Garcia. might prove to be in our national interest. It is not in our interest. today. Rather. we should be seeking in all ways to prevent a naval arms race with the Soviet Union. I have returned this week from the Soviet Union. where I raised the issue of limiting arms in the Indian Ocean with top Soviet leaders.

Responding to the economic situation in the Nation. the committee accepted the basic provisions of an amendment that I cosponsored along with 12 other Senators to substantially increase the funding for public service employment programs. Some $325 million in additional appropriations over the Houseapproved $500 million. This will return the appropriations level for fiscal year 1974 to permit some 117.000 additional jobs to be made available across the Nation. The additional funds place well on the road to returning the level of public service employment to the level achieved during the earlier years of the Emergency Employment Act. From testimony to the committee and from the administrations own evaluation contained within the annual report of the Secretary of Labor. it is evident that this program not only was a marked success but it was applauded by cities. States. by labor unions. and by the workers themselves. I am hopeful that In the fiscal year 1975 appropriations we can maintain and increase still further the Federal commitment to assisting men and women obtain Jobs that offer critical community services. In addition. the Appropriations Committee accepted an amendment I introduced to add $10 million to the funding of the community service employment program for older Americans. This increase in the appropriations for fiscal year 1974 for title IX of the Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments of 1973 is a forceful reminder to the Department of Labor that the congressional intent was to establish a separate. categorical. and distinct program to provide parttime community service jobs to workers 55 and older and that special revenue sharing was not deemed to be an acceptable answer to their needs.

They were the agencies which produced the successful model programs and they have demonstrated a capability for lowcost administration of these programs that we want to see continued.

With the passage of the supplemental today. it brings the fiscal 1974 figure some $18 to $19 billion greater than the proposal submitted January a year ago. With that in mind. I voted in the negative. One final word: For the 6year period ending June 30. 1975. the accumulated Federal funds deficit will be $133 billion.

I am happy to see that the Senator from New Jersey agrees with the principle. but. as he knows. what I am saying is that there ought to be something in the law which makes this type of employment available for people who hold these religious beliefs. I. myself. do not happen to be a member of that sect. but I will say that I have found them to be very. very fine people in all the time I have known them. Although I had this bill up before In the committee. I think for something like 6 yearsand I may be just a little wrong on thatI have never had an opportunity to present it on the floor. I have never had an opportunity to present it in committee except once. when it was adopted. All I can say is that. with all due deference to the Senator from Ohioand I think it is unfortunate that he is not hereI do not foresee any opportunity to present this type of amendment in the rest of this session. So I have to take such opportunity as I have. and this is the only bill coming out of the Labor Subcommittee dealing with the NLRA. and it certainly is most germane to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.

If we are talking about a $4.000 level then that may be poorer in one place than in another. Then how much do we need for that child once we have found him and we count the child. then what do we pay? We should. as I say. adjust it. make the uniform adjustment as to educational cost differentials between the States.

I believe the facts here are clear. First. the Green substitute. which I support. would hold harmless the eligible student. based on the current census. This is an eminently fair and sound propositionsound and fair to the majority of States and for the majority of our children. The Quie amendment. which changes the hold harmless formula from 100 percent to 85 percent. is a step in the right direction. It lessens the adverse effects on 29 States in providing a limited hold harmless provision for 21. The Perkins amendment. however. is not a step forward in my judgment. It not only retains the Inequitable holdharmless formula at the 1972 level for State but adds a holdharmless provision at the 1973 level for counties. In New York State. for example. the Perkins amendment would result in a loss for every school district in the State. Mr. Speaker. the principle. is clear. The continuing appropriations measure. if it is not amended here on the floor. will prevent States with increased numbers of disadvantaged children from receiving funds and will give funds to States which have a decreased eligible population. The money should go first and foremost to where it is most needednamely to those areas that have experienced increases in eligible children. Lastly. let me just give the Members the figures as we have them. and then I will yield to the gentleman from New York. Mr. Speaker. under the Green substitute. our estimates show that New York would receive $309 million. under the Quie amendment. $285 million. and under the continuing resolution. unamended. $255 million.

The first thing I want to say to the Senator from South Dakota is that while much of what he says today surely has genuine meaning in light of what has developed over the years. it is important for the RECORD that we not put down what I call the public safety programs as having been antipeople. antidemocratic. as having been an expression of American force and villainy. On the contrary. many of the programs have served very well over the years and have served the public. We train our own police in this country. I was the mayor of a large city once and I spent a good deal of time getting the police trained. not with foreign assistance money. of course. But I happen to be one of those people who believe that we need a police department. Just because someone comes up and says. \"The police have messed me up\" does not mean that he is right. When I ran the police department of a large city. many people thought they should not have been arrested when I thought our biggest mistake might have been that we did not arrest enough people. So I believe in training the police to be responsible individuals. In this instance that we are talking about. foreign assistance to countries and whether American funds should be provided by this Government for those countries for police training there. it is a fact that over the years we have done a good deal of good work. because of the situation which developed in some of those countries. The Committee on Foreign Relations has taken a view in opposition to police training being supported by American dollars. Under section 115. therefore. of the present bill. it says.",

This inequity was originally brought CXX---364--Part 5 to my attention by a constituent who. as the result of a court order. is the sole support and legal guardian of his grandson. Unfortunately. because of the laws deficiency. his grandson does not have the full privileges accorded other military dependents. As an example. every time this sergeant is transferred. he must. out of his own pocket. pay for the travel and moving expenses of his grandson. This is not an isolated case. During the 92d Congress.

There is. however. a serious possibility that without proper protection these resources will be overrun by rampant development. Since coming to the Senate I have worked to preserve many of these areasthe lower Connecticut River Valley. the upper Housatonic River Valley. the Long Island Sound shoreline. Today I introduce legislation to save another endangered resourcethe Shepaug River. This small but extremely beautiful river flows south from Cornwall and Goshen through the quiet communities of Warren. Litchfield. Washington. and Roxbury until it merges with the Housatonic River at Bridgewater. Connecticut and the rest of the Nation will be the poorer if we allow one more priceless natural resource to be squandered. Much of this river remains close to its original state. There is. however. deep and legitimate concern among residents of the area that the rivers days of beauty and tranquility are numbered. I am therefore. introducing today legislation to add the Shepaug River to the National Wild and Scenic River System. Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. the river itself is protected by a prohibition against the construction of power dams and other encroachments. The land alongside the river is protected in three possible ways: First. complete public ownership. second. partial public ownership through acquisition of scenic or other easements. or third. local zoning ordinances. When the legislation was passed in 1968. eight rivers were designated for immediate inclusion in the system and others were chosen for further study for possible future designation. This bill would add the Shepaug River to those now being studied. If approved by Congress. the Department of the Interior will then make a survey of the river to determine whether it should be designated for permanent inclusion in the wild and scenic rivers system. Because of the strong citizen support for adding the Shepaug to the wild and scenic river system and the growing threats to the river. I am hopeful that the Congress will act quickly on this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

Under the proposed bill. the Federal Power Commissions present jurisdiction would be expanded to include oil as well as natural gas and the Commissions regulatory powers would be considerably strengthened. However. the bill in its present form would not give the Commission the authority to regulate the methods of developing or extracting oil and gas nor the rate at which they can be recovered. Such authority is necessary in order to guard against the use of recovery techniques or rates of recovery which might increase the supply of oil over the short run but lead to a smaller percentage of reserves being extracted In the long run. The risk is that the present high price of oil may lead some producers to damage fields by extracting as much oil as they can now on the assumption that oil prices will ultimately fall. An example of this is the recent dispute between the independents and the majors before the Texas Railroad Commission. The large oil companies argued for an increase in the legal rate of extraction. the small producers warned that such an increase would permanently damage the fields and result in less oil ultimately being recovered. My amendment authorizes the Commission to establish standards for methods of developing and extracting onshore. offshore and Continental Shelf oil and gas reserves so that the maximum amount of reserves will be recovered at the lowest reasonable cost to the consumer. These standards would take into account historical rates and methods of recovery. geological conditions. and technological advancements. Included would be such items as maximum efficiency rate of recovery. primary. secondary. and tertiary recovery. and deep wells. We must increase the domestic production of oil and gas as rapidly as possible. But in doing so we must not permit the greed of a few today to result in lower domestic fuel supplies tomorrow.",

This bill was introduced by my colleague. Senator iVIAGNUSON. for himself. myself. and Senator TUNNEY. Senators GOLDWATER. SYMINGTON. STEVENS. and CHILES. have joined us as cosponsors. S. 2495 aims at establishing within the executive branch of Government an improved mechanism. an improved climate. and improved funding for making projections of critical domestic problems which may be susceptible to scientific and technological solutions in whole or in part. It is pointed at bringing into that process careful consideration of the projected availability of the necessary scientific and technological resources to apply to those problems before they become of crisis proportion. Specifically. the technology resources survey would be prepared and maintained to provide an inventory of the Nations scientific. engineering. and technological resources. both current and projected. It would also provide an inventory and projection of critical domestic problems which may be susceptible of resolution by the application of science and technology. Finally. it would use this information to strengthen the economy and contribute to the resolution of such critical domestic problems. A second provision of the bill would authorize NASA and its partners to tackle selected critical domestic problems upon assignment by the President and approval by Congress. Federal research and development efforts have increasingly become reactive and crisis oriented. Chaos and uncertainty seem to be the hallmark of significant portions of federally supported R. & D. The energy crisis underscores this problem. S. 2495 is intended to help avoid the social and economic cost of crisisoriented Federal funding. To aid in evaluating the provisions of the bill. leaders in the scientific and engineering community will be asked to testify. For the hearing next Monday. the witnesses are: Dr. H. Guyford Stever. Director. National Science Foundation and Science Adviser to the President. Dr. James C. Fletcher. Administrator. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Dr. Philip Handler. President.

I am pleased to note that the National Broadcasting Companys television network has filmed a 2hour drama based on Mrs. Wilders most famous work. \"The Little House on the Prairie.\" Jerry Franken. vice president of McFadden. Strauss & Irwin. Inc.. informs me the NBC special will be telecast on Saturday evening. March 30. or its World Premiere series. The film stars Michael Landon of \"Bonanza\" fame. who also is the director of this production. The special program is to serve as a pilot for a continuing series based on Mrs. Wilders works. Mr. Franken says the idea Is to continually stress the need in the Nation today for values and qualities that are meaningful and can provide strength and direction in times of crisis. These values were clearly present in the lives of South Dakotas pioneers. and are clearly values which we would do well to call upon today. I urge that my colleagues and others join me in watching what promises to be a television tribute to pioneering in our American heartland.",

To bring export controls more clearly into the arena of foreign economic policy and to create some consistency between the Trade Reform Act and the Export Administration Act. I have substantially revised both the \"findings\" sections and the policy authorities of the Export Administration Act. In my view this revamping is necessary to adequately empower our Government to deal with the new economic circumstances in which we find ourselves internationally. Specifically. there is an urgent need to have the legislative language governing the use of export controls reflect: The need to be able to respond with export controls of our own to the use of export policies of other goverlnments which are damaging to our domestic economy. The need to address the problems of access to supplies as well as access to markets in international discussions and agreements. The need to have export controls be an integral part of the international trade negotiations within the GATT. and The need to strengthen International rules and institutions dealing with export policies. As the law now stands the authority does not exist to deal with these problems. The legislation I have Introduced fills these loopholes. I refer my colleagues with an interest in these matters to my earlier remarks in the RECORD on February 4 and February 21. The energy crisis and changed world economic conditions as well as the Inflation problem we are experiencing in the United States make these issues of pressing importance.",

Thomas Masaryk was a statesman. a scholar. a moralist. and a successful politician. But more than all of this. he was a man who brought to fruition through his personal tenacity and integrity a lifelong dream to make his country free. Thomas Masaryk was the founder and first president of the Czechoslovak Republic. established at the end of World War I. He guided the Czechoslovak Republic in accordance with democratic principles which he had previously explored in several scholarly works. The keynote of his philosophy was that uncompromised truth is the absolute moral requirement in a democratic system. When he took office as President of the Czechoslovak Republic. he characteristically chose \"Truth Prevails\" as the maxim for his new nation. In 1968 during the Dubcek era in Czechoslovakia people freely made the pilgrimage to Masaryks grave. Masaryk remains today a symbol of Inspiration to all who revere freedom and true national independence.",

I believe that these eloquent words may be applied with equal justice to our police officers at all levelsFederal. State. and localfor they are a thin blue line standing between us and the brutal onslaught of crime and the criminal. It is in this spirit that I wish to share with my colleagues a thoughtful speech delivered by Clarence M. Kelley. the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. before an Outstanding Law Enforcement Officers Award banquet held in Birmingham. Ala.. on February 9.1974. Speaking from personal experience as both a Federal and local policeman. Director Kelley noted that it is not always pleasant to be a police officer in our troubled society and that the physical risk of being a police officer is high. He added: There are many groups and individuals who hate the police. who call the officer vile names. They seek to discredit and impugn our profession. If an officer makes an arrest he is accused of \"brutality.\" If he maintains order during a demonstration he is taunted as a \"bully.\" If he enforces the law he is charged with \"harassment.\" He is called a \"pig.\" and hissed and vilified as he carries out his duties. Yet. as the FBI Director pointed out. our policemen perform their duties with skill. patience. and disregard for their own safety. And they are paying the price for guarding our lives and property. For example. during last year 134 brave officers lost their. own lives as a result of criminal actionall but three of them were local. county. and State officers. This was the highest total of such slayings ever recorded. he said. Mr. President. as a measure of tribute to the bravery and dedicated contribution made to society by our police officers.

There was a great Secretary of Transportation in this country who unfortunately chose to go to Italy and become an Ambassador. John Volpe knew that mass transportation is a situation of the chicken and the egg. We cannot simply say that because we give a city a capital expenditure for a new train. that people are going to ride on it. We have to give the city the sustenance to keep that system operating until the people have found out that it is there. that it is operating. that it is attractive. that it is practical. that it is on time. that it is clean and that it Is sanitary. Mr. Speaker. I would simply like to turn around and say that every effort was made in the conference by the conferees together to get with the administration to try to produce a bill. with a formula which. in our opinion. would be fair to all. which would give funds for operating money and extra money for capital funds. and which would not be vetoed by the White House. It is absolutely essential that we pass some source of operational funding for mass transportation this year. If the President does not want to release it. we know of all the weapons he has. which are delay and impoundment. But. I would suggest to the Members that one of the most successful experiments which has been done in mass transportation recently is the Shirley Highway bus express route. This is the perfect example of operating subsidies which have allowed the system to get started. and keep going until people find it and increase its ridership and profit by realizing it to be a sensible and attractive alternative to the automobile.",

Its passage is vital if we are to unclog the streets of our cities. lessen the demand for scarce energy resources. and reduce the choking fumes from private automobiles. Let us face it: In many areas of the country mass transsit is either unavailable or only partially available to the commuting public. or it is too expensive to be attractive. or it is obsolete and its modernization is draining the coffers of local governments. Yet it has been nearly 10 months since this legislation passed the House.

Additionally. proposals are before the Congress to establish. under various names. what the administration refers to as the urban transportation assistance program. Such an effort is clearly urently needed and should be pursued. The only real solution to the financial bind in which transit systems find themselves is a meaningful. long term commitment of funding.

Amendments prohibiting granting \"most favored nation\" trade treatment to any Communist country that denies its citizens the right to emigrate. have been offered to the administrations trade bill by both Houses of Congress. Indications are that the Soviet Union may have relaxed its restrictive policies against the Jewish minority to a small degree. However. systematic discrimination and persecution directed against other ethnic. religious. and national minorities continues not only as a governmental policy. but as a daily fact of life in the Soviet Union. For some reason. the plight of these captive people has largely gone unreported in the national press. Yet stories of the merciless \"Russification\" of such formerly autonomous nations as the Ukraine and the imprisonment and death of those who resist. continue to trickle out from behind the Iron Curtain. A recent report from Vienna tells of more than 200 intellectuals. critical of Russian rule of the Ukraine. who were sent to prison camps. The repressive action was taken by the Kremlin in an effort to stamp out all nationalistic feeling being expressed by historians. archeologists. artists. and writers. In other efforts to \"ultimately erode the significance of Soviet ethnic republics.\" a regional government system. which reduces the 15 former republics into 7 \"planning regions.\" has quietly begun. The plan. put forth by Communist Party boss Leonid I. Brezhnev. would liquidate any trace of old ethnic boundaries within 15 years and eliminate all minority opposition. I find the possibility of extending U.S. taxpayers money to the Soviet Union in the form of subsidized food sales. lowinterest loans or outright gifts totally incompatible with cherished American ideals of freedom and justice. Extending to the Soviets preferential trade treatment. amounts little more than approval of the repressive policies against minority dissent in that country.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently my good friend and distinguished colleague. the Honorable JOHN Moss. engaged in a revealing dialog with the Citizens for the Control of Federal Spending. Mr. Moss pointed out to Mr. David Packard of the citizens group that while a majority of Americans believe that Federal spending is the greatest single cause of inflation. that same majority also believes that Federal spending should be increased for programs to curb air and water pollution and decreased for Defense Department programs. The President has not done this. Instead of spending money on the domestic programs demanded by the people of this Nation. the President has chosen to veto one social need after another. At the same time his proposed budget includes a $4 billion increase for the Pentagon. This increase comes at the end of the longest and costliest war in our history and at the begiming of what Mr. Nixon has termed a \"generation of peace.\" I do believe that we are going to have to learn to live within the Presidents $268 billion budget ceiling. and to do that. the Congress is going to have to reform its budgetary review procedures. The Federal deficit this year alone is some $36 billion. and the total national debt will grow to a whopping $505 billion. Thankfully. the Joint Study Committee on Budget Control has produced an excellent proposal that should succeed in closing up the loopholes in the current appropriation process. As Mr. Moss statesThe issue is not simply to control Federal spending. but to allocate public dollars more effectively. sagaciously and in a manner that will most productively contribute to Improvement of the general welfare. We know where the Presidents priorities liein the bombing of Cambodia. and the appropriation of billions of dollars for unnecessary. costineffective weapons programs. It is up to the Congress to reorder the Presidents topsyturvy set of national priorities. and allocate Federal money in those areas where the people of this Nation need and want it most. At this point in the RECORD I would like to insert the full text of the correspondence between Mr. Moss and Mr. Packard for the benefit of my colleagues:",

In most other fields. we no longer offer superior quality or more desirable product features. and our products are rather consistently overpriced and underserviced by comparison with those offered by other industrial nations. The hard facts concerning our position in international trade are clearly summarized in an article by Saul Friedman of the Detroit News Washington staff. My colleagues will find this valuable if frightening reading. Especially disturbing is the conclusion reached by a Common Market expert who said that the United States must \"innovate and find areas in which you compete or you will end up second rate in world trade.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as chairman of the Subcommittee on Merchant Marine of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. I am today introducing. with other members of the committee. a bill to amend the Merchant Marine Act of 1970. The legislation will provide merchant nuclearpowered vessels. contracted before July 1. 1978. with incentive support payments to cover such portion of the contracting cost differences arising from the use of nuclear propulsion units. as the Secretary of Commerce may determine is necessary for the purpose of fostering the advancement of U.S.-flag maritime technology. The recipients of the incentive support would. under the proposed legislation. repay the sums received subject to governmental recapture of 20 percent of each nuclear powered vessels annual net operating income. as defined in the Maritime Administrations uniform vessel accounting system. until the entire amount of incentive support payments for each such vessel shall have been recovered by the Government. I have stated many times. both in committee hearings and on the floor of the House. that the United States must have a modern. productive. and efficient merchant marine in order to compete in the world markets. Nuclear power merchant ships is one of the answers. Todays high productivity ships such as the VLCCs and container ships require a great deal of horsepower to move ever increasing tonnage at high speeds. This. coupled with the escalating bunker C fuel prices. make nuclear power a very competitive propulsion system candidate. Also. as a side benefit. economic studies have shown that nuclear ships can result in a favorable balance of payments. For example. to import the projected needs of oil from the Persian Gulf in 1980 by fossil fired tankers the balanceofpayment deficit on bunker C for propulsion could be as high as $650 million per year. For nuclear it would be zero because all the fuel would be obtained from U.S. sources. After 20 years of extensive research and development. the time has arrived for nuclear merchant ships to take their place on the high seas in pursuit of international commerce. I feel that this legislation will help provide the proper stimulus for the American merchant marine industrys efforts to modernize and rebuild the U.S. fleets into a competitive position.",

The Tufts University School of Medicine is unusual in that while it has one of the smallest operating budgets of any medical school. it has an unusually high enrollment.

Secretary of the Army. who is resigning his position on May 15. Secretary Froehlike first joined the Defense Department in January 1969 as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Administration. He remained in this position until July 1971. at which time he was confirmed as Secretary of the Army following the Honorable Stanley Resor. Mr. Froehlkes contributions as an administrator. and more specifically. in his role as coordinator of all defense intelligence resources. are well known to the House. I would like to focus on an area for which he has been less known. perhaps. but which will have enduring impact on the Army of the future. Secretary Froehlke has been with the Army in a difficult period of transition. While reducing reliance on the draft as a source of its manpower and suffering the disaffection inherited from the Vietnam conflict. the Army needed inspired leadership to regain its confidence and move toward a volunteer force. Secretary Froehlke not only provided that leadership but clearly recognized that a volunteer Army could succeed only if its soldiers were properly motivated and challenged by meaningful tasks. Secretary Froehlkes commitment to job satisfaction and improved interpersonal communication has resulted in an Army where men and women have an enhanced opportunity to serve with decency. dignity. and personal satisfaction.",

These two defendants were duly indicted by a Federal grand jury for stealing. photographing. and disposing of classified Governmentowned documents involving national security. and of espionagevery serious offenses under our criminal laws. After a lengthy trial. U.S. District Judge W. Matt Byrne. Jr.. dismissed all charges and did so in a manner deliberately designed to prevent any reindictments or retrials. According to the press there was an abundance of evidence. by admissions and otherwise. to support the indictment. But the judge in his dismissal order claimed the Government had engaged in a series of improprieties in investigations of the defendants. both before and following the indictments. Mr. Speaker. it would appear the judge had valid reasons for his criticisms. But the judge should have seen to it that the tail did not wag the dog. This was not a trial of any who participated in the investigation. This was a trial of two mature men. apparently mentally responsible for their deeds. charged with the commission of serious crimes. They have been summarily released without a jury having had an opportunity to resolve the issues raised and a chance to determine their guilt or innocence. From all accounts. the manner of the trial and its conclusion was a plague on the Government prosecutors. the defendants and their lawyers. and the Federal judge who presided.

Title XII established a National Commission on Individual Rights. The amendment I propose would. among other changes. broaden the scope of responsibility of that Commission. As originally created. the National Commission on Individual Rights was directed to study Federal laws and practices relating to a number of new criminal statutes. including those dealing with special grand juries. dangerous special offender sentencing. electronic surveillance. bail and pretrial detention. no knock search warrants. and collection of data on individuals by the Federal Government. The amendment I offer would include the aforementioned subjects. with the exception of electronic surveillance. as well as provide for a study of court decisions. certain legal restrictions on police and prosecutors. evidence. trial delay and collateral review of Federal and State criminal proceedings. These difficult areas of criminal law. practice and procedure merit careful evaluation. The problem of electronic surveillance will be studied by a separate Commission. established by the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968. but not yet formed. The amendment I offer would also shorten the life of the Commission from 6 to 3 years. Finally. the Commission would be renamed the National Commission on Individual Rights and Personal Security. The Commission will be composed of 15 members. 4 each from this House and the other body. and 7 members appointed by the President.

On the contrary. product safety regulation needs to be fully funded to be effective. The myth of the omnipotent computer. Instead. determinations of \"unreasonable risk\" requires more than the mechanical application of computerized injury data. often commonsense Judgment will prove sufficient. The unfortunate myth of counting the bodies. Clearly. some hazards are obvious and should be judicially eliminated irrespective of how many injuries are traceable to them. The myth of the nut behind the lawnmower. Consumer education. however useful. is not an adequate substitute for meaningful product safety standards and other regulatory action where appropriate.

    "speech": "Mr. President. unbeknownst to many. the Nixon administration has made important changes in its approach toward drug abuse. Efforts to enforce existing drug laws have been increased while. regrettably. programs for narcotics prevention and education are now receiving less emphasis and funding. These recent modifications in our drug policies were discussed in a New York Times article of July 5 entitled \"United States Cutting Narcotics Treatment Programs.\" I think this piece informative and worthy of attention. One key way in which the administration is trying to improve enforcement. the Times points out. involves the recent centralization of all drug enforcement authority in a new Justice Department agency called the Drug Enforcement AdministrationThe consolidation was primarily designed to end bureaucratic feuding between the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. An increase of $28.7 million has been budgeted for drug enforcement by the administration for the 1974 fiscal year. At the same time. the Times article points out. the administration contemplates a reduction of $27.52 million in the overall Federal budget for treatment and rehabilitation programs and the \"termination or sharp reduction\" in budgets of treatment programs sponsored by Cabinet agencies. It is further reported thatThe White House Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention has begun to trim its manpower rolls in preparation for a complete phase out by the end of 1974 . . . the agency was set up In 1971 to coordinate antidrug programs and especially efforts against heroin. which President Nixon has labelled \"public enemy number one.\" The administrations decreased interest in these programs is evident. I appreciate the need for stronger law enforcement efforts. I regret. however. that these new efforts are being provided at the expense of other essential drug programs. This approach represents a return to the backward attitude that sees drug use as a crime rather than a disease. There can be no real solution to the drug problem that does not include strong efforts at education and rehabilitation. Mr. President.

I can understand the frustration expressed by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations because consideration has not been swifter on this amendment. But it should be pointed out that this is not a printed amendment. It is an unprinted amendment. submitted at the desk. Most Senators even now do not know the wording of the amendment. It has taken some time to try to determine the implications and impact of the amendment. On its face. the amendment appears rather simple and innocuous. It speaks in terms of publishing 30 days advance notice in the Federal Register of the fact that an export license is being considered. As I understand it. at the present time regular reports are submitted to the appropriate committees in Congress at intervals of 6 months. advising of export licenses that are granted. The Hathaway amendment would be a radical change in the procedurea change which could be very mischievous. The amendment provides. In effect. that an arms sale must be delayed 30 days while notice is published. Not only would this trigger an arms race. as the Senator from Vermont has pointed out. it could operate as a very serious obstacle in a situation where time is of the essence. I refer. for example. to a situation that could arise in the Middle East. Under the amendment. we would have to delay a sale for 30 dayswhich could be too long to be helpful. . This amendment has not been given adequate consideration and the Senate committee has not had an opportunity to get the views of the administration.

This amendment was sent to the committee on May 22. over a month ago. It has been altered. but very slightly. That is why it is unprinted at this time. The substance is the same as the measure that was before the Committee on Foreign Relations on May 22. There has been ample opportunity for them to study it. The administration has commented on the amendment in writing. and I presume the other side has copies. The Senator said we already received notice. that under the regulations the State Department is supposed to notify the appropriate committee 6 months after licenses have been granted. Assuming this would be fair notice. and I do not think it is. the State Department is so far behind that we are not receiving these notices now until a year and a half afterward. But that is not the issue. What we want is prior notification so that members of the public and particularly Members of Congress can complain if there is any proposed sale of armaments to any country throughout the world. any private individual or group of individuals. Contrary to what otherwise is argued. this would not escalate the arms race but would deescalate the arms race. There would be pressures from the public to prevent some of these sales. That is the purpose of the amendment. The Senator said there might be an emergency situation. like sending arms to Israel. The United States Government can make that sale and it does not have to rely on individuals to do it. Without further ado. Mr. President. I urge Members of the Senate to support the amendment.",

Over a period of time now we have been reassured by our Government and the Greek Government that some real progress would be made toward return.ng to normalcy. Every time a promise has been made. we find that repression continues. What I am concerned about relates to the ability of Greece to discharge its responsibilities to NATO. One can talk all that one wants to talk about the internal situation in a country being its own business. However. the facts are. Mr. President. that the internal situation in Greece has deteriorated each month and each year as a result of this regime. Mr. President. some very thoughtful people who follow the goings on in NATOsome outstanding officers and professional soldiers who have only one concern. and that is the security of Western Europe and the Mediterranean areahave expressed their continuing concern about the developments in Greece. I can say to the Senate that one very high ranking. retired officer who served overseas in connection with a NATO assignment has conveyed to me his deep concern about the events in Greece. As a result of the latest defection of naval officers. we have a situation now in which the ability of the Greek Government to make a viable contribution to its NATO commitment is in serious question. Mr. President. I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island in an effort to see if we cannot jar some sense into the leadership of Greece. My concern runs directly to the ability of the Greek Government to fulfill its commitment to NATO. The course that government is following at this time. with all of the repression that isevidenced there. is disgraceful. So I would hope that the Senate would express its deep concern about the developments in Greece by agreeing to the pending amendment. This amendment does not cut off all aid.

Not only does the Congress benefit through tapping a reservoir of skills that would not otherwise be available to it. but the fellows themselves enrich their experience and deepen their understanding of how our political process works. Moving out into key positions in our society former fellows can effectively communicate to others the insights that they gathered during their year in the program.

Journalists have returned to their newspaper staffs with a greater capacity to report congressional activities. As rich as this professional program has been for the more than 500 men and women who have received this award. I believe that an equal value has accrued to Congress through its involvement in the program. The backgrounds of congressional fellows enable them to assume positions of significant responsibility in Members offices and on committee staffs. and in these roles the fellows make an important contribution to our national legislative institution. Mr. Speaker. I commend the American Political Science Association for its excellent administration and sponsorship of this program. which exemplifies the finest of relationships between an academic discipline and the governmental process.",

Mr. STEIGER Of Wisconsin and Mr. UDALL. for taking this time today to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the congressional fellowship program. As one who has benefited from this program in the past .and. in fact. is benefiting right now. I join my colleagues here in praise of a most worthy and mutually rewarding undertaking. I am hopeful that the congressional fellows I have had in my office have secured a valuable insight into the role of a Congressman and into the political. legislative and organizational realities within which that role is carried out. When top caliber people such as these fellows are exposed to this congressional climate in an intimate. daytoday manner. the result is a greater understanding of our legislative system and. therefore. our entire governmental system. Hopefully. that greater understanding is accompanied by a greater appreciation of our system. But if the program is beneficial to the highly qualified personnel who are chosen to participate. it is every bit as beneficial to the Members fortunate enough to be the recipients of their services. For the fellows bring with them a quality and an expertise that serves our offices. and therefore. our constituencies. in a very high manner. Mr. Speaker. there could be no better example of this than the present congressional fellow serving in my office. Mrs. Lorraine Torres holds a permanent position at the National Institutes of Mental Health. Selected as a congressional fellow. she has served in my office for the past 4 months and her firm grasp of all matters relating to the health field has been of incalculable assistance to me and to my efforts in this area. I was firmly committed to this program long ago. However. if I had not been. I would. be now because of the excellent contribution this woman has made to my office. While the congressional fellowship program Is 20 years old today. it is everyoung and vital. reflecting the enthusiasm and professionalism of its participants. I would like. at this time. to congratulate all of those connected with the administration of this fine program. past participants. and of course those men and women who are serving the Congress so well in this 20th anniversary year.",

This program enables bright. young professionals from diversified backgrounds to spend a year participating in the workings of Congress involving duties comparable to those of legislative assistant and press secretary. Their contact has established an invaluable resource of mutual understanding between the executives in the agencies of the Government and the Members of Congress with whom they deal. At the same time. they have given those of us here on the Hill a tremendous opportunity to develop longlasting relationships with the various Government departments and to understand better their attitudes and circumstances under which they work. I have had an opportunity to have a number of congressional fellows on my staff over the past 6 years and they have been uniformly helpful. They have brought their expertise from the agencies to bear on legislation with which my office was concerned and have been of assistance in avoiding administrative problems in the writing of new legislation. As they have returned to the agencies. their knowledge of the way in which the Congress works has been valuable to my office in assisting us to solve many constituent problems. I am delighted to pay tribute to the congressional fellowship program to the hundreds of fellows who have taken part in it over the past 20 years.

In order to shed more light on this particular issue I would like to call my colleagues attention to a recent letter from George D. Woods. the president of the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council. and former president of the World Bank. The letter has appeared in the New York Times on July 6. 1973. and represents a statement of great significance in regard to the Soviet refusal to live up to its international financial obligations as a successor government. I would like also to stress that my staffs inquiries have clearly revealed that the Soviet Government has not complied with the existing standards of the international law. It has repudiated on several occasions the international debts incurred by the predecessor government. I consider this to be very characteristic for the behavior of the Soviet Government. and especially in view of the fact that the other Communist governments. including the government of mainland China. have settled or have agreed to settle the financial obligations they have inherited as successor governments.

It would strike from the bill those particular provisions that deal with military grants. foreign military sales. and security supporting assistance to the country of Chile.

It will in no way affect the other programs of narcotics assistance. selected developmental aid and education. or United Nations resource funds. which come to about $300.000. It seems to me. Mr. President. that the whole world has been shocked by the use of military equipment in Chile. It has been used against civilians. It has been used against foreign refugees. This has been military equipment supplied by the United States to the Government of Chile. It seems to me that until that country is prepared to return to the orderly processes of democratic institutions and democratic government. it does not behoove the United States to be extending military aid. assistance. and grants to Chile. I think there are a number of different. delicate negotiations going on in the international community. with the High Commissioner on Refugees. the International Red Cross. who have been down to Chile trying to insure the protection of human rights and human liberties.

We must give full consideration to the problems and to the fact that we must maintain a balance. We must be aware of the tremendous amount that the Soviet Union has done in arming the Arab nations. So that aspect of the bill--some help for Israeldoes not give me cause for great concern. What does give me concern is the rest of the bill. and that is the larger part of the total figure. The bill totals $5.5 billion. I am most interested in the table which appears on page 6 which shows that if ExportImport Bank funds are included then the total transfer of U.S. resources to foreign nations for fiscal 1974 will bd a minimum of $16 billion. I say \"minimum\" because that figure does not reflect certain items that are included in footnote No. 1 on that page. I would like to vote for parts of the bill. but obviously I must vote for or against it as an entity. That being the case I shall vote against the total package of $5.5 billion.",

To do that. it seems to me we have to make it possible for a person who is near the welfare point to do better than he is doing now. In the State of Washington they figured you have to make about $3.50 an hour out there. with a family of four. to do as well as you would on welfare. That is a problem that is running through all of us. and there are several million people who work all year. usually unskilled but working hard and trying to care for their families. and we tax them 27 percent. Many of those taxes are completely regressive. There is no deduction. for example. on the payroll tax. for the size of the family. There is no deduction on the payroll tax for medical costs. There is no deduction for anything. it is just a straight. fiat tax. with no deductions. and they pay half again as much. I agree with the chairman. in the form of indirect taxes. because what the employer contributes obviously is either added to the cost of the product or taken from wages. and as consumers or wageearners they pay that tax indirectly. which is why we get the 10percent figure. These families. according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics own figures. after working all year. probably do not have enough money to provide the minimum necessities. according to our own Department of Labor. that they need. So in terms of simple equity. in terms of incentives for employment. and in terms of trying to show we appreciate a person who works all year and stays off welfare. for all these reasons this modestly expensive programand it is less expensive than a lot of other things which we did today-",

At the present time. the poor person who works for a lifetime is about $4.50 better off. because we do allow him to keep a small amount of benefits when we reduce his welfare check by his social security check.

Perhaps they will be helpful to the Senator from Minnesota. The Senate committee recommended $720 million for cancer. which is $120 million over the budget request. $169 million over last year. and $240 million over the House allowance. The $120 million increase for cancer research is by far the largest increase over the budget of any single item in the bill. The proposal of the Senator from Minnesota is more than the National Cancer Advisory Council said to us can be used effectively. I do not think we can afford to put in funds that will not be used. because if we go up too much on this bill. we will have another veto. We have not had an election yet. so we cannot pass the bill over the Presidents veto. HEW would then be operating on a continuing resolution. and the Cancer Institute would be forced to operate at $600 millionwhich is $120 million below what we have in the bill now.

In H.R. 1975 we were amending the emergency loan program under the Farmers Home Administration. the Tower amendment related to the Small Business Administration. a matter that would ordinarily not come under the jurisdiction of our committee. Accordingly. while the agreement of the conferees on the part of the House was to accept the amendment. we have complied with the rules of the House in reporting it back in technical disagreement. The motion at the desk is in compliance with the recommendations of the conferees that the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment No. 4 and concur in that amendment with an amendment inserting. in lieu of the language proposed by the other body. language suggested by the administration and agreed to by the conferees. The language of the amendment. and the purpose of the Amendment is to impose the same interest rate5 percenton Small Business Administration disaster loans as the House bill imposes on the Farmers Home Administration emergency loans and remove the $500 forgiveness feature from such SBA loans. The effective date of the change would be the date of enactment of the bill. and the changes would apply to any disaster occurring on or after the date of enactment of this act. Mr. Speaker. this socalled Tower amendment is under the jurisdiction of the Banking and Currency Committee and we want it understood that the Agriculture Committee is not planning any jurisdiction.

The only issue before us is whether or not the Treasury Department. which has a clear conflict of interest that all of us can understand. should be in the position of preventing the Farmers Home Administration from being able to borrow money when it thinks it needs it. on the terms and conditions that it provides. and to take care of the needs of rural America. when all of us who have had any experience with rural America in our States recognize that is where the housing problems are most serious.

They cited the case of the United Transportation Union v. the State Bar of Michigan. 401 U.S. 576 (1971). a U.S. Supreme Court case. Does it have any relevance to what we are attempting to do in this legislation? Here is what it says: The Michigan State Bar brought this action in January 1959 to enjoin the members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen from engaging in activities undertaken for the stated purpose of assisting their fellow workers. their widows and families. to protect themselves from excessive fees at the hands of incompetent attorneys in suits for damages under the Federal Employers Liability Act. I have read verbatim from the decision. Does it have anything to do with the right of the Congress of the United States to create rights which have been previously denied under the law and to say in creating this new right that the union worker shall have a free choice in selecting counsel to represent him in his private affairs?

In other words. what this amendment does is this: It says that impoundment will cease within 60 days unless the Congress takes action by concurrent resolution. It has been pointed out. Mr. Chairman. in this debate that under the definition of \"impoundment.\" as in this bill in section 103. we will have literally thousands of messages from the President to the Committees on Appropriations of both bodies in regard to funds that under these definitions would be classified and defined as \"impoundment.\" Under the terms of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas these impoundments would cease after 60 days unless the Congress took action by concurrent resolution. It would be literally impossible for the Congress to consider within 60 days the thousands of impoundments that would be required of the President to send up to the Congress.

There are many reserves. I will say to the gentleman from Texas that are by the direct order of the Congress. This says \"reserves.\" Let us say we appropriate $100 million for research and development or for construction projects. or a plane or a battleship. whatever it may be. You do not spend those funds the first day you get them. but you have to draw plans and specifications. advertise for bids. receive the bids and then a contract is awarded to the successful bidder.

Hitlers legions conquered the Lithuanian nation and the Nazis maintained their control until the last days of World War II. With the defeat of Hitler. the Lithuanian people were once again forcibly included into the Soviet system. Mr. Speaker. despite years of oppression the proud Lithuanian spirit is untamed.

The 20 years of Lithuanian independence which followed were marked by great advances in the fields of agriculture and social progress and by important achievements in literature and opera. It was an era which paralleled the great cultural achievements in other historic nations. Unfortunately. this golden era was short lived. On June 15. 1940. the Soviets once again invaded this great country. and Lithuanians were executed and exiled by their Soviet captors.

At a time when the grave economic situation demands fiscal restraint. I am unable to Justify to my constituents the expenditure of more than $63 billion for the military. The House did adopt two excellent amendments which I was pleased to support. The first eliminated a $5.8 million appropriation for the development of a new binary nerve gas program. We already have approximately fifty million pounds of nerve gas in our military stockpiles. We should be working to ban weapons of chemical warfare. rather than inaugurating new and costly programs. The second amendment approved by the House reduced the appropriations for military aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion to $700 million. Americans are no longer being killed in Southeast Asia. but the war continues to rage. fueled by American planes. bombs. guns. and ammunition. Contrary to the repeated assurances of the administration. the United States has not yet gotten out of Vietnam. We remain involved to the tune of billions of dollars in military aid which helps to support the dictatorship of President Thieu. The $300million reduction in the appropriations level imposed by the House yesterday represents an important step in the right direction. Unfortunately. the House failed to make more substantial cuts in the proposed budget. I voted for unsuccessful amendments to delete funding for the obsolete Safeguard missile system and for the dangerous new program of counterforce firststrike weapons development. An amendment to reduce the entire budget by $2.2 billion. which I supported. was rejected by a narrow margin. In its final form. the budget approved by the House last evening provided $83.4 billion to the Department of Defense for fiscal 1975. We in the Congress have been urged to help slow inflation by exercising fiscal restraint. Apparently. the military budget. which represents our largest Federal expenditure. is not subject to this same standard of responsible spending. Increased spending for the military at a time when crucial domestic programs are being curtailed strikes me as a tragic confusion of priorities.

This is a problem which has received much attention and publicity in recent years. and one which has a particularly powerful effect on millions of young people in this Nation. It has been reliably estimated that between 12 and 20 million adolescents and young adults in this country use or have tried marihuana.

It is in light of these startling and alarming statistics that I vigorously believe that this situation merits the serious attention of this Congress in terms of opposing any relaxation of the current marihuana laws. There are many in this Nation who strongly advocate a less punitive law for the marihuana user. maintaining that our present drug policy only breeds further disrespect for the law and thus serves to exacerbate the problem even more. However. this same segment of our population has consistently failed to realize the significance of reports being circulated by scientists and doctors throughout the Nation who have testified to the serious and adverse effects of cannabis smoking. One serious disclosure related to marihuana usage has been the findings that it has the effect of impairing the bodys immunity system.

In 1967. the United Nations imposed an embargo on all trade with Rhodesia. and the then President of the United States. President Johnson. unilaterally imposed an embargo on all trade by the United States with Rhodesia. This meant that the United States then became dependent on the Soviet Union for its critical and muchneeded defense materialnamely. chrome. The bulk of the worlds supply of chrome is deposited in Rhodesia. The New York Times in an editorial on Monday. April 8. states that South Africa and Rhodesia have 96 percent of the known chromium reserves. The United States was faced with a very critical situation as a result of President Johnsons unilateral action. In 1971.

The issue was the same then as it was the year before and in 1971 when the Congress first adopted the Byrd amendment. which permits the importation of strategic and critical materials from Rhodesia as long as they can also be imported from Communistcontrolledcountries. On December 18. 1973. the Senate passed S. 1868 which would impose the former sanctions and sent it to the House where it was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. That committee favorably reported It out on June 27. 1974 and it now appears on the House calendar for an early vote. The issue is obscure and remote from the lives of most Americans. It is also complex. involving materials which are not produced in the United States or even in all of North America. and involving our relationships with the United Nations. It is an Issue which deserves careful and thoughtful review. My aim today. therefore. is to provide a careful outline of my reasons for continuing to support the Byrd amendment and opposing the enactment of S. 1868. now H.R. 8005. which would repeal it. The principal commodity affected by the Byrd amendment is chrome ore. specifically metallurgical chrome ore. because in Rhodesia are located the free worlds largest deposits of highgrade metallurgical chrome ore. Other types of chrome ore. including chemical grade and refractory grade. are found elsewhere in the world. but the metallurgical grade s by far the most important kind in terms of both economics and national security. The Importance of metallurgical chrome s heightened because the worlds other major sources are the Soviet Union and South Africa. although much smaller quantities are found in Turkey. Iran. and India. Metallurgical chromite in the form of ore as it comes from the mine cannot be employed by the steel industry or by other industrial users. It must first be converted into one of several types of ferrochromium by a hightemperature smelting and reduction process. This process is carried out by the ferroalloys industrywhich also converts manganese ore into various types of ferromanganese and ferrosilicon for use by steel producers and the aluminum industry.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the distinguished junior Senator from Pennsylvania has introduced a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which reaffirms the right of voluntary prayer in public schools and buildings. I am happy to join with Senator SCHWEIKER and Senators CANNON. EASTLAND. PASTORE. and SCOTT of Pennsylvania in sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 84. This measure offers a most encouraging opportunity for united legislative action to restore voluntary prayer. All the sponsors of this resolution have sponsored previous legislation with the same objective in mind. Though our goals were the same. the various proposed amendments were worded somewhat differently. Earlier In this session. for example. I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 7. which speaks of the right to \"participate in nondenominational prayer.\" I had included the word \"nondenominational.\" because this is the language of the proposed prayer amendment I introduced which passed the Senate in 1970. Similarly. Senate Joint Resolution 10. Introduced by Senators SCHWEIKER and SCOTT of Pennsylvania made reference to \"voluntary nondenominational prayer or meditation.\" Senators SCOTT of Virginia. and BARTLETT and others also put forth prayer resolutions in the Senate. In the House of Representatives. Congressman CHALMERS WYLIE of Ohio. offered a joint resolution favoring \"voluntary prayer.\" one which Is very similar to Senate Joint Resolution 84. Senator SCHWEnER has spent much time and effort in studying the various prayer amendments. He has carefully consulted with congressional sponsors of such amendments. constitutional experts in the academic world and the Library of Congress. and concerned citizens throughout the Nation. The purpose of this intensive study has been to develop a single amendment. acceptable to all who seek to reaffirm the right of prayer. which can effectively be enacted into law. I believe Senate Joint Resolution 84 meets those criteria. Earlier attempts to achieve the objective of voluntary prayer have been most frustrating. The political machinery has not been responsive to the wishes of an overwhelming majority of the people of this country. I am most encouraged. however. by this latest development. I look forward to continuing to work with the other sponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 84. with Congressman WYLIE and other leaders in the House. and all others who support the right for voluntary prayer.",

I supported him in this difficult effort. and I support him now in opposing blanket amnesty. I supported him in his efforts to open constructive new relationships with China and the Soviet Union. However. while I shall oppose any meat axe cuts in our defense budget. I will support a unilateral reduction of military forces overseas. It Is time that our European friends take on more of the cost of providing for their own defense. Anent the Presidents imposition of a ceiling on meat prices. this does not go far enough. We should at least return to the phase II mandatory controls. and apply them on prices. wages. interest rates. et cetera. To deal with meat prices alone. only touches one area in rising living costs. As to the Presidents reference to congressional spending. there Is no question but that Congress has contributed its share to costly programs. But if ones comments stop here. the story is only half told. The overall net cuts made by Congress in the administrations budget during the past 4 years have amounted to $20 billion. Even so. the national debt has increased $104 billion during the 4 years of the present administration. and this constitutes almost a fourth of the total national debt. Additionally. it was the administration that recommended a $30 billion general revenuesharing program over a 5year period. which in many instances proved to be a handout to States that are far better off financially than is the Federal Government. Surely. some reference should be made to this expenditure. which I voted against and which Congress did not initiate. Furthermore. it was the Congress that enacted standby price and wage controls. which the President opposed but which. after too long a delay. the administration finally utilized in August 1971. in the fight against inflation. While the President seeks. therefore. to focus public attention on congressional spending. there is enough blame to go around. After all. it was the administration. not Congress. that lifted phase II controls prematurely. and the \"stick in the closet\" has not worked.",

This is precisely the kind of program I had in mind in the comprehensive proposal I presented in the Senate last May on jobs and opportunities for youth. where I discussed the need for carefully planned programs of paid jobs for youth in vitally needed community services.

Davis was a member of a highly secret intelligencegathering organization called the Third Radio Research Unit. He was called Tom by the men of the unit and he was well liked. He was 25 years old. He was married and had a young son whom he had never seen back in Tennessee. On December 23. Tom. Davis was to return to the United States for discharge. On that December 22. he was boarding a truck for one last mission. The unit commander. Col. William Cochran. passed the truck and told Davis he did not have to go outthat it was not worth the risk. But Davis did not like Saigon. and he wanted to take a few more pictures before going home. Besides. it was his job. And if he did not do it. somebody else would have to do it. so he stayed aboard the truck. On a narrow track in the province. Davis convoy moved. strung out. around a curving road. and suddenly Davis truck was blown off the road. The ARVN guards on the truck were all gunned down from ambush. Davis body was found with his carbine. The clip was empty. so it was apparent he had been able to fight back. The stock was broken. which suggested he had fallen heavily when he was hit.

In this day and time when so many decisions are based on the popular whim of the moment. the leaders of our States and Nation should pause not only to pay tribute to this great American but also to learn from his courageous example. The life of Harry S. Truman Is very much a representative American storyof how a man can rise from humble origins to the highest office in the land. He embodied in his personality and character the qualities shared by the vast majority of his fellow citizens. Through all the great controversies in which he participated and which tested and proved his leadership. he retained that humility which we call \"The common touch.\" the ability to speak directly and frankly to his fellow Americans. With good reason. General Marshall noted his curious blend of humility and boldness. nourished by faith in God and belief in America. An eminent preacher of 19th century America. Henry Ward Beecher. once observed that \"greatness lies not in being strong but in the right use of strength.\" Let It be said of Harry Truman that he used the powers of his office and the Godgiven gifts which were his Inner resource to give effective leadership not only to his own country but to the free world in a time of grave crisis and disruption.

President Truman determined that the use of -the bomb on two Japanese cities would bring the war to an end and thus save an estimated 1 million American military personnel who otherwise would have been ordered to invade Japan.

I first met President Truman when I was a young professor of history at the University of Wyoming. It was during the month of May 1950. on the very eve of the Korean war. and the President addressed a capacity house convocation for university students and faculty. I remember on that occasion. President Truman talked to me about launching on a political career. At that time he urged me to consider running for the House of Representatives. pointing out that times were changing and that academicians could dare to venture into the political arena. From that moment on. until I arrived in Washington as a U.S. Senator. Harry S Truman grew in stature on the pages of history even though at the time of our first conversation he was being castigated and demeaned by his critics. Upon my election to a first term in the U.S. Senate. I had barely arrived in Washington. D.C.. when I was summoned to the Mayflower Hotel by President Truman. I have never forgotten the warm. fatherly counsel he gave me on that occasion. Thus. in a very real way he played a very meaningful part at significant moments of my life. And for that. I will be forever grateful and appreciative. In conclusion. I would request that my remarks today be placed immediately following my tribute to President Truman of January 26. 1973. in the bound volume of eulogies.",

Mr. Truman never shrank from the difficult decisions of his Presidency. In the closing days of World War Ir. when freedom was threatened and when Israel was born out of controversy and discord. he always stood firm. But he was also a wise and compassionate statesman who led the reconstruction of a wartorn Europe through the Marshall plan. The Senate has a special fondness for for Mr. Truman who considered a seat in this body one of the highest and most important positions to which an individual could aspire. His reluctance to give up his Senate seat and become President Roosevelts Vice President was well known. and throughout his Presidency he always held the Congress in high regard and maintained warm relationships with many of its leaders. I first became interested in politics when President Truman was in office. and. though we sometimes held different views. he always had my utmost respect for his Integrity. decisiveness. and dedication to Americas best interests. Millions of free peoplehere and around the worldwill long remember and be grateful for President Trumans service to his country and mankind.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. few Americans have served their Nation with the devotion and dedication of Harry Truman. He became President in one of the most critical periods in our countrys history and faced some of the most awesome and farreaching problems ever to confront an American President. Harry Truman assumed the Presidency only months after his election to the office of Vice President. and at a time when the United States was engaged in one of mankinds most devastating wars. In rapid order. he faced some of historys most difficult decisions. There were the negotiations with Stalin. the decision to drop the atomic bomb. the Berlin blockade and the Korean war. to name only a few. And through all these monumental decisions. Harry Truman was more than equal to the challenge. His courageous and decisive leadership during those troubled years stand today as a hallmark of excellence in American history. With each passing year since he left the White House. we have gained a deeper appreciation of the enormity of his contribution to his Nation and to the free world. Today there is little question that time and history have judged Harry Truman to be one of our greatest Presidents. But Harry Truman was more than a bold and decisive leader. he was a man of great compassion and vision. He was totally committed to building a better America for all of our people. Many of the great social programs enacted during the decade of the 1960s were first suggested by President Truman. He was an early leader in the struggle to provide equal treatment for all Americans regardless of race. and he advocated government assistance in providing medical care for our senior citizens years before medicare finally became reality. Throughout his life. Harry Truman cared deeply about the people of this great country. And in return. I think the American people cared deeply about Harry Truman. We admired his strength and wisdom. and we loved his warmth and honesty. The magnitude of his contributions to the American people and to all the free nations of the world can never be adequately measured. Perhaps it is enough to say that we are immeasurably in his debt. just as future generations of freedomloving people everywhere will be in his debt.",

Indeed. the Veterans Administration operates a highly efficient and credible hospital system. but to include medical education and training as a further responsibility would only detract from their most important functionto treat and care for those men and women who served their country when called.

I think that is a correct way to put it. and I accept that. The question is. Is it the prerogative of Congress in its test to give away somebody elses equity? That is really what is at stake here. Congress is not giving up anything itself. We are not giving up projects in our home States. We are addressing ourselves to an entitlement of Federal employees that is already 6 months overdue. Congress. as the only bargaining agent those employees have left. has a moral responsibility to honor that obligation. That is the real test here. I say to the distinguished Senator from Arizona. who rightfully says that he wants to stay within the budget. that if he would examine the budget. he would find that this item is budgeted. The Presidents budget includes allowances for this pay adjustment. We are not adding something to the budget. it is there now. But the proposal from the President is to withdraw this from the budget in order to provide a cosmetic. I suppose to convince somebody that he is fighting inflation. Well. Mr. President. the Federal employees are willing to take their lumps. but they do not want to be the scapegoat. If we really mean it when we say we can go after inflation allout. as the Senator from Arizona has just said we must. then let us do it to all wages and all profits and all interest rates and all dividends. Then we have the American people committed to this noble enterprise. But do not pick on a group that is already behind on equity. That is what the Senate has to look after. The distinguished minority whip used the word. \"baloney.\" and then he appeared to wish he had not used it. He kind of apologized for it. I do not think he has to apologize for it. it is one of the highestpriced words in our vernacular. But now. Federal employees have to look forward to living on it as well as living with the baloney.

    "speech": "Mr. President. during my tenure in the Senate. I have consistently advocated budget restraint. Recently. I have made it my prime task to review all appropriations bills and to recommend cuts in these bills where they appeared inflationary. Budget restraint is merely one of the many devices we must use in the battle against inflation. And because budget restraint translates into sacrifice by the publiceither through lower wages or unemployment due to fewer Government projectswe should especially try in this area to make sure that budgetary restraint is undertaken in a fair and equitable manner. When it is undertaken in such an acrosstheboard fashion. everyone will equally share the sacrifice and struggle. After reviewing President Fords proposal. I am convinced that one small group of Federal employees are being discriminatorily singled out to fight the battle against inflation alone. Let us examine the record: while consumer prices are up almost 12 percent over last year. Federal employees will only get a 5.5 percent raise. At that. the raise will only conform to what comparable jobs in the private sector were paying last March. Furthermore. Federal employees other than military and whitecollar workers have already received pay hikes for the yearand some of those increases exceeded 16 percent. In my State of New Mexico bluecollar workers received an 11.24 percent raise this summer. Why should their whitecollar counterparts not receive a 5.5 percent raise? Even with such a raise. they will have suffered a 7percent decrease in their standards of living. When President Ford proposes a uniform approach to Federal wage restraint. and an overall Federal budgetary program of constraints in all sectors. which I believe he should do as part of the economic summit conference. then he will have my wholehearted support. Such a plan should include an acrosstheboard. uniform wage raise deferral. Thus. we can show the private sector that we support fair and equitable restraint and the private sector must then be asked to do likewise in the interest of our country. It must agree to do so. and follow our lead. or most certainly controls and formal allocation systems will follow. And so. I support Senate Resolution 394. and urge my colleagues and the President to arrive at a more equitable plan to fight inflation.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join my colleagues on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee in recommending that the Senate favorably approve Senate Resolution 394. As we all know. on September 11 President Ford called for a postponement until January of the proposed 5.5 percent pay raise for Federal whitecollar employees and military personnel. Senate Resolution 394. which we are considering today. would assure that these Federal employees receive their pay raise on October 1. Since the consumer price index has increased 11.8 percent over the past year. the proposed pay increase of 5.5 percent will give this group less than half of the increase in the cost of living. During the past year. the private sector has received incremental increases to meet inflation averaging 7.8 percent and 22 percent for their executives. I believe it is unconscionable that one group should be singled out to sufer the burden of the spiralling inflation in our country. We all agree with President Fords statement that the Government has the responsibility of initiating a plan to stop inflation and spending is certainly an important factor. Further. I recognize the need to balance our Federal budget. and I have helped in the Senate efforts which have resulted in a cutback of some $6 billion in the fiscal year 1975 budget. The day after President Ford made his recommendation to delay the Federal pay raise. he went down and gave a bigger increase to the District of Columbia employees. praising them for their fine work. I think Federal employees have done equally fine work and should not be singled out. I had recommended to Arthur Burnsand he agreed with methat to make it uniform what we should do was cut the 5.5 percent to 4.6 percent and make it apply to public and to private labor contracts as a guideline for all employeesprivate and public. In this way we would have saved the $700 million and moreand not just temporarily. The proposal to delay this increase is unfair. and accordingly I cannot support such a move.

I have given a great deal of thought to President Fords recommendation that the October 1 pay increase for Federal employees. as provided by the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970. be postponed for 3 months and that Federal employment be reduced by 40.000 workers through attrition. President Fords purpose in each case is to help in the war against inflation. I shall discuss these two items separately. Under the act. the mechanism allows for a 5.52percent pay Increase effective October 1. President Ford would delay the effective date to January 1. 1975. While I approve his purpose. I have not been able to convince myself that it is fair and appropriate for the President to ask only one group within the economy to forgo a salary increase. The President has ruled out wage controls and price controls for private industry. a position with which I am in agreement. With reference to the Presidents proposal to reduce Federal employment by 40.000 by attrition. namely by not filling vacancies. I support this. but it does not go far enough. The report of the Joint Committee on Reduction of Federal Expenditures shows that for the 6month period January through June 1974. the number of Federal employees increased by 91.044. I see no justification for such a tremendous increase in public employees. A sharp increase in the number of Federal employees adds greatlyand permanentlyto the total cost of Government. and I believe results in less efficiency. The deferral of a pay increase. besides being inequitable. can yield at best only a oneshot saving. Because the deferral singles out one group for financial sacrifice. I shall vote against delaying the 5.52percent increase for Federal employees.",

Do we hear them say. \"Yes. we want to bring this into the budget?\" No. to the contrary. If there is any Appropriations Committee feeling toward this amendment. I think it probably is we should abide by the Budget Committees determination and withhold the movement of any of these entities that are outside the budget until they can all be considered under the Budget Control Act. The gentleman from Ohio referred to that earlier. Then third. I think It should be pointed out. as it has been by the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California. that the Eximbanks loan commitments are committed during a fiscal year and are within limits approved by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. But the disbursements of loans are often made several years later. Once the ExportImport Bank makes a loan commitment. it must holor that commitment by making disbursements to U.S. exporters when they ship the goods abroad. If the ExportImport Bank loan disbursements are treated as budgetary expenditures. the budgetary requirements would impose restraints upon commitments legally entered Into years previously. I think that the arguments in support of the committee amendment are weak. it should never have been adopted in the first place in the committee. and I am sure it will not be adopted now.",

The special exclusion of the bank in the past has served to isolate It from the oversight operations of Congress. Certainly any lowinterest rate. multibillion dollar lending operation deserves close annual scrutiny In the budget. The U.S. Treasury in a recently disclosed study declared that the loans for U.S. commercial jet aircraft failed to increase exports and have not helped employment In the U.S. aircraft industry. In fact. they hurt the U.S. balance of payments. The Treasury termed these loans a needless subsidy. To extend the same loan provisions to U.S. airlines would only compound the disaster. Foreign purchasers of U.S.-made aircraft can well afford the commercial borrowing rate. The amendment should be defeated and the Exim Bank should be required to refer foreign aircraft purchase.s to normal commercial lending channels. Overall. we find little in the Exim Bank to deserve Its continued support. Despite the rhetoric of the Exim Bank representatives and that of the multinational firms. who have little stake in this nation. American workers are not benefiting from the Exim Banks lending policies. Therefore. at least. the Bank should be kept in the budget. its loans be made with the needs of America In mind. and loan favoritism to all airlines should be forbidden.",

Also. it extends the Economic Stabilization Acts authority over energy prices for the period of this act. which would carry that authority under the FEAA administration up through June of 1975. so that the consumer can feel somewhat comforted. But it also provides this authority for the administrator: If he feels that higher costs can be justified and will stimulate increased supplies which eventually will bring down costs. then the administrator is able to authorize the increases. It is for that reason. to give the administrator. the socalled energy \"czar.\" that increased leeway to use the pricing mechanism as a stimulus specifically to increase production and eventually. therefore. not only meet the energy problem but also bring the cost down through price increases that would increase supplies. that I support the amendment of the Senator from New York.",

The conference bill. however. would require specific annual appropriations for the second and third year rather than permitting the Secretary to use \"section 32\" funds as he presently does and as the bill provides for the first year of its life. I would also point out that the conference substitute retains the amendment I offered to permit the distribution of seafood and seafood products under the program. These nutritious foods can go a long way to improving the diets of those who participate in the program. Second. it removes the annual authorization ceiling of $120 million on the present school milk law and permits such sums as Congress may appropriate in future years. It also raises the halfpint reimbursement rate by 1 penny and ties future reimbursements--starting in fiscal year 1976to the cost of living index maintained by the Department of Labor.

The press makes mistakes from time to time. like everyone else does. but in such a vital area as impeachment there should be extreme caution and care. it seems to me. Mr. Speaker. there recently came to my attention a misleading article in the Jack Anderson column and I had thought that I had set it straight. at least privately. but now I hear that a national television chain is going to reproduce and expand the error that was made. In the June 4 Jack Anderson column the following was said: NixoN WOOS CONSERVATIVE LEGISLATORS (By Jack Anderson) White House aides have taken pains to remind members of Congress that they are sitting on the impeachment jury and. therefore. that it is improper for them to discuss the case against President Nixon. It would seem to be even more improper. however. for Mr. Nixon as the defendant to court members of the jury. Yet he has taken key senators and representatives on dinner cruises down the Potomac. He has made White House planes. limousines and other privileges available to them. He has pampered them with sudden attention. The President is even tailoring his legislative program. at least in part. to appeal to the conservatives whose votes he is counting upon to keep him in office. The politics of impeachment. rather than the merits of the legislation. now seem to determine what bills he will support. For example. the President had halted the construction of a crossFlorida barge canal to preserve the beauty of northern Floridas Oklawaha River. As recently as six weeks ago. the White House reassured Florida conservationists of the Presidents support. But the promises are forgotten after a contingent of conservative congressmen called upon the White House to go ahead with the barge canal. The President hastily withdrew his opposition.

I recall participating in extensive work in 1961 on the original measure. During the programs infancy. I stressed my firm belief in the concept of the Peace Corps: It is evident that the Corps has helped to restore. in many underdeveloped sections of the world. the vision of America as a nation committed to the improvement of the life and enhancement of opportunity for all people. There have been hills and valleys during the growth of the Peace Corps. Its budget has now doubled. But the Peace Corps and its philosophy remain. It is a response to the best within mankind. Dr. Michael P. Balzano. Jr.. Director of ACTION. in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said: The idealism of the Volunteer is the foundation on which Peace Corps built its program and continues to foster international goodwill and understanding. While we are changing some of our methods of operation. we are not changing this fundamental approach. Our Nation is known for its volunteerism which has been demonstrated in both overseas and domestic activities. In this regard. the recruitment of returned Peace Corps volunteers for domestic service has strengthened our volunteer programs generally. I support H.R. 12920. the Peace Corps Authorization Act with the pending amendment. It is a realistic and necessary approach to sustain a vital program.

We all recall the rather dramatic parliamentary maneuvering it took to grant the Queen an l1th hour reprieve from the drydock in 1970. That 3 year reprieve expires this November 1. H.R. 5649 gives the Queen an additional 5year extension of its exemption allowing it to operate until November 1. 1978. The owners have contracted to replace the Queen with a new vessel satisfying the safety at sea regulations. The 1966 Safety at Sea Act which necessitated this action was intended to protect Americans from unsafe oceangoing vessels but its provisions were so broad as to include inland water passenger vessels with wooden superstructures. In other words. the laws broad brush interpretation paints Americas only overnight paddlewheeler. the Delta Queen. into a corner and only the Congress can now rescue the vessel from oblivion. I recently had the opportunity to inspect the Queen when she docked in my district in Gallipolis. Ohio. Quite frankly. I was very much impressed by the extensive fireproofing and safety work that has been performed on the vessel since 1970 as well as the pride. dedication and experience of its crew. Over half a million dollars in safety equipment and repairs have made the steamboat as safe as possible and justifies an additional lease on its life. The Queen is an unique part of Americas river heritage which she keeps alive for thousands of people to experience and enjoy. The charm and nostalgia she invokes is that of a bygone era rich in cultural . and historical significance.

Of course. the steel superstructure requirement was meant for oceangoing vessels. but it has. inadvertently. I believe. affected the Delta Queen. Twice before. Congress has acted to give the Queen reprieve by exempting her from the steel superstructure requirement. Today. I believe we should again do so to protect this important. irreplaceable relic of the past. The Queens owners. Greene Line Steamers. Inc.. have invested a good deal of time and money to insure the safety of the paddlewheelers passengers and the Queen has written an excellent safety record. I believe the safety precautions. the safety record. and the Queens magnificent history combine to merit our favorable consideration of the required exemption.",

I rise to urge my colleagues to join in support of this effort to preserve one of the last living museums of our Nations great heritage on the Mississippi River. In this age of modern transportationof jet airplanes. highspeed buses and trains and faster and faster means to get us from one place to another. we often forget to look and appreciate the sights we pass along the way. We forget the every day drama of life that Is being waged in each of Americas communities and towns. This was not the case with steamboat transportation in the heyday of the magnificent paddlewheelers of the Mississippi. When it took days instead of hours to get to a destination several hundred miles away. one had a chance to reflect on ones surroundings and the emotions they welled in him. Today. a trip on the Delta Queen provides the traveler this same perspective on a bygone era. If only to preserve this perspective. I urge that we act today to grant the continued operation of \"the Queen.\" The bill under consideration today exempts the Delta Queen from the fire standards established for deepwater vessels. This is not a permanent exemption. but one that would be In effect until November 1. 1978. when a new $15.5 million passenger riverboat. can take her place. The financial resources necessary to build the new vessel will depend upon whether the Delta Queen is allowed to continue operation until her replacement is ready. Granting this extension to the Delta Queen would be a giant step toward retaining for posterity the last remaining link with- the era of the Mississippi. Ohio. and Tennessee River boats. In my opinion it should be saved.",

In many ways they were also the center of life for the inhabitants of the river towns. providing entertainment and a tie with other parts of the land. Today. there remains only one overnight passenger paddlewheel steamboat. the Delta Queen. She makes regular trips up and down the Mississippi. and Ohio Rivers. granting us the opportunity to glance back into a bygone eraan era of Tom Sawyers and. Huck Finns. of riverboat gamblers. and of a music all its own.. Today- we have the opportunity to preserve a living symbol of this heritage. It has been argued that the Delta Queen should meet standards established for deepwater vessels. but those regulations were designed to protect passengers on ships hundreds of miles from land. The Delta Queen is- never more than 5 minutes from shore and meets modern firefighting capability standards. In order to assure the preservation of this- portion of our river heritage. the present owners of the Delta- Queen are currently building a riverboat which will meet the new structural standards. I urge you to vote today to extend the life of the present Delta Queen so that she and her successor might continue to inspire future generations of Americans.",

H.R. 7423 to increase the authorization for fiscal year 1974 for the Committee for Purchase of P -oducts and Services of the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped. Mr. Speaker. I believe the bill now before the House is rather straightforward. It increases the authorization for the Committee for Purchase of Products and Services of the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped by $40.000 for fiscal year 1974. The committees function is to help increase employment opportunities for blind and handicapped workers by selecting products and services which the Government will purchase from certified workshops employing these workers. The existing authorization of $200.000 was set in 1971 when Public Law 9228 amended the WagnerODay Act of 1938. Besides expanding the coverage of the act to other severely handicapped. the 1971 amendment authorized a full time staff for the committee. The original authorization was not based on actual operating experience and represented the best information available at that time. Subsequently. increases in rental costs. travel requirements to inspect workshops for compliance and to provide assistance. and step level increases in salary necessitated an increase of $40.000. The Senate has already passed S. 1413. a bill identical to this one. The Appropriations Committee has received testimony on the need for this additional amount. Approval of this authorization would clear the way for action by the committee. This action today is of a onetime nature. Since new authorization for fiscal year 1975 and thereafter will be required. our subcommittee plans to hold hearings to put the authorization procedure on a continuing and realistic basis.",

Two years ago. the Congress enacted another bill emanating from the Special Studies Subcommittee of the Government Operations Committeeone which established a Committee for Purchase of Products and Services of the Blind and Other Severely Handicapped. We authorized an annual appropriation of $200.000 for hiring a staff and conducting the business of the committee. Mr. Speaker. that small sum has proven a good investment. The committee has done excellent work in providing opportunities for handicapped people to become part of the American economy. Due to increased operating costs and a recognition that the committees staff must leave Washington somewhat more frequently if it is to do its job properly. the committees authorization must be increased by $40.000 for fiscal year 1974. This small increment is justified. H.R. 7423 would provide it. I hope that the House will follow my subcommittee and the full Government Operations Committee in giving unanimous support to the bill Mr. Speaker. this appropriation is one I think every Member of Congress supPorts.

As- a result of Public Law 922. which passed the House upon the recomnendation of the Government Operations Committee. other severely handicapped were included within the scope of the blind committees operations. That committee is now pursuing the goal of fully Implementing the legislative mandate. It has plans to expand its operations still further. to assist in training. handicapped citizens so that they have sufficient. skills to leave their sheltered workshops and become truly selfsufficient. The aims of the legislation we passed 2 years ago are valuable. Fulfilling them requires a small amount of money. In the last Congress. we enacted an authorization for this committee using cost estimates which could not have been based on operating experience. for the committee: had never before had a staff. The first full years experience has demonstrated that our original authorization was too low. and must t increased by $40.00y for fiscal year 1974.

An amendment introduced by Senator HUGHES. identical to this bill. passed the Senate on June 5. 1974 as part of the military procurement authorization bill. In conference on the authorization bill. the House conferees supported this amendment in principle. but could not accept it because it was considered nongermane under the House rules. H.R. 15936 passed the House on This bill revises the language of the recent law by permitting payment of continuation pay to officers undergoing initial residency training. provided that they otherwise qualify for such pay. H.R. 15936 corrects an unfortunate and unforeseen consequence on recent legislation. Public Law 93274. enacted May 6. 1974. which revises the special pay structure for medical officers in the uniformed services. This law sought to increase pay in the early years of service for military medical officers. so that the differential between civilian and military earning power could be narrowed. Unfortunately. because the law denies continuation pay to men in their initial residency in military hospitals. some younger doctors with 5 to 10 years service face immediate pay cuts of $5.000 to $6.000 per year. There are approximately 300 medical officers who would be affected. The problem is that some doctors with several years service are only now completing their initial residency. which is something usually done immediately after finishing medical school. Instead. many of these doctors went directly to the fleet or to the field out of medical school where they were of direct and vital service to our men in Southeast Asia.

I opposed this change and believe that this years experience demonstrates the desirability of reinstating it. but there are other even more serious shortcomings of the disaster provision. The trouble began when the Department of Agriculture set the acreage allotment for this year. Although advocating greatly increased planting over last years 102 million acres of feed grains. It established a national allotment for feed grains of 89 million acres. In March 1974. the USDA projected that 126 million acres of feed grains would be planted or 40 percent more than the allotment. The Senate Agriculture Committee held hearings on the inadequacy of the allotment. but the USDA refused to change it. Consider what this means for a farmer with a feed grain allotment of 100 acres and an established yield of 100 bushels. who has planted 140 acres of corn or 40 percent more than his allotment as the typical feed grain producer has done this year. If a natural disaster prevented him from planting 40 of the 140 acres. he would not be eligible for disaster payments. This would occur only if the bad weather kept his planted acres below 100. Then he would receive onethird of the target priceonethird of $1.38 equals 46 centstimes the yield of 100 bushels or $46 per acre for each acre below 100. Thus. if he could plant only 90 acres he would receive $460not much compensation for 50 acres of lost production. Consider now what would happen if he were able to plant all 140 acres. but the drought cut his yield by 50 percent and he harvests only 7.000 bushels. He would not be eligible for disaster payments because this is still more than twothirds the established yield on his allotment. Only if total production fell below 6.667 bushels would he be eligible for assistance.",

U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell recently pointed out that legally sanctioned snooping has become a common practice which has proliferated without judicial supervision. According to Judge Gesell: Informers. in return for government promises or hope cf favors. are equipped with recording devices and sent into the homes and offices of their friends ad confidants to try to trap their words on tape ... Many individuals. without any knowledge of the government. secretly tape their own conversations with others for ulterior purposes and use casual remarks to extort or intimidate ... My bill will make the practice of bugging illegal not only in the White House. but anywhere. Violations would be punishable by fines ranging up to $10.000 and up to 5 years in jail. and by being subject to civil suits. The courts would. of course. retain the power to authorize wiretaps for investigations involving criminal activities or national security.",

Mr. Baxter has served as executive director of the Syracuse Junior Achievement since its founding in 1966. Under his direction the program has grown from unknown experiment in economic education to a program of 30 miniature companies. 1.000 annual participants. and solidly established in the community. Many cities have JA programs and Syracuses is far from being the largest. but what denotes ours is the love and respect that hundreds of former high school students in the central New York area had for Dale Baxter. The students named him the recipient of the first Kenneth R. Leach Award. recognizing his contribution to their own futures. The annual closing banquet for the program year finds him the recipient of numerous gifts and awards. Dale Baxter is leaving Syracuse for a new job with Junior Achievement in Denver. Colo. While his many friends and \"achievers\" will miss him. they all echo my feelings that he finds success and happiness in his new job.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am happy to have the opportunity to support Senate Joint Resolution 25. the national next door neighbor day bill which originated with Mrs. Becky Mattson of Lakeside. Mont. The idea for this annual day to be observed the fourth Sunday of each September was spearheaded by Mrs. Mattson. Her concern. and that all of us. is the national loss of our sense of community. Many factors have contributed to this loss. including urbanization. high mobility. and others. In A Nation of Strangers. noted author Vance Packard says that: The people of America have no more urgent problem today than to combat the uprootedness and unconnectedness which are producing so much social fragmentation. Most can start in their own towns and urban neighborhoods . . . Technological progress is no bargain if we lose the natural human community in the process. We must respond to that urgent need and Senate Joint Resolution 25 will help to start us on the right road. Hopefully. that road will lead us to renewed caring for our next door neighbors. for our neighbors down the block. for one generation to the other. and from this Nation to all other nations. By giving people an opportunity to express appreciation for their fellow man. a commemorative day such as this may take the bitter edge of loneliness off and may sustain those whose lives are otherwise lacking in personal contact and human warmth. As Mrs. Mattson says: This day will not be a cureall for the social ills and fragmentation in todays world but it will be one short easy step for families to make together and a basic way to begin a new age of caring. I urge unanimous passage of Senate Joint Resolution 25 so that we may start a new time of caring on September 23. The Senate joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. The title was amended so as to read: \"To authorize and request the President to issue a proclamation designating the fourth Sunday in September 1973. as National Next Door Neighbor Day.\" A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.",

As a cosponsor of this legislation it is obvious where my sympathies lie. However. today I would like to address my remarks to my colleagues on the role of women in the working world right now. In the past few years a revolution has taken place among many women of our country. Most men ridiculed it at first as a passing phaseperhaps as something childish. Then it was ridiculed out of fear of something that could not be understood. Now it is plain that women have indeed been treated as second class citizens. that intellectual abilities have been thwarted and opportunities for achievement denied because of sex. This realization is an important first step in overcoming the consequences of longstanding penalities levied against women by virtue of their being women. Now it is our duty. not only to women or to ourselves but to our countrys best welfare. to foster the right attitude for womens equality. The Congress is taking great steps in overcoming its own daytoday prejudices. Much more must be done. American business is also trying to provide the same opportunities extended to men for the growing numbers of working women. It will. however. take a long time to quash the discrimination of centuries. Each encounter with women is an opportunity to change this dismal record. Both men and women must work in this direction together. Mr. Speaker. womens equality Is a serious matter that must be dealt with in the years to come with all the maturity of our Nations people. I sincerely hope my colleagues join me in sharing this view and the other comments I have made today.",

The designation of August 26 as Womens Equality Day is a recognition of the importance of that day to the continuing effort to establish equal rights for women in this country. August 26. of course. is the anniversary of that day in 1920 when the 19th amendment was finally ratifleda day which came perhaps too late in our history but which marked the beginning of a new era in the struggle for equal rights for women. With the ballot and female participation in the political process came a growing awareness of the vital contribution of women to our society. and of the necessity for full political. social. and civil rights for women. Of course. there are still many inequalities and discriminations suffered by women in this country. Another landmark constitutional amendment is on its way to ratification. the equal rights amendment. Thirty of the required 38 States have now ratified this amendment. It is to be hoped that final ratification will come soon. and that the amendment will bring the desired changes in many areas. There is also a wide variety of legislation pending which affects the rights of women in many areas. including tax treatment. credit and mortgage equality. and job discrimination. It is clear. however. that not all of the unfair treatment experienced by women can be changed by either legislation or constitutional amendment. Much of the discrimination which exists in this country is due to the social attitudes and prejudices held by people. both men and women. Only time can change this situation. but I believe that public support for improved womens rights and public awareness of both the gains that have been made and the work that remains to be done will assist in this process. It is for this reason that I support the designation of August 26 as Womens Equality Day. as an indication of congressional support for the continuing efforts to achieve full equality for women and of commemoration of the final ratification of the 19th amendment.",

At the present time. there are thousands of these children in understaffed orphanages or fending for themselves in city streets. The frightful living conditions of these children have received considerable attention in the media during recent months. Many Americans have responded to this situation by offering to adopt the victims of this tragic war. but they have found their efforts frustrated by existing immigration laws. Over 5.000 families have been approved by local adoption agencies. but immigration statutes preclude 95 percent of these children from being admitted to the United States. Many of the problems associated with adopting AmericanVietnamese children would be eliminated with the passage of H.R. 8381. This bill will automatically grant such a child the status of U.S. citizenship when accepted by a qualified American family. For a child to qualify for this citizenship. he must be under 12 years old. born in the Republic of South Vietnam prior to January 1. 1974. have one parent who. in all probability. was a U.S. citizen. and who has been orphaned or abandoned.

No payments were made to Mobile County for that year. The amendment would clarify the situation. If they are migratory. just as the agricultural workers are migratoryand certainly the Department has its own definition of what constitutes migratory conditionsand if the agricultural workers are entitled to have their children counted.

I know that my colleagues share my deep concern about the standard of education in this Nation. and about the future of hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren. Thus. it is important that we carefully review the major title on this bill. title ISpecial Educational Programs and Projects for Educationally Deprived Children. I know that there will be extensive debate and discussion about the Senate committee title I formula. and about the concomitant effects this formula will have on delivering educational services to disadvantaged children. It is with this in mind that I review for my colleagues the history and development of this formula in committee. and point out its salient characteristics. I know also that my colleagues will be wondering about the specific financial effect this formula will have on their own States. and no doubt they will be comparing this effect to the effect of action taken by the other body just a few weeks ago. At thu outset. I want to emphasize that this program is an educational program above all for economically and educationally deprived children. It Is furthermore a program for the entire United States and not just for a single State or a single region. My colleagues in reviewing the effects of the committee bill should keep in mind that in the final result the purpose is to insure equality of educational opportunity to all children and that title I is designed to insure that poor children are assisted so tha6 they. too. will share in that opportunity. There can be no doubt that some States under the committee formula appear to receive smaller estimated allocations than they would under the House bill.

Occurrences such as this may cause far more than substantial inconvenience. They hold a potential for tragic consequqences. In an effort to lessen the chances of such occurrences. the Hospital Council of Southern California. has classified all hospitals in the area as to its emergency capabilities. and has broadly disseminated this information throughout the community. I am particularly pleased to note that this information is being disseminated in both English and Spanish. the latter being a major language in the Los Angeles and other areas of California. The categorization of hospital facilities and broad public information programs to enable the resident of a community to know how to get emergency treatment immediately are two elements essential to a communitys being able to provide emergency medical services. There are mandatory elements of an emergency medical services system to be assisted by the legislation I introduced. 3. 504. the Emergency Medical Services Systems Development Act of 1973. which recently passed the Senate and is pendng conference with the House.

I was necessarily absent Tuesday afternoon when the Senate completed its consideration of S. 7528. authorizing appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I would have voted against final passage of S. 7528 had I been present. My opposition to this bill is not an opposition to all NASA programs and activities. I have been pleased by the many successes of our space program and am hopeful that its scientific and technological developments will have an increasing range of constructive domestic applications. The costs of an expanded space program must be balanced against other national priorities. Some of the funds authorized for NASA in S. 7528 should be devoted instead to more pressing needs. I am particularly dubious about the merits of the Space Shuttle program. for which S. 7528 authorizes more than half a billion dollars. A recent study by the GAO raises serious questions about the accuracy of NASAs cost estimates and savings projections for the shuttle program. Continued development of the shuttle also increases the momentum for expansion of other aspects of our space program. if only to justify the costs of the shuttle itself. I submit that it would make more sense in this time of budgetary stringency to develop and support mass transit systems for our crowded cities. The Senate has twice approved a $268 billion outlay ceiling for fiscal 1974. The budget must be cut somewhere. I would prefer to cut funds for the space program than funds for housing. health. education. or transportation here on Earth. The activities of NASA must be evaluated from the perspective of our total national needs. The authorizations in S. 7528 exceed what we can reasonably afford.

Yesterday the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that retail food prices will average 12 percent higher this year despite phase III. the 60day freeze. and the promise of a phase IV later in the year. It is long past time for us to realize that cosmetic measures such as shortterm. limited price freezes will not turn back prices. What is needed in the short run is a price rollback and a freeze on the cost of raw agricultural and meat products at the farm level. It is at the sourcethe farm levelthat inflation is most rampant. In the last year 83 percent of the increase in the cost of the market basket of food went to the farmusually the large agribusiness corporation. 17 percent went to the wholesalers and grocers. In the long run we must move the American agricultural system back to a free market economy. The farm sub. sidy program should be eliminated. And the new farm bill. which compounds the problems of the past. should be defeated. It is a guaranteed annual income for large agribusiness corporations. The bill guarantees recordhigh target prices for farmers for wheat. cotton. and feed grains. And these prices would escalate as the cost of production goes up. This means that by 1976 we will be paying $7 billion to farmers. Every housewife in America will be making these payments every time she enters a grocery store. If the farm bill reaches the Presidents desk. he should veto it. It is time for action not rhetoric. I ask unanimous consent that an article on this subject be inserted at this point in the RECORD.",

It establishes a foundation of the development of an effective program of prevention. identification. and treatment of child abuse. Child abuse is one of the most shocking problems facing our Nation. Senator MONDALES deep concern for children who have been battered. beaten. or severly abused and his perseverance in moving forward ii. this vital area are reflected in legislation that marks an important step toward halting this dread disease. Our subcommittee recognizes the need to focus on child abuse if this country is to effectively deal with the problem. The public must be made aware of the severity of the problem and that possible treatment is available. The National Commission on Child Abuse and Neglect established under S. 1191 to fully study and investigate the problems of child abuse will continue the necessary attention to this critical issue. S. 1191 also provides for the establishment of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in the Office of Child Development. The Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare would be authorized to make grants through the center for the training of personnel to work in the area of child abuse and to make grants for the establishment of regional centers designed to prevent. identify. and treat child abuse. During subcommittee hearings on this problem representatives of the administration testified that legislation is not needed. It was their contention that the present structure was working effectively. despite the 60.000 cases of child abuse reported each year. During a recent conference in Washington on child abuse. however. the administration presented a $4 million proposal to study the problem. It is my feeling that the administrations proposal was formalized only when action by our subcommittee became imminent. The proposal approved by our subcommittee does not commit the Federal Government to an extensive and costly program before we have a complete study of the problem and recommendations for action by the National Commission on Child Abuse and Neglect.

The amendment would not be subject to a point of order if the earmarking were omitted. Then. of course. we probably might say in the report that we assume it will be used for this purpose. I am not impressed by letters from the League of Cities and those people. They naturally want this money. As a matter of fact. many of them are now in a position where the burden has shifted from the States and local governments. in many places. to the Federal Government. We are talking about reducing expenditures while many of the States are in surplus because of what we have been doing. Revenue sharing has been used to make capital improvements. while health and the things we were worried about are at the bottom of the totem pole.

I would just like to call the attention of the Senator and the Senate to the fact that 6 days ago Secretary Brennan. of the Department of Labor. based upon the information that he had. allocated $350 million for public service jobs. He announced the allocation of $350 million to States and localities with substantial unemployment. making it possible for them to create some 73.000 public service jobs. This completes the funding requested by President Ford at a White House meeting on September 11 with national labor leaders. Within 48 hours of that meeting. Secretary Brennan had allocated $65 million. The current action brings the total to $415 million. creating a total of 85.000 jobs. Distribution of the $350 million has begun. and hiring can start immediately. You cannot even hire that number of people overnight. The $350 million was authorized by title II of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act at the administrations fiscal 1975 appropriation request level. The aim of title II is to give the unemployed transitional public service employment in areas of substantial unemployment. The funds include $280 million. 80 percent. for State and local governments with areas having substantial. 6.5 percent or higher. unemployment 3 straight months. The amounts were determined by the number of unemployed living In each area compared to the number of unemployed living in all such areas of substantial unemployment. Seventy million dollars. 20 percent. is. at the Secretarys discretion. also for States and localities most severely affected by unemployment. and having a 6.5 percent or higher unemployment. Then It goes on to outline the present $350 million combined with $620 million distributed since June. making a total of $970 million. and can provide some 70.000 public service jobs this coming winter. All of this is in the works. I felt this should go Into the RECORD and that it was appropriate to call this information to the attention of the Senator at this time.",

Although forebodings over the energy crisis are playing havoc with the stock market. there is a \"bull market\" here in Washington as competing energyrelated interests in and out of Government scramble for the new Federal dollars which will be available for energy research and development. The President is to be complimented for the firm hand he has lent to planning for new energy programs and for his specific mention of the need for research on energy conservation. yet this Item. which is relatively small in comparison to the large research priorities now emerging. must not be lost in the shuffle. Energy conservation is a broad and largely untapped subject. which extends far beyond the act of doing without energyfueled niceties. There is considerable potential for enhancing the technology of home heating and cooling. and far more could be done to recycle waste heat. steam. and fuel. In these investigations. there are exciting possibilities for new inventiveness and ingenuity. which can turn the dross of our society into the new gold of energy. Mr. Speaker.

This radical concept of Government intervention Into medicine would accomplish what the \"plumbers unit\" failed to do in the celebrated burglary of Dr. Ellsbergs psychiatrists office. PSRO will enable the Government to \"legally burglarize\" the confidential medical records of every patient treated under any of the many Governmentsponsored health care programs. After January 1. when HEW is scheduled to begin implementation of PSRO. formerly confidential medical and psychiatric records will become public records. This plundering of records by PSRO examiners is necessary for the Department to develop norms to cover care. diagnosis. and treatment of the ill. The stiff penalties for failure to comply. suspension from practice and fines up to $5.000. have caused some physicians to already notify patients that after January 1. they will no longer treat patients whose fees are paid directly or indirectly by social security.

FAO. and members of the Permanent Interstate Committee of the Six Sahelian Countrieshas recently returned from an onthescene survey in the six affected countries. The international mission estimated that food needs in the drought area are up to 662.000 tons through September 1974. Further. the international mission found that nutritional levels of substantial portions of the population were \"poor and often bad.\" It is urgent that we realize that although about onethird of the 662.000 tons of food needed is \"in the pipeline\" that the deficit which is left is about 400.000 tons.

It notes that economists generally see a future of continued affluence. although spending habits may change direction a bit. The major reason for their optimism is that they expect the economy to continue growing faster than the population. The economists also note a growing participation in the labor force by women. By last year. families with more than one worker accounted for almost 55 percent of the families headed by married men in the labor force. compared with 45 percent 10 years ago. Economists do not expect this percentage to stay on a dramatic climbbut they do not expect large numbers of women to leave the labor force either.

Public Law 93373 will become effective. One consequence of this is that banks will enter Into the business of gold dealing. Since this is an entirely new venture. and since the law is extremely vague as to what banks may or may not do in the gold trade. I believe it is urgent for the Federal Reserve to respond to pressing questions about this. The language of the law. as you know. is extremely broad and couched in terms which appear to have the sole intent of denying any effective regulation over gold dealings. This being so. the first and most urgent question I have is whether the Federal Reserve can. in fact. regulate gold dealings by its member banks. Is it possible. for example. for the Federal Reserve to prohibit banks from dealing in gold futures? Does the Federal Reserve contemplate counting gold assets held by banks as part of their reserve requirements? Would the Federal Reserve accept gold held by banks as collateral against loans by the System to its member institutions? From all available information. it is Inpossible to estimate the size of the potential gold rush. Nor is it possible to determine just how banks will deal in gold. No guidelines have been issued and so far as I know none have been prepared. I do not believe that this law should be allowed to become effective without an adequate understanding of Federal regulations if any that will apply. I would appreciate your advising me at your earliest convenience. whether you believe the statute should be modified or Its effective date delayed so as to enable a smooth transition to unrestricted private ownership. I know that you have opposed this Amendment. as I have. I believe that Congress would have been wise never to have adopted it. because so few people are asking hard questions about what this statute means and what it will do. I am particularly anxious to have your appraisal of it and especially your appraisal of the possibilities that remain for effective and adequate regulation of banking activity in the gold market. With best wishes. I am Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on October 29. while Congress was in recess. President Ford vetoed H.R. 14225. the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974. My colleagues will recall that the House passed this legislation *by a vote of 400 to 1 on May 21. 1974. and the House and Senate unanimously agreed to the conference report on October 16. Mr. Speaker. the President specifically stated that he was not vetoing the bill because of the amount of money involved: He said: The key issue posed by this bill is not how much money will be spent. The issue posed is how well the programs will be run. But the veto message which accompanied the measure back to the Speaker is so rife with factual errors and incomprehensible assertions that I fear the President has been seriously misinformed about the purposes and the contents of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. let me stress that I make this observation not from any partisan motive and. indeed. more in regret than in anger. For I fear that the same advisers who tried to hinder and disrupt the vocational rehabilitation program under Richard Nixon are. today. proffering the same bad advice to our former colleague. now President. Mr. Ford. Mr. Speaker. I want to emphasize also that the distress and puzzlement I voice are not mine alone. The distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and Labor. the gentleman from Minnesota . for example. immediately following the veto. expressed his \"extreme disappointment\" at President Fords decision and indicated his intention to vote to override the veto when Congress reconvened. And on November 7. Burt L. Risley. president of the National Council of State Agencies for the Blind. wrote to me of his dismay at the veto. Said Mr. Risley: President Fords veto of H.R. 14225 is both distressing and inexplicable. Having carefully reviewed the Presidents veto message. we must confess that we are unable to understand what the President means by the various reasons given in support of his veto. The various statements made in the veto message simply are not supported by any facts of which we in this Commission are aware and the rationale offered In support of the decision not to sign the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 cannot in any manner withstand objective analysis.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is debate in the Congress as to the value of utilizing incentives and disincentives to control pollution. It is argued by some that this indirect subsidy of TVA should not be enacted. because it distorts the relationship between the consumer and pollution control costs. I am inclined to agree that goods ought to include as a part of their price the cost of pollution control. But we have in a number of ways acted because of an assumed national interest to permit certain pollution control costs to be spread to the taxpayer as whole rather than just to the consumer of a given product. Production of electricity is but one example. As I have indicated. electric utilities have been able to take advantage of tax exempt bonds. investment tax credits. and accelerated amortization to reduce the impact on their ratepayers of pollution control costs. The bill before us provides temporary relief for TVA to reduce the impact of pollution control investment on its ratepayers. It is an imperfect mechanism. But I suggest to my colleagues that it will provide significant stimuli to the Nations largest electric utility to again assert a leadership role in the development of new technology and new ideas. The TVA will be required to spend this money for the kind of pollution control investment that is clearly consistent with clean air and water laws. I would hope the TVA would utilize these funds to go beyond the mere requirements of law and provide new techCXX2297Part 27 niques. new technologies. and new methods to meet our environmental needs.",
