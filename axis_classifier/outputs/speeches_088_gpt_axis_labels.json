    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Monday. August 3. our distinguished Secretary of the Interior. Mr. Stewart L. Udall. released a memorandum which he has written to the Director of the National Park Service. concerning the management of our national park system. Secretary Udall. in his memorandum. has clearly spelled out the management principles to be followed by the National Park Service in the management of the three categories of areas which have been placed in the national park system by the Congress during the almost 100 years since the beginning of the national park movement with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. In addition. the Secretary has set forth six longrange objectives to guide the management of the national park system. The National Park Service was established by the Congress on August 25. 1916. In a letter of May 13. 1918. the then Secretary of the Interior. Franklin K. Lane. outlined the management principles to guide the new Service in its management of the national parks and national monuments then included within the national park system. Every succeeding Secretary has reaffirmed three principles. and Secretary Udall. in his memorandum. has reaffirmed them in the management of the natural areas of the system. However. during the intervening years. the Congress has expanded the national park system to include areas of historical significance. as well as areas having national recreational significance. Secretary Udalls memorandum develops additional management principles for these new categories of areas. Without doubt Secretary Udalls memorandum is the most significant pronouncement by any Secretary in recent times concerning the management of our national park system.

To give deserved recognition to this milestone. under leave to extend my remarks I am pleased to insert the following proclamation and commend it to the readership of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: Whereas much of what is now Lincoln Park between Diversey Parkway and North Avenue has always been public property. having been purchased by the city in its early days from the State of Illinois for cemetery and other public purposes. and Whereas. by 1860. after repeated cholera epidemics.4his dreary area contained. in addition to three cemeteries. a morgue. a pesthouse. an axle grease factory. and was thieaded by the stagnant. unsavory. diseasebreeding 10mile ditch. and Whereas a group of publicspirited citizens of the North Side recognizing the need for drastic improvement of the area. prepared and pulilished a study entitled \"Public Parks: Their Effect Upon the Moral. Physical. and Sanitary Condition of the Inhabitants of Large Cities With Special Reference to the City of Chicago.\" and repeatedly petitioned the city council to allocate all or a portion of these lands for park purposes. and Whereas their efforts were successful when on October 21. 1864. the council passed ordinances dedicating approximately 60 acres of the tract as a public park to be known as Lake Park. and shortly thereafter appropriated money for improvements. and took action toward condemning and removing the adjacent cemeteries. and Whereas the following year. after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. the council deemed it fitting and proper that this park. the largest in the city. be renamed in honor of the martyred president. and Whereas from these humble beginnings. Lincoln Park has now grown to almost 1.200 acres and contains facilities for practically every form of sports. games and public resort and recreation: Now. therefore. be it Resolved by the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Park District. That the period from July 26 to August 1. 1964. be proclaimed \"Lincoln Park Centennial\" to be observed with appropriate ceremonies. games and spectacles. and that all of the citizens of Chicago are most cordially invited to attend. participate in. and enjoy this 100th birthday celebration.

As I interpret their writings. to them the Republican Party should be a cheap imitation of the Democrat Party which exists only because it is necessary to have some nominal opposition in a representative republic. Can it be that the liberals who are shedding crocodile tears for the Republican Partys death are really afraid that a Republican victory could be in the offing? Is it their real fear that if the GOP offers the people a \"choice. not an echo\" that they will accept that choice and reinstate in Washington a Government dedicated to the principles of free enterprise?

The production of sugar in America provides such job opportunities not only in factories but in rural areas and service industries so vital to producing sugar. Lastly. all Americans deserve. need. and must have a dependable source of this staple commoditythis can only be assured by increasing American production.

The program we have had since 1962. and which is soon to expire. has been helping new growers. and I feel we have to enact legislation which will continue to give the new grower some reasonable place in this picture.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in visiting with sugarbeet growers in Michigans Eighth District and from heavy correspondence. it is obvious that the over 5.000 families in Michigan and Ohio are visibly concerned with the future of the sugar industry. The need to increase the basic sugarbeet quota by 750.000from the present 2.650.000 tons to 3.400.000is real. As has been pointed out earlier. it is in the interest of U.S. sugar consumers and is vital to American farmers who need sugarbeets as a cash crop and as an alternate or replacement for crops now in surplus production. It is important to keep in mind that unless the basic sugarbeet quota is increased. established sugarbeet growers will be faced with a 40percent cut in acreages. The sugar industry is important to Michigan. In 1963. Michigan farmers grossed over $16 million from the sale of sugarbeets. Besides thousands of farmers. over 6.000 persons are employed in the producing. processing. and distribution of the product. More than $7.5 million has been invested in expanding Michigan sugar factories. New factories are extremely costly. It does not seem reasonable to expect the persons will invest millions of dollars for factories when it appears possible that quotas will be imposed in the near future. And. let us not forget that. from 1962 to May 1963. sugar prices jumped from 4.8 cents per pound to 12.6 cents because of a dwindling supply and rising world consumption. Faced with this situation. the Department of Agriculture announced that acreage allotments would be removed for 196365. This was done to stimulate domestic production. The domestic sugarbeet industry responded with immediate and substantial increases in production. far above existing quota levels. It saved millions of dollars for U.S. consumers in 1963. This increase is warranted. it is justified. and it is deserving.",

I certainly recognize this to be a very important problem and one important to my district and State. In Kansas we have a very great sugarbeet potential. On March 19. I introduced a bill to increase the amount of domestic beet sugar and mainland cane sugar which may be marketed during 1964. 1965. and 1966. The basic beet sugar quota of 2.6 million tons should be increased to 3.4 million tons. This increase is in the interest of U.S. sugar consumers. and vital to Kansas beet growers who need sugarbeets as a cash crop. and as an alternate or replacement for crops now in surplus. The 750.000 increase in the basic beet sugar quota could be made without disturbing any of the present individual country quotas. as the increase would come from the socalled global quota. This bill can easily be amended to continue the special provision enacted in 1962 which sets up the administrative machinery providing for sugar quotas for new producers and areas of present production. This will attract the necessary financing to insure construction of a processing plant. Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD. as a part of my remarks. two excellent articles from the Wichita Eagle and Beacon of Sunday. June 7. 1964.

Tobacco is produced in 21 States. It is an $8 billion industry with Government receiving approximately $3.3 billion in tax per annum. It is the fifth largest income producing crop to its growers. It is vital to the economy of our Nation. If this amendment is adopted and enacted into law the Federal Government will lose millions of dollars on stocks of tobacco now in storage.

I share his concern regarding the action of the Department of Agriculture. in its action issuing certain regulations in the dead of night. so to speak. I was very much surprised at the new regulations which will go into effect almost immediately. As I understood the situation. under the law. the purpose of Congress in passing the act was to require a processor to buy certificates only for wheat going into food products. That was pointed out by the gentleman from North Carolina. the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. on the floor when that matter was upand not on wheat going into products used by industrial processors. There are a number of littleknown uses of wheat that I have in mind. My particular concern is with the socalled wheat clears that are widely used in my area. which is taken off along with the feed when a mill makes bakery flour. The higher ash material. as I understand it. goes into a number of industrial uses including plywood. adhesives. laundry starch. textiles. and paper size. It is foolish. it seems to me. to treat these clears the same as flour going into bread. For one thing. under the food and drug regulations. it is against the law to sell the higher ash clears as flour. Even more important. we talk a lot about industrial uses of wheat and other agricultural products and have appropriated large sums for this purpose. The use of these clears by industrial processors is right in line with what Congress intends for agricultural products and it has not cost the Government 1 cent to develop these uses.

I was not one of those who supported the 1964 wheat legislation. but I am absolutely certain that it was the intent of Congress that processors of wheat into manfood products should not be required to purchase domestic marketing certificates. The legislative history both in the other body and here in the House. thanks to the gentleman from Michigan. is cleargoing back to the 1962 actthat a price adjustment would be arranged either with the millers or the industrial processors of flour in recognition of the fact that not all of the end product is to be used for human food purposes.

My distinguished colleague. the junior Senator from North Dakota . inforned me that between 1956 and 1962 there was an average of 890 million pounds imported while in 1962 there were 1.9 billion pounds imported. and this year the increase is even larger. This situation cannot be handled lightly when we are presented with such information as this. In addition to the import situation the livestock producer is confronted with customer preferences and changing marketing patterns. These matters need attention. but I feel that the most beneficial action at this time would be the establishment of a quota system on imports. There has been quite a bit of talk about legislation. I do not think this is the quickest way. in fact it might confuse an already complex situation. I have discussed this matter with a number of officials in the administration and I feel that this can be done administratively under existing law. Senator BURDICK was successful in getting the Senate Finance Committee to adopt a resolution directing the Tariff Commission to begin an investigation of the impact of foreign beef imports on the domestic market. I hope the Commission will act expeditiously in this matter. I believe there is sufficient authority under the Trade Expansion Act and through executive action to bring about some relief. The livestock industry Is one of the most basic industries in our country. it cannot be allowed to drift. I commend this matter of increased cattle and beef imports to the attention of our President and his counselors. and ask that it be given immediate attention and action at the executive level.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. no high official of the U.S. Government in recent years has conducted himself with greater effectiveness than Assistant Secretary of State for InterAmerican Affairs. Edwin M. Martin. Mr. Martin has recently yielded this important post to another distinguished official. Thomas Mann. It is understood that President Johnson has been anxious to highlight the importance of Latin America as far as U.S. policy is concerned. To do that he has ordered certain changes in the authority and responsibility of the Assistant Secretary post and apparently felt it was necessary to dramatize his action with a new appointment. While I personally feel that the new Secretary. Thomas Mann. is a highly able official. his appointment should in no way detract from the magnificent record of Secretary Martin. During the first 2 years of President Kennedys administration. I served as Director of the food for peace program. In that capacity I came to a new appreciation of our State Department officials. No one of them impressed me more favorably than Ed Martin. He is a completely devoted. highly intelligent. progressiveminded administrator with a long and impressive record behind him. He is the kind of rare individual whose great talent calls for a constantly rising recognition of his ability. I hope. and fully expect. that this administration and future administrations will recognize his expanding capacity for service. My own view is that there is no post in the State Department including the office of Secretary of State that is beyond Ed Martins capacity. I have complete faith in his judgment. his genius for inspiring the confidence and cooperation of his colleagues. and his total devotion to the best interests of the United States. Mr. President. the December 19 issue of the Washington Star carried a column by Mr. Charles Bartlett relative to the service of Mr. Martin. and the new responsibilities that face Mr. Mann.

Theres only one way to do both of these two things. Stop spending so much money on foolishness--on unneeded projects. That means \"Stop giving so much money to persons who would be better off without it.\" We need a tax cut because too much of our money is going to the Federal Governmentmore of it every yearin income and excise taxes. in social security payments---even in postage.

We should have forgotten the last two words of the phrase and remembered only \"We owe it.\" Its not the Government or someone in Washington who is more than $250 billion in debt. We owe it.

The Nation. and particularly the Southwest. has been fortunate in having in the Senate a Member from a waterscarcity State who is keenly interested in the need for more water research. Our country in the next decades will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build reservoirs and dams to conserve wasting water needed for the Nations benefit. It is fitting that we spend a few dollars on plants like this one at Roswell and the one in my own State. at Freeport. Tex.. for research to find ways to cut down the great cost of water conservation. Every dollar spent on water research now will mean vast savings to the taxpayer. and Senator ANDERSON is to be congratulated for the vision and practical approach to the problems that he has demonstrated in his years in the Senate. Water scarcity is beginning to plague the entire Nation. and Senator ANDERSONS leadership in this phase of research will benefit this and future generations.

Very recently a distinguished member of the faculty of the University of Michigan Law School. Dr. Samuel D. Estep. expressed some Interesting thoughts concerning the international aspects. thoughts which I feel sure will be of interest to each Member of the Senate. In his paper he summarizes some important assumptions. Certain of these assumptions about the international implications were discussed in the Senate last summer. but others are new. Dr. Estep reviews three problem areas which will confront the organizers of the communication satellite program and the Federal Government: Relations of the Government and the Communication Satellite Corp. with other countries. relations with the International Telecommunications Union. and the selection of countries in which ground stations should be established. It is the conclusion of Dr. Estep that the decision to create a privately owned corporation for the execution of the communication system was a wise one when the international relations aspects of the activity are considered. Most especially Is this his feeling with respect to the question of location of ground stations. As one will note in reading his paper. Dr. Estep feels site selection in Europe would have involved many questions other than economics of use. were the system to be operated by the Government itself. He notes. however. that overriding reasons of national interest would permit the Federal Government to have a decisive voice in site location. should such considerations be overriding. Because of the interest each of us continues to have in the evaluation of the Communication Satellite Act of 1962. conscious that in such programs experience will permit changes and improvements. I ask unanimous consent that the paper of Dr. Estep be made a part of the helpful also to have a summary biography of Dr. Estep appear at the conclusion of this paper. and I ask unanimous consent that this be printed.",

It summarizes the major errors of both France and the United States. errors that have culminated in the present strained relations between these two keystones in the arch of our free world. Most importantly. Mr. Spanel outlines a constructive series of steps to be taken by both Nations designed to heal the existing. dangerous rift. Commenting in the RECORD dated June 12. 1961. in connection with another editolial by Mr. Spanel. I stated as follows: It is a certainty that no private citizen in American history has given so much of himself and of his company in thought. effort. and treasure. in order to establish stronger bonds between the people of the United States and France. as has Mr. Spanel since 1939. This is the more remarkable when one considers the fact that neither Mr. Spanel nor his company have any businesE interests in France.

The Senator from Colorado is entitled to high praise and favorable comment for the time and effort he has devoted to this important subject. The issue of Cuba simply will not \"down\" with the American people. The Senator from Colorado is bringing out what every American knows. namely. that the presence of a Russian army in a Russiandominated country. in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. the arrogance of Communist forces. the failure of this administration to take any action. the unwillingness of this administration to face factsbrutal facts. and an aggressive horde of evilly disposed persons in a position to render us continuously insecure. constitute a menace to the safety of every American. So long as it is ignored. so long as it is treated as if it would go away. I am certain that the American people will never feel secure in their own homes. their own localities. or their own country. until something is done to correct the situation. I am glad that the Senator from Nebraska has brought out in his colloquy the fact that there are two kinds of blockades. We have all heard much talk and many smug statements to the effect that a blockade is an act of war. Wherever I have discussed Cuba. I have met with the reaction. \"Oh. you must not talk about a blockade. because a blockade is an act of war.\" We are often met by categorical. imperative statements. statements which sound good but are totally untrue.

    "speech": "Of course. To say that Cuba is no longer a menace because some weapons have been removed is to close ones eyes and ears to the obvious fact that the greater menace is not the current presence of any weapons. The present menace is the continuing presence of any army whose government is dedicated to the destruction of the free world. That army is closer. more dangerously situated. and more evilly disposed than any army has ever been in the history of the American Republic. To say that a blockade is an act of war is not to state the factual situation. because when the administration imposed a blockade on October 22. last. it did not. under international law. change the fact that it was a blockade merely by calling it a quarantine. Interestingly enough. the word \"quarantine\" is one which had been used by the former Vice President. Mr. Nixon. in an earlier speech. It was apparently seized upon by the present administration to indicate that there was some kind of difference between a quarantine and a blockade. But when the President announced on October 22. 1962. that our military forces were so disposed as- to prevent the passage of vessels of other countries en route. to Cuba. that statement meant exactly what it said. namely. that for the time the danger lasted. which was very brief. namely. if Russian ships or Russiancontrolled ships entered the zone of our frontiers and pierced those zones to communicate with Cuba for the unloading of military and other supplies. the United States would be prepared to stop them and use such force as was necessary. That. in international law. is a blockade. We had imposed a blockade. and it was not an act of war. That is what impresses me. Why the administration must say that a blockade is an act of war. after it had imposed a blockade which was not an act of war. I cannot understand. So I should not only like to stress my agreement with the point which the Senator has been making here. but I should like to continue to have it made as clear as it can be made that a blockade by the Organization of American Statesan economic blockade or perhaps a military blockadedoes not need to be an act of war.

The practice -of obligating funds for projects far in advance of need and. in many instances. far in excess of the cost of projects. is one of the primary reasons why the aid program is so confused and the cost of many projects so excessive.

They have always attached extraordinary significance to this historic document because they felt. and still feel. that by the implementation of its liberal. sweeping provisions they were to be freed from the shackles and obstructive intricacies of their old. unwieldy. and inefficient regime. With that worthy goal in mind their leaders framed. adopted. and promulgated that Constitution. which by its democratic and progressive provisions was considered a moderate and model charter for the Poles. The Constitution drastically limited the powers of the King and made Poland a constitutional monarchy. Responsible cabinet form of government was established. the old system of class distinctions was eliminated. The upper legislative chamber lost some of its powers. and the second chamber was vested with genuine legislative authority. Economic barriers existing between the nobility and the bourgeoisie were practically obliterated. and the peasantry was taken under the protection of the law. In many ways the Constitution abolished the worst abuses from which Poland had been suffering for centuries. Its promulgation was hailed not only by the Poles. but it was also acclaimed by liberals in other countries. Unfortunately. the Poles were not given the chance to test the efficacy of this Constitution. Soon after its promulgation the country was overrun by its inveterate enemies. it was partitioned. and Polands independence was no more. But the spirit of the Constitution of 1791 lived in the hearts of the Polish people. and today they celebrate the 172d anniversary of the Constitutions adoption and promulgation.

Poland adopted its national Constitution only 2 years after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. That the same spirit animates both of these great documents of liberty is evidenced by the following statement from the Polish Constitution: All power in civil society should be derived from the will of the people. its end and object being the preservation and integrity of the state. the civil liberty and good order of society. on an equal scale and on a lastIng foundation. One hundred years ago. Mr. President. when our own Nation was engaged in a dreadful contest of* survival for the Union. Polish patriots staged their greatest and bloodiest uprising against Russian tyranny.

The Treasury is financing a huge deficit. and therefore is going to borrow larger sums of money. The Federal Treasury and the Federal Reserve is determined to finance the effort without inflation which means to them with higher interest rates. The administration and the Federal Reserve System also feel that we must increase our interest rates. at least - on Government operations. to keep money from flowing out of the country. Also the proposed tax cut is likely to put - even more pressure on interest rates and drive them even higher. I think this analysis is excellent. I happen to disagree with Sylvia Porter on the necessity for higher interest rates. I think a fair appraisal will show that we should make every effort to stop any rise in present interest rates.

The thaw is on: The test ban treaty has been signed and put into effect. the Soviets have drawn away from those bloodthirsty Chinese. the wheat transaction has been approved. there may soon be an air link between Moscow and New Yok. an agreement is being reached to establish consulates in Chicago and Leningrad. and between Washington and Moscow the lines are busy with new efforts to \"consolidate the peace.\" The fact that combatready Soviet troops Friday blocked a U.S. Army supply convoy from Berlin causes hardly a ripple in the sea of euphoria. for isnt this one of those things weve worried too much about in the past? Lets not worry so much. Weve been too tense. What matters it that: Russia is a Communist nation with the announced aim of eliminating our system. Only 1 year ago. as part of that plan. the Soviets sent missiles into Cuba and pointed them at American targets. Soviet troops and equipment remain in Cuba. and weve never been able to conduct an onsite inspection. The Russians have a long record of signing treaties and breaking them without remorse. They are friendly or hostile as suits their purpose. and they have demonstrated the patience to retreat one step in order to advance five. They have murdered and pillaged and still hold millions of Eastern Europeans as prisoners in their own lands. What does it matter if we can just have peace? Yes. the big thaw is setting in. and the torrents of \"peace\" are flowing. Let us only hope they do not wash up over the dam and down into the valley. Americanism Versus Feudalism",

Having been a colony ourselves. and having created the worlds greatest industrial nation out of the wilderness. we can appreciate some of the problems confronting some of the lessdeveloped countries. We had to reply on foreign capital for our own development during the 19th century in much the same way that other countries rely on us for foreign assistance. I think this story about the transcontinental railway makes in an amusing way a very important point: that foreign aid. in order to be a success. necessarily involves an element of risk. Strict accounting and careful safeguards are certainly necessary. but foreign aid must be more than a strictly commercial- or bankingtype operation if it is going to succeed.

The suggestion has been voiced that conflicting interests influenced judges in some important decisions in the early history of this country. For example. it Is widely suspected that Chief Justice Marshall had a strong influence in the case of Martin v. Hunters Lessee s and its predecessor. Fairfaxs Devisee v. Hunters Lessee.9 even though he disqualified himself from participating in the two cases. Marshall and his brother had a direct financial interest in the cases. as their title to a large tract of land depended upon the outcome. While Justice Story wrote for the Court in both cases and based the decisions. which were favorable to Marshall. on a treaty between the United States and England. \"[It] has been commonly supposed that Marshall practically dictated Storys two opinions * * * and certain writers have stated this to be the fact. Story himself. 15 years afterward. declared that the Chief Justice had concurred in every word of the second opinion. yet in a letter to his brother concerning the effect of Storys opinion upon another suit in the State court at Winchester. involving the same question. Marshall says: The case of Hunter and Fairfax is very absurdly put on the treaty of 94. \"10 The latter assertion. made by Marshall more than a decade after the favorable decisions. would tend to rebut the implication from Storys letter that Marshall had collaborated in the opinions. Indeed it has been affirmed. and not without historic basis. that in the primitive days of our highest Court practically every member was financially interested In some case coming up for final decision.\" And Justice Story. during many of the years that he sat on the Supreme Court bench. was president of a bank.12 This would be unthinkable behavior for a Justice today. While the question of competing financial interest still remains a subject of deep concern. one problem which plagued the Judiciary of old England has been removed In this country. The early English judges were a \"servile bureaucracy\" holding office at the Kings pleasure.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I send to the desk for appropriate reference a bill to amend Public Law 874 to provide payments to local school districts based upon two additional categories of public school pupils who have a relationship to Federal programs and activities. The bill would also amend existing law to provide the Commissioner of Education with authority to phase out payments in connection with termination of existing programs over a 3year period. instead of the present 1year period. If enacted. the bill would recognize the Federal connection for school district payment purposes of first. children of school age on whose behalf parents are currently receiving payments under the aid for dependent children welfare program and. second. children in families receiving unemployment compensation benefits in those areas which have been designated by the Secretary of Labor as areas of substantial unemployment. It is estimated that there are currently some 2million school age children in families receiving aid for dependent children payments. The bill provides that if the number of children in a school district is 3 percent or more of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance during the year that the district could receive for each child a payment equal to 25 percent of the payment made under Public Law 874 for a child whose parent both lives and works on Federal property. The cost of this portion of the amendment would thus be under $140 million a year. The second category. for which payment would be made relates to areas designated by the Secretary of Labor as areas of substantial unemployment. In January there were 39 such areas throughout the country. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that at this point in my remarks a listing of these areas and the number of families receiving unemployment compensation benefits be printed.",

Calif.. and Seattle on the west coast through the MidwestMinnesota and Indiana are on the listto the east coast and Southern States of Florida. Tennessee and Texas. It is estimated that the school district would receive payments based upon 2.6 times the number of unemployment compensation benefits. The rate of payment in this category would also be set at 25 percent of the payment made for a child whose parent both lives and works on Federal property. I am currently in the process of deriving cost figures for this portion of the program. but. in my judgment. the total cost of the program initially would not exceed $200 million annually. or less than is being appropriated for category A and B payments under Public Law The important point. however. is that this money would be funneled directly into those areas by these twin standards having a great need for additional school funds. Every large metropolitan center would receive help from the Federal Government to educate these youngsters for whom the Federal Government through the twin programs of aid to dependent children and unemployment compensation benefits has already assumed a responsibility. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not wedded to the precise language of the bill. It would be my hope that hearings upon it could perfect the detail and the language. I suggest to Senators that the bill has certain advantages in its approach. These include: First. the decision as to which school district the aid shall go. and the amount. is automatically determined by objective verifiable factors associated with depressed areas whether rural or urban-",

We forget completely that the Federal Government has imposed a special gasoline tax. an excise tax on tires and accessories for the purpose of creating the trust fund to build highways. There was no contemplation of imposing a special tax to finance this eternal program which is being urged. The taxpayers generally will have to provide the money. When hearings were held on the measure before the Commerce Commission. a Mr. Maloney. of Boston. in charge of the Boston transit system. testified that he was highly elated by the results being obtained in a pilot test that was being made. The Federal Government spent $4 million in Boston. The State of Massachusetts put up some money. and the local people put up some money also.

The House Small Business Committee has studied and investigated the many vexing problems of the small business segment of our economy and is pleased that the impact of tax reduction by the new law will show the following among other major benefits to small business and our economy: Small businesses will reap direct benefits of more than $1 billion in 1964 and more than $1.25 billion in 1965 as a result of the tax deductions. An estimated 1.5 million taxpayers with very low incomesand this includes many very small retail shops and service establishmentswill be removed from the Federal income tax rolls. In addition to the reductions. which are relatively greater for small business than for large. small businesses will share in the benefits from increased business volume and higher profits as the economy expands at a more rapid rate. The benefits resulting from expanding business and profits will in time exceed appreciably the amount of the direct tax reduction. The national economy will receive a direct stimulus of about $8 billion in 1964 as a result of the reduction in the withholding rate from 18 to 14 percent. Since an estimated 92 to 94 percent of the tax savings will be reflected in increased consumer purchases. small business will be among the first to feel the thrust of the increased consumer demand. particularly the retail trade and service industries.

The original proposal to amend rule 6 of the regulations under the Flammable Fabrics Act was issued on May 20. 1963 and published dn the Federal Register on May 21. 1963.

I submit further that under the prescribed criteria as set forth by the Administrator. reference is made to income levels. and I would suggest to those of you who have contact with rural areas the fact that the net taxable income of a farmer does not necessarily compare at the same level with an urban dweller. It has no reference to comparison in standard of living because the tax treatment results of the farmer and the farmerowners is entirely different than the nonfarmworker. The tax treatment of those who earn by the sweat of his brow on. the land. if you will. is different. And the fact his net taxable income does not measure up to the level of the urban dweller does not necessarily mean that he is actually underemployed. He may well be. but his level of income does not necessarily prove that. There will be comment made as to the number of applications which are coming in and which have flooded the office of ADA recently from counties which are 5(b). or underemployment counties.

Notwithstanding the glowing reports which we are presently receiving on the status of the countrys economy.

Local benefits from the HillBurton Acthospital assistancethe public works acceleration program. the Federal interstate highway program. the libraries assistance program. and others. are obvious. but the Area Redevelopment Act has utterly failed in its announced objectives. Out of the $395 million initially appropriated. less than 25 percent has. to this date. been obligated. Nonetheless. we are today faced with a decision to give this program permanent status. plus an additional $455 million. without having proven its value to the Nation or to halt the unsavory tendency to \"pork barrel\" spending.

It appears to me the fundamental problem lies not in the principle involved. not with the dedicated public servants involved. but. more specifically. with the fact that duplications with other programs tend to conflict with one another. improper judgment in approving certain loans have resulted in unfair competition to existing businesses. sometimes resulting in a shift of job opportunity and of tax base. rather than creation of new jobs and new tax base as was initially intended.

The United States is paying 40 percent of the cost of the U.N. Special Fund. the account financing the Cuban agricultural project of the U.N.. and there is no way to differentiate between U.S. funds and other funds in this account. If this project is allowed to proceed. the United States will be contributing to the perpetuation of its own foes. Of what value are socalled economic sanctions. quarantines. and other measures to halt subversion from Cuba if. at the same time. the United Nations finances efforts to enhance the agricultural economy of Cuba? Such aid as this will merely assist Castro in his efforts to subvert Latin America. it will aid in the spreading of communism throughout the Western Hemisphere and the United States should refrain from giving aid and comfort to any such program by refusing to appropriate the necessary funds for the U.N. Special Fund. If Congress is going to persist in appropriating money for the U.N. Special Fund. then it should at least place enough strings on such money to assure the U.S. taxpayers that none of their money will be used to assist. in any manner. Communist governments.

The Jesuit High School students. Rick Atkinson and Jim Turner. competed against 117 other high schools. public and private. representing 20 States. The debate topic was \"That the United States Should Provide a Common Market for the Western Hemisphere.\" The Jesuit team took the affirmative side in the final debate. but de.bated both sides of the question In the course of the tournament. Jim Turner also won an award as third highest ranking speaker out of all the orators in the tournament. Mr. Speaker. this achievement by a team representing one of our fine Dallas high schools is another indication of the fine record of Dallas County. It is natural for Dallas to lead. Our people have always prided themselves on getting things done and as a result we have one of the greatest metropolitan areas of the Nation. Our achievements in industry. retailing. education. and cultural activities are a constant wonder to people everywhere. It always gives me great satisfaction to announce the achievements of Dallas people and to call attention to the fact that our progress as a community. in every field. is done through the efforts of our own people. That success in scholastic achievement is not confined to one Dallas high school was stressed by Rev. Father Herlong. of Jesuit. talking of the friendly rivalry between the various school debate teams. He said the Dallas students have a close bond with one another. He told how this was demonstrated last year in an intercity debate in which Bryan Adams. a public high school. and Jesuit competed. Jesuit was declared the winner and when the announcement was made. the whole Bryan Adams team stood up and cheered. Father Herlong paid tribute to Bryan Adams as well as Garland High School and said they are both on a par with Jesuit and he feels that in last weeks tournament they would have done as well and perhaps even better than Jesuit. Incidently. on a personal note. Father Herlong is a distant cousin of our colleague. Congressman SID HERLONG. of Florida. Report From Washington",

This measure is identical to bills introduced by other Members of the minority. including the Republicans of the House Judiciary Committee. The observance of Brotherhood Week seems to be a particularly fitting time for the introduction of a measure which would extend greater legal protection to a large body of American citizens. This is a sensible bill and one that I feel should be enacted by this Congress. It offers a positive program to carry out the mandates of the 1960 Republican platform. In presenting this bill. I would like to call attention to the Republican Partys record of action in the field of civil rights. It is our party which has spearheaded every major civil rights measure in the last century. I think it is well to review the provisions of this legislation. The bill calls for permanently establishing the Civil Rights Commission. The Commission would be given additional authority to investigate vote frauds. instructing the Census Bureau to compile voting statistics from every State on the basis of race. color. and national origin. authorizing the Attorney General to institute action on behalf of a citizen denied admission to a nonsegregated public school. after the person complaining has exhausted his States legal remedies. giving the Federal Government permission to offer technical assistance to States and localities to aid them in desegregating their public schools. creating a Commission on Equality of Opportunity in Employment discrimination by any business or union engaged in Government contract work. presuming that. if otherwise qualified to vote in a Federal election. citizens with a sixthgrade education have sufficient literacy.

It seems entirely fitting that the largest fresh water dam and reservoir in his own State be named after Sam Rayburn. As the Members of the House know this dam and reservoir are located in the Second Congressional District. in southeast Texas. which I am privileged to represent. Those of us who served with Sam Rayburn know that he was personally and actively interested in the construction of this significant project. During* the Korean emergency. the Corps of Engineers testified before committees of the Congress that this project was one of the nine most important public works projects in the entire country for development of our defense and essential civilian economy. In 1955. after the Lower Neches Valley Authority pledged $13 million in local support. the House Appropriations Committee approved the first construction money to build this $58 million project. In those early days of construction. this dam and reservoir were not without some opposition. Many of us may remember the June afternoon in 1958 when Sam Rayburntemporarily laid aside his gavel. and stepped down here into the well of the House and forcefully spoke in behalf of continuing the project. That day seemed to mark the end of all opposition to this great project which will be completed next year. Mr. Speaker. since I proposed this legislation. the response from the people of east Texas has been. in wholehearted support of honoring in this manner the half century of constructive labor that Sam Rayburn gave to sound conservation so that all our people can enjoy the benefits of our natural resources. No man has contributed more to our Nation and no dam and reservoir could more appropriately stand as a testimonial of Sam Rayburns love for the people of our Nation.

A church and a rectory and several businesses and private residences are in danger. not to mention one of the main thoroughfares of the town. The Chief of Engineers in March of 1957 approved construction of a bank protection project along Water Street. under the general authority provided by section 14 of the Flood Control Act of 1946. subject to certain Items of local participation including a cash contribution of the construction cost in excess of the $50.000 Federal limitation specified by the act.

Colo. To give the House an idea of the great requirements of the mint. I refer the Members to page 2 of the committee report. In 1950 some 407 million coins were minted. Last year. 1962. 3.460.524.142 coins were minted. The Treasury is operating facilities and plant in Philadelphia that were constructed in the early part of this century. It has tried to rehabilitate them and bring them up to date without too much success. There is need for additional space. There is need for the improvement of the types of machinery employed by the mint in the city of Philadelphia. The second reason is. that the demand for coins has reached an unprecedented high. The Federal Reserve System. the banks. the business community have all found themselves in great need of additional coins. If these necessary improvements are not made there will be an extreme shortage of coins which will have an effect on our total economy. This is a unique operation. The principal duties of the mint represent a manufacturing operation. The committee felt that the mint should have additional authority to take care of the requirements for the next 10 years. This is the reason the committee authorized an estimated amount of $30 million to be available until the fiscal year 1973. This provides for rehabilitation and improvements as far as the mints in Denver and Philadelphia are concerned. The committee gave careful consideratioh to the testimony of representatives of the Treasury. It was satisfied that there is need for additional space requirements for the mint.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Speaker. the reason this bill has been made necessary Is the tremendous demand for coins throughout the United States. This has been caused by a great increase in the use of vending machines. practically all of which require coins. and the great increase in the use of parking meters and many other things of this kind. all of which put an increased burden on the mints. The estimated production required of the mints for the year 1964 was about 4.100 million coins. For the mints with the existing facilities to produce that requirement they will have to work 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. without interruption. This means that if there is any interruption whatsoever. if any particular part of their equipment breaks down. they are in trouble. Further. if any expansion is required after 1964 the mints will not be able to take care of the need with the existing equipment. It is perfectly obvious there is going to be a continued expansion in our coin requirements because the country continues to grow populationwise and the use of vending machines is steadily increasing. Therefore. this bill is absolutely necessary in view of this situation. This bill came out of the committee by unanimous vote. It is designed to rectify this problem that has already developed to the point where the Mint must take action. The committee has recommended that new mint facilities be constructed at Philadelphia and then as they require further facilities In view of the coinage requirements that they likewise take action to expand and improve their facility at Denver.

It is our hope when this legislation is approved that the Department of the Treasury will make adequate presentation of the needs for the expansion and construction of new mints and new facilities. particularly In my area where is located the Denver Mint. The Denver Mint should be expanded because the operation of that facility and the production of coin in that mint has been most efficient.

Secondly. it increases the number of trustees from 15 to 30. Mr. Speaker. the parent legislation which this bill would extend was passed by this House on August 22. 1958. by the overwhelming vote of 261 for and 55 against. It was felt at that time. both in the House and in the other body. that there was a great deficiency in the fact that Washington alone of all the great capitals of the world did not have a National Cultural Center for the performing arts. . The legislation authorized the creation under the Smithsonian Institution of a National Cultural Center Board of Trustees whose purpose it would be. among other things. to raise the funds for the construction of this building. It is estimated that approximately $30 million will be required for this purpose. To date they have raised in excess of $10 million. There is an additional $5 million pledged by one of the great foundations of the country conditioned upon the raising of $15 million. which seems to be well within sight. The response in recent months has been extremely gratifying. and I think the House will want to pass by an overwhelming majority this bill to extend for an additional 3 years the time in which this money may be raised by public subscription. not by the expenditure of taxpayers money. in order that our Capital may have the benefit of this great building and the services it can perform for our Nation.",

I took occasion to discuss this problem with him and asked him about his views. Mr. Stevens is a businessman who has operated successfully in real estate for some time. He has promoted successful Broadway plays all of which have been among the 10 most successful plays of the year. He is a man of experience. in this lineof work. He pointed out to me that. first. of all. he had recommended the reduction in cost from $70 million to around $30 or $40 million because he did not believe that it was necessary to have $70 million. He pointed out to me that they would probably proceed if they were not able to raise the necesssary money with. part of the project and not complete it entirely at one time. This makes sense. He also pointed out that they are considering working out a plan so that part of the money which they collect will be dedicated to operating expenses. thereby insuring solvency of the project and eliminating its dependency on Federal funds. These and other businesslike ideas that he discussed with me have completely changed my mind. I believe this is going to be successful.

For 120 years. from 1795 to 1915. they had been under Russian domination. then during World War I. they finally gained freedom. But this freedom lasted only to World War II. when the nation was overrun by the Red army and again fell under Russian domination.

We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with the former independent Government which has a legation in Washington. D.C.

I want to say that the shrinkage values of wood which the Forest Products Laboratory uses and recommends are those printed in table 39 of the Wood Handbook (1955 edition). rather than the curves shown on page On December 18 and 19. a meeting was held here at the Forest Products Laboratory and attended by representatives of the western and southern lumber producers. including two representatives of green producers. and the National Lumber Manufacturers Association. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the relation between the size of green lumber and the equivalent dry size at an average moisture content of 15 percent. This naturally led into a thorough discussion of the shrinkage values for the major lumber species. Because of variations in shrinkage. moisture content. and grain orientation in lumber. average values must be used. Our calculations indicate that the proposed new dry sizes. 11/2 inch in thickness and present ALS widths. are equal or slightly greater in strength and stiffness than the present standard ALS sizes dressed green. Therefore. I see no reason why the present span tables should not apply to the new dry size on an interim basis. pending the reanalysis of the stress data and design criteria which apply to FHA joist and rafter span tables.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to add a few observations of my own to those that have been made with regard to the Federal Housing Administrations acceptance of nonstandard lumber in housing insured by the FHA. Present FHA minimum property standards require that the \"moisture content of framing lumber shall not exceed 19 percent at the time of installation.\" and that \"the minimum dressed dimensions shall comply with the American lumber standards.\" Of the many sound reasons for standard lumber sizes. perhaps the most important is to establish a basis for the preparation of minimum span tables for joists and rafters. To prepare span tables. it is essential to know that the lumber used in the structure is the same as that used in the calculations. In recent years. a practice of dressing lumber in the green condition has become commonplace in certain lumberproducing regions. Those familiar with the performance of lumber know that it must be dressed in a seasoned condition at the time the lumber is manufactured at the mill to be able to qualify for use on present FHA spans. Therefore. in order to comply with present FHA requirements. all unseasoned lumber used in FHAinsured homes should have span reductions of 5 percent. If FHA were enforcing its present requiremcnts. unseasoned lumber would not be allowed to be used on FHA spans. which are predicated on full ALS sizes. Since a major portion of the lumber now going into FHA projects is unseasoned. it must be assumed that FHA is not enforcing its present standards. While I cannot vouch for the technical adequacy of 1 /2inch dry lumber. I certainly concur in the gentlemans judgment that the FHA should limit its acceptance of new products to a technical decision of the adequacy of such products and not become enmeshed in the question of competitive advantages or disadvantages for other products.",

Lithuania tried vainly to regain its independ ence during the 19th century. Along with other small eastern and central European nationalities. Lithuania emerged from the First World War as an independent state. During the 20 years between the wars Lithuania made great strides toward becoming a viable member of the international community. developing its industry. agriculture. social legislation. and culture. These gains were swept away in the Second World War as first German and then Russian Armies invaded and occupied the Baltic area. Since the war. Lithuania has been one of the union republics of the Soviet Union. without even the nominal independence of the satellite countries. But the force of Soviet tyranny cannot suppress the Lithuanians longing for freedom. which is symbolized each year by the celebration of Lithuanian Independence Day.",

Lithuanians are known for many of their fine qualities as hardworking and loyal citizens. as gifted artisans and good businessmen. but on the observance of their independence day we do well to extol their courage and bravery. their tenacity to cling to certain noble ideals and their readiness to sacrifice their lives for freedom and independence. Throughout their long and turbulent history they have shown all these fine qualities in abundance. though in times of grave national adversity even such distinctive qualities did not save them from misery and misfortune. In the past when they had lost their independence and were subjected to alien regimes in their homeland. they carried on their struggle for freedom. Finally. in 1918 they were freed from Russias oppressive yoke and proclaimed their national independence on February 16. 1918. 45 years ago. Then. while they were enjoying their newly regained freedom. their country was overrun and occupied by the Red army in 1940 and then made part of the Soviet Union. Since then. for 22 years. these people have not known freedom. They are imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain. and are not even free to celebrate their national holiday. their independence day.

It may be of some use for Senators to know that South Carolina has 28 percent of the active cotton spindles in the United States. So Senators can readily see I am very much interested in a proposal along this line. But I must say. in all frankness. that all the problems we face cannot be solved by merely adopting this amendment. There are other factors involved. I think the problem of cloth made from cotton which is imported into this country probably should be injected into the consideration of the problem and should probably carry a part of the cost of operating a program such as this. I am interested in the cotton farmers. South Carolina is a cottonfarming State. I fear that if we adopt an amendment such as the one pending tonight. the cotton farmers might be hurt by the proposal we are now considering. That is the reason why I think all these complicated .questions require hearings. The Senator from Louisiana will recall that as soon as he introduced a bill on this subject. hearings were set as soon as possible. in order to look into the subject thoroughly and do what we thought was the right thing under the circumstances. We do not have to tell Senators that a manufacturer in Japan has many advantages over a manufacturer in South Carolina. We all know he has many. But some of the problems involved cannot be solved here tonight. The problem caused by the difference in the price of machinery cannot be solved here tonight. In South Carolina cotton mills are being built and Japanese machinery is being installed there. They have even gone so far as to bring Japanese into my. State to install the Japanese machinery.

Today. we heard from Prof. John Gurley. of Stanford University. Excerpts from his prepared statement follow: Professor GuRLEY. First. \"Independence\" is a good word. and so many people think that the independence of the Federal Reserve is a good thing. But it is not a good thing. It is like having two managers for the same baseball team. each manager independent of the other. The managers could get together for lunches once a weekthat might help. Or one of them could try to offset the actions of the otherthat might work a bit. Nothing of this sort. really. would correct the basic situationthe intolerable arrangement of having two managers. That we have a separate manager for monetary policy gives rise to unreasonable situations. such as the President of the United States trying to use moral suasion on the Federal Reserve. hoping that it will not nullify the good effects of the tax reduction * * *. Second. the independence of the Federal Reserve has been defended on the ground that antiinflationary policies are unpopular. and so should be carried out by an independent agency removed from immediate political pressures. This seems to mean that even though the majority of the people are against these tight monetary policies. the actions should still be carried out because some independent agency knows what is best for the people. Third. it has also been argued that the ones who pay the bills should not control the creation of money. I suppose that in some circumstances--mostly involving irresponsible governments In rather rudimentary economic settings--this argument carries some weight. But it is a foolish argument to present about responsible governments. The manner of paying for expendituresby taxes. newly created money. or new government debtis a decision for the administration. it is a decision that is part and parcel of the overall economic program. Anyway. even if an administration were irresponsible. it could always irresponsibly issue new Treasury bills instead of new money to pay for its spendings. and the economic effects would be rather similar.

The bill authorizing this statue was passed unanimously by the Congress in the summer of 1960. and at that time we House Members issued a House document dealing with the outstanding contributions to human freedom and the emancipation of all nations and races of Taras Shevchenko. The Post Office Department has undertaken a program of issuing \"Champion of Liberty\" stamps in honor of outstanding freedom fighters of the world. Among these champions should be included Taras Shevchenko. Our Nation has been the happy recipient of the immigration of fine Ukrainian citizens to this country after their terrible ordeal when the Soviets invaded and took over control of their homeland. I say \"happy recipient\" because in my own State of North Dakota the Ukrainians have become valuable citizens and their families are looked upon with respect and admiration. I am glad to take part in urging the Post Office Department to issue the commemorative stamp in honor of Taras Shevchenko. Not only will this be well received in our country. but it will be an indication of our feelings of sympathy and respect to those Ukrainians still living in the homeland who are waiting for the scales of justice to balance in their favor and cause the yoke of injustice and oppression to be removed from their shoulders. I would like to ask permission at this time to include with my remarks a copy of a letter dated February 21. 1964. written to Postmaster General John A. Gronouski by the president of our State Branch of North Dakota of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America. Inc.. Dr. Anthony Zukowsky. of Steele. N. Dak. This letter is an expression of the sincere desire of the Ukrainians in the United States that their famed poetpatriot Taras Shevchenko be honored by issuance of the commemorative stamp. as a part of the \"Champion of Liberty\" series.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I take this means of notifying the membership of the House that I have Just introduced a joint resolution to authorize and request the President to provide for a study of the feasibility of a system for carrying ships overland between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The oceantoocean route I have suggested for this study is the 150 mile isthmus route across Mexico from the Gulf of Tehuantepec to the Gulf of Mexico. I hasten to say. Mr. Speaker. that I am not proposing a substitute for the Panama Canal where we have sovereign rights which under no circumstances should be abrogated. The report on a longrange program for Isthmian Canal transits filed in 1960 by the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee contains traffic projections which indicate the need of additional facilities sometime in the next 40 years. The idea of transporting ships in strong dry dock containers overland on multitrack conveying systems might once have seemed impractical. but anyone who is familiar with the Cape Kennedy Missile Base crawler which is for use to transport the Saturn V to its launching pad will recognize the engineering for such a conveyor system is not complicated and might be more in the nature of an overland triple track railroad bed. thus making a canal and locks unnecessary. Under my resolution our Government would invite Mexico to initiate and cooperate with the United States on such a study. Any such route would save approximately 1.000 miles on a voyage from the Pacific to the Atlantic which could reduce the cost of intercoastal shipping and likewise the west coast European trade. Of special importance would be the defense advantages of an alternative route. The plan of an overland ship conveyor system is not original or new but in light of modem engineering technology it certainly should be investigated and the findings compared with studies that have been made of various routes for a second interocean canal.",

I commend the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. who. as chairman of the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. has directed the efforts of the staff in maintaining a watchful surveillance over the implementation of these safeguards by the executive agencies involved. The chairman of the committee has done a responsible and thorough job. It has been almost a year since the Senate voted to give consent to the nuclear test ban treaty. by which the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. in outer space. and underwater would be denied to those nations which would agree to be bound by its terms. The relative advantages and disadvantages of becoming a party to the treaty were fully discussed and properly identified in the debate immediately preceding ratification on September 24. 1963. Although the provisions of the treaty would restrict us somewhat in the full military application of our nuclear technology. nevertheless the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously recommended that the treaty be approvedan approval. however. that was conditioned upon the vigorous implementation of the treaty safeguards which were considered to be essential. As the chairman of the subcommittee pointed out. those safeguards were four in number. Underground testing is perhaps one of the most difficult of the safeguards to carry out and further our knowledge of advanced nuclear technology. but we are making progress on it.",

That has gone forward. satisfactorily from the testimony that has been given to us. The personnel there have been maintained to a better degree than we had thought they could be maintained. The people have stayed on. Their work is going on. We are informed that perhaps the readiness to test in the atmosphere has not gone on quite as well and that we are not as ready as we had hoped to be. but that phase is going forward. Finally. improving our detection system is difficult. but we believe progress has been made in that field. I commend the chairman of the committee and the whole committee. including the Senator from Missouri . and others. upon their commendable interest in seeing that these four safeguards are vigorously maintained in order to have our support of the treaty effective. in the interest of preparedness and readiness and security for our country and peace in the world.

Typical of the way we operate is that when we get into a particularly technical subject of this character. where it is relatively difficult for laymen to understand the scientific details. The chairman gets someone comparable to Colonel Smith. in this instance. one thoroughly conversant with the technical problems involved. Without exaggeration. this committee could be the most important committee of its kind in the country today. When the question came up as to whether we should have or should not have a nuclear test ban treaty. for many months we discussed that problem. and later the Senate ratified the treaty. However. anyone who has read the RECORD knows that the ratification was made with reservationsthe four points the able chairman of the committee brought up this morning.",

Those of us who have had some experience in this field know the apprehension that comes into the minds and hearts of many. including the fighting forces. when they realize that a weapons breakthrough has been made by a possible adversary in the technological field. We all know about the first use of gas In World War I. During the Battle of Britain. it is fair to say that if it had not been for a technological breakthrough in the radar field. through which they were able to put radar on Beau fighters. the Germans would have had largely a free hand over Britain at night. and possibly won the Battle of Britain. It is also interesting to note that radar was discovered on about the same day by three different countriesEngland. the United States. and Japan. Therefore. followup work of this character. properly supervised by a committee of this character. is essential to the security of the country. Shortly after Pearl Harbor I can remember Admiral Davidson telling me that we did not know the Japanese had hundreds of Zero fighters. For many weeks and months they gave us a bad time. Later the British and all the rest of us were greatly upset at inauguration by the Nazi of the V1 buzz bombs. If it had not been for a lucky picture taken of Peenemunde. the later second generation missile. the V2the first ballistic missile in world historythis new weapon. a clear technological breakthrough. might have changed the course of World War II. or at least prolonged it. I again wish to commend the able Senator from Mississippi for the care he takes in recalling the warnings the military made at the time the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed to the signing of the test ban treaty.

As late as 1947 they still nursed the hope that the Communist leaders of the Kremlin would abide by certain basic international agreements and honor at least some of their contractual agreements. One of these was that the Communists were to allow free and unfettered elections in Communistdominated countries. and that thenonCommunist candidates to office were free to express their views. But these illusions and hopes were shattered. and the West learned that these Communist leaders were no better than the fanatical Fascists and Nazis. This was proved to them by the Communist treachery in Bulgaria. There the Communists took steps to crush effectively all opposition groups and elements. Under the allpowerful steamroller policy of the Communist Party. all opposition was eliminated and their leaders liquidated. By 1947 there was left only the agrarian group led by its courageous leader Nikola Petkov. He with his group carried on the first against heavy odds. and while doing this he was arrested. condemned as an \"enemy of the people.\" and executed on September 23. 1947.

The hardest work in this business is going to be in keeping an inventory of how many hogs I havent raised. My friend is very Joyful about the future of his business. He has been raising hogs for more than 20 years and the best he ever made was $400. until this year. when he got $1.000 for not raising hogs. If I can get $1.000 for not raising 50 hogs. then will I get $2.000 for not raising 100 hogs? I plan to operate on a small scale at first. holding myself down to 4.000 hogs which means I will have $80.000 coming from the Government. Now. another thing: these hogs I will not raise will not eat 100.000 bushels of corn. I understand that you also pay farmers for not raising corn. So will you pay me anything for not raising 100.000 bushels of corn not to feed the hogs I am not raising? I want to get started as soon as possible as this seems to be a good time of the year for not raising hogs. One thing more. can I raise 10 or 12 hogs on the side while I am in the notraisinghog business just enough to get a few sides of bacon to eat? Very truly yours. J. B. LEE. Jr..

We registered a 73percent turnout of voters. which is certainly a very large vote for an offyear municipal election. And. I am very happy to advise my colleagues in the House on both sides that under these ideal weather conditions. Mayor Richard J. Daley was reelected yesterday to a third term by an impressive majority of 150.000 votes. Mayor Daley has certainly written an outstanding record in the last 8 years of his administration. He is today hailed not only throughout the United States but throughout the world as one of the outstanding administrators of a large city government. Mayor Daley has brought to the people of Chicago a new dimension of leadership which yesterday was certainly rewarded by this spectacular reelection. I daresay that the overwhelming victory experienced by Mayor Daley in Chicago yesterday. carrying with him his running mates. John C. Marcin. city clerk. and William Milota. city treasurer. reflects the high regard that the people of our community had for the record that the mayor has written and. I think. also reflects the high regard our people have for President Kennedy who was a visitor on an official visit to Chicago a week earlier when he participated in the dedication of the terminal facilities at OHare Field. President Kennedy could not help but take advantage of the opportunity to say some very inspiring words about Mayor Daleys impressive record. In reelecting Mayor Daley yesterday by this very sizable majority of 150.000 votes. I believe the people of Chicago at the same time registered what high respect they have for President Kennedy who supported the mayor.",

Clausewitz was right to stress that the most decisive act of judgment which a statesman and general exercises is rightly to understand * * * the war In which he engages. not to take it for something. or to wish to make it something. which by the nature of its relations it is impossible for it to be. What are the relations that shape war today? They are that we live in a revolutionary age of contending ideologies which challenge each others validity. Should these challenges lead to war. the contrast is between absolutes. such as orthodoxy and heterodoxy. liberty and tyranny. and democracy and autocracy. in which the aim is to maintain an old or establish a new dispensation. Wars of this nature have constituted the great turning points in history. for instance the Crusades. the wars of the Reformation and of the French Revolution. Because of their absolute aims. all have been unrestricted and. within the regions in which they were fought. total. Today we are faced with a war of this nature. or rather are living in a period of incessant ideological hostilities. which embrace the entire world. It was initiated by Lenin in his October revolution of 1917. To understand this cataclysm. it is necessary briefly to examine the components of Lenins obsession.

It was on this date in 1877 A2396 that Rumania was established as an independent nation for the first time in history. Ever since. until Communists seized power in Rumania. May 10 has been the national holiday. as important to Rumanians as July 4th is to us. Rumania was an ancient province of the Roman empire and has shared for centuries many of the cultural and religious precedents of western civilization. Who has not thrilled to the wonderful Rumanian Rhaposidies of Georges Enesep? Rumanians maintained their unity against repeated invasions for centuries. When the opportunity came in 1877 to fight for independence they were prepared. They acquitted themselves with agreat distinction in the war against Turkey and proved that they deserved independence. Under King Carol I independent Rumania became an honored and respected member of the international community. Rumanian industry grew rapidly. Despite the destruction of World War I. by 1939 Rumania was a most progressive nation. The combination of destructiveness from war and avaricious fascist groups within reduced Rumania to a state of ruin by 1945. Perhaps a million lives were lost. Even today there are many more women than men in Rumania to testify to the horrible losses of wartime. This weakened nation thus fell to the furious aggression of Communistled political and military forces in 1947. Independence became a lost word for Rumanians and Independence Day a forbidden memory. But thankfully many Rumanians around the world still yearn for freedom for Rumania and still celebrate Rumanian Independence Day. By our words here we encourage Rumanians everywhere to continue their resistance to communism and we contribute to the maintenance of the memory of Rumanian independence. We see with a great deal of hope recent indication of an independent spirit in Rumania. The ties that bind Rumania into the Soviet empire are loosening. Now is the time to speak out more strongly than ever before for Rumanian independence. May 10. 1877. is not completely forgotten yet by any means. National Commission on Food Marketing",

Recently we have noted the Rumanian demands for national freedom in defiance of a colonial system perpetuated from the Kremlin. We welcome this trend. We are pleased that Rumania has determined to work out its own domestic and foreign policies free of dictation from other powers. Now we desire that the Rumanian Government. realizing the benefits of freedom of action on the world scene. will extend freedom to its own people. for their benefit and the ultimate good of the nation.

It is my earnest hope that these discussions may result in fruitful action on the part of both countries.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there has been a great deal of controversy over our military force structure. At one time the cold war was such that the most urgent task was to provide for a deterrent against massive aggression--a nuclear superiority that would protect the West from total destruction by a potential nuclear attack. But wars change. and so do the implications of the threat as well as the methods by which wars are fought. Sometimes these changes come about more swiftly than philosophers of warfare can keep abreast. The cold war threat Is now no longer limited to mass military destruction. Rather. the menace is our lack of conventional weapons to meet the threat of limited wars. If we. as a nation. are to be unprepared for limited warfare we are then compelled to rely upon desperate strategies of vast mutual destruction. I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues an editorial from a small weekly newspaper. the Feather River Bulletin in Quincy. Calif.. which makes a point of emphasis in the present controversy now before the Nation. The editorial follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday was Rumanian Independence Day. We remember this day in honor of those many Rumanians who joined together in 1877 to establish their own nation. Rumanias unification and independence came after nearly 400 years of alien rule by her neighbors and the Ottoman Empire. Never. however. during this whole time did the Rumanians cease to work for the attainment of their freedom. In 1877. with the RussoTurkish War raging in the Balkans the Rumanians saw their opportunity and joined the Russians against the Turks. At the end of the war their efforts were rewarded when the Congress of Berlin recognized their newly won independence. Unfortunately. the Rumanians did not retain their true independence for very long. Although this nation fought with the Allied and associated powers in the First World Wax. she was inevitably involved as a helpless victim in the Nazi struggle during the Second World War and by the end of the war found herself A2401 under the complete domination of the Kremlin. For nearly two decades now. the country has been sealed off from the free world and some 17 million Rumanians live in what is practically a vast prison camp where they are continually subject to the worst excesses of Communist totalitarianism. As a result of Russian control. these sturdy peasants are forced to till their fertile land mostly for the benefit of the Soviet Union. Denied all forms of freedom. they have no choice but to obey all Communist dictates. for democracy. as we in the free world know it. is not permitted. We. in the free world. must hope that the Rumanians will continue to retain the strength and will to fight for independence as they always have in the past. And it is on this 87th anniversary of Rumanian Independence Day that we look with sorrow at the present unhappy state of the Rumanian people and wish that the future will soon allow the Rumanians to regain their lost freedom.

If we permit recreational boat fees on the waterways of this country. if we permit the assessment of a use fee or entrance fee on the waterways of our country for a recreational boat. just as surely as the sun comes up in the morning there is going to be a demand following that to put a fee on the commercial barge and on commercial boats.

I came to the conclusion it would be essential at some point to charge users fees when the Government invested in specific recreation areas. I was gravely concerned about the original concept of this bill. which was a concept of admission fees. rather than users fees. In line with that I would like to ask the gentleman from New Mexico. the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. some questions. First. it is my understanding that the bill would authorize both admission charges and users charges. I think it is important for the House to understand. however. that the bill does not authorize a general admission charge for the use of national forests and public domain lands. Such fees for these areas may be charged only at specific sites where facilities have been provided at Federal expense for the benefit of the recreation user and are operated by a Federal agency. Thus. the fee. while technically an admission fee. is actually a user fee. in that it is for facilities provided for the safety. convenience. comfort. and enjoyment of the recreation user.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman. Now. another question I should like to propound to the gentleman from Colorado. The bill provides that no entrance or admission fee could be charged except where three conditions occur concurrently: First. The area is administered primarily for scenic. scientific. historical. cultural. recreational. or wilderness purposes. Second. The area Is administered by a Federal agencyand not by a State or local or private agency. Third. The recreation facilities or services in the area are provided at Federal expense. I believe some clarification is needed as to what is meant by \"administered primarily for scenic. scientific. historical. cultural. recreational. or wilderness purposes.\" It is my understanding that under this criterion an entrance or admission fee could be charged for an entire national park or monument. because such an area is administered primarily for one or more of these purposes. I believe that such fees are entirely proper for areas in the national park system. This concept should not. however. be applied to the national forests and public domain which serve an entirely different purpose. For example. I understand that outdoor recreation is one of the purposes for which the national forests are administered. They are also administered for other purposes. Thus. recreation may be a principal purpose for which large areas of a national forest may be administered. Generally. there would be other principal purposes for which these same areas would be administered. With respect to the national forests. am I correct In understanding that it is not intended by this legislation to authorize the charging of a fee to enter or go upon a national forest? Instead. I understand that the intent is that within national forests entrance or admission fees could be charged only at specific. designated sites where recreation facilities are provided. In other words. a person would not have to pay an entrance or admission fee just to go into a national forest. Is my interpretation correct?",

My concept is that the Congress intends a system of moderate fees and reasonable collection procedures. Administrative costs should be held to a minimum. It is my understanding. moreover. that the money needed to administer the program will be sought separately from the program moneys.

This measure incorporates the recommendations of former President Kennedy. and is strongly endorsed by President Johnson. the Departments of the Interior. Agriculture. Army. and the Budget Bureau. Its enactment has been urged by 49 States including Delaware. 43 State Governors including Gov. Elbert N. Carvel. of Delaware. many State agencies including the Delaware Game and Fish Commission. which urges its passage without crippling amendments. all of the major conservation and recreation groups of the Nation. mayors of major cities. leading newspapers. and an overwhelming number of local public and private agencies. groups. and organizations concerned with recreation and conservation. Last year. the Congress acted favorably on my bill. H.R. 6678. which returned to Delaware some 500 acres of excess Federal property on the Fort Miles Military Reservation near Lewes. Del. This legislation provided an opportunity for the Congress and the first State to insure that attractive and valuable public seashore lands. no longer needed for military purposes. would be made available for public recreational and educational uses.

I might add that Fort Miles is only 7 miles distant from Rehoboth Beach. ofttimes called \"The Nations Summer Capital.\" The acquisition of the Fort Miles seashore property and the current plans and efforts of the State of Delaware in developing this prime beach area will. with the enactment of H.R. 3846. make possible the constructive and pivotal role in creating and improving recreational opportunities which Delaware must assume. and enable Delaware to shape its recreation programs to meet the varying conditions and the particular needs of our burgeoning population.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill which is designed to improve the DavisBacon Act and its administration by clarifying much of the present ambiguous language of the act. insuring uniformity of implementation among the various Federal agencies concerned. and establishing an independent administrative review procedure. The bill is a result of and largely based on the findings and recommendations of the recently published subcommittee report on the administration of the DavisBacon Act. The report points up the needed improvements to the act. among which are first. legislative clarity for proper administration. second. language to insure uniformity in interpretation. application. and enforcement by various Government agencies. and. third. a formal review procedure which would afford an appeal from a decision of the Secretary of Labor as a matter of right. The bill would clarify some of the language found to be ambiguous: \"Laborers and mechanics.\" \"city. town. village. or other civil subdivisions of a State.\" \"projects of a character similar to the contract work.\" \"employed directly upon the site of the work.\" The bill would remove the present uncertainty and lack of uniformity in the interpretation and enforcement of the DavisBacon Act among the various Federal agencies by centralizing enforcement functions in the Department of Labor. A DavisBacon Appeals Board would be established to provide impartial review to interested parties on determinations made by the Secretary of Labor. The Board would be composed of three members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The members would serve for terms of 3 years. Other changes made in the DavisBacon Act by the bill would authorize the Secretary of Labor to impose debarments for a discretionary rather than an absolute period of time as is now required under the DavisBacon Act and would allow a contractor to be removed from the debarred bidders list upon a showing by the contractor of present responsibility. Enactment of the amendments to the DavisBacon Act. as proposed in my bill. should solve many of the problems that have arisen in the implementation and interpretation of the act. The subcommittee will hold hearings on the bill later in the session.",

I call to the attention of the Members of the House the fact that the President has sent up a communication in which he is requesting Congress to provide a program to initiate the development and construction of supersonic commercial transport aircraft. There has been a lot said about this program for the last several weeks. Consideration has been given to the advisability of this type of aircraft for the last 5 or 6 years. I think this is a most important program In view of the fact that a joint undertaking by the British and the French is in process of developing such a commercial aircraft. Our committee will hold hearings on this request and we will develop the authority and to just what extent there is present authority under the law. We will initiate these hearings Thursday afternoon at which time we will go fully into this program with a view as to what we should do and how we should do it in the best interest of our country and continued leadership in the aviation community.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a source of great regret to me that farming. always considered the backbone of the Nations economy. should have to be mentioned in the same breath with the administrations war on poverty. Four years ago. a presidential campaign pledge was made which guaranteed that \"farm income would be raised all across the Nation.\" That pledge has not materialized. and with inflated farm costs. along with all others. we are witnessing continual growth of farm indebtedness. a sharp increase in farm mortgage foreclosures. and an agricultural depression in general. The dairy industry has been especially hard hit but alas. a disappointing solution is all that has been advanced. Under the poverty program. it has been announced that farmers will receive a grant of $1.500 for equipment if the plan is adopted. I have not heard from a single dairyman urging this ridiculous subsidy be authorized because farmers are practical people who realize that the three or four cows they could buy would only give them a negligible net return. Equipment such as a basic tractor costing at least $4.000 is entirely out of the question. not to mention the other related and more expensive implements needed on the farm. The following editorial. which appeared in the Chatham. N.Y.. Courier of April 23. 1964. sketches the farmers plight and quite correctly concludes that in spite of increasingly misguided Federal control in the barnyard. they will continue to provide our Nation with the best food mankind has ever known.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. dauntless and daring fighters for their human freedoms. the Poles are a gifted. resourceful. and industrious people. In the course of their turbulent history they have contributed to mankind great masters of art. science. and statecraft. Their liberal and democratic Constitution. drafted. adopted. and promulgated on May 3. 1791. quite clearly Illustrates their skill in the field of government and diplomacy. That Constitution is a veritable landmark In the progressive process of evolving a constitutional form of government. in an orderly and democratic way. By that historic document the Poles accomplished peacefully what many other people had attempted to accomplish by revolution and bloodshed. In this constitution the kings autocratic and unlimited powers were sharply reduced. and a constitutional government was established with a responsible cabinet. The upper chamber lost some of its powers. while the lower and popularly elected chamber gained considerable legislative power. Religious liberty was guaranteed. and the peasants were taken under the protection of the law. Townsmen recovered their judicial autonomy. and received a number of political rights. For all these and other liberal. progressive features the Constitution of 1791 was hailed as a great advance step in the right direction. Unfortunately. patriotic Poles who framed and enacted the Constitution into law. were not given the chance to see it work. Soon after its promulgation. Poland was attacked and overrun. and finally partitioned among its three greedy neighbors. But the spirit of freedom and progress embodied in that Constitution did not die. Today. on the 173d anniversary observance of the adoption of that Constitution. they still cling to the lofty ideals embodied in their Constitution of 1791. Polish Constitution Day",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we in the United States know so well. the development of and the functioning of government must be within the confines of constitutional guidelines and precepts. Thus are guaranteed the rights of the individual citizens and thus is assured government by the people and for the people. Soon after the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. the citizens of Poland adopted a constitution. The year was 1791. Poland had already undergone a partition at the hands of her three powerful neighborsAustria. Prussia. and Russia In order to forestall further encroachments. certain liberal leaders of Poland. imbued with genuine democratic Ideas. had been working on a new constitution. It is that document. adopted in May of 1791 whose anniversary is being observed. That historic document seemed at the time a true bill of rights for the Polish nation. By that constitution a government of limited monarchy was established with definite ministerial responsibility. The electorate of the parliament was considerably enlarged. and numerous privileges formerly enjoyed by the small upper classes alone were made available to other classes. Certain rights of the peasantry were restored and the peasants were brought under the protection of the law. Even more important. freedom of conscience was guaranteed. and absolute religious toleration was established. Today. so many years after that epochal event and after so many advances in all phases of democracy. this document may seem somewhat outdated. but nevertheless. it is regarded as a forerunner of later liberal constitutions. particularly in central and Eastern Europe. In many respects it was a pioneering document and therein may be found its real significance. Unfortunately for the Poles and their friends abroad. there was little chance to put its provisions into operation. Soon Poland was again partitioned by her implacable and powerful neighbors. and is no longer a free and independent and sovereign country. Even so. all Poles regarded. and still regard. this document as a landmark in their history. I am honored to join in the participation of the 173d anniversary celebration A2241 of Polish Constitution Day. I have visited Poland on several occasions in recent years and I know that the principals embodied in that great document are cherished today even though a foreign nation dominates that country and the people are denied the rights that were once guaranteed them.

This is for the benefit of the gentleman from Texas and others who have been voting for most of these bills. There is scarcely a bill passed but what some of these people who bleed today have voted for this delegation of power to the President.

I have listened with great interest to the statements that have been made during the past 2 days in connection with the measure now pending before the House of Representatives. I had hoped that I might gather from this debate information that would make it possible for me to vote in good conscience for a tax cut. Unfortunately. that has not been the case. To reduce taxes when our national debt is greater than at any time in the history of the United States. when the Federal budget is in the red by many billions. and when the present administration is advocating new programs which can only increase rather than decrease expenditures is. in my opinion. an unwise move for the Congress to make. Unquestionably the taxpayers of this country need relief from the tax burdens they have been carrying for more than two decades. Yet. to give this relief without first reducing Federal expenditures does not exhibit the fiscal responsibility that I believe Congress owes to the people of this country. There is nothing in this legislation. nor in the misleading motion to recommit that is being offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. that will guarantee a reduction of expenditures. Under the terms of the motion to recommit. a budget estimate of $97 billion submitted by the President would bring about a tax cut. A supplemental request. however. could then increase the budget far beyond the $97 billion mark. While I realize my views are in the minority. I am convinced that the only fiscally responsible way to bring about a tax reduction at this time is to reduce. either first or simultaneously. Federal expenditures. In my opinion.

Most of us here in the House more or less depend on the sage advice of that distinguished gentleman. that great American. the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. the Honorable WILBUR MILLS. Mr. Chairman. several Members in debate yesterday stated that the House ought to forge a pact with the President in order to limit our spending in fiscal year 1965 to $97 billion. Whom are we kidding? Any sort of suggestion that we pass legislation in order to prevent the President from requesting any sum over $97 billion is offstroke. because Congress authorizes expenditures and then appropriates the funds. It is our babyand rightfully belongs to us in the Congress--not to the President. It seems to me that we are passing the buck. I just returned from my district and I can tell you the people. as well as businessmen. want a tax cut. During the recent debate on the authorization for foreign aid. I said: We are spending money we havent got on people we dont know to impress those who hate our insides. If this bill passes today. I would paraphrase my statement and say: \"We would be saving money we have. for people we know. to help those who need it most. I shall not vote for any motion to recommit with instructions that would specifically require the President to limit expenditures at any amount. We are the duly elected Representatives of the people and. under the Constitution of th United States. we not only have the right. but it is our duty to tell the President what he will be permitted to spend. How are we going to do it? By enacting into law sane. sound. courageous authorization bills and then appropriate the necessary money therefor. I urge every Member of this House not to reject this baby that was fathered by our forebearers and adopted by us as our very own the day we were first elected to Congress.

Perhaps I shall be accused of believing in the Puritan ethic by making this statement. but I believe it is immoral for our generation to spend money that future generations will have to repay. Now I believe that a tax cut could have some effect on stimulating our economy. I have long believed that our people and our industries and businesses are overtaxed.

Under the emergency now existing I will vote for a 1year extension of it. for this year only. This 1year extension will provide an opportunity to phase out the bracero program. and that development is inevitable because the use of both bracero labor and domestic agricultural labor Is declining. as the result of the increasing mechanization of agriculture. I agree with the chairman. when he states that he will not bring out a bracero bill another year. I vote for this 1year extension to enable American farmers to adjust their labor supply. to search for domestic labor. and to lighten the disruption caused by a too sudden termination of the program.",

Protectionism in any formwhether in the guise of unduly restrictive buy Americantype legislation. tight quotas on residual fuel oil. a more restrictive antidumping law. or especially costly marketing requirements of imported goodsis against the best interests of the United States. We are about to embark on some very difficult trade negotiations. the first under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The atmosphere of these negotiations has already been clouded. controversy and suspicion have been provoked. by illtimed restrictive actions on the part of the EECEuropean Common Marketand there are grave doubts as to the likelihood of any worthwhile accomplishments coming out of the forthcoming talks in the foreseeable future. Further restrictive steps on our own part at this time would further endanger these crucial talks. . Restrictions on steel imports proposed by the Steelworkers and the steel industry are not in their own best interest either. Restrictions on our part in turn engender restrictions abroad which would inevitably damage our exports. jobs. the economy. and the balance of payments of the United States. I am particularly impressed by the editorials argument that: The worst effect of protectionism and the one most injurious to employment is that it relieves the industry of responsibility for meeting competitive conditions as they really are. The strengthening of the competitive capability and performance of our own economy is the best solution to import competition as well as the meaningful expansion of exports. This means an early enactment of a substantial tax cut. the maintenance of price and wage stability at home. and the reduction of the cost of production through automation with just provision for the workers concerned.",

Representative WILSON has asked the Congress to call a World Conference on Oceanography to be convened in the United States in 1965. As the good Representative pointed out. the undetectable approaches to our shores which lie under water constitute one of our greatest perils of enemy surprise attack. And so the subject of national defense would be high on the conference agenda. But we all know that scientists have only begun to ripple the surface of the vast oceans of the globe in their search for untold treasures. We know the oceans yield food but we take but a fraction of the food because we have yet to learn the necessary processing techniques. We know the oceans cover enormous mineral wealth. oil and other natural resources. We know the oceans may some day be a prime source of energy. Each year we have managed to lower the cost of converting salt to fresh water. Some day we may eliminate the worlds deserts and convert them into rich. productive farmlands. To sum up. each of us acknowledges the importance of oceanography and its virtually limitless potentials. A world conference on this subject could not help but prove to be beneficial to the United States and all mankind. Since my House colleague suggested the conference be held. I can only second his motionwith one slight amendment. I propose Hawaii as an ideal conference site. Hawaii. surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. is ideally suited as a conference site. The city and county of Honolulu is just now completing a modern civic auditorium complex which would make an ideal location for the Conference. I am certain the faculty of the University of Hawaiis Geophysics Institute would be happy to act as Conference hosts. In conclusion I hope that my Senate colleagues will give their wholehearted support to the proposal that a World Conference on Oceanography be held in the United States in 1965. preferably. of course. in Hawaii.",

In 1958. on July 30. this committee. in words and figures the same as the resolution before us. with the exception of the dates and years involved. was set up by unanimous action of this House. I might add that in each instance the action of the House was unanimous. On July 2. 1960. exactly 4 years ago today. July 2. 1960. by unanimous action of the U.S. House of Representatives. a special committee to investigate campaign expenditures was set up. That was followed on August 9. 1962. when a special committee was created by a resolution in words and figures the same as the resolution before us. with the exception of the year and dates involved.

It is said that as the economy expands excess capacity is available to supply the new demand without inflationary pressures resulting. Over the past year considerable evidence provided by private surveys and studies has come to light indicating that much of the socalled excess capacity is actually obsolete or inefficient. In the light of this evidence. doubt has been growing about the ability of the economy to supply the burgeoning demand that may arise from the administrations economic policies without new inflationary pressures arising. An article from the March 1964 issue of the Survey of Current Business. published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. points out some highly significant evidence on this point. According to the article. nearly onethird of manufacturing companies. with just under 50 percent of the total capital assets in manufacturing. indicated that their facilities at the end of 1963 were inadequate to meet their needs in 1964. 60 percent of the firms with 44 percent of the assets considered their facilities about adequate. In other words. less than 10 percent of the firmswith 7 percent of assetsfelt that existing capacity exceeded their. needs. There are a number of qualifications that should be consdiered in evaluating these new statistics. and the yare spelled out in the article. The point remains. however. that this new evidence should alert us to the strong possibility of a new wave of inflation that might very well arise from a strong upsurge in economic activity.

The joker in the proposal is that Government approval of a newer. slimmer 2 by 4 (now only 1% inches by 3% Inches. but perhaps soon to be a dainty 1 V2 inches by 31/2 inches) will automatically enrich some of the proponent companies by millions of dollars. Mr. Speaker. these giant timber companies should not be permitted to perpetrate such a major economic move under the guise of making technological improvements. At least. this vital economic matter deserves the fullest public airing before any action is taken by the Department of Commerce. In this regard. I am pleased to learn that my good friend and colleague. the gentleman from California. who is chairman of the House Small Business Subcommittee on Distribution. has announced tentative plans for hearings on the lumber standards issue. I also understand that our beloved Speaker has urged our colleague from California to allow adequate time for the presentation by Massachusetts port interests and wholesale and retail lumber dealers at these hearings. Please be assured. Mr. Speaker. that I will give this matter my fullest support. At this time. under unanimous consent. I include the Boston Globe article and the press announcement of the hearings by the gentleman from California In the RECORD: [From the Boston Sunday Globe. Feb. 2. 19641",

The matter has been thoroughly explored and has been strongly supported and recommended by the committee as a result of its hearings. The able chairman has set out the several respects in which this bill will enable the savings and loan associations of this country. now an industry with more than $100 billion of assets. better to serve the public. I am glad that my able colleague from Michigan on the committee has emphasized that mobile dwellings are eligible for assistance under this bill. Millions of Americans live in these mobile homes. If you came to my State. Florida. you will see great trailer camps where thousands of people congregate in their various trailers and enjoy all the facilities necessary for the maintenance of their homes. These mobile homes have the virtue of mobility as well as the advantages of the convenience and comfort of fixed living in these trailer camps when they choose not to be mobile. In addition. a great many of the students in the colleges and universities use these mobile homes as their dwelling places. In that respect. too. they make a very valuable contribution to the furnishing of adequate housing facilities for our country.

House Resolution 411 provides for the consideration of H.R. 6016. a bill authorizing additional appropriations for prosecution of projects in certain river basin plans for flood control. navigation. and other purposes. The resolution provides an open rule with 1 hour of general debate. H.R. 6016 provides increased authorization for the prosecution of river basin plans for flood control and related purposes under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Engineers. The appropriations intended to be covered by these increased authorizations are those for fiscal years 1964 and 1965. Allowance is made for the amount of monetary authorization carried over on June 30. 1963. The first national flood control act was the act of June 22. 1936. In that act and in subsequent acts the Congress was faced with the problem of dealing with large comprehensive river basin plans containing numerous individual projects. Congress dealt with the problem in many cases by approving the entire plan but authorizing only the appropriation for a part of the total cost. so that it could have the opportunity to examine from time to time the work which was being accomplished in the basin and any modifications that might be desirable. As the appropriations approached the total monetary authorization ceilings. the Congress increased the basin authorization for these partially authorized plans. At the present time there are 21 basin plans in this category. Of these it is estimated that 10 will experience deficits between estimated appropriations and total authorization over the next 2 years. Mr. Speaker. I urge adoption of House Resolution 411.",

There was an alternative proposed and I think this committee should have gone very carefully into that when the Conewango Valley project was considered. May I say to the gentleman that In the construction of this Kinzua Dam project. this Congress violated one of the solemn and binding obligations we made with the Seneca Nation. The first President of the United States had sent to the Congress of the United States a treaty with the Seneca Nation. By the construction of this project. you violated that treaty and the first President of the United States. George Washington. thought so much of keeping the solemn word of the United States inviolate that he wrote to the great Indian Chief Cornplanter a fivepage personal letter in which he promised that nothing would ever take away from this nation. that had been a friendly nation. the lands that we guaranteed they could always have.

H.R. 6016. contains an additional monetary authorization for the Central and Southern Flood Control District in the amount of $21 million. This increase is needed in order that this proj ect. originally authorized in 1948. can keep pace with the rapidly increasing population and economy of the 18county area which it covers. Available monetary authorization for the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District presently total $106.300.000. while appropriations available through June 30 of this year total $95.373.000. leaving a monetary authorization of $10.927.000. However. the Bureau of the Budget has recommended that $14.000.000 be appropriated for the flood control district for fiscal year 1964. Appropriations in this level would leave a deficit of over $3 million unless there is an increase in the monetary authorization for the project. Mr. Chairman. the area covered by the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District holds some 29 percent of the population of the State of Florida. In 1950. the population within the project numbered approximately 800.000. As of June 30. 1962. the population figures had risen to over 2 million. and these figures are rising even today. This growth was not envisioned when the project was first authorized in 1948. Each subsequent authorization act containing additional authorizations for the project have attempted to provide adequate levels for the project. but growth within the project has been too rapid. The 1963 session of the Florida Legislature has just appropriated some $10 million to match Federal appropriations for the project through fiscal years 1964 and 1965. At the same time the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District isable to provide an annual sum of approximately $5.5 million to fulfill its responsibilities in the project. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. because of the growth and expansion of the area covered by the project. and because local and State interests are able to continue to fulfill their responsibilities.

In August 1963. the full committee issued a report entitled \"The Federal Budget as an Economic Document.\" which made a number of highly important recommendations in this field. As a number of the Economics Statistics Subcommittee I was highly pleased to note an article in the July 1964 issue of Challenge magazine. entitled \"Another Look at the Budget.\" The article is by Dr. Murray L. Weidenbaum. senior economist with the Stanford Research Institute. Dr. Weidenbaum suggests that an improved allocation of Federal funds could be achieved if expenditures were grouped in certain general categories. such as national defense. public welfare. economic development. and routine operations of the Government. Currently all Federal programs fall into one of these categories. and yet Congress and the Budget Bureau consider individual programs separately rather than in their totality. Considerable savings could be made. Dr. Weidenbaum says. if each Federal program were weighed against all others and evaluated in terms of national priorities. The article by Dr. Weidenbaum makes an important contribution to the continuing effort being made to improve upon the Federal budget and the manner in which it is considered by the executive branch and the Congress.

I applaud the action of the various groups representing the Negroes in their statement that this type of action should cease. I would encourage them to go even further and to discourage all forms of civil disobedience as they seek justice and equality. I further urge the leaders of this country. whether they be political leaders. religious leaders. social leaders or labor leaders. to do all in their power to seek restraint and moderation by those who are interested in solving one of our great social and moral problems.

As a Congressman who is for economy in government. I am opposed to plans for an unneeded Federal dam in my district. which is estimated to cost more than $50 million. My opposition to the proposed dam at Livermore Falls. north of Plymouth. N.H.. in the beautiful Pemigewasset Valley. commenced in October 1963. at which time the Baker River watershed project was approved by the House Committee on Public Works on which I serve. It seemed logical to me that the concept of small impoundments on tributaries. which characterizes watershed projects. could be applied in crowded river valleys to avoid the catastrophic impact of a single large dam. During October. November. and December. I studied in detail the proposed Livermore Falls Dam with my staff. As a result of my studies. I have concluded that. despite my high regard for the U.S. Corps of Engineers. their proposals for a dam at Livermore Falls are not in keeping with the best interests of the State and the immediate area involved. The proposal may be feasible on the drawing boards but I believe what has not been given proper consideration is the shattering and detrimental effects of this installation in terms of human and community values which dwarf. by comparison. the stated benefits.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in my radio broadcast for the week of February 24. I drew the attention of the people of the 24th Congressional District to the problems of increasing steel imports. In a statement on March 6. 1 again emphasized this serious problem and the necessity for a firm position by the U.S. Government at the General Agreement on Tariffs and TradeGATTConference at Geneva. The stagnation of the steel industry in western Pennsylvania resulting from heavy steel imports has reached the critical stage. Already some 40.000 steelworkers have been displaced in this country because of the rapidly increasing imports which have hit 5.5 million tons. Meanwhile. U.S. steel production is hovering at 2 million tons. Within the next 3 yearsif no corrective action is takenforeign produced steel will cut further into the American steel market. taking from 10 to 15 percent of the market and eliminating more jobsperhaps 35.000. bringing the total to 75.000. If the current trend continues. by 1970 American steel exports will drop to about a million tons. while imports will approach 10 million tons. wiping out thousands of more jobs. A further downward adjustment in corporate taxes and more liberal depreciation allowances on plants and equipment are necessary to better the competitive position of American steel producers. I support a strong U.S. position in international trade negotiation discussions scheduled for Geneva in May. At these conferences. no cut should be made in American steel tariffs unless the Common Market countries and other steelproducing countries slash their duties back to American levels. These countries must trim back their nontariff trade barriers and end unfair marketing twoprice practices such as dumping. The Buy American Act and the Foreign Assistance Actforeign aid programshould not be negotiable items at Geneva. No agreements should be made to seek congressional modification of these laws to permit greater American purchases of foreign goods. Failure to achieve cooperation in international negotiations would make it necessary to strengthen and enforce the Antidumping Act to eliminate trade abuses. It is time to protect the payrolls of our U.S. steelworkers by guaranteeing a competitive position for American steel not only in the world market but in the domestic market. Northwestern Pennsylvania needs this firm action at the Geneva Conference if jobs are to be stabilized and our economy improved.",

I have subsequently received a copy of the decision which was handed down and will include it with these brief remarks. I was pleased to note that the same concern expressed in my March 9 statement was contained in a New York Times article by the veteran political writer.

Unfortunately. Mr. Krock is completely correct. It is becoming more and more obvious that many other strange theories of this stripe will be perpetrated under the guise of \"civil rights.\" Merit will not count. only the likes and dislikes. the whims of those in authority who feel they are divinely endowed with the wisdom to rewrite the economic. political. and social practices of our society. Unfortunately. the socalled Civil Rights Act of 1964 which is embodied in H.R. 7152 is about the broadest delegation of power that can be imagined. Many of us objected to this bill because it contained little restraint on excessive bureaucratic zeal which in its administering. could bring about many inequities and undesired results. It is not by accident that the word \"discrimination\" is not defined in the act now before the Senate. To define it might narrow the interpretations which courts and agencies could give to its radical provisions. Certainly. there would be no difficulty in producing the same results under H.R. 7152 as the Illinois FEPC did in Myart against Motorola. Inc. While this case at this point has not been adjudicated through the courts it is. indeed. as Arthur Krock entitled his New York Times article. \"A Pilot Ruling.\" Mr. Speaker.

The United States will not be able to match the performance already demonstrated by the Soviet Union in weapons yielding more than about 30 megatons. We are told that the United States has no requirement for such weapons. The statement is not fully accurate. The record will disclose that a military requirement for such a device has been expressly stated. It has not been granted. but its requirements have been stated. Second. The United States. by being unable to test such very high yield weapons. will continue to be unable to realistically assess their military value. The reference here is to socalled big bombs. Third. The United States will not be able to acquire the knowledge it needs on the performance of weapons at high altitude. Without such tests there will .be unresolved uncertainties about both the warheads and radar performance of any antiballisticmissile system employing nuclear weapons. Fourth. The United States will be unable to prove the performance and reliability of antiballisticmissile systems under conditions in which the defensive missiles. the radars and the warheads .are exposed to nuclear explosions. Without the confidence that such testing alone will bring. I believe it is unlikely that any program as demanding of national resources as this may prove to be will ever reach operational status. Gen. Curtis LeMay told us: I think you probably can build one (an ABM system) that will work. but how well it is going to work. what degree of efficiency it is going to have is something else again * * *. The thing you will not know is how effective our radar and control and guidance system is going to be * * * under conditions of nuclear war. This we do not know * * * and I would prefer to test.

The President of the United States has handled this matter with skillful diplomacy and wise discretion. and his representatives in the negotiations have conducted themselves impeccably. However.

I mentioned Mexico with a particular reason in mind. Of all the major countries in Latin America. it is. in my opinion. the most stable and most advanced. and its revolution is behind it. The Mexicans are trying to do the best they can to increase their gross national product. but are finding it quite difficult. because the lands in the north are semiarid. while the lands in the south are tropical and need much improvement before large blocs of people can adequately be induced to move there. In addition. the increased birth rate in Mexico has complicated the solution to these problems. The construction of a canal would be one way in which a solvent government could undertake. if it so desiredand. of course. the decision would be its owna project of this kind. which is needed. which would bring in revenues. and. most importantly. would be under the control of the country traversed by the waterway. With all these factors in mind. with the demonstrated need of a second waterway in the immediate future. if not at the moment. and with the need for a sealevel canal rather than a locktype canal. it seems to me that the most logical place for such construction would be Mexico. Surveys have been conducted on and off for many decades across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

While the administration \"brass bands\" the Alliance for Progress. Senator TOWER notes that it is \"a paradox and an unhappy one that our dollars may be doing more harm than good.\" Every American realizes that the Alliance was not intended as largesse to build a sinecure for Latin American dictatorships. It was engineered. and the administration which introduced it so stated. to be a stimulus to the investment of private capital in Latin America and the inauguration of broad social economic reforms there. After 3 unhappy years. it is apparent that American dollars have driven out private capital. not induced its inflow. subsidized dictatorships. not inspired democracy. and shored up political philosophies which are anathema to representative government. As Senator TOWER so lucidly points out in quoting a Mexican businessman: Your Alliance is giving governments the money to buy up and operate as moneylosing Socialist state monopolies scores of businesses that were formerly taxpaying parts of the freeenterprise system. It seems remarkable to some of us that the wealth of the American people should be used to undermine the very system that produced it. Mr. President.

All these claims were just imaginary since at that time the plant had not actually begun operation. In sharp contrast was a Labor Department study suggesting that the multiplier effect of ARAfinanced projects would be negligible in depressed areas due to existing underutilized capacity in service and trade industries. This study \"never saw the light of day because the study was contrary to official ARA claims.\" says Levitan. Mr. Levitan concluded: ARA spokesman contributed substantially to the confusion that existed in the public mind about the program and the frustrations of its friends concerning its progress. Instead of explaining and clarifying the real problems it faced. spokesmen for the agency displayed great dexterity in issuing exaggerated press releases about its accomplishments. Until a Federal agency is willing to \"level\" with Congress and the public. its funds should be sharply curtailed.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 30 years ago. on June 18. 1934. President Roosevelt signed the Celler ForeignTrade Zones Act. I fought hard for the legislation that was patterned after the ancient idea of the Hanseatic Leaguea combination of socalled free ports in Europe around the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic. The purpose of the act was to set up free ports or free zones into which goods could be imported and held in the zones duty free until taken into U.S. customs territory. Almost 30 years of operation of these foreigntrade zones have proved how great a help they can be to our foreign trade and commerce. The Celler Act has been justified. Zones have been established in New York. New Orleans. San Francisco. Seattle. Toledo. and Puerto Rico. Many are the advantages of such a zone. Goods from other lands can enter and be held until. for example. the quota on such goods is resumed. Goods can enter in large quantities and be broken down into smaller quantities and retransshiped to foreign climes without payment of duty. U.S. customs laws apply only when the products enter U.S. customs territory. The foreigntrade zones provide an excellent opportunity for dutyfree manufacturing for export markets at U.S. sites. Foreign commodities may be brought to a foreigntrade zone from abroad and used in the manufacture of finished goods. thus providing the opportunity to use American labor and American components in the production of these goods. These may then be exported to world markets. Many and varied are the permissible operations. all of which give a fillip to American foreign trade. May the foreigntrade zones go from strength to strength. I also salute the executive secretary of the foreigntrade zones board. Richard H. Lake. for a job well performed.",

First. I wish to say a word with reference to the current organization of the Civil Rights Commission. When the Civil Rights Commission was first named. there was some effort to make it representative of the best and most constructive thinking of all parts of the country. I well recall that I was approached and asked to make any suggestions which I considered appropriate with respect to highly representative and reputable citizens in the southern area of our country. so that there might be representation on the Civil Rights Commission from our part of the country which would command respect on the part of our citizens in general. whether white or colored.

The most notorious of these .were the donation to Panama of the terminal yards and passenger stations of the Panama Railroad in the 1955 treaty and the hoisting in 1960. and subsequently. of the Panama flag in the Canal Zone in equal dignity with the flag of the United States.

I have had an extended correspondence with the Department of State. much of which has been published in the CoNGiESSIONAL RECORD over a period of years. An examination of this will disclose a pattern of evasions in meeting my queries that merits the fullest Inquiry by the Congress. Other Members of the Congress have had similar baffling experiences and they. too. would be benefitted by such investigation. After learning that the Department of State. following the January 912. 1964. mob assaults on the Canal Zone. had a representative in the administrative headquarters of the zone. this post was confirmed in a July 14 letter of the Secretary- of the Army. who stated that this representative was \"expected to advise and counsel the Governor on- some of the difficult problems which the Governor faced at that time.\" In the light of events. such \"advising and counseling\" of the Governor has amounted to control.

I The brief goes on to question the authority of the executive branch to negotiate.an eliminati6n of that principle. Although I cannot quote the brief in full. the following concluding paragraphs are most interesting and are entitled to the most careful consideration: In view of the legislative history it should be evident that the Congress has not delegated to the President authority to enter into a trade agreement providing for a change in the American selling price valuation basis. The absence of any specific language in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 clearly stating that the American selling price valuation principle is subject to trade agreement negotiations. and the overwhelming evidence of a contrary intention on the part of the Congress throughout the history of the trade agreements legislation. eliminate any serious possibility that the President possesses any such authority. In view of this clear lackjpf authority for Executive action in regard to the American selling price. we urge that the special representative as the chief negotiator acting for the President refrain from making any cominitments or entering into any discussions with a view to the possible making of commitments pertaining to the American selling price valuation basis. To quiet the alarm which Is being experienced within the dye. dye intermediates. and pigments industries. the special representative is urged to make a public announcement disavowing any purpose or intention to negotiate for change in the American selling price.",

I am today introducing a bill to provide for the disposition of funds arising from judgments in favor of the Miami Indians of Indiana and Oklahoma and for other purposes. I should like to explain this bill briefly. Appropriations were passed by the Congress in September 1961. to satisfy claims against the United States by the Miami Indians of Oklahoma and Indiana. These funds. which total about $4.600.000. are on deposit in the U.S. Treasury awaiting legislation to declare the manner in which they are to be allocated. In brief. the problem has been to determine who. for the purposes of receiving these funds. is a Miami Indian and who is not. A bill for this purpose. S. 2753. was introduced by Senator CHURCH at the request of the administration on April 20. For the most part. the bill which I introduce today Is identical with this measure. However. the present bill incorporates some significant clarifying changes which are in accord with the will of the Miami Indians themselves. as expressed in a resolution adopted at a meeting held in Peru. Ind.. on May 24. 1964. At least 2.000 to 3.000 individuals are involved. These changes include a statutory definition of the Miami Tribe of Indiana. which would be the basis for incorporation under the WheelerHoward Act should the tribe wish to do so. Another change would limit distribution of a small judgment due the Miamis of Indiana exclusively to the children or grandchildren of persons named on certain payrolls of the 1890s. Another change would allow the Miamis of Indiana to deal on this matter with the Minneapolis office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs rather than the more distant Oklahoma office. There are also provisions to assure that no person could collect twice by being on the Oklahoma Miami roll and also on the Indiana list. The same provisions are embodied in a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman RousH. of Indiana. H.R. 11824. Mr. President. I introduce this bill on behalf of myself and Senator BAYH. and request that the resolution of the Miami tribe in its May 24 meeting may appear at the end of these remarks.",

The white unemployment rate was 6 percent while the colored rate was 16.3. I emphasize that the State of Michigan has on its statute books an FEPC law. and yet 16.3 percent of the unemployed were colored. as against 6 percent of the whites. The total unemployed in the State of Illinois was 4.5 percent. Of that number. 3.8 percent of the unemployed were whites. and 11.5 percent were Negroes. Why was not the FEPC made to work in those States in order to provide more employment for Negroes? The proponents of the bill wish to place the program on a national basis. Why? I presume that they wish to get after the South. But I ask Senators to look at the similar percentages that are found in the South. The total percentage of unemployment in the State of Mississippi is 5.4 percent. Among the whites. 4.5 percent are unemployed. the Negroes. 7.1 percent.

Those percentages would indicate to me that there must be something wrong with the FEPC laws in those States. Either they are unpopular and are not enforced. or something else is happening. The State of Wisconsin. for example. had a total unemployment rate of 3.9 percent. Among the whites. the rate was 3.7 percent. Among the Negroes. it was 11.4 percent. In contrast. the State of Virginia had a total unemployment rate of 4.2 percent. Among the whites. the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. Among the colored. it was 7.1 percent.

As pointed out by the chairman of our committee. it would seem that if forgiveness features are justified to encourage more teachers this same feature could encourage doctors and dentists for rural areas. I wish to point out that in the immediate area in which I live a little town built a clinic for a doctor and a dentist. It stands empty. There was a little town farther west where the same thing happened. They found that after the building was supplied. the doctor or the dentist would move to a larger city. The building stands empty. The purpose of this bill is the hope that. by its provisions. we may encourage doctors or dentists to locate in rural areas. We are hopeful that this incentive will do the job. If the forgiveness feature is to be criticized. is to be deleted from this bill. it would seem to me it ought to be examined across the board. and not merely in this measure.

Once we decide that we are going to forgive student loans to doctors who fulfill certain requirements that are laid out by the Government. then we have let the bars down and opened the gates. How are we going to say no when they want to forgive loans for social workers. and how are we going to say no if they want to forgive loans to workers in poverty stricken areas? We have had the National Defense Education Act here on the House floor in the last 3 weeks and on the floor of the House we enacted amendments to cut down the forgiveness features that were then included in the bill that came to the floor. The proposal in that bill was to extend it to social workers. giving them forgiveness of loans if they would go into that type of work and also for workers in poverty stricken areas. There was a proposal from the floor to forgive loans for those who decided to go into teaching in the Peace Corps. Originally we felt that there was a great need to have more teachers in this country and that our national security was involved. so we tried to induce more people to go into the teaching profession after the sputnik controversy of 1958.

The real reason I have seenand I have struggled with this problem in my area. as a good many others havethat you cannot get a doctor to go into a rural area is that as soon as he does he wants a hospital Immediately available or he wants to specialize in a given field or he is unwilling to be a jack of all trades. as a good. oldfashioned country doctor must be willing to be.

Today in Washington a large number of American citizens. said to be in the neighborhood of 100.000. are demonstrating. Yet in connection with the Presidents proposals for civil rightswhich I strongly supportit is important to appreciate that unemployment is one of the greatest present difficulties in the way of a successful granting to our Negro citizens of their civil rights. The invitation which has been received by all Senators to view the demonstration this afternoon contains on its face a request that we appear \"to hear the demands of your constituents for jobs and freedom.\" At the very heart of the discrimination against our Negro citizens is their inability to obtain their fair share of jobs. Therefore. a number of the measures dealing with unemployment are of great importance in the area of assuring equal opportunity to all citizens. regardless of race. creed. or color. In this mornings New York Times appears a thoughtful and provocative article by the wellknown columnist. James Reston. pointing out. among other things. the importance of the job implications in connection with civil rights.

This article places some of the blame for some of the slow pace in which the Congress has acted this year on the President. It states: When the same party controls both the Presidency and the Congress. as is now the case. the pace of legislation is usually set by the President and. for tactical reasonsWith that statement I agree. But I am in disagreement with the following statement. which is that: Mr. Kennedy has consciously slowed the pace. In the first place. he made it clear from the outset of this session that he was interested primarily in the passage of a tax reform bill and in little else. I do not agree at all with that statement. The President has sent to us 104 separate recommendations for legislative action. In my opinion. it is our duty or obligation to act on them. one way or the other. to pass them. defeat them. or modify them. but to do something about them. I do not think the Economist is correct in making this particular statement. The article. however. ends with a rather melancholy conclusion. It states: It is a little absurd to believe that a few changes in procedure will do much to cure the deep spiritual malaise that has been afflicting Congress for a decade or more. Indeed. the very unwillingness of Congress to venture on a bold program of selfreform is itself a symptom of that malaise. With that conclusion I agree. but I have not given it hope. I urge upon my colleagues a further and careful consideration of the entire program of congressional reform. in the hope that in due time this program may be placed in a position in which it can measure up to the responsibilities that confront us In a constantly shrinking and everchanging dynamic country and dynamic world.

I noted with interest that the Senator read from the invitation which all of us received from the committee which planned and is carrying out the march on Washington. taking place today. The Senator from Florida received one of those invitations. I thought that little good psychology and little courtesy or good manners was involved in the way the invitation was phrased. in that it requested us to come to listen to the \"demands\" of our constituents.

I did not take it amiss. I hope very much that other Senators will not. though I appreciate the views of the Senator from Florida on that subject. In the substantive point which the Senator has raised. it is one of the real aspects of this situation. namely. the economic side and the job side. Antidiscrimination alone does not solve it. because though we would give opportunities. we do not wish. and would not. preempt the opportunities of others. because that would not be justice. There is. of course. the general effort which must be made. and on which we have fallen down very badly. and that is in connection with the matter of the endemic unemployment problem. and the gearing up of the American economy to a higher note of employment and productivity. I have given my prescription for that. as has the Senator from Pennsylvania. who is as ardent as I am. The specialized aspect. however. requires attention. I believe that there is a very good case for a specialized effort. from the standpoint of making it possible for Negroes to compete on the basis of the possession of equipment and training. I am against quotas for jobs. but I believe that in this connection they should receive preference. because there exists an opportunity for real nondiscrimination. An analysis prepared at the request of the Joint Economic Committee shows that there would be an absolute gain in the American gross national product of an estimated $13 to $17 billion annually if there could be an effective utilization of Negroes on the basis of their present state of training and education. thus contributing measurably to our national productivity. if nondiscrimination became real. rather than as it is now. so often honored in the breach rather than in performance.

Captive Nations Week is for us a reaffirmation of our belief in and our dedication to freedomfreedom for all persons throughout the world. and freedom especially to those to whom this precious right has long been denied. It is fitting in thismonth of July. the month of birth of our freedom. that our thoughts center on the brave and dedicated people who bear the weight of Communist oppression. It is fitting that we think back to the streets of Budapest where the blood of freedom once flowed. We should think. too. of the great Ukrainian people. who for 40 years have suffered the monstrous tyranny of Soviet imperialism.

Eric Gnupson. whose see included Greenland and VinlandAmericawas appointed by Pope Paschall II. in the year A.D. 1121. The colony in Greenland flourished for many years. but completely disappeared sometime after 1340. An expedition was sent to locate and bring back to the Christian faith the colonists who had left the western settlement.

Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman and Mrs. Freeman left Saturday on a trip which will take them on a monthlong tour of the Red bloc. including the Soviet Union. Poland. Yugoslavia. Bulgaria. and Rumania. The junket gives substance to the rumor that Secretary Freeman is now considered a New Frontier liability. and is about to be kicked upstairs into a diplomatic position. It is more likely househunting and a warmup for an ambassadorship. than the serious study of Communist agriculture predicted in Department of Agriculture publicity releases. Mr. Freeman is traveling halfway around the world supposedly to trade ideas with Communists in five countries on how to control farms and farmers. In planning the itinerary. he apparently overlooked Communist Cuba and Castros Minister of Agriculture. \"Che\" Guevera. He could search the world over and not find a more dedicated Communist farm leader than Guevera. and he would have to travel only 90 miles off Floridas coast to find him. Whether the real reason is house hunting or idea hunting it is hard to see how the U.S. taxpayer can possibly benefit from this extensive junketing by Mr. Freeman and his entourage. What can they learn that would be useful to the United States? The trip is confined to Communist countries where Government controls have been notably unsuccessful in solving food problems. Nor is any benefit to the Communists in prospect. Mr. Freeman has been notably unsuccessful in his own efforts to regiment U.S. farmers. If he could go as champion of a free agriculture. the Communists might learn something worthwhile. As it is. he travels as the rejected advocate of mandatory acreage controls. jail sentences for dairy farmers and other forms of regimentation. One possible reason for the trip remains. In the wake of his overwhelming defeat in the May 21 wheat referendum. Mr. Freeman may be searching for ways to win the next one.

However. the proposal of mediation was rejected by one side. so Mr. Justice Goldberg did not serve. The Senator from Mississippi has had no .contact. directly or indirectly. with Mr. Justice Goldberg. but expresses the hope and belief that the Justice did not wish to serve. The Senator from Mississippi reemphasizes and reiterates his opinion and position stated last week that no member of the Supreme Court. while Sitting as a member of that body. should have any duties. responsibilities. or official capacities of any kind except the direct official duties and responsibilities of that Court. A Supreme Court Justice cannot be partly a member of that Court and partly engaged in outside matters. One is either on the bench. or he is off. The Supreme Court is distinctly a separate branch of our Government. and the most independent of all branches. There is no possible reason why members of the Court should engage in outside activities. be they official or semiofficial. ordinary or extraordinary. This applies to foreign affairs. domestic affairs. and all affairs. I reemphasize and highly commend the position taken by the late Chief Justice Stone. who during his active tenure on the Court. was called upon to exercise responsibility beyond the direct affairs of that high tribunal. The Justice very respectfully declined the invitation. Mr. President. under date of July 11. 1953. Arthur Krock. the eminent and highily respected columnist of the New York Times. wrote a column on this subject. in which he gave his reason for his position and set forth the precedents as well. I ask unanimous consent that the column by Arthur Krock be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

Our debt and gratitude to the developing and emerging nations of the world is that they have reminded us of our own traditions. and given us a treasured opportunity to sacrifice and work once more for those principles which created our own Nation.

I oppose the Gross amendment and support the Thomson amendment. As a matter of practical arithmetic. here is the situation. The Peace Corps is placing people in the field at the rate of 150 a month. At the present time there are 7.176 Peace Corps men in the field. In the 8 months remaining of the year. they could add 1.200. That would give them approximately 8.400 people. Multiplied by the $9.000 per man that we are told it would cost. they cannot possibly spend more than $75 million. The gentleman from Wisconsin proposes that we authorize $81 milliona substantial sum to meet any possible contingency. I would also like to point out instead of being criticized for having minority views. we ought to be complimented for constructive suggestions. We want to help the Peace Corps and serve the taxpayer by authorizing realistic sums. We want to help the Peace Corps by maintaining financial responsibility. There is no possible way that the Peace Corps in good or bad projects could spend $102 million. The only way they could do it would be to lower their standards and we do not want them to do that. An authorization of $102 million is practically a blank check. It does not take into account realistic manpower utilization. Furthermore. the proponents of the program must bear in mind that we have yet to receive a thorough inspection and appraisal of the entire Peace Corps operation. It would seem the cause would be benefited far more by careful scrutiny and congressional control than by lavish blind praise and dispensing of unlimited funds.",

The bulk of it has been done traditionally in the private sector. The question is. what is the relationship between the governmental sector and the private in doing missionarytype work. In the committee hearings and in the reports and in the debate one has no concept at all of how much Is being done dollarwise or otherwise in the private sector and whether or not the Peace Corps itself is geared to encourage further efforts in the private sector. Let me illustrate. In regard to the student exchange program where I once had the details. we all hear about the Fulbright scholarships. One would almost think the only student exchange programs were through the Federal Government. For every one dollar in Federal Government student exchange programs there were $10 in the private sector. and I suspect the ratio is somewhat similar in this great missionary work. It is a problem of the use of such personnel as we have. The work is great. but the issue is how much should be done though the governmental mechanism and how much should be done through the private sector. As I said during the debate on the rule. regrettably the committee has not the information presented to us to evaluate whether this program should be doubled or cut in half or whatever. I think the matter should go back to the Foreign Affairs Committee so that we can get the kind of data we need to enable us to vote with intelligence.",

Mr. Chairman. 40 Peace Corps volunteers from Montana are helping America to show the world that a free society can produce the kind of men and women. who by their own initiative. perseverance. and just plain hard work. can make the world a better place. These Americans are proving in every corner of the globe that progress is the result of hard work. Through their example developing nations have seen that it is not American dollars which really do the job. but rather the ability to get down to the grassroots and do the work that needs to be done. Mr. Chairman. it Is not diffleult to imagine the impact 7.000 Americans are having on the underdeveloped nations. In the words of a church official in the Philippines \"one Peace Corps volunteer is worth a whole boatload of corn.\" One has to agree when he sees that a single Peace Corps volunteer in Pakistan saved a milliondollar rice crop. This single Peace Corps volunteer is costing the American taxpayers $75 a month in addition to a small living allowance. Certainly he is well worth the investment. This great return on a small investment can be magnified many times in the areas of Latin America. Asia. and Africa where Communist lies fool millions every day. Peace Corps volunteers are serving in the very nests of the Communist agitators in these areas. By their presence alone they expose the fraud being perpetrated by the Communists. Mr. Chairman. these Americans are our greatest asset in the pivotal area known as the developing nations. We are fortunate to have citizens such as these. We are fortunate they are willing to serve. And we are fortunate they are serving so well. I hope we give them the support they need.",

In 1961. in Augustand I shall speak only in round numbersthere were about 500 members in the Peace Corps. A year later. in 1962. there were about 3.500 members. Again a year after that. in 1963. there were about 6.600 members. Today. in midNovember. there are about 7.200 members in the Peace Corps. If that progression is to be continued. and if we assume that a fair standard of cost is $9.000 per year per Peace Corps individual. then it is quite apparent that there will be enough money at the level proposed by the gentleman from Wisconsin. that is. $81 million. to carry on the program for the balance of this fiscal year. If Members support the amendment of the gentleman. they will be granting an increase over expenditures in the last fiscal year of more than 40 percent. which is certainly a rather large increase for any program. I am convinced after studying the matter carefully that the reduction proposed will not injure the program and will in fact tighten it and make for a more effective Peace Corps operation.",

It strikes me as somewhat unreasonable to say that the Peace Corps is doing a good job and because it is. it should not be expanded or should not be given the opportunity to expand and do a better job. It seems rather unreasonable to me to argue that because nothing can be said in criticism about the program that it should be cut down or discontinued. I find it very difficult to understand the reasoning that says because taxpayers money is not being spent fast enough by the Peace Corps in the first 6 months of this fiscal year. therefore this authorization should be cut down and the program not given an opportunity to expand or continue its good work. It has been implausibly argued that it is impossible to get people into the Peace Corps at a rate faster than that which they are now being recruited. But there is given no evidence to support this allegation. I say the Peace Corps should be given the opportunity to recruit more. There are almost 7.200 people in the program and the Peace Corps says the target is 11.340 people. The recruitment growth record of the Peace Corps is admittedly excellent. Progress under the program has been worthwhile and there are more pending applications than ever. In the nonmilitary. noneconomic area. this program has had a great effect and tremendous beneficial impact both for the host country and the United States. For these reasons we should give the Peace Corps opportunity to expand. by our action in voting down the amendment and the substitute. and voting for the committee bill. Furthermore. and in conclusion. if people cannot be brought into the program all the funds authorized cannot be spent. Therefore I cannot see any reason why we should not support the amount of the authorization in the committee bill.",

I do not think a program that has proven as valuable as this one to our own country. and to the countries where we provide our help should be cut back. Mr. Chairman. a more serious question is the Thomson amendment. which I believe also should be opposed. This amendment would provide money sufficient to maintain only 9.000 volunteers. instead of an amount sufficient to support 11.300 volunteers. Mr. Chairman. in my opinion there is a real possibility that we can find as many as 11.300 wellqualified volunteers. I think a cut of over 20 percent from the amount requested would be undesirable. It would be an indication that we have our doubts regarding the selectivity which will be used hereafter. even though we must generally concede that a good job has been done up to this point.

The reduction offered by the Director was down to 11.300. Take a look at the report. on page 4. Members will note that the two areas of the world which are in greatest need of Peace Corps volunteers are Latin America and Africa. The additional funds are needed to send volunteers to those areas. Mr. Chairman. those who say that these additional volunteers cannot be recruited cannot show me any evidence In the presentation made by the Peace Corps that indicates that they cannot be produced. Mr. Chairman. I say again that the two areas where there is a crying need for volunteers are Latin America and Africa. Those who took the time to read the report written by the gentleman from Alabama . and his Subcommittee on Latin America after their visit to Latin America in 1962. will remember that they made a recommendation for an increased Peace Corps in Latin America. Mr. Chairman. I say both of these amendments should be defeated. I think the Peace Corps has done a good job in turning back money at the end of fiscal year 1962 when they returned to the Treasury the sum of $1.9 million. and again in 1963 when they returned $3.9 million.

This would make possible. Mr. Chairman. an increase greater than we have had in previous years. As I pointed out a few moments ago. from 1961 to 1962 we increased from 400 to 3.500. from 1962 to 1963 we moved from 3.500 to 6.600. My amendment would still make possible a Peace Corps of over 10.000 people. an addition of more than any we have had in previous years. and. again having in mind that we are now speaking in midNovember. certainly more people than can be carefully added to the Peace Corps in the remainder of this fiscal year. The Director. Mr. Shriver. has pointed out. and I applaud this. that the Peace Corps has been quite selective in the people that it has chosen to enroll. I hope this policy is continued and I believe it will be. but with this selectivity certainly 3.500 or more people to be added in this fiscal year gives more than enough leeway.

Although they are in the minority. as compared to millions of lawabiding citizens. they. the \"dobaders.\" are sensationalized. Because we live in the midst of many people whom we consider good and honorable. we do not jump to the conclusion that all people are bad. because a few have done wrong. With our AID program. it is different. The American people are detached from the vast activities of AID. Normally. their only knowledge of our foreign assistance program is obtained from the press. and. because all too often the press sensationalizes shortcomings in our oversea efforts and either minimizes or overlooks outstanding accomplishments. many of our people get the idea that our entire foreign aid program is a waste. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I. of course. come across instance after instance of where our AID dollars and people are doing a tremendous job. and I feel this knowledge should be shared with the American people and their Representatives in Congress. who have doubts as to the overall value of our foreign assistance activities. This is the first of several weekly installments I intend to insert in the RECORD under the title of \"Whats Good About Foreign Aid\" for the benefit of those who are interested in knowing more about our AID program. I trust these articles will help to demonstrate that whereas our AID program. as an essential part of free world mutual security. does need improvement. it is certainly not the worthless endeavor that many believe it to be.",

In so doing he won and held for more than two decades the respect of citizens of all ranks and political affiliation and of the entire Washington State press corps. including those who at State and national political conventions. and at sessions of the State legislature. were his competitors. For many years he served as president of the organization of legislative reporterswhich fact attests to the high regard with which they held him.

I was proud to consider \"Stub\" a warm and personal friend. yet I could not truthfully say that I was closer to \"Stub\" than other elected officials or candidates for public office with whom he was in frequent or continual contact. Ours was a frierdship of mutual respect for each others integrity. which perhaps over the years is the finest friendship one may have.

A short time ago I discussed what happened in the little city of Plaqueminewhich should not be confused with the Parish of Plaquemines. which is located about 100 miles away from the city of Plaquemine. In the peaceful little city of Plaquemine. a tolerant. kindly city. Mr. James Farmer. of the Congress of Racial Equality. who went there. stirred a lot of fine. understanding. lovable people into demonstrations of hatred and unrest. and in that connection there were all sorts of violations of law. including demands that businessmen hire Negroes to work as cashiers in their places of business. even though the Negroes referred to had had no such experience. and there were also demands that if such Negroes were not hired to work as cashiers in those places of business. Negroes would picket such business establishmentscontrary to the ordinance of that city. which prescribes that picketing may be done only by groups of not more than two persons. There was also a great deal of hurling of bricks and brickbats and broken bottles at automobiles. and similar violations of law and disturbances of the peace. There were countless violations and all sorts of disturbances. All of them were stirred up by the same persons. There were also many threats of personal harm to the residents of the city. and there were violations of the right of working people to enjoy peace and rest at night. when they were In their homes. and when it was time for them to sleep. In short. there were all sorts of unlawful disturbances and violations of law and order. including a great deal of chanting. singing. and screaming at late hours of the night. well after midnight. and countless other minor violations.",

All the activity of that sort involved clear violations of law. and all such violations of law justified the methods the police used to break up the demonstrations and to send the people to their homes. But that situation was described by James Farmer and by others of his group as \"police brutality.\" I suggest to the Senator from Florida that although the magnitude becomes greater when such persons undertake to humiliate the President of the United States in the eyes of the rest of the world. and although it is unthinkable that anyone would do such things. yet I believe it is fairly clear that the principle is the same in both casesnamely. that such activities clearly involve violations of laws and violations of the rights of citizens.",

I am introducing. by request of the Nations subsidized steamship lines. two bills which were before the Committee on Commerce during the 87th Congress. were reported favorably by the committee and passed by the Senate. but too late in the session for final action by the House. One bill would permit U.S. owners of vessels built with construction subsidy to secure Government warrisk insurance coverage in the same amounts available to foreign owners of comparable vessels built in foreign yards without subsidy. Present law is unduly restrictive in such respect. U.S. ship operators contend. The other bill would give owners of U.S.-flag vessels requisitioned for use by the Government in time of war or emergency priority toward reacquiring their vessels when the Government no longer has need of them. The many new vessels being put into service now by U.S. operators generally are built to serve the needs of particular trade routes. The owners believe. therefore. that the interests of our countrys shipping and commerce would be best served by having the vessels in the hands of operators serving the particular routes for which the vessels were designed.",

This bill would authorize. but not make mandatory. the assignment of class I bases among dairy farmers within a Federal milk marketing order in a manner reflecting the actual utilization of fluid milk within the given market. The essential purpose of this proposal is to authorize the producers within a marketing order to receive payment for their class I fluid milk in line with their actual base and a surplus price for production in excess of their base. Under the present Federal order program unfortunately there is an incentive to the producer to continue expansion of his production because he is rewarded through a blend price for milk production which goes into manufacturing uses. Thus surplus milk from the Federal order markets floods the manufacturing markets and eventually results in substantial surplus accumulation under the support program. I realize that this proposal leaves substantially unanswered one of the difficult problems regarding this class I base plan. namely a means of orderly sale or transfer of bases from one producer to another. Hearings on this and related proposals will be necessary to develop sound answer to this problem. It is possible that such a plan could operate for 1 or 2 years before we find the best manner in which to provide for such transfers or sales. I am hopeful that all concerned with the future wellbeing of the dairy producer will contribute to perfecting this proposal during the hearings in order that Congress can enact sound legislation before the close of the present session. The bill which I introduce today is essentially the proposal suggested by the National Milk Producers Federation. which proposal has received the endorsement of the Michigan Milk Producers Association. I ask unanimous consent that there be printed at this point in my remarks a copy of the resolution adopted by the Michigan Milk Producers Association. the text of the bill. a memorandum explaining the bill. and comments which I made on this subject at the annual meeting of the Michigan Allied Dairy Association in Detroit on February 13.",

The editorial stems from a recent report from AID of $669 million in carryover that. when added to the $3 - billion appropriation for this year. makes for a more adequate figure. On January 7. 1964. the Washington * Star published a letter to the editor from Mr. David E. Bell. Administrator of the Agency for International Development.

In his letter. Mr. Bell points out that it is congressional custom in past years to make such carryover funds available. He noted: Last year. for example. about $700 million of carryovers and recoveries were available. in addition to $3.9 billion of new appropriations. Our estimated carryovers and recoveries for the present year have been neither lost nor found nor concealed in any way. Mr. Bell also noted: Beginning early last spring. we have kept the Congress fully informed at all times of what amounts of past appropriations might be available in fiscal 1964 through carryovers and recoveries of various types.

Moreover. we have made it perfectly clear that we intend to take all the necessary and appropriate economic actions to cripple the Castro regime in Cuba.

Whether we get a reply which is typically Russian. or any reply at all. is a question. The Presidents letter was clearly designed to elicit a response. His message is constructive without being compromising. direct without being derogatory. The tenor is positive. If the Soviets respond. if they take up only one of the Presidents suggestions. we may be on the way to something resembling a rule of law which might. some day. lead to genuine peace. We have reached that point in history where both East and West are aware of the dangers inherent in todays world. We may have reached the point where both East and West are ready to discuss means of reducing the dangers. Mr. Khrushchevs roundrobin letter may be another Soviet propaganda ploy. it may be an evidence of helplessness and frustration. it may represent a real desire to come to some terms with the West. The President cannot know which. if any. of these the Soviet message represents. Whatever the Soviets purpose. the Presidents reply is a serious. wellreasoned. calculated effort to find an opening for discussions. His proposal for talks in a multilateral forum. whether in the United Nations. in the Disarmament Conference. or by other means. should convince the Soviets that we are ready and willing to talk with them.

On that day. while in my home State. I missed two yeaandnay votes. Both were on the bill to provide an increase in resources for the InterAmerican Development Association: The first yeaandnay vote was on the Morse motion to recommit the bill. Had I been present.

I heard a statement by the Secretary of State also taking exception to the sales that were made to Cuba. The Secretary himself stated that he did not believe it proper for any one of our allies to be selling critical goods to Cuba. I completely subscribe to that principle. Moreover. it was applicable to our sale of wheat to Russia but we did not adhere to it. We went down the wrong way when we decided to sell wheat to Russia. The Senator from Wisconsin voted against the measure. I also voted against it. I was then of the opinion that that deed was going to plague us. and it is plaguing us now by the sales that are being made to our enemy 90 miles from our shores. Mr. President.

This action. perhaps more than anything else. serves notice to the world that we are not content to accept a residual share of the world wheat market after our competitors have satisfied their marketing needs. The improved standards reflect our determination to participate. fully and effectively. in the international wheat trade. In recent years. the Nation has been plagued with wheat surpluses. acreage allotments and an unfavorable payments balance. The improved wheat standards will help solve these basic problems. and bring closer the day when U.S. wheat growers will be able to make greater use of their productive resources. The existing standards. with their liberal allowances for admixtures. have been a constant source of embarrassment for handlers and sellers of U.S. wheat. The new standards. which will go into effect on the 1964 crop. will provide many benefits. To the farmer. it will mean that the quality of his crop will be safeguarded as it moves through marketing channels to the ultimate consumer. Exporters of U.S. wheat will have the assurance that they are representing a product that is more in line with world needs and with wheats now being offered by our major competitors. Foreign buyers also will have more confidence in knowing that they can be assured of a quality product at a fair price. The Department of Agriculture. and especially the Agricultural Marketing Service. is entitled to commendation for developing the improved standards and putting them into effect. With these new and improved standards. the U.S. wheat industry will be in a better position to compete in quality markets and to capture an enlarged share of world cash sales.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the feed grains program. now entering its fourth year. is already a $2.5 billion dollar bust. It is too late to drop the program for 1964. but it should not be permitted to plague the taxpayers beyond this year. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. the program cost $2.5 billion during its first 3 years. 196163. In my opinion. this is a very conservative estimate. What did the taxpayers get for their money? There are two ways to evaluate the performance of the feed grains program. and either way it comes out a costly fizzle. First. did it cut back total production of feed grains. and if so. how much? Here the program worked in reverse. Production is up. not down. Here is the sad story of the three crops under the feed grains program. taken from U.S. Department of Agriculture reports: [In bushels] Production 1960 1963 Corn . ----------------- 3.908.000. 000 4.082.00. 000 Barley ----------------- 431.000. 000 400. 000. 000 Grain sorghum ---------- 620. 000.000 583.000.000 Total ------------ 4.959.000.000 5.065.000. 000 Change. from 1960 to 1963: production increased 106 million bushels. Second. did it result in a cutback in Government carryover stocks. and if so. how much? This too is a sad story even if one assumes that the Government program was responsible for every bushel cutback in stocks. Figures just released show that the cutback in Government stocks during this 3year period was only 514 million bushels. Department estimates of Government carryover stocks. all positions. at the close of the marketing year: [In bushels] Corn ------------------- 2.008. 000.000 1. 550. 000. 000 Barley -----------------153.000.000 140. 000. 000 Grain sorghum ---------- 703.000. 000 660. 000. 000 Total ------------2.864.000.000 2. 350. 000. 000 Change: Carryover down 514 million bushels. With the program cost at $2.5 billion. and the cutback only onehalf million bushels. each bushel cutback cost the taxpayers an average of $5. or about five times the market value of the grain. Any fair evaluation of the programs performance must include the effect it has had on livestock prices. The Governments dumping of corn in 1961 and 1962 to get a good signup invited abnormally heavy livestock feeding. This. in turn. triggered todays disastrously low livestock prices. The exact pricetag of all this is impossible to fix. but it can be conservatively placed at $3 billion.",

Senator Johnson said. in opposing cloture: If I were given a choice. if I should have the opportunity to send into the countries behind the Iron Curtain one freedom and only one. I know what my choice would be. I would send to those lands the very freedom we are attempting to disown here in the Senate. I would send to those nations the right of unlimited debate in their legislative chambers.

The first of the three amendments deals with all four categories of the socalled retailers excise taxes. that is. the 10percent levy on jewelry and related items. on furs. on toilet preparations. and on luggage. handbags. and similar leather goods. The amendment. if adopted. would repeal all of these levies effective immediately. except that with respect to jewelry and furs. only the first $100 of the retail price would be excluded from application of the tax. only the excess of the price above $100 being taxable. The second amendment. if adopted. would repeal in its entirety only the retailers excise tax on luggage. handbags. and similar leather goods. effective immediately. The third amendment. which is cosponsored by Senators JAVITS. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. and HRUSKA. would affect only the retailers excise tax on ladies purses and handbags. In effect. it would repeal the tax as applied to so much of the retail sales price of any of these articles as does not exceed $50. This is the same amendment which was offered but rejected in connection with H.R. 8363 earlier this year. which became the Revenue Act of 1964. The merits of the case for all three of these amendments are well known. and I will defer further comment until after the Committee on Finance has had an opportunity to study them arid determine whether or not the Senate will be given a chance to vote on them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am advised that a third Russian trawler penetrated U.S. territorial waters late last week. Several Florida fishing captains reported the vessel just off Hillsboro. Fla.. at approximately 10:09 a.m.. eastern standard time. last Thursday. One captain. reporting the trawler between his boat and the shore. took a sounding of 470foot depth. indicating his position to be approximately 2/2 nautical miles offshore. He then took a sounding of 450 feet at the position of the trawler after she had passed and estimated her position to have been 2% nautical miles offshore. Indications show these depths to be within the 3mile limit. However. when the Coast Guard reached the trawler she had headed out to sea and was headed south some 5.5 miles offshore. Mr. Speaker. the recurrence of Red trawlers entering U.S. coastal waters is becoming highly disturbing. The functions of these vessels may range from commercial fishing to fishing for such valuable intelligence data as the location of sunken vessels. It is known that the submerged wreckage of a hull provides submarines with excellent protection from radar. In any case. their mission is not in the interests of U.S. security. And the United States is doing little about it. Compare our policies. if there are any. to those of the British. On April 19. the British press reported that British customs officers boarded a Soviet trawler entering British waters. and served her with a writ of attachment. in effect denying her permission to move until further notice. At the same time. the royal navy was dispatched to protect the fishing rights of British vessels reportedly being crowded by Soviet trawlers in an area some 200 miles beyond the coastal limits of the British Isles. I have urged that an investigation be held in the Congress to determine the weaknesses in our defense network. and what steps can be instituted to halt these activities. There is real cause for concern here. and I am hopeful that the Congress will realize the urgency of this matter before we allow the Soviets another advantage in this hemisphere.",

One of the most ridiculous provisions of this act is to provide salary increases for Members of Congress in the amount of $10.000. This is sheer hypocrisy. We have promised the American people that this Government will cut expenditures. Many pious pleas were made on this floor advocating the tax cut. but at the same time. stating that expenditures must be held down to make the tax cut an effective one. What is to become of those promises now? Were they mere Idle words to lull the American voter into a false sense of security? To say the least. raising congressional salaries by 44 percent is breaking faith with the American taxpayer. This is certainly an unwarranted and unconscionable increase. and represents fiscal irresponsibility at its worst. The average American wage and salary earner has an annual income of $5.000. and to increase congressional salaries by twice that annual wage is blasphemous. What about the poor social security pensioner who is expected to live on a monthly stipend of $73? My office is constantly flooded with mail from these people asking for a modest increase. yet. we fail to heed their requests. and now we propose to increase our own salary by 44 percent.

A few weeks ago. the House of Representatives. caught in a crossfire of annoyance against other foreign aid projects. reduced by $150 million the proposed authorization for the Alliance. Following as it did a $50 million cut by the Foreign Affairs Committee in the executive asking. the House thereby reduced by more than 30 percent the total Alliance for Progress request. This is a more severe financial curtailment than almost any other governmental program has been forced to suffer. Ironically. the Alliance is one of the most popular of our foreign programsboth with the public generally and with the Congress. I am convinced that it also is one of the most urgently necessary and one of the most useful. The purpose of this discussion today. however. is not to chastise those who voted for the recommital motion which somewhat incidentally contained this drastic cut in funds for the Alliance. I recognize the sincerity of the concern felt by many of our colleagues toward the AID program generally. It is my firm conviction that. if the Members of this House had been afforded an opportunity for a separate vote on the proposed debilitation of the Alliance. this individual reduction would have been soundly defeated.

Their support is evidenced by a ratio of 56.6 percent in favor of either increasing or maintaining the Alliance for Progress program as is. as opposed to 43.4 percent who prefer a reduction.

This cut. from $600 to $450 million in AIDs participation in the Alliance. if sustained. will necessitate serious cutbacks in vital Latin American projects. The Alliance is a principal hope for peaceful development in Latin America. Dr. Milton Eisenhower. who was a special representative to Latin America during the previous administration. has just pointed out in a very fine book. that revolution is inevitable. the only question is whether it will be peaceful or violent. Needless to say. the United States has a tremendous stake In the peaceful development of our neighbors to the south. This will require large sums of money. and to cripple our effort now. when the program is beginning to show results. is not in our best interests. For example. this cut may require the abandonment of a number of important health projects. Expenditures for surplus food distribution. textbooks. and health clinics are now in jeopardy. In emphasizing the need for economic development we must remember that this can only be carried forward by a healthy population. It Is staggering to realize that Latin American nations have in some instances an infant mortality four times that of the United States and Western Europe. This statistic is. of course. preventable. It is false economy to permit this terrible drain to continue. Where will we find the leaders of tomorrow If not among the children of today? New opportunities for development are opening up In Latin America every day. We are encouraging private investment through our Investment guarantee program. This investment cannot bear fruit. however. unless the countries involved are assisted in developing the essential resources that support strong business enterprises. Power. roads. water supplies. and capital are as essential now as they were 2 years ago. It may be a few years before we see the kind of results we hope for in Latin America. but we cannot stop now with half measures.

Mr. Moscoso replied that among other things a $75 million cut in housing construction would mean that 175.000 people would go without new low cost homes next year. that the United States would be prevented from expanding the distribution of surplus food designed to feed 6 million Latin American children now in school for the first time. and that 2 million children would not get new textbooks in Central Ameriban schools.

It isnt the object of the exercise. but it does necessarily occur under present circumstances If you are going to cut taxes. The committee also got Into some of the problems of financing the deficit at its annual hearings. In the following statement. Dr. Heller made clear the key role played by the Federal Reserve in determining the economic impact of financing large budget deficits: The impact of the financing of a deficit that would grow out of the present economic situation. plus the tax program. will depend in considerable part. on what the Federal Reserve System does to the reserves of the banking system. Senator Douglas brought out in questioning Dr. Heller that financing the budget deficits out of savings. which is generally a noninflationary method. would tend to offset the stimulus of tax reduction. His exchange with Dr. Helier follows: Chairman DOuGLAs. If the Federal Reserve Board insisted that the deficit must be met out of the savings of individuals. would not this divert capital from industry and result in no net increase in monetary purchasing power and consequently no net increase in demand?",

How does William McChesney Martin. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. feel about financing the deficit through savings as opposed to financing by the Inflationary method of bankcreated money? While Mr. Martin has made clear that he never said there should be no monetary expansion in a year in which the Federal Government is incurring a deficit. his concern over inflaCIX1114 tionary methods of deficit financing is evident from the following exchange with Senator DOUGLAS: Chairman DOUGLAS. What you are saying is that Government borrowings coming as a result of deficits should be financed through savings of individuals and corporations not by the creation of additional bank credit. is that right? Mr. MARTue. That is right. Mr. Martin. therefore. clearly believes the deficit should be financed in a noninflationary manneror through savings--but this is the very method Dr. Heller believes would be selfdefeating in the light of the administrations desire to stimulate the economy. Two possibilities exist: economic stimulation accompanied by inflation arising from too rapid a monetary expansion. or little or no stimulation accompanied by little or no inflation. Either way one wonders about the soundness of a policy which poses such a dilemma. Mr. Speaker. the Inflationary threat posed by the administrations economic program has been dismissed all too lightly by the assertion that exces3 plant and capacity as well as unemployed manpower provide a safe margin for economic expansion without inflation. Careful analysis of the facts does not bear out this contention. Likewise the inflationary potential of financing large budget deficits is dismissed too lightly. I hope that these remarks will point out some of the inflationary dangers of the Presidents economic program and thus stimulate genuine debate on some of the real and pressing issues which tax cuts with more spending pose for the Nation.",

Public Law 78 provides a strict antidiscrimination measure for the protection of the bracerosa public accommodations law. if you will. Now. Public Law 78 has been approved by this Congress six times. so we know that the antidiscrimination measures called for in article 8 of the international agreement are given hearty approval by the proponents of the bracero program. Curiously enough. many of these same men are much concerned about the constitutionality of public accommodations provisions in the current civil rights legislation. It seems clear that if the provisions of the bracero program are constitutional. then so must be title II of the civil rights bill. Therefore. I would urge my colleagues who are hesitant about endorsing the public accommodations provisions of the civil rights bill to be not afraid. especially if they have endorsed the bracero lawand many of them have. repeatedly. Mr. Speaker. we often hear disparaging remarks about those politicians who say one thing one day and another the next. depending on to whom they are speaking. If a man votes for Public Law 78 and against title II of the civil rights bill. he is doing precisely that. He is saying on one day that you cannot discriminate against a person on account of his race or ancestryand even authorizing a foreign government to help carry out the letter of that lawand on the next day deny the same rights to his own countrymen as he voted for in extending Public Law 78. A man cannot be two things. he must be one or the other. If he votes to extend Public Law 78 and Its antidiscrimination provisions. he must also vote in favor of the civil rights bill. I would urge my colleagues who want to extend Public Law 78 to search their consciences. To be honest with themselves and with their constituents.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. no longer should the people of America refer to the \"sacred cow.\" If they wish to make reference to something sacred they should refer to the \"cotton cow\" or \"sacred cotton.\" For 2 days we have been witnessing another example of what can happen to an agricultural commodity raised in the South. There is no question but that the cotton textile industry is in distress because of the price differential between what the domestic textile producer must pay for domestic cotton and what the foreign textile producer can buy identical cotton for from CCC stocks. Just what is so sacred about cotton that the support price should not be permitted to drop by 2 or 3 cents or possibly 4 cents so that domestic mills would be in a more competitive position? Just why is the cotton producer so much more sacred than the wheat producer for instance? In 1962 Congress passed a socalled wheat support bill which was so unAmerican in its provisions and conditions that the wheat farmer rejected it in a referendum. This was early in the spring of 1963 and yet neither of the Agriculture Committees of the House or Senate has taken any action to provide any legislative relief to the wheat farmer of America. His price will drop to possibly $1 or $1.25 per bushel. Apparently this is all right in the eyes of the Democratcontrolled Agriculture Committees. But rather than to see the producers of \"king cotton\" take any reduction in production price. the committee comes in stampeding the Congress for a brandnew subsidy program. This subsidy program opens a brandnew field for subsidizing any industry injured by imports. Now the taxpayer is to subsidize the industrial production of cotton goods. I ask.

While Congress this year is setting a record for slow action on annual appropriations bills. it also may well establish an outstanding record for budget cutting. In this connection. the Council of State Chambers of Commerce suggests that the net reduction on the 1964 budget will be a reduction from the original budget request of in excess of $5 billionthe largest total cut since 1953.

The evidence which was presented to us in our hearings has convinced me. and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. that. unfortunately. a large number of working women- are not financially rewarded to the same degree as males doing the same work. There perhaps was a time in the countrys history when a man. because of his commanding position as the head of the family and breadwinner. was entitled to more compensation than the single woman. Even that concept is open to serious challenge when one considers that each has human needs that must be met. But in modernday America. womens role as a provider. for not only herself but her family. has become an essential role. These considerations. documented as they are by the evidence that is before this body. must lead to the support of S. I urge a \"yea\" vote on the part of every Senator.",

They received credit in the computation of past pay for their inactive Naval Reserve service. This decision resulted in their having received this money over a period of approximately 15 years.

The record to this point shows that this legislation has been approved over the unanimous objection of the Republican members of the Committee on Agriculture set forth in the minority report on H.R. 10222House Report 122888th Congress. The record also shows that it was passed through the House on April 8. 1964. as a \"package deal\" with the cottonwheat bill in spite of overwhelming opposition by House Republicans.

In other words. the pressure will be on the States of Virginia and Maryland to increase their teachers salaries because of the increase here. There must be an end sometime. some place. to this business of salary increases. I hope that the Treasury of the District of Columbia is able to afford the $2/2 million annual Increase involved in this bill.",

Mr. Speaker. in view of the statements of my good friend and colleague from Iowa I think there ought to be at least this explanation made. The teachers of the District of Columbia as compared with teachers in cities throughout the country with a population of 500.000 to one million are well paid. However. even with the salaries as they are now it seems that it is extremely difficult to recruit schoolteachers in the District for the District of Columbia schools. We do have some social conditions in Washington which are most unusual. Thirtyseven percent. I believe. of the teachers of the District of Columbia are not what I would call fully qualified to teach. They have a temporary status at the present time. Many of them are here because they do not have the qualifications that would enable them to teach in other systems that have higher qualifications. Recruitment of teacher personnel has been probably the most difficult problem with which the District Superintendent of Schools has been faced. Even with the good salary schedules teachers are not attracted to the District of Columbia schools. If any of my colleagues will visit the District of Columbia schools they will get an understanding of why teachers hesitate to come to Washington.

The police department in Washington works under terrific circumstances and deal with all the top Government officials. all the diplomats from approximately 100 countries who have embassies or consulates located in Washington and they are continuously confronted with obstructions from certain private organizations who would like to dictate to the Chief of Police. They are subject to abuse from the leftwing newspapers and their hands are practically tied by certain Supreme Court decisions. I realize that a high salary cannot and will not make them more efficient policemen. however. it will assist in relieving some of the high living conditions here in the Nations Capital. My committee accepted the bill as it was drafted by the Commissioners and I presume some of their advisers here in the District of Columbia without making any changes other than a slight change In the longevity of the Deputy Chiefs in the fire department and the police department who may be compelled to retire after their promotion to Deputy Chief without having served sufficient time as a Deputy Chief to be able to collect their longevity even though they have served more than 30 years as a member of the Metropolitan Police Department or the Washington Fire Department. I was of the opinion that this should be applied to the lieutenants. captains. and Inspectors. however. the Commissioners objected on the grounds that it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to take care of all the grades effected in the police department and the fire department. The committee amended the pending bill so it will only effect the Deputy Chiefs who may be required to retire before they have served as Deputy Chief a sufficient length of time to collect their longevity. The unofficial ultraliberal press here in Washington would make the citizens of Washington think that the House District Committee wrote the bill since they stated that the House District Committee reported a bill that would increase the salaries from 61/2 percent to 50 percent. The House District Committee did not write the pay scales included in the Police and Fire Department bill and if the privates do not get what they justly deserve It is because the Commissioners and the persons responsible for this piece of legislation did not recommend a higher pay scale.",

If you will take on page 2 and add that to all of the other specified exemptions in this act.

For instance. he is exempted if he employs persons under a seniority system. or a merit system. or a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality. I would like to know how any person could argue against an unscrupulous employer who would say that this persons work does not meet the quality of performance of a worker alongside of one who happened to be of a different sex. It is only based on a differential in sex when that differential is not subject to these other qualifications.

The principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be denied. but I do not believe it is necessary to have broad administrative power of the nature that is given here to conduct this type of socalled fishing expedition into every business in America. On page 3. line 13. I will offer an amendment as follows: Page 3. line 12: At the beginning of the line. insert the following: \"Investigation of alleged discrimination under this subsection shall be limited to the facts set forth In writing by an aggrieved employee and\". I happen to think this would make this legislation much better and would prevent abuse. The point was raised during the hearings that if you require an aggrieved employee to file a charge few if any would in fact be filed. I am sure this is not the case. It seems to me this is a typical attitude we have in Washington. that the people back home just are not smart enough to take care of themselves and utilize the law to protect themselves. I happen to think. as a matter of fact. that women throughout America are much more intelligent than that. and if there is an abuse they will not in any way deem it unwise to file such complaint out of fear and trepidation. We know in our homes that our wives are not afraid to speak up. To allege that they would be afraid to file a complaint is to say in effect that they would be afraid to speak up where there is an abuse in the law.

I suppose that dealing with such a fair subject it is not surprising that we should have all gotten along so well. I do think there are one or two things that should be pointed out as additional observations with regard to a couple of points that have already been made with respect to the bill. The first is that it has been stated in the minority views at one point that this bill will in effect give a hunting license to the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor to go on what they call a fishing expedition. I think the gentleman had better get a fishing license if he is going to go on that. rather than a hunting license. but in any event I do not think the accusation is true. I would call to the attention of the members of the committee that in a couple of cases we have researched it has specifically been held that the Wage and Hour Administrator does not have the authority to go on a fishing expedition to make blanket demands of material. The only sanction. actually. of which the Administrator can avail himself. if there is a refusal to provide information he requests. is to go in and ask for a subpena. In the case of Mississippi Road Supply v. Walling (136 Fed. 2d. 391). the Fifth Circuit held that the Administrator does have the burden of showing that violations probably occurred before a subpena may be enforced. Another case I would call to the attention of the committee is the case of Walling v. McGinley (7 Labor cases. No. 61.600). which held that motions for general search of records will be denied where the purpose of the search was a fishing expedition.

Mr. Chairman. it gives me great pleasure to speak in behalf of H.R. 6060. the equal pay proposal reported by the Education and Labor Committee. We have talked too long about the inequities and hardships brought about by pay discrimination based on sex. It is high time the Federal Government took action to remove this evil. As has been pointed out. it not only falls most oppressively on the most unprotected and lowest paid employees. -it also penalizes fair employers whose pay practices are based upon job content and results. I think the Labor Committee has presented a workable bill for effecting an equal pay policy. The committees bill would add an equal pay standard to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Instead of imposing a new. untried regulation with a separate administrative channel upon employers. H.R. 6060 would make the experience and resources of 25 years of application of labor standards legislation available to implement the equal pay provisions. Moreover. the bill affords ample time for preparation to meet equal pay standards. At the minimum. it allows employers a full year in which to make any necessary adjustments in their employment practices. I think H.R. 6060 is an eminently fair. efficient measure embodying a principle the justice of which no one can dispute. We cannot fail to take this opportunity to insure its enactment into law. The time. the means. and the procedures are at hand to eliminate the unfair pay rate discriminations on account of sex from the instrumentalities and producers of interstate commerce.

We all like to think that we are fairminded. And yet. study and hearings have established evidence of widespread wage rate differentials based on sex. The problem before us now is simply how best to remove this anachronism. H.R: 6060 would accomplish this by incorporating the equal pay for equal work principle in Federal labor standards legislation. that has been effectively administered. tried. and tested in the courts since 1938the Fair Labor Standards Act. Further. it would allow a suitable grace period for administrators. employers. and workers to become acquainted with its demands and to make any necessary adjustments. In the case of employers in general. it would be 1 year before the provisions would apply. in the case of employers having collective bargaining agreements. this period would be 2 years. or when an existing agreement ends. if that be sooner. Mr. Chairman. I think H.R. 6060 offers a workable solution to remove unequal pay practices from the channels of interstate commerce. It makes investigative. interpretative. educational and efforcement resources and techniques available for this purpose which have been familiar and acceptable to employers and workers for a number of years. At the same time. it would not require any new administrative setup. Convinced as I am of the need for Federal legislation to protect against wage rate discrimination on account of sex.

We suffered perhaps and we heard much comment in this country to the effect that the United States was about to become a secondclass power. The decision to diminish the program which might have enabled us to put the first satellite in orbit was motivated by the fact that the then President of the United States. Dwight D. Eisenhower. and the then Secretary of Defense. Mr. Wilson believed that the money should be spent for more sophisticated defense weapons and a defense system.

In my own State of Iowa my relations and contacts with the League of Women Voters have for the most part been excellent.

I must confess amazement at a statement appearing in this article attributed to a leading Kennedy political aid. who said that the league apparently had no influence. not even on their husbands. and he attributed this to the fact that they never take sides in an election. that they are so nonpartisan that they are completely useless. I think the nonpartisan approach of the league is one reason why it is indeed effective.

Of course the gentleman from Illinois unquestionably does not intend to gut the bill. But if we should adopt this proposal. this loan program would certainly be Ineffective In a great many countries that lack the capacity to repay at any significant rate of interest. I might say that the difference to this country would be very small. The reason why we are lending this money at low rates of interest is because projects which are being built with the money provided produce small revenues. and the recipient countries are not in a position to support anything more. This may be a reasonable proposition from our point of view. but It would not be practicable from the point of view of the recipient countries. We have to recognize that this would be a very damaging direction in which to move. In that connection. I would like to quote from the Clay report on this problem. They point out on page 14 of the report. the necessity of other countries which lend money to liberalize their rates. They point out that Italy should liberalize her terms of lending. that the United Kingdom should lower her interest rates. that Germany should soften its terms. and that France should soften its aid terms. The importance of improving loan termsAnd I quoteincluding maturities. interest rates. and grace periods is particularly apparent in the case of those nations undertaking comprehensive development programs. Unless the lending terms to other countries improve greatly. . That means unless the terms are made more liberal. not made higher. and approach U.S. terms. international consortia and coordinating groups for such countries as India. Pakistan. Turkey. and Nigeria will saddle those countries with Impossible debt service requirements. and U.S. funds would pay for these short term and shortsighted debts. It Is for this reason. Mr. Chairman. that in 1961 we deliberately set the rates at low interest. We did not desire to saddle these new countries. these countries in need of development assistance. but not having the financial resources within themselves. with heavy debt service burdens. They should qualify for this assistance.",

We would be rising to meet the recommendations of the Clay Committee. May I take 1 more second of the gentlemans time to correct some misinformation which the gentleman from Ohio did not mean to leave. This rate of threequarters of 1 percent is not available to any poor Bolivian peasant. This rate is available to the Government of Bolivia or any other country. They relend It to the people. A Bolivian peasant drawing a loan from his Government will be paying in the neighborhood of 10 percent.",

So in effect we would be very effectively gutting this development loan program if we should increase the rate. The gentlemans amendment recognizes the necessity for a subsidy. He is not getting away from the fact that in these cases at least a subsidy is a desirable thing. In my opinion liberal interest rates are absolutely essential if we are to provide aid to developing countries. This applies both to this country and to Allied countries capable of making loans.",

Without corrective measures. the seaway will fall into functional obsolescence far short of its 50year accounting lifetime. So far this year. the total tonnage of the seaway is 18 percent ahead of last year. which was 25.593.600 tons.

This victory was due to President Kennedys firm. determined. and unyielding action toward Khrushchev and Castro. and to the wholehearted support given him at the time by all Americans. Still another reason for our success was the fact that throughout that crisis our Government and that of the Soviet Union were in constant communication as the world teetered on the verge of nuclear war. One lesson we learned from that experience is the importance of maintaining readily accessible communications between our President and the leader of the Soviet Union. To facilitate this. negotiations were conducted for the establishment of a direct telecommunications link. or socalled \"hot line.\" between the Kremlin and the White House. Despite months of setbacks and discouragements. an agreement was finally reached. and this socalled \"hot line\" is presently in effect. It enables our President to confer informally and privately with Khrushchev at any time. day or night. speedily. directly. and effectively. This marks a new era in diplomacy. Recent events have proven the wisdom of this action and also the necessity for improving communications between officials of the two Governments at lower levels. It is reported that one reason for the recent tense situation. when one of our military convoys was halted for a matter of hours on its way to West Berlin. was the lack of swift communications between military commanders representing the United States and our West European allies in Germany and their Soviet counterparts in East Berlin.

I am glad to support this measure and will support other measures that help our colleges. But other proposals like todays bill do not persuade me that tax relief Is not needed. I believe it is needed. no matter what other proposals are voted upon. And I intend to see to It that a constructive tax relief proposal is considered by the Finance Committee and that the Senate has an opportunity to consider such a proposal on its merits. Mr. President. for the reasons I have stated. I welcome the expressions of the Senator from New York. I know that he has much to add to consideration of this issue that will be of great value. I hope that In the days ahead he and other Senators. including myself. will be able to prepare a program which will receive the support of the Senate and that it may be incorporated in the tax laws of our country.",

There Is no question that unemployment for this entire Nation is serious. running around 6 percent. But if there Is any group where unemployment particularly hits It Is the young Negro. where the rate Is not 6 percent but around 20 percent. This bill is designedand I am happy to see that it has got bipartisan support. as it should haveis designed to hit at this problem. It becomes very Important that we direct our attention to this. I was really hesitant to take the well of the House after some of the remarks of the gentlemen on the Democratic side.

Those of us who have followed these hearings very closely over the years and who are members of the Committee on Education and Labor are very familiar with how difficult it is for a graduate of a vocational school in the skilled trades to get a job today. white or black. Mr. Meany. who is the president of the AFLCIO has testified that within the workings of his organization he cannot break downall of the race barriers. He has said he needs the help and the arm of government. that he needs the help and arm of the Congress. . What is going to happen if the House of Representatives refuses to take one little step in the direction of removing discrimination in the vocational field? Today a Negro boy. graduating from a vocational high school in the North. cannot get a job as a plumber. a carpenter. a sheet metal worker or an electrician. He cannot be taken into the apprenticeship program. Right at this very moment. the biggest construction job in the city of Cleveland is tied up because the unionrefuses to hire two mechanics who are skilled Negro mechanics. I say -to you. Mr. Chairman. that if this House of Representatives does not have the courage to pass this weak amendment then weare saying to organized labor. \"We dont care whether you break down the barriers in your apprenticeship program or your race problem. you go ahead and run it as you are.\" But if we pass this amendment I can assure you. Mr. Chairman. that 4 years from now when these boys who entered the skilled trade schools are graduating and looking for jobs. the union will have to give them jobs. white or black.",

I challenge anyone to dispute that statement. And so I must say frankly that I resent the blanket indictment of \"phony\" because I support an amendment in which I deeply believe. I have always gone down this aisle on teller votes in support of antidiscrimination amendments to such things as medical facilities bills. housing bills and all the others. and I have voted for every civil rights bill that has been brought to this floor. I do not believe that consistency of principle should ever be interpreted as \"phony.\" Why will not this bill pass if this amendment is adopted? This House is controlled by the majority party 277 to 158. The other body is controlled by the Democrats by 67 to 33. Do we mean when we say this will not pass with the Bell amendment included that the principle of civil rights cannot pass these two bodies?

How did the majority leader vote on that civil rights bill in 1957the first since the Civil War? He voted \"no.\" How did the majority whip. the gentleman from Louisiana vote? He voted \"no.\" He also signed the southern manifesto \"n 1954 which stated that desegregation was immoral.

No one can deny this. despite all the speeches we have heard around here today. If I lived in Aiken. S.C.. with the Federal installations there. maybe I too might be against this bill. I too wouldnt need this bill because of all the Federal money Alken gets from the aid to impacted areas bill. But under the legislation before us. this is the first time that we have an opportunity to help the urban areas of America which have been the recipients of this tremendous inmigration of families from rural areas into the urban areas. This bill. for the first time. makes Chicago and other large urban areas eligible for Federal aid to vocational training. For that reason. I hope this amendment will be defeated. Let us get on with this bill. Let us enact mean\" ingful legislation which will help a city like Chicago shift part of the present burden for maintaining our public schools vocational education program from the real estate tax payer in my district to the Federal Government.

As I indicated in my earlier statement to the House. this would apply to Boys Town and Moose Heart and institutions like that. as well as religious institutions of all denominations. I think you all understand the purpose of the amendment. Let me just say this one word. I am sure that the chairman of this committee. being interested as he is in the elimination of discrimination in any guise. should accept the amendment. Let me point out. that most of these private institutions are supported and are in existence today largely because of vocations. and vocations do not supply machinery. Usually people with vocations do not have technical skills. Therefore. I would say to you that if the public institutions need this type of legislation a fortiori. so do the private institutions. and I would hope. therefore. that the House and especially the committee headed by the eminent chairman from New York. will accept this amendment.",

One of the other purposes of the -bill. as the Senator well noted. is training. development of work habits. and development of certain skills or at least semiskills. As I understand the intent of the Senators amendment. It is to see that the enrollees at least develop toward employability. once they leave the camps. \"by providing work experience and training in occupational skills.\" I believe that that part of the language. that far. is highly desirable. There Is one point which might cause some difficulty. and I ask for the Senators tolerant consideration of this point. The amendment would require the Secretary to certify that there is an existing labor shortage at some particular time. This would mean a great deal of examination of an area or a region as to whether there was a labor shortage in a particular skill. It might well be. for example. that a young man might get some training which would be very helpful to him later in life. and with respect to which at the moment there might not be an existing labor shortage. I think the standards the Senator would apply are desirable. If the Senator would give consideration to my suggestion. I would feel that the amendment was highly desirable. I suggest inserting on line 12. page 41. after the word \"enrollees\" the following: \"by providing work experience and training\" in occupational skills.\"",

No kind of training in the world is going to get a West Virginia coal miner. or the son of a coal miner. back to mining coal. but let us say that in the State of West Virginia. or Pennsylvania. or Minnesota. there is a shortage of good welders or men who understand the operation of machine tools. Instead. then. of teaching a boy about the problems of coal mining. which industry for the time being is pretty dead in this country. he is taught something by means of which at least he can go out in the labor field and demonstrate his skill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the purpose of this bill is to permit the packaging of smaller quantities of milk. ice cream. and other dairy products than is permissible under present law. Under modern methods. dairies are able to package milk and ice cream in very small amounts. and there is demand for such packaging on todays market. Present law forbids the sale of milk in containers smaller than 1 gill in capacity. For this reason. it is necessary for restaurants and other food service establishments to fill individual 1ounce containers from bulk packages in order to provide individual servings of cream or halfandhalf with coffee servings. We are informed that the District of Columbia Department of Public Health does not approve this practice. as unsanitary conditions often result from the refilling of used containers. salvaging of partially used servings. and exposure of open servings. If this proposed legislation is enacted. the local dairies propose to produce small. individual packages of plasticcovered paper. sealed. containing an amount of cream or halfandhalf suitable for serving with coffee. Under the provisions of the bill as amended by the Senate. the dairies will have the option of labeling each container filled with cream or halfandhalf with the actual net contents. or. alternatively. of packaging two or more of such identical containers in a larger package and labeling such container with the total contents. When the latter packaging technique is used. the actual labeling of each individual unit with the net contents will not be required. These two alternative methods of packaging appear to be compatible with the existing packaging processes of the dairies and will not require the industry to make any extensive modification of their packaging techniques and equipment. Equally important. it is the view of the committee that these packaging provisions of the bill will benefit and protect the public as the actual packaging of the container with the dairy fluid product will be supervised and accomplished in an environment that maintains high standards of sanitation. The bill. as amended by the Senate. is supported by the District of Columbia government.

As long as 10 years ago. when I was mayor of Philadelphia. the cost of 1 mile of our Delaware Expressway. which is not yet built. was $17 million. I am sure that cost is substantially higher today. Yet. until we can get the modern equipment and the necessary Federal financing. we have unused and unavailable a network of railroads which could be utilized to bring more than 100.000 people. in and out and around the metropolitan area every day. So the Senator from New Jersey is quite correct. when he says that the very modest expenditures which are contemplated by the bill would. in the end. pay for themselves many times over in saving the cost of highways which would otherwise become necessary.",

This is a subject which the Senator from New Jersey has well said involves the life and the continued wellbeing of our cities and. indeed. many of our towns. too.

In addition to the added highway expenditure that will be necessary if we do not preserve and modernize essential urban transit service. we have the problems and costs of providing enough parking space for all the automobiles. the loss of tax ratable property. the dislocation of families. the added traffic control and street maintenance costs. . In my judgment. much of this pain and confusion is inevitable. for urban highways will always be essential to meet a variety of needs that public transportation will never be able to meet. The automobile is here to stay. but we cannot handle the crush of rushhour travel by highways and automobiles alone. What we are trying to do is get a little balance. to improve rail and bus transit to help supplement our efforts to handle the rushhour problem. And no one that I know of disputes the need for a balanced and coordinated urban transportation system. using all modes of transportation to the best natural advantage. But how in the world can we get balance when the Federal Government provides 90 percent of the cost of highway construction and provides nothing for the improvement of transit? So I say that there is no shortcut to economy. If we do not provide the modest help proposed here. we will end up paying far more to move people some other wayfor move they must. and move they will during the rush hours. And the expenditures proposed in S. 6 are modest. The $100 million expenditure proposed for the first year is only $30 million more than it cost to build less than 3 miles of a highway loop in the city of Cleveland. Ohio.

Congress approved essentially the same wheat program in the omnibus farm bill which was vetoed by President Eisenhower. Wheatgrowers achieved a substantial victory when the modernized version of the domestic parity wheat program was included in the Agricultural Act of 1962. The members of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees voted for it. The Members of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives voted for it. President Kennedy signed it into law. Now the question goes before the f armers themselves. If twothirds of the growers vote \"yes\" in the forthcoming wheat referendum. they will bring into operation a grassroots program. devised by farmers. won by farmers. to be administered by farmers. In this referendum. farmers will be asked to make the most important economic decision since 1933. when the first Agricultural Adjustment Act was passed.

Or. if the farmers did not want controls. then they had to accept a withdrawal of support. It provided a means for the farmers to decide one way or the other. As I have said. this program gave the wheat farmers a choice which is reasonable and fair: either controls with supports. or no support and no controls.

What I object to principally with respect to a number of the amendments offered. and others. is that we are attempting to usurp the discretion of the Executive in the administration of foreign policy. We are not merely writing foreign policy. we are going further and seeking to tie the Presidents hands in the actual administration of it. That is unwarrantable and could force the President into many embarrassing situations that would be of great harm to our foreign relations in -many areas. I think some of the other actions may do that. particularly the criticisms of friendly countries which occurred in the debate on the fishing amendment. I dare say that many of those statements will be repeated in the press of the respective countries referred to and- be highly offensive to those countries. When we undertake in public to discuss each of those countries in turn and recount all of their misdeeds. it is a very bad thing. But that is another matter. On this particular issue.

Some Senators think they have information that aggression is about to be committed against the State of Israel. I do not know that. We do know about the Yemen problem.

Under any circumstances. I think even my substitute amendment would be difficult to administer in a really effective way. It would be very difficult to judge who is an aggressor. Every country always contends that the other country is the aggressor. and the other country always says it is only defending itself. I do not know of any case in which a country has admitted it was an aggressor. except possibly Germany in World War I. There are few cases in which a country has made any pretense about being an aggressor. Generally speaking. 99 percent of the time a country says it is only defending itself. They may be taking preventive action. Even if they take overt action. they say it is the other nation that is committing the offense and that they are really anticipating another attack.

This book will certainly prove of great value to our Army families throughout the world. families who must move from post to post while protecting the vital interests of the United States. There is a great deal of factual information on more than 300 Army installations in the book. including posts overseas. and the emphasis is on current housing. transportation. schools. and other facilities at or near the posts. This is the sort of information Army families need to know. that has never been conveniently collected in one volume before. and Members of Congress should find the book of great help in answering queries from constituents in the service. But there is also a great deal of factual and fascinating historical data in the book about some of the older Army posts. In this regard. Editor Scanlans comment in the preface seems worthy of attention: It is suggested that anyone interested in American history and how the United States came into being can discover something of value from a study of old Army posts. Even a passing knowledge of old Army posts will again prove that the United States was not created by a people intent upon playing it safe. waiting for a base on balls. and letting some other guy fight the wilderness. the prairie. pestilence. the original Americans we called savages. and the innumerable other fears and facts of the unknown that had to be met before this Nation could be united ocean to ocean. Editor Scanlan. who has been writing about the Army for over 10 years. combines the concise. sharp writing of a good newspaperman with the accuracy of a historian. He has made a reference book interesting reading. I am sure the book will prove of value to all Members of the House. Equality of Opportunity",

This reduction made by the committee amounts to approximately 13 percent across the board. We are assured that these reductions will in no way impair the operational effectiveness of the armmed services nor will they in any way jeopardize our national security. Despite this assurance I regret that the committee has seen fit to delete one item which is of considerable Importance to the capabilities of the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in my district. This was a large crane which had been requested for use in connection with a large drydock located at this yard. It is the worlds largest drydock and was completed over a year ago--except for additional increments such as the crane. In order for the drydock. which was constructed at considerable cost. to be fully utilized it should have a crane that can reach halfway across its width. Some members of the committee have told me that while they realize the eventual need of the crane the full committee felt that provision for it could be put off until a later date. They have given me assurance that it. together with many other deleted items. will be considered in the next authorization bill. I respectfully disagree with them and believe the crane ought to be authorized this year so that there will be no unnecessary delay in is construction should one of the superearriers need repair or overhaul work done at the yard. However. I recognize the futility at this point of offering an amendment to restore the item. As usual. the House would support the committee position and defeat the amendment. This would make it difficult for the House conferees to accept the item in conference should the Senate see fit to include it in their Appendix authorization bill. At this time. therefore. I desire only to register my views and to urge the House conferees to give favorable consideration to the crane item should it be brought up in conference.

Since this section would only be giving to the District of Columbia the same rights of urban renewal that are already enjoyed by every other city in the United States.

The United States greatest cold war triumph was won last October when President Kennedy. with his firm. determined. and unyielding attitude toward Khrushchev and toward the missile and offensive airplane buildup in Cuba. compelled Premier Khrushchev to turn tail and withdraw those offensive weapons from that little island. The Soviet Union would be at a great disadvantage were it to wage a war against us based on Cuba. It must have been in the realization of that fact that Khrushchev wrote those hysterical letters to our President following last October 20. yielded altogether. and withdrew the offensive missiles at that time. The Soviet Union would be at an even greater disadvantage than we would be were we compelled to wage a war against Red China or the Soviet Union in South Vietnam or Laos. Former President Eisenhower recently said that Americans should support the Kennedy administrations Cuban policy. The facts are that our Government officials have more information than is available to others. Furthermore. our forces at Guantanamo Naval Base and our airpower could readily destroy all of Castros military installations. war planes. and artillery in 1 dayprobably in one strikeand. incidentally. kill many Cuban civilians women. and children. as well as men. in the process. Our Government is doing everything against Cuba short of a shooting war. Our U2 planes continue constant surveillance. and all photographs are examined minutely for possible Soviet missiles and military buildups.",

We have already succeeded in cutting off much of the trade between Cuba and. the free world. We have at this time what we did not have at the time of the Bay of Pigswe have the complete cooperation and support of the Organization of American States. No Americans are losing their lives in the process. as some would surely lose their lives were we to use our tremendous armed might to wipe out all the strength Castro has. to singe his whiskers. and send him fleeing from Cuba if he had the opportunity to do so. We have the cooperation of our friends and allies. We are engaged in a tough economic quarantine of Cuba. and we are doing everything short of war to suppress the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere and to end the tyranny of Castro in Cuba. At the same time no American lives are being lost. The policy of this Government toward Cuba deserves the support of the American people.",

Comparing todays nuclearpowered submarines that roam the seas at will with the Holland which did not have any sea going ability is like comparing two different worlds.

In formally acknowledging the current formidability of the American submarine capability. In World Wars I and II the submarine was regarded as the most dread of instruments of war. Striking silently and mercilessly. the submarines of both the Allies and Axis countries took their toll. In the past war years. the submarine has assumed a new capability and in fact has become a political instrument. No longer does world peace necessarily have to depend on ententes and detentes. on alliances and mutual security pacts. At the present time. armed. loaded ICBMs. whether housed in a silo in the peaceful Sierra Nevadas or encased in the belly of a Polaris SSBN lying at the bottom of the Atlantic. are a complete balance of power with the hundreds of ICBMs dug into the Siberian hillsides. The United States now has in service 18 Polaris submarines and will have a total complement of 41 near the end of 1965. Seven of these vessels will have been constructed at my home shipyard of Mare Island at Vallejo. Calif. The people of my congressional district are proud of their part in the construction of these vessels--constructed not as instruments of war. but as instruments of peace. This Nation and the world have experienced the peace provided by weakness--this is a peace that endures only so long as international gangsters are not on the scene. We have experienced substantial peace now in the world for nearly 20 years. This peace has been kept in balance by power and capability clearly disclosed and used with discretion by both the Soviets and ourselves. When the annals of our time record the significant events which have motivated our social and political life. I believe the Polaris submarine will play an important part.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. our foreign aid authorization bill conference report has now been accepted by the House and sent to the Senate for their action. This brings to mind our many struggles over the years to bring our foreign aid program into some semblance of orderand enable the American taxpayer who foots the bill for this aid to receive at least a modicum of assurance that it is money well spent. This the foreign aid program obviously has failed to do. and the American public has become aware of this and made the Congress and the administration aware of their feelings. The title of a column written by Jenkin Lloyd Jones \"Our Brothers Keeper.\" which appeared in the Washington Star yesterday. December 9. 1963. reminded me of another and perhaps more apropos Biblical parable about the man traveling to a far country who gave one servant five talents. another two. and another one. according to his several ability. Upon his return he found that the one given the five talents had traded and made them into five other talents. The one with two talents did likewise. The one with one talent was afraid and hid his talent in the ground and could only return the one talent to his master. The master praised those of his servants who had made good use of their talents and took away from the one who hadhoarded his talent. what he had given him. I believe you will understand why I thought of this story when I read Mr. Jones column. It is an excellent presentation of the attitude of the general American public to our past foreign aid operations. I think it deserves the attention of the Congress. and would like to ask unanimous consent that it be included with my remarks today.

That question is entirely apart from the proposed Knowles Dam. The Missouri River basin is important to Montana. It covers twothirds of our State. Knowles is in the Columbia River Basin in the western part of the State. That project also is important.

Furthermore. I felt it should go through the \"due process\" of conference and/or further discussion on the floor. There is considerable question in my mind about the cost as set forth on pages 4 and 5. in the language that was added to this bill by the other body. for example. wherein it says. \"to take by lease. gift. purchase. grant. or otherwise from any public body.\" It just happens that on the same day that we had this up on the floor of the House. and I objected to it. we also had a supplemental or a socalled deficiency appropriation bill before the House which involved several thousands of dollars for the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial Foundation. and even for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Foundation. It seems obvious thenthat this will thereby. under these terms of new language reference. eventually cost the taxpayers a considerable amount of money. I would like to hear from the committee or from the proponents of the bill such explanation as they have. I do have a serious question about the meaning of the term that has been added \"international good will.\" Furthermore on page 3 of the bill it sets forth specifically that additional persons may be appointed by the President at any time and. finally. on page 10 it says that the report shall not be printed as a public documentand this pertains to an audit.

The South in former years was an underdeveloped area of our country. but in the last few years great changes have been taking place. It is significant that the great timber resources in the South have played an important role in the development of new industry and increased income for our local citizens. In addition. private industry has taken the lead in promoting conservation and planting programs and have been ever conscious that these important forest resources should be not only utilized but that landowners should be encouraged to do even more to increase the supply of these resources. Up until this time. timber landowners have been given additional incentive under the Internal Revenue Code by being able to apply capital gains tax treatment on certain sales of timber. but now the Secretary of Treasury proposes to change these tax laws and in effect breaking faith with those who have participated in reforestation and conservation projects. The North Carolina General Assembly recently passed a joint resolution petitioning the Congress of the United States to defeat and reject the extreme and harmful changes in timber taxation proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury. I wish to call to the attention of the House the resolution as follows:",

Libraries all over the country will this week display various exhibitions and stress the great importance of reading. The freedomtoread. Mr. Speaker. is one of the great freedoms the human being possesses. On this week particularly. I recall the many great libraries that exist in the First District of Massachusetts. one of the Nations great areas of academic accomplishment. From the beautiful Berkshire hills of Pittsfield to the great urban city of Holyoke. citizens of my district daily take. advantage of our great libraries. In a city like Northampton. for example. the Calvin Coolidge Room attracts visitors from all over the Nation at the great Forbes library. In Amherst. at the Jones library. we have the finest collection of Robert Frost material extant and on and on. I could name libraries for almost every community. I have visited most of them and have been greatly impressed. This week then. Mr. Speaker. is a great historic week not only in my district but in the entire Nation.

I say this because I see where President Eisenhower. yesterday. in Cleveland at the Governors conference urged a constitutional amendment to give the President power to veto individual items in Federal appropriation bills. Of course. the idea of a method of cutting out funds for pork barrel projects is attractive. and in fact I myself once introduced legislation to accomplish this very purpose. But. Mr. Speaker. after being around Washington. D.C.. for nearly 12 years I recognize the dangers inherent in this otherwise or seemingly desirable proposal. I have seen the results of walks in the White House rose garden. and realize that a President with this item veto power could bludgeon individual Members of Congress so that the independence and integrity of the legislative branch could be destroyed. Such power to influence Members of Congress should never be placed in the hands of any President. nor should the constitutional authority of the legislative branch ever be further limited. Mr. Speaker. this is what James Madison in the Federalist once warned could lead to tyranny. The Founding Fathers placed spending of the taxpayers money under the control of that body of public servants closest to the peoplethe House of Representativeswhose Members are directly answerable to the people for their actions every 2 years. Any suggestions to weaken that provision of the Constitution. in my opinion. should be strongly opposed. The same is true at the State level. For example. the Governor of my State last year. under this veto power. struck out funds for a legislative investigation of his own administration and especially the State liquor board.

It seems to me that on the occasion when we are discussing and debating the Foreign Assistance Act of 1964 we should give sober reflection to our deliberation before we once again give a blank check to the Presidents request for funds. I feel it the proper time for the Congress to regain some control over our aid program. What better time than now? There are very few who are completely opposed to all foreign aid. but certainly the administration of this program the past few years has failed miserably. To state that there has been waste and deficiencies is putting it mildly. It occurs to me we have failed miserably in helping those who need it mostcertainly we are not helping at the grassroots level.

House Resolution 742 provides for consideration of H.R. 11380. a bill to amend further the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. as amended. and for other purposes. The resolution provides an open rule. waiving points of order. with 4 hours of general debate. H.R. 11380 authorizes the appropriations of $2.041.600.000 of new money to carry on the foreign assistance program for fiscal 1965. This is the full amount requested by the President and. together with authorizations previously enacted. provides the authority for the appropriation of $3.516.700.000 for foreign aid for the coming fiscal year. The fact that the President has requested approximately $1 billion less for foreign aid than was requested for fiscal 1964 does not indicate that providing assistance to other nations is any less essential to the implementation of our foreign policy or to the maintenance of our security than in previous years. U.S. defense strategy is based on the presence in nations which are face to face with Communist territory of mihtary forces sufficient in number and equipment to convince the Communist dictators that they can gain no easy or cheap victories by military action. Except for the major countries of Western Europe. the existence of such forces depends on U.S. aid. The continued material and cultural advance of the less developed countries as independent states is dependent on the availability to them of U.S. capital. technical assistance. and encouragement. Subsequent to the sharp cut in foreign aid funds for fiscal 1964. the scope of the foreign assistance program has been curtailed and its administration improved. Even though our problems in the field of foreign relations and the threats to our security remain acute. the more restrictive policies and procedures inaugurated last year have not been relaxed. It is believed that it would impose an unjustified handicap on those responsible for our defense and for the conduct of our foreign policy to authorize a smaller amount. Mr. Speaker.

The measure carries new money for a total authorization of $2.041.600.000 for the foreign assistance program for the fiscal year 1965 which starts July 1.

I believe. slightly more than actually appropriated by the Congress for the present fiscal year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I should like to read into the RECORD some of the testimony which was given to the House Committee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia in its consideration of the appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1963. The testimony to which I allude was with regard to an AFDCUP program for the District of Columbia. Commissioner Duncan saidand I am quoting him out of context: We have had a very good reason for not having attempted to adopt certain of these programs. Frankly. Mr. Chairman. I am quick to say it has been money. With regard to the presence of paramours. Commissioner Duncan said: I do not believe that any person who genuinely believes in good government would want to see the taxes of a people spent on a person who was in total violation of our laws. living in the home. sharing in the food. the rent. and even in some cases sharing in the funds going into that home. I do not mean to imply that Commissioner Duncan is not supporting the program. He does support the program. He made the point then and there18 months agothat the District of Columbia had a money problem. It still has a money problem. and I do not believe that facts justify the inception of another costly welfare program. Mr. Shea. in his testimony before Representative NATCHER. said: There are 15 States now participating in this type of program. Mr. President. today. 18 months later. there are still 15 States participating in this program. If it is so good. why have not more States begun to participate in it? Mr. Shea indicated at that time that the total cost of grants and administration in the first year of the proposed program was estimated at $1.312.000. It is interesting to note a question which Representative NATCHER asked of Mr. Shea. Representative NATCHER said: Mr. Shea. this statement you make to the committee to the effect that a firmer estimate may result in different figures. how different could the figures be? Would they be different to the extent that instead of the Districts portion being $1.312.000. that it is possible it would be $3 million?",

There was a miscalculation in the estimates for the programa miscalculation that was brought out under questioning. That incident indicates that the Department is unprepared to give Congress a firm estimate of the cost of the program. Whereas last year Mr. Shea said the program would cost $1.3 million the first year. it is said now that the cost would be $2.577.271 for the first year. which is twice as much as the estimate last year. Yet the estimate this year was based upon the same sample survey conducted by the Department in July of last year and upon which it made its estimate at that time. So. what are we to believe? Is the total cost to be $1.3 million the first year. or is it to be $2.5 million? I do not propose to go into the program with my eyes shut. Moreover. Mr. President. the cost of such a program would be higher per recipient than that of the present ADC program.",

Last year. the parimutuel turnover in West Virginia hit $91 million from which the State derived almost $6 million in revenue. But this was only a small part of the action. Illegal gambling was the real big action. Offtrack betting alone. on the basis of the estimates presented to the McClellan committee. reached a level of more than $500 million in 1962. This figure must be doubled in order to ascertain the sum total of all kinds of illegal gambling in West Virginia. It can be estimated that illicit gambling in that State stands at a billion dollars a year. The gambling syndicates. Mr. Speaker. hang on to about 10 percent of this loot as gross profit-$100 million. Money that could be used to rebuild West Virginias sagging economy is being sucked into gangster coffers because of the hypocritical ignorance of those who refuse to recognize the natural gambling urge of the people. Part of these profits go to corrupt law enforcement and governmental process. The moralist contingent has been the greatest benefactors of the States underworld gravy trainjust as the bluenose prohibitionists were the gullible patsies of the bootleggers. I wonder if the West Virginia congressional delegation is aware of the extent to which their States economy is being bled for the comfort of the vice lords?

Mr. Speaker. that there was no attempt made to provide safeguards to the domestic oil industry when the Reciprocal Trade Act was passed back in 1962. Certain Democrats were assured that if they did not support an amendment to the trade bill. the administration would take necessary administrative action to place some reasonable limitation on the importation of foreign crude and residual oil. The administration did make good on this commitment. for the sum total of 60 days. Certain exemptions were then written into the oil import program. and the Kansas oil industry has deteriorated each day since.

Another point on which there was considerable controversy. and I believe a great amount of concern in this Chamber. is the question of the interest to be charged upon loans. Members will recall that by amendment on the floor of this House we established a 2percent rate on interest. The other body established also a 2percent rate on interest with certain additional modifications. First. it provided a 5year grace period. Secondly. it provided that there should be a limitation of 35 years with respect to any loan. Out of these two provisions the conferees bring in today a proposal which gives a 10year grace period with interest during that period at the rate of threequarters of 1 percent and then thereafter a rate of 2 percent. excepting matters already now negotiated. with no time limit at all upon loans. Therefore. Members will immediately see that upon this rather important point there was a very great relaxation over the position which had been taken previously by this House. Next there was a group of amendments relating generally to the area of private enterprise and its encouragement. Some of those had been added on the floor. some of them had been added in the committee. As to those. generally. there was not much controversy. Some rather small modifications were made but by and large I think it can be said that the conference report treats rather well the private enterprise sector of our economy and notes by its action in presenting this report that we do have a concern not only for the private sector of our economy but also for the fact that if such programs as the Alliance for Progress are to be successful great reliance must be placed upon the participation of the private sector.

His efforts are reflected in the fact that of the 80 points of difference between the House and Senate versions the House conferees come back with nearly 75 percent of the differences resolved in favor of the House. This record speaks very well of the efforts of the House conferees led by our able chairman. Further. I do want to comment on the mostfavorednations treatment provision. The distinguished gentleman from Illinois . I. and all of us want to see countries under Soviet domination liberated. There may be several ways of accomplishing this development. No one advocates war. In my opinion a desirable way Is to prevent their dependence on the Kremlin. One way of liberating them. Is to bring the satellite countries on a trade basis closer to the free world. The discretionary authority provided in the conference report is vital to the implementation of the efforts to bring about the liberation of the countries of Eastern Europe. That is the reason the House conferees acceded to the Senate version as amended by the House conferees to limit trade concessions to Poland and Yugoslavia. Lastly.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. although I did not support this legislation in its final passage by the House earlier this year. I feel strongly that it was much more desirable than the compromise legislation presented to us today as a result of the conference with the Senate. In its present form. H.R. 7885 abandons many of the longoverdue reforms called for in the bill as it originally. passed the House. In fact. much of the original insistence by the House that the foreign aid program be tightened up has been watered down. There is little or no hope in this bill that meaningful congressional control will be reasserted. Basically. the broad powers of the administrators of the foreign aid program. which were under such deserved attack on this floor. are now quietly sustained. The old arguments that \"flexibility of policy\" is required. have been used to cover a complexity of maladministration in the past. In acceding to the Senates larger grant of authority and discretion to the White House and the administrators of this program. we are perpetuating the same powers which have existed so long. I still believe the Congress should demand reasonable standards of administration and that the discretionary powers should be sharply limited. These restrictions should certainly include a statement of congressional policy with respect to trade and aid with and to Communist countries. The compromise which perpetuates mostfavorednation treatment to Communist Poland and Yugoslavia is. in my opinion. unsupportable. This bill adds $100 million to the funds originally authorized by the House. Important as this issue is. of even greater importance is the fact that in so many of its details. the bill concedes too much and recedes too far from the principles that guided the House a few months ago. If we agree to this report. we will be evading again the responsibilities that are clearly ours to force the reforms in foreign aid that we know must be made and which we know the American people are demanding.",

This bill would alleviate this situation by providing that when 10 years have elapsed since the last communication received about any such unclaimed moneys. such funds shall accrue to the credit of the District. Prior to this transfer of such funds. however. a final effort must be made to notify the persons entitled to the return of these moneys. It is estimated that approximately 1.000 such accounts. totaling in the aggregate some $25.000. could be closed out immediately if this legislation is enacted. with a substantial saving in manhours of clerical work and badly needed recordkeeping space.

I would suggest that the Members may want to look at that section as I read the existing law. section 222801 of the District of Columbia Code. It reads as follows: Whoever has carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will. or carnally knows and abuses a female child under sixteen years of age shall be Imprisoned for not more than thirty years: Provided. That in any case of rape the Jury may add to their verdict if it be guilty the words \"with the death penalty\". in which case the punishment shall be death by electrocution. provided further. That if the jury fails to agree as to the punishment the verdict of guilty shall be received and the punishment shall be imprisonment as provided in this section. So the current. existing law has this 16yearage proposition. It also has the possible death penalty if the Jury recommends it. which is in the bill we have before us. The only change substantially that the bill would make in the present law would be that we would strike out \"thirty years\" and insert \"life imprisonment\" or possible electrocution as punishment. whereas now the choice is between not more than 30 years or execution. As I understand the amendment offered by the gentleman. his suggestion is that we would now provide that the jury would by unanimous vote have to recommend the death penalty. and that is the only import of his amendment.",

It focuses on only 9 countries of the worldout of the more than 100 which have received U.S. economic aid in the last 15 years. It fails to present any of the U.S. foreign policy objectives for which the foreign aid programs have been authorized by Congress. Mr. Speaker. this article needs to be answered. An excellent answer has been brought to my attention and I want to share it with my colleagues. Mr. Speaker. foreign aid. both economic and military. is directed toward a single goal: to assist other countries that seek to retain their independence and develop into selfsupporting nations. Since the midpoint of World War II. the United States has recognized 49 nations as becoming newly independent. Not one has chosen a Communist form of government and not one has become a member of the SinoSoviet bloc. Fourteen countries which formerly received economic aid from the Agency for International Developmentor its predecessorsare no longer dependent on U.S. asistance and are now selfsupporting. Another 10 countries have shown substantial economic growth--over 1.5 percent per year per capitaand are approaching the stage when U.S. aid programs can be discontinued. The security of the United States is clearly diminished when other countries fall under Communist domination. or break all ties with the free world. U.S. aid programs are intended to make this possibility less likely and the major share of aid programs has been directed to countries directly menaced by Communist aggression. external or internal. The Readers Digest article. even in its limited treatment of foreign aid. contains numerous statements which are misleading or erroneous. It was. in fact. labeled a clever collection of distortion. halftruth. and innuendo\" by the distinguished gentleman from Michigan [Mr. STAEBLERI. in a speech on this floor The following facts should be considered in forming conclusions based on the Digest article.",

That process is proceeding very actively. Also more and more American companies can do their financing abroad for their own enterprises abroad. The interest equalization tax bill would exempt direct investments abroad. so we would not reach that area under the bill. Other ways to improve our balance of payments are: expansion of our exports. and we are doing pretty well in that direction. As I have said. we have a $6.25 billion export surplus indicated for this year. also we have cut down very materially already in foreign procurement of military goods and expenditures of all kinds for American personnel abroad. We need to get very much more aid from our allies in terms of foreign aid. both military and economic. We are doing pretty well in the struggle which we are waging. but not as well as we should. The Senator from Ohio has referred to increased tourism. We are derelict in not expending the necessary amount of money to encourage more tourism to the United States. We cannot get more than a few million dollars from the Congress. although it is understood that hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures for tourism are made by countries abroad. Finally. our tourists spend abroad about $3 billion. There is no limitation whatever upon spending by American tourists abroad. Almost every country in the world has a limitation on spending by foreign tourists in the United States. Those are some of the factors. There are many more.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the question raised by the amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from New York is not whether the United States will have to be the banker to the free world. but whether it will be a prudent banker to the free world. This. it seems to me. was the thrust of the able speech which the distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana has made. Our country must not only husband its resources. but be its own counselor and be the master of the distribution of those resources. I use \"distribution\" in this sense. not as referring to a gift. but in its sense of reality. and to resources whether by way of loan or by way of investment. The senior Senator from New York is experienced and able in this field. as well as in many other fields. However. it seems to me that the experience he has had and the ability which he possesses should lead him to the conclusion that entirely voluntary action is an unreliable safeguard. Indeed. it is no safeguard at all. The Senator rightly points out that a number of exemptions are provided in the bill. and that those exemptions will permit the outflow of capital which is sought to be precluded by the proposed tax. The remedy is to eliminate the exemptions. not to render the whole bill meaningless by placing reliance exclusively upon voluntary compliance. Therefore I hope the Senate will reject the amendment of the distinguished senior Senator from New York. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

On the contrary. the advantage will still be with the flotation in this market. The tax will not diminish the flow of investment which moves abroad out of the United States but will. on the contrary. have a deleterious effect. which I have described. on the American banking position. This is borne out by Secretary Dillon himself. In a letter to me dated May 28. 1963. he said: Even if longterm interest rates rose above those in Europe and Japan. we would expect foreign governments and corporations. particularly those needing relatively large amounts of money. to resort to the highly developed U.S. market. It seems to me that that is a direct admission by the Secretary of the Treasury as to the inability of this particular bill to have the effect which is claimed for it. I have already pointed out the fact that the interest rate differential would still leave the interest rate in the United States lower. In addition. underwriting costs in Europe are considerably higher than in the United States. This is a third reason why borrowing would continue to be pursued in this country. Furthermore. a decrease in the U.S. capital supplied to foreign markets would result in an increase in demand for foreign capital and a pressure for higher interest rates abroad. While the interest rate spread between the United States and Europe initially would be reduced by approximately one percentage point under the bill. the spread would probably return to approximately its pretax size after the offsetting increase in foreign rates that would really result. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a table entitled \"Level of LongTerm Rates in Selected Countries.\" based on data supplied by the Federal Reserve Board. to which I have referred. may be printed in the RECORD.",

I defy the Senator to show me how. when this tax will expire in 1965. we are going to prevent the outflow of foreign investments. It is claimed that our gold reserves declined from about $25 billion to $15 billion in the past 7 years. What is here proposed would make it far more likely that foreign creditors would demand payment. because we would have shown ourselves as complete amateurs. The Senator gave the analogy of the bank. I believe I know something about banking. A bank does not impose a tax on the withdrawal of money. A bank may have to limit withdrawals. as this country could have done had Congress so provided. It has not decided to impose direct controls on the outflow of capital. This is done by other countries. Practically every other country has controls over capital fluctuations.

Looking to the future. it will result in an improvement. on an average. of $1.5 billion a year. The Senator from New York may describe this as being an \"amateur hour.\" but as between the various contending points of view. we have to look to advisers in the international finance field. and I do not know who could pose as a professional any more successfully than Secretary Dillon. He has been in the field his entire adult life. I am sure he is as good in this field as anyone else. This is as mild a measure as has been proposed by anyone in the executive branch.

Of course. our balanceofpayments deficit increased during the second quarter of 1963. but it had gone up on other occasions also. Perhaps we should not be discussing this bill at all. because the present imbalance in U.S. international payments. for the first quarter of 1964. is only $168 million. and it has been going at that rate. It seems to me that we have done a brilliant job on that basis. because the inhibition that the Senator speaks about is not an inhibition at all. What we have lost in peas we have gained in bananas. We have cut off foreign investment in this country. which normally takes $700 million or $800 million of American money. I am not talking about the total flotation.

It provides for an acrosstheboard tax of 15 percent on foreign stocks. and a sliding scale of tax varying from 2.75 to 15 percent on debt obligations. depending on their maturity. If we have regulation. the regulation which I suggest might sound tougher. but it is much more practical and much more likely to reduce the amount of interference with the capital market. We often get a statute that is so inflexible that no one can do anything about it. The situation continually changes. The control over it. of course. is in the hands of Congress. We can repeal the statute if we are dissatisfied with the way in which such authority is being administered. We can hold the Secretary to account. as we often do. But the theory of the amendment requires this flexibility. The theory of the amendment is to protect us against runaway dollars over. above. and beyond what we are willing to have go into foreign investments.

For example. if the balanceofpayments deficit exceeds a certain figure. he can lower it. And if the balanceofpayment deficit drops below a certain figure. he can raise it. But there is no standard whatsoever provided in this delegation of power. All the provision provides is that the Secretary or his delegate may from time to time by regulation decrease or increase the percentage. Nothing is said about conditions or circumstances.

We must look upon vocational education as one means of meeting the need for specialization. as one way of preparing our youth for the more diversified labor market of tomorrow. In short. vocational training is one means of preparing our young people for useful roles in modern society. Mr. President. I should like to make one final plea for my amendment. a plea for more resources In vocational education. In this era. when a diploma does not guarantee a job.let us fully implement this program designed to see that each student is \"jobtrained.\" \"Jobtrained\" with the skills needed today and tomorrow. Let us insist that the vocational programs of this country be large enough to do the job. Let us not be satisfied with half a loaf. We must not be content to send a boy to do a mans workunless. of course. he has been trained In the best skills our great countrys resources can provide.",

The reason why I proposed this amendment in all seriousness was that it seemed to me that this is one area where. by investing more money in resources. we have better than a 5050 chance to get more than our money back. As I pointed out. the State and local governments spend $4 for every $1 spent by the Federal Government. and of course the Senator from Oregon is aware of that. I appreciate his counseling with me on this matter. I hope that. under his leadership. his subcommittee will consider my amendment. The Senator from Oregon will note that my amendment for this year called for the same allocation of funds that his illustrious subcommittee proposed. but I felt that if we could assimilate this large an increase the first year. we could assimilate with great ease additional increments. until finally. in a 4year period. ire reached what the Presidents advisers have said we could have and should have reached this year.

It is because of the mushrooming numbers of children and the need for increasing resources plowed into the area of education.

The bill is required to implement the convention and to compensate the property owners and tenants who will be dispossessed as a result of the Chamizal settlement. It is estimated that the $44.9 million authorized to be appropriated under the law will be adequate to compensate the 4.500 people and the established businesses that will have to leave their homes. residences. and places of business to relocate in other areas. The bill was introduced on December 17. 1963. before the Chamizal Convention with Mexico was ratfled. Some support for ratiflcation was based upon the pendency of this compensatory legislation. It is an act of keeping faith by our Government that it be passed at this session of Congress. in order that money be appropriated this year for the purchase of the lands. homes. improvements. and businesses located in the porton of El Chamizal. which will be in Mexico under the convention. The bill would permit families and businesses in the disputed zone. whose progress is stagnated by the convention settlement. to obtain resettlement funds and to move into new areas. to begin the readjustment of their lives. necessitated by the change. The sooner the bill is passed. the sooner we can carry out our obligations under the convention. and the sooner the 4.503 Americans in the Chamizal can find other homes and relocate. Expedition is good government. It keeps our faith at home and abroad. I commend the Committee on Foreign Relations. the leadership of the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Alabama . and the Senate majority leader for their diligence in the hearings and on the floor of the Senate to see to it that justice is done for the 4.500 residents of the Chamizal who are immediately affected by the boundary adjustment.",

Mr. President. I am the sponsor of a bill to provide that 90 percent of these royalties are returned to the State of origin. To me this would provide for a more equitable distribution of this money and would be a positive step in providing State governments with additional revenue to meet their steadily rising expenses.

We receive letters addressed in peculiar ways. which finally reach their destination. thanks to the efficiency of the postal employees. Many people write expressing their views on various Government programs. but only a few are prepared to offer any help. Recently. I received two letters from Long Island constituents expressing opposition to the cut in the foreign aid bill proposed by the House of Representatives. They were most disturbed over this cut not only because of the harmful effect it might have on the economic growth of underdeveloped countries but also because of the tremendous damage it might do to the United States in our struggle against communism. Because these two fine ladies wanted to do more than just write to me. they each sent in a check in the amount of a dollar to be forwarded to the Agency for International Development. I have learned that the Agency for International Development has authority to accept such checks from citizens who wish to help it. Although I suspect it took a good deal of consultation to obtain permission to accept the $2. I believe it will be effective. It is not always possible for all of us tc give practical support to pending legislation. But when it is. it is refreshing and encouraging to have constituents who. Instead of merely expressing their views. take it upon themselves to go the extra mile and offer a little hard cash support for the programs they believe in. These ladies have set a fine example. I hope that. considering the state of the Federal Treasury. their example will be followed by many others. I am sure the Treasury would have no objection if they wished to earmark the money for whatever particular Government project they wished to help. So my congratulations go to these two fine ladies. Mrs. William R. Fleischer. of 120 Elm Drive. and Mrs. Elinor Perkell. of 125 Elm Drive in Roslyn.

The editorial concurs -with the AFLCIOs support of Chairman PATMANS proposals to make the Federal Reserve a genuinely responsible Government agency. Quoting an article in the American Federalist. the official AFLCIO magazine. the editorial warns that the Feds preoccupation with inflation has led to excessively tight money before and is likely to do so again. at a tremendous cost in rising unemployment and declining growth. To prevent such flouting of administration and congressional policies aimed at reducing unemployment and increasIng our rate of economic growth. the AFLCIO proposes that the Open Market Committeethe major policymaking body of the Federal Reservebe abolished and its powers transferred to the Board of Governors. that the terms of the Governors be reduced and that they serve at the will of the President. and that the governing structure of the Reserve banks be made more representative of the Nation as a whole. The Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the Banking and Currency Committee is currently holding hearings on bills introduced by Chairman PATMAN which include many of the AFLCIO recommendations.

I was told personally by many Democrats that the world would come to an end if a Catholic were nominated for President. Many Democrats were convinced their party would be split in two and a Catholic had absolutely no chance to even make a race out of the election. The shock troops were brought in to stop Kennedy. First Senator HUMPHREY led the assault. then former President Truman. and. last. but not least. Lyndon Johnson. No holds were barred. We recall that Mr. Johnson tried to stop J.F.K. by pointing out that Kennedys father had played footsie with the Nazis. Anything and everything was done to stop Kennedy. After the late Presidents victories in the primaries. members of his party began to take him seriously. The panic subsided and in the long run. the religious factor helped rather than hurt. Mr. Speaker. a similar situation developed with respect to the campaign of Senator GOLDWATER although it was not based on a religious issue. Now that the Arizonian has won in California. more and more people are beginning to take him seriously. As Mr. Chuck Dancey points out in his editorial appearing in the Peoria Journal Star of June 5. 1964. more people are taking a closer look at the Senator.

Over the centuries we have seen similar types of experiments fail in other parts of the world as efforts have been made to assure that the people have a voice in their government and that their government be not run by executive fiat or by dictation from authority concentrated in a single source. One of the greatest safeguards in our system. and one of the reasons it has survivedone of the major reasons it has continued to exist is the fact that we have assiduously and jealously maintained a separation between the civilian aspects of our Government and the military aspects. We have over the years indoctrinated in our military forces and in the leaders of our military forces the principle that they must not become involved in the political aspects of American life. It seems to me. the greatest threat that is presented today by this Gesell report and any proposed implementation of that report is the intention and the effort that is being made through that report to bring our miiltary leaders and our military forces into the political arena.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Burundi today celebrates the second anniversary of her independence. We take this opportunity to extend warm felicitations to His Majesty King Wmambutsa IV. and to His Excellency the Burundi Ambassador to the United States. Leon Ndenzako. Burundi is a small kingdom situated in the mountains and plateaus which separate the Nile and Congo River Basins. Its many rivers. two of which are the southernmost sources of the Nile. rise in these mountains to begin their long twisting journey to the sea. The capital. Usumbura. which is a bustling city of 50.000 inhabitants. overlooks Lake Tanganyika. the longest freshwater lake in the world. Most of the trade between this landlocked country and the outside world travels down this body of water to be taken either to Atlantic or Indian Ocean ports. Three different ethnic groups in Burundi live harmoniously together. A small number of pygmies remain. while the overwhelming number are Hutus. who form 85 percent of the population. These industrious people have traditionally been farmers. an occupation that most in Burundi still follow. Since the fifteenth century. their overlords have been the Tutsi. a nomadic. pastoral people of Hamitic origins who migrated to this area from Ethiopia. European influence came late to this land which is nestled far from the oceans. Visits by the great explorers. Speke. Stanley and Livingstone. were soon followed by those of Germans and in the 1880s Germany was given control of Burundi.

Each of us. whatever our individual heritage. shares in the common heritage of liberty. This heritage comes to us as a gift of the Creator. a gift which we have brought to life in America. a gift which we must constantly defend. Today. as for many years. the threat to this heritage is Communist imperialism. which has already blighted half the world. and which recognizes no individual rights but seeks to shackle humanity to the will of a soulless state.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have introduced a bill to authorize the heads of departments and agencies of the Federal Government to deposit amounts due to military and civilian personnel as salary by means of single checks payable to banks and other financial institutions for the accounts of individuals. The bill is intended to facilitate such deposits to the accounts of employees at less cost to the Government. and with greater convenience to the employees. the agencies. and the financial institutions concerned. The mailing of salary checks directly to banks is an entirely voluntary practice which may be requested by employees. and which is in fact used by many personnel for their convenience. In the military services. many officers and enlisted personnel have long requested this service. and frequently the disbursing offices have simply consolidated the amounts due to any individuals who use the same bank. and mailed a single check. Accompanying lists make clear the names and amounts due to each individual. The procedures save the time of distributing checks on the job. of cashing the checks. and the costs of handling and mailing individual checks instead of single ones to banks used by many employes. The bill is necessary to overcome a technical objection of the Comptroller General that payments by this method appear to violate a section of law that requires that a check be written only in favor of the employee. The Comptroller is permitting the current practice to continue in the expectation that this legislation will bring the laws up to date with the improved financial practices that can be achieved with modern data equipment. If the bill is enacted to authorize these procedures by all the agencies of Government. it is expected that the savings in time. cost. and mailing will be available not only to the military departments. but to all agencies and their employees.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the recent debate over the tax cut the administration made widespread use of the concept of the \"full employment budget\" as a tool of analysis designed to demonstrate the magnitude of the \"brake\" on the economy exerted by Federal fiscal policy. In simplest terms. the \"full employment budget\" is intended to show what the budget surplus or deficitnational income accounts basiswould be if the economy were operating at full employment. defined at a constant 4percent unemployment rate. The surplus in the \"full employment budget\" is considered too large when Government spending. plus private spending. is insufficient to bring total output to the full employment level. This was the situation which the administration said existed prior to the recent tax cut. The importance which the administration attached to the concept in the tax cut debate led me to believe that in the future it was likely to be used as an even more important guide to fiscal policy. For that reason I wrote Dr. Walter W. Heller. Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. on February 11. asking a number of questions about the concept and about the administrations assertion that its fiscal program would provide a greater net fiscal stimulus to the economy this year than in any other peacetime year in history. I also asked for estimates of the full employment surplus for 1962. 1963. and 1964. Dr. Heller replied to my letter on April 27. setting forth the information which I requested. I then sent Dr. Hellers reply to Dr. Henry Wallich. professor of economics at Yale University and former member of President Eisenhowers Council. requesting his comment on Dr. Hellers letter. I have now received a reply from Dr. Wallich which is critical of the statistical precision given to the \"full employment budget\" concept by the Council. After summarizing the weaknesses of the concept. Dr. Wallich concludes that it is \"a very much less than adequate description of the effects of a particular budget.\" Because of the light which this correspondence sheds on the \"full employment budget.\" I believe it would be useful if it were brought to the attention of Members of Congress. economists. financial writers. and others.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Area Redevelopment Administration law is so broadly drawn that It makes the Secretary of Commerce--or the ARA Administratora veritable satrap or czar when it comes to designating areas for eligibility. Last July Under Secretary of Commerce Franklin D. Roosevelt. Jr.. told the House that the Administrator already had the authority to group contiguous counties which were not hard up with counties which were. This was so that special. particular counties could be tied into a single neat redevelopment area. The ARA calls this \"rounding out\" an economic area. The truth of the matter is. however. that after the ARA got through with its first frenzy of designation. it turned out that some counties failed to qualify even under the loose criteria ARA was using. This put some Congressmen. who had voted for the legislation and promised their constituents lavish benefits. \"on the spot.\" So. the new \"rounding out\" technique was concocted. Under this scheme. the ARA claimed the right to \"depress\" a county. or series of counties. if it touched counties already eligible under the rationale that the group of counties constitute a single economic unit and ARA assistance to a \"rounded out\" county would benefit the unemployment and underemployment in the contiguous areas. By this scheme. 24 more counties were added to the dole. But. like the little boy with jam on his face and a guilty conscience. ARA went back to Congress and asked the legislation to give it authority which it claimed it already had. The change in the law. said F.D.R. Jr.. \"merely makes more explicit the authority and discretion the Administrator already has.\" For once. thank heaven. Congress had the courage and foresight to say \"No.\" But the ARA still carries those 24 counties on the dole. Congress should investigate these techniques before it permits the Area Redevelopment Administration to continue.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. another of the important independence days of those many oppressed nations behind the Iron Curtain is being celebrated this Sunday. May 10. This Is Rumanian Independence Day. the most important national holiday for all free Rumanians. It is sad indeed that the Rumanian people themselves cannot celebrate their own national independence day. That is one of the penalties of living under communism. While we here freely express our admiration for Rumanias independence. Rumanians themselves must not celebrate. Their recognition is limited to a silent word in their own hearts and clandestine listening to the celebrations in free countries over the radio. Rumania enjoyed many centuries of independent growth. it was for two centuries a Roman province. From this came the modern name of Rumania. and the romance language which Rumanians sbeak. In the middle of the last century the forces began shaping which led to the pronouncement of Rumanian independence on May 10. 1877. The people were sick of many years of cruel invasion and oppressions. first from one side then from the other. During the years when our Nation was engaged in a great civil war. Rumanian leaders were fighting to free their country from RussianTurkish domination and an archaic feudal land sytem. Much progress was made by autonomous Rumania under King Alexandru Cuza between 1859 and 1866. On that memorable day in 1877. the Rumanian people demanded and got their rightful independence. It was duly recognized by all the great powers in 1888 in reward for Rumanias gallant fight against the Ottoman empire. This is the event which rightly holds an important place in Rumanian loyalties. It inaugurated the greatest period of progress in Rumanian history. which was drastically altered In World War II. and shattered completely when the Communists came to power in 1947. Today the very event which founded Rumania as a nation. and the great courage of Rumanias leaders of 1877. are denied to A2281 the people by the Communists. It is well to remember Rumanian Independence Day here. to add our voices to the great outcry demanding Rumanias freedom. In this way we can encourage RumanianAmericans as well as the Rumanian people to carry on the struggle against tyranny with a view to making it over again an independent nation.

At his death he was the executive director. editor. and moving spirit of the Wilderness Society. a national. nonprofit. conservation organization with approximately 27.000 members from all States of the Union as well as some foreign countries. Of Howard Zahniser I think It can be truly said that he was a dedicated servant of the public. even though he was not in the employ of a Government agency. He always stood for that which he thought was in the public good and even though he and I had our differences of opinion I think we always understood each other and respected those opinions. As so frequently happens. Howard did not live to see the fulfillment of one of his prime projects: The legislative establishment of a National Wilderness Preservation System. However. he knew that his main battle had been won and when he and I talked just last Thursday he spoke with great feeling and utmost concern lest some outside disruptive forces might upset the conciliatory attitude pointing toward compromise legislation that was In evidence in the hearings conducted throughout last week by the Subcommittee on Public Lands of our Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. We will miss Howard Zahniser. we will miss his guidance and we will miss his fellowship. but. if we do all work together now and ignore those who have other axes to grind. we can. I trust. agree on legislation for the preservation of some of our wilderness areas. in a manner that will be in the national interest without forsaking regional and local interests. as a lasting memorial to the work of Howard Zahniser.

Then he shall issue marketing certificates representing the amount of wheat to be eligible for sale. In other words the domestic quantity of wheat. Then. of course. the balance of the wheat will be socalled feed wheat and shall receive a feed price.

Now we get into many areas here where we can differ. I would point out though. that under the program after 1965 the Secretary still has the authority to require a farmer to divert acres but there is no authority for payment for these diverted acres.

If the .$2 price objective .is only 80 percent of the established parity price. I wonder if there are many farmers who would raise any wheat for the low support price of $1.30. I suppose if anyone can produce wheat at that price. the western Kansas farmers can do it. Is that correct?",

    "speech": "This is relatively correct. yes. but under this program of course. we can only produce so much at $1.30. Which is another difference between this and what they originally talked about as the McNaryHaugen bill thats been around for about 40 years. and turned down by Hoover. Roosevelt. Truman. and Eisenhower. and of course vetoed originally by Mr. Coolidge. And I think we should point out. too. that 100 percent of parity is $2.49. and as you pointed out. $2 is around 80 percent of parity. Now I call this the 8080 bill. You get 80 percent of parity for 80 percent of your production. And on the balance you get 52 percent of parity. I remember very well the promises of President Kennedy when he was campaigning. about 90 percent of parity for the basic commodities. And I dont know of any. in fact there arent any basic commodities now receiving as much as 90 percent of parity. And this brings to me. I think. a very significant difference between the present bill. the one the farmers will vote on. and the one weve talked about in the past. In fact. one that Clifford Hope from my district. a member of the Agriculture Committee for 30 years and a wellrespected Meinber of Congress. has long supported. which was called the domestic parity bill. Under this present 1964 program. we also have. in addition to bushel controls. acreage controls. So the farmer isnt free to plant all the wheat he wants. He can only plant so many acres. He must stay within his allotment. or hes subject to penalties and marketing quotas. I think. when we talk about the income to the farmer In the 1964 program. he just cant possibly maintain the income he had been receiving before. And from this standpoint. while the farmers of western Kansas would certainly raise all the wheat they could at $1.30. they cant do this under this program.",

I think. as the 1964 program. The only major change for later years Is the diversion payments are not authorized after 1965. However. it seems to me the income can still be maintained under the program because the Secretary of Agriculture is required to set price support at a level and quantities In a manner which will achieve the income objective of the farmer. And I would like to continue in this vein to say that the figures that have been quoted this morning I am sure are correct in saying that the price for wheat will be in the neighborhood of $1.30. assuming that the farmers stay within their allotments that have already been assigned. Now. if as many as 65 million acres of wheat are planted. like the Secretary and some of the figures in the Department have indicated they feel will be the case. then there will be so many farmers planting over and above and disregarding their allotment. and for that wheat there will be no price support. that then there could be dollar wheat for a large portion of our wheat. Now Im not saying that to be argumentative. I think it is only fair to point out that if the allotments are disregarded. then there will be a lot of wheat. very likely. that Is as low as $1 or in that neighborhood.",

This Is the least that the Secretary can release surplus stocks on the market. And under section 407 of the 1949 act of course. he can strengthen the market if he wants to by raising this figure.

So our farmers could sell their wheat on the world market. without benefit of any program at all.

Then it goes on in the next paragraph to say that its between $2 and $1 wheat. This is the 1964 referendum. And these are the types of things I think have been unfair. It denies the farmer the freedom of choice that hes entitled to in the referendum.

After the Baltic States were forced to join the Soviet Union in 1940 under pressure of Russian troops. a reign of terror was unleashed on the peaceful citizens of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. The Soviet Union tried to impose its own way of life upon the Baltic peoples. and when these efforts met with resistance. thousands who were opposed to the Soviet experiment were subjected to exile. deportation. execution. and imprisonment. What started as- a program of bringing schools. government. transportation. and banks under Soviet control ended with plans to transplant wholesale all the Baltic peoples into Russia. The deportations reached their peaks during a 5day period starting June 14. 1941. During these few days. thousands of Lithuanians. Latvians. and Estonians were arrested and deported to the interior of Russia. This crime against humanity was not accepted without resistance. Revolts fomented by underground groups occurred in several cities. a radio station was seized in Lithuania. and. as the rebellion spread. a Lithuanian insurgent government was set up. But the small Baltic States could not withstand the brute force exerted by their mammouth neighbors to the east and west. who were determined to suppress the Baltic States and exploit them in every manner. Mr. Speaker. the Baltic States. like all countries under Communist rule. belong properly to the community of free nations. The ideals of freedom and independence remain alive in the men. women. and children of Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. As we recall the horrors of the mass deportations which occurred 22 years ago today. we firmly vow to leave the lamp of liberty lighted for all people behind the Iron Curtain.

Few men have served so long or so faithfully through a period of such great change and such import in the history of our Nation. One cannot overlook his exceptional personal traits which have endeared him to all who know him. including thousands of unfortunate people who have passed through the gates of the prisons he administered.

Jim Bennett has shed new light on the dual role of punishment and rehabilitation for those who violate the law. . A couple of years ago. Mr. Bennett. himself a native New Englander. wrote a penetrating article on \"The New England Conscience and Prisons.\" which was published in the New Hampshire Bar Journal. I was particularly interested in his statement singling out New Hampshire for having the lowest number of men in prison per 100.000 of population of any State in the Nation.

For a quarter of a century Mr. Bennett has urged and worked for a measure of this kind. which will better assure an adequate defense of indigents accused of Federal crimes. It is both fitting and gratifying that this proposal in which he believed so deeply will become public law within a week of his retirement. Earlier this year the National Penitentiaries Subcommittee compiled a selection of Mr. Bennetts writings and published them under the title \"Of Prisons and Justice.\" The title is most appropriate. for as prisons are his work. justice has been his objective. By perusing the amazing scope of articles. the reader cannot escape the realization that many reforms in the criminal law largely evolved from the forward looking efforts of Mr. Bennett. The book is a remarkable testament to his devotion to the cause of criminal justice. I share the splendid sentiments of the Washington Post as expressed in its recent editorial about Mr. Bennett.

This amendment would amend the Internal Revenue Code to withhold the tax credit provided under section 3302 from maritime employers in States that do not meet the conditions required by section 3305(f) of the code.

I also introduce for appropriate reference a bill containing the same provisions as the amendment. Even though it is not possible to achieve an upgrading of the entire unemployment compensation at this session. enactment of the bill would remove a loophole which results in hardship to many Great Lakes seamen. In 1946 Congress extended coverage under the unemployment compensation system to Great Lakes seamen. Unfortunately. no enforcement provision was included to guarantee that seamen would have the same rights for unemployment benefits as other employees in a maritime firm. The bill and the amendment are designed to correct this situation which results in severe discrimination against Great Lakes seamen. The laws in Minnesota and several other States bordering the Great Lakes are in conformity with the Federal statute but this not true of every State. As a result several thousand Great Lakes seamen are without unemployment compensation coverage during the winter months when their need is greatest.

    "speech": "Mr. President. throughout their history. the people of North Carolina have pioneered on every frontier of life. The career of Mrs. Willye Wright as a librarian in Johnston County. N.C.. illustrates the fact that pioneering is continuing in many facets of life in my State in the 20th century. To my mind. Mrs. Wright has been a modernday Johnny Appleseed. sowing the seeds of learning and stimulating education in Johnston County. It would be. however. impossible to fully assess the salubrious effect Mrs. Wright has had upon the development of our State. She has touched so many lives and they. in turn. so many others. that it is indeed difficult to know the multiplier effect of the outstanding work this great lady has undertaken in rural communities in eastern North Carolina. I am proud of Mrs. Wright and of her eminent contribution to the Nation. and of other pioneers similarly situated. who are continuing to explore and find new ways of making this land of ours a greater and happier place. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD an article and an editorial. from the Smithfield Herald. describing the honors accorded to Mrs. Wright for her lifelong contributions to the education of her community.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I call attention to a fine editorial. from the Nashville Banner calling attention to the fact that we do not have. as lawabiding citizens. any option as to our choice of compliance or noncompliance with regard to the Civil Rights Act. It is essential that we recognize that the very foundations of our Government are based on majority rule. and that it is mandatory that we live in conformity with the wishes of the majority. To attempt any civil disobedience could only weaken our constitutional right of due process of law. As the editorial so eloquently states. we do have at our disposal adequate means to test certain provisions of this measure. and undoubtedly test cases will soon be considered by our courts. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD this fine editorialpublished in the Nashville Banner on July 3. 1964. entitled \"To a LawAbiding People. Compliance Isnt Optional.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I call attention to an editorial. from the Morristown Gazette Mail. reporting on an article. carried in a Presbyterian magazine. which is so absolutely wrong as to be almost ludicrous. Morristown. instead of being. as the article indicated. \"a town which has never had a Negro student who went to college.\" hasto the contrarybeen recognized as a place where literally thousands of Negroes have attended college. As the editorial states. this is just one example of poor reporting on the part of one publication. It certainly gives rise to speculation that there are many other stories equally as false with regard to Negro higher education in the South. I join the editor of the Daily Gazette in deploring the distribution of this type of loose misinformation. and I hope a satisfactory apology and explanation as to this unfortunate and untimely incident will be forthcoming. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have this fine editorial. entitled \"Untruths Dont Help in Race Relations.\" which was published in the Morristown Gazette Mail of July 5. 1964. printed at this point in the RECORD.",
