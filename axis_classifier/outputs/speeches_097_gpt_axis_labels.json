    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on S. 2852. the Student Financial Assistance Technical Amendments Act of 1982. The conference committee on this legislation succeeded in adopting the best provisions from the House passed legislation. H.R. 7048. and the Senate bill. The resulting conference agreement will significantly reduce the confusion surrounding both the Pell grant and guaranteed student loan programs. which has resulted in many students not knowing what aid is available to them. The major provisions of the conference agreement are. first. to establish a Pell grant family contribution schedule in the law for the 198384 academic year. Second. to establish a foolproof mechanism to insure the timely promulgation of the 198485 family contribution schedule. Third. the GSL family contribution schedule for the 198384 academic year is established. Fourth. the Pell grant eligibility of veterans who were denied aid because of a legislative change last year is restored. Fifth and finally. the exemption of Sallie Mae debt from a 1977 bankruptcy statute is extended for 2 years. Mr. Speaker. I am happy to observe that the conferees dropped from the Senate bill the provision most objectionable to the administration. This provision called for the granting of loan consolidation authority to State guarantee agencies participating in the GSL program. This provision was not only costly but also was too complex to adequately consider. given the urgency of this legislation. The compromises incorporated in S. 2852 have resulted in a bill which will not increase Federal expenditures. Perhaps more importantly. the provisions of S. 2852 will result in tremendous improvements in the operation of the Pell grant program. These improvements will result in more reliable information about the availability of student aid being known by lowincome students at a much earlier date than has been the case this year and in the past. Mr. Speaker. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri .",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on S. 2852. to establish a Pell grant family contribution schedule for 198384. Mr. Speaker. this conference agreement has been carefully worked out between the House and the Senate. with both sides and parties concurring fully with the final product. The one controversial provision regarding loan consolidation. which the administration opposed. was removed in conference to the agreement of all conferees. The bill puts in place for next year the formula by which Pell grants are distributed to needy students. In past years the publication and dissemination of this formula has been delayed. thus causing problems for students and their parents. counselors. and colleges. By setting the formula into law now. we can distribute the information in a timely manner to all those involved. and they. in turn. can make their academic plans with advance consideration. This bill does not affect any appropriation or authorization level. it only helps the flow of Pell grant dollars to the students who need them most. I commend my colleagues here and in the other body for taking this matter up promptly and for seeing that lowincome students are served in a timely and efficient manner. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report on S. 2852.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I simply want to rise in support of House Resolution 421 which would create a Select Committee on Children. Youth. and Families. and want to make reference to a California experience. Some 10 years ago. when Congressman GEORGE MILER was a staffer in the California Senate. I had the privilege of carrying a similar resolution to create the Senate Select Committee on Children and Youth. And that committee was born out of an experience I had in visiting a childrens hospital to observe abused children there. The question of abused children was one which was kept among families and was not one which was discussed in the public arena. As a result of the formation of that committee. we had passed in California the Child Abuse Prevention Act. the Early Childhood Education Act. the Childrens Center Construction Act. all of which I might add was signed by a man named Reagan. Governor of California. So the measure had bipartisan support of this President. who was then Governor. The committee also went on to study the question of the runaway child. the handicapped child. the abused child. suicide among children. a number of very important issues affecting children. Today I received a call from California that the select committee is still in operation and was able to get Governor Brown to sign legislation to appropriate $10 million for the abused child. That legislation was signed last Friday. And so I am very pleased to join with my old friend. the gentleman from California (Mr. MiaER). and commend him for initiating this effort. There is one important dimension in this resolution in that it adds familiesunlike the California resolution which dealt with children and youth. But we realized you cannot deal with children and youth without dealing with families as a whole. So I am very pleased to join with my colleagues from California in supporting the creation of this very important select committee.",

Programs for children. youth. and families are legislatively parceled out to a number of committees and because of this. we do not have a single. clear voice that can be a forceful voice on a national level for the best interests of this segment of our population. As one of the original members of the Select Committee on Aging appointed by the Speaker in 1975. I have seen firsthand what our own select committee has accomplished on behalf of the elderly. Ours is a nonpartisan and bipartisan committee committed to the advancement of the quality of life for our Nations seniors. I have every confidence that a Committee on Children. Youth. and Families would be equally as effective. Consider that the lions share of budget cuts which have been made in the past 2 years disproportionately hurt this particular segment of the population.

Children cannot vote and are often inadequately represented in the Congress. It is time that we squarely face the unique problems that have been created for todays families and children. Obviously. I do not feel that the Federal Government should be in the business of running our families. but I do feel a select committee can overcome the division of congressional responsibilities to focus attention on the needs of youth. children. and families. and the support appropriate to the Federal Government. Youth drug and alcohol abuse has undermined the interest in learning by many young people. Adolescent suicide has increased at an alarming rate. Teenage pregnancy has denied many the opportunity to have a normal youth. Juvenile delinquency has sown a plague of vandalism in many of our communities. The burden of inflation has been devastating on the American Family. requiring that in many families. both husband and wife work without being -able to afford child care. The consequence has been unsupervised adolescents who grow up feeling there is no one who cares about them. and assume they have nothing in their lives of value for the future. One of the alarming issues the select committee will address is child abuse. a dark and ugly secret in all too many homes. Children who have been beaten and abused by their parents or guardians are violently denied the protection a child needs to grow up as a confident and socially concerned adult. Whatever we in the Congress can do to support the prevention of problems among children. youth. and families is vital if we are to protect the essence of our future.

Nonetheless. the recent trial of Feliks Serebrov brings to 47 the number of individuals in the Soviet Union tried and imprisoned for attempting to monitor the Soviet Unions performance in meeting its human rights obligations under the Helsinki accords. Although it has been tragic to see the hopes of Helsinki obliterated by the Soviet Unions crackdown on human rights spokesmen and the invasion of Afghanistan. the time and effort that went into formulating the Helsinki accords was anything but wasted. As the New York Times points out. the agreement gave all the participating nations the undeniable right to inquire into each others performance in the area of human rights. Thus. at the various review conferences after Helsinki. the Soviets disgraceful record in this field has been a legitimate topic for discussion. and the Soviets cruel and repressive treatment of their own citizens has been bared for all the world to see. The spirit of Helsinki will remain alive as long as we in the West remember those like Feliks Serebrov who are fighting for human rights behind the Iron Curtain. Mr. President. I ask that the editorial from this mornings New York Times entitled \"Helsinki Rights. Soviet Wrongs\" be printed in the RECORD. The editorial follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there is a slgnificant provision included within the reconciliation bill which is worthy of note as we proceed to final action on this bill. For many years. many citizens have expressed outrage at the policy which has allowed employees to receive food stamps after having walked off their jobs on strike. The Department of Agriculture estimates that taxpayers paid about $20 million per month during the coal strike earlier this year to provide strikers with food stamps. I am pleased that both the Senate reconciliation bill and the House Republican substitute contained identical language which I offered to make such strikers ineligible to participate in the food stamp program. This reform is sure to improve the publics perception of the program whose integrity has been greatly damaged by the current policy of providing food stamps to strikers. The underlying philosophy supporting this change should be clear: Any worker who walks off the job to go on strike has given up the income from that job of his own volition. A person making such a choice. and participating in a strike. must bear the consequences of his decision without assistance from the taxpayers who provide the funds for the food stamp program. Public policy demands an end to the food stamp subsidization of all strikers who become eligible for the program solely through the temporary loss of income during a strike. The public has been demanding this change for many years. I am pleased that the reconciliation process has brought this desire to fruition. Mr. President. Senators will be interested in an article from the Hartford Courant of July 14 by Jay S. Siegel. a Hartford attorney and former chairman of the American Bar Associations section of Labor and Employment Law. outlining in more detail the significance of this change.

It also contains a number of amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act to improve and update the commodity futures regulatory program. The conferees have developed a bill that Is comprehensive and that includes provisions recommended by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. the futures industry. the General Accounting Office. farm organizations. securities regulators. and others. It provides. I believe. a strong framework for the continued improvement of the Federal regulatory effort. The conference report also contains a provision. of importance to our Nations farmers. to guarantee delivery under contracts for the exports of agricultural commodities. Under this provision. except in periods of declared war or national emergency. the President cannot. under a suspension of trade. curtail the exports of agricultural commodities covered by export contracts already signed if the contract calls for delivery within 270 days after the suspension is imposed.

In my view. the language contained in the statement of managers report is inconsistent with this and cannot override the language of the statute.

More than 1 million handicapped children in the United States were excluded entirely from the public schools. prohibiting their inclusion in the educational process and forcing peer isolation. Many handicapped -children throughout the United States participating in regular school programs had handicaps that were undetected. Because of the lack of adequate services within public schools systems. families were frequently forced to find services outside these systems. often at great distance from their residences and at their own expense. There were untold violations of the rights of children and parents with regard to placement and confidentiality of records. and There was a tremendous gap between personnel trained to deliver services to children with severe and lowincidence handicapping conditions and the numbers of children needing these services.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to address the issue of the postal public service subsidy. I want to express my disagreement with the action taken by the Appropriations Committee in the continuing resolution which would have eliminated the $250 million public service subsidy to the U.S. Postal Service. I have in the past and will continue to support the need for this subsidy. which covers the cost of certain uneconomical postal operations6day mail delivery. small post offices. rural mail delivery. window services. and other postal activitiesthat are deemed in the public interest. The Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services. which I chair. recently began a series of public hearings with the Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization. to take a close look at the effectiveness of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. One of the areas we are looking at is how the Postal Service will be affected by the possible elimination of the public service subsidy. Mr. Speaker. frankly I worry about the Appropriations Committees action to accelerate the phased out schedule of this subsidy by its elimination. Last week. Postmaster General Bolger testified before our subcommittees and was questioned closely about the effect on the Postal Service in eliminating this subsidy. He replied that although the Postal Service could absorb these cuts it would most likely lead to increasing postage rates sooner than he had anticipated. This was also the prevailing view presented to the subcommittees by the General Accounting Office. The American people have been complaining about the fact that in the past year they have seen postage rates increase twice. first to 18 cents and more recently to 20 cents. I do not think the people of this Nation will be happy to learn that their rates would be going up again sooner because of the Appropriations Committees proposal to eliminate this subsidy. They want to see their postage rates stabilized for as long as possible. We all realize that at some point the public service subsidy will be eliminated. However. I believe now is not the time to take this action. I support the continuation of this subsidy.e",

Transportation and Tourism is legislation dealing with the relationships between sales representatives and the manufacturers for whom they market products. This bill. the Sales Representatives Protection Act. has been cosponsored by 170 of our colleagues. The subcommittee held a day of hearings on this bill. H.R. 3496. on June 23. Since that time we have received many letters expressing various concerns about this legislation. Among these is a letter from the Federal Trade Commission indicating their lack of support for H.R. 3496. In the interest of providing all parties concerned with this matter a better understanding of the legislation. I am inserting into the RECORD a memorandum commenting on the FTC opinion.

The subcommittee has been reviewing the record of the hearings on this bill with a goal of preparing a series of improving amendments that may produce a broad consensus. This effort will continue next year. and I invite all interested Members to provide us the benefit of their views. The memorandum follows: You have asked for my comments on the FTCs recent letter indicating that while the Commission recognizes that H.R. 3496 provides for salutary and efficient disclosure of pretransaction information between sales representatives and their principals (FTC letter. pages 34). because the commission believes that the bill might create inefficiences and higher prices to the consuming public. it is unable to support its enactment. The reasons which the FTC gives to support its conclusions are basically the same. indeed many of them are in the exact same",

House Concurrent Resolution 192. and Mr. BRINKLEYS bill. House Concurrent Resolution 222. seek to correct this inequity in social security retirement benefits. Mr. Speaker. I have received many letters from constituents who were shocked to learn that they will draw substantially smaller retirement benefits from social security than many of their fellow workers. simply because of a small difference in age. People who are turning 65 and preparing to retire in 1982 find that their social security checks will be as much as $110 a month less than those of workers retiring at 65 this year. Why. they ask. should we get smaller social security checks when we paid the same social security taxes and had the same work records? Simply stated. this sharp disparity in benefits. the socalled notch problem. results from adverse economic conditions unforeseeable when Congress made changes in 1977 in the retirement benefit formula. Although Congress tried to avoid creating a notch problem by providing a transition period from the old formula to the new one. the transition rules did not work as intended. largely as the result of continued inflation. Everyone born in 1917all who turn 65 in 1982. and thereafterwill be sharply and unfairly penalized by the present formula changes. combined with economic conditions. Mr. Speaker. the notch problem needs to be corrected. Indeed. the National Commission on Social Security. after extensive investigation. agreed that this disparity in benefit amounts was unjust and that steps should be taken to resolve it. My bill. House Concurrent Resolution 192. and Mr. BRINKLEYS bill. offer possible solutions. I urge my colleagues to join in resolving this critical problem.o",

Bozick served his country in the Office of Strategic Services. He also attended the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Baltimore School of Law. Soon after Senator Bozick moved to Prince Georges County. he began his career in public life. serving. in 1965 to 1970. as a commissioner. and chairman. of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. The senator also took an active role in reshaping the structure of our county government. serving as a member on the Prince Georges Community Goals Committee and the Prince Georges County Charter Advisory Committee. Mr. Bozick was appointed to the State senate in 1971 and he won reelection in 1974 and 1978. As a State senator. Mr. Bozick won needed funds for Prince Georges County as a member of the prestigious budget and taxation committee.

I have grown increasingly concerned with the ability of the financing mechanism that was established to meet the obligations due by law to our disabled coal miners. The black lung beneficiaries deserve the security of a healthy and stable trust fund for their benefits. and the temporary user taxes imposed by this bill will help to assure that the original intent of the black lung disability trust fund is met. When this fund was established. it was felt that the level of the tonnage charge on coal imposed at that time would be sufficient to cover the costs of the program. However. at the same time the program was substantially expanded. and huge deficits are now projected for the fund if action is not taken. Other language of the bill establishing the average prime rate as the annual interest rate on deficiency payments owed by mine operators to the trust fund is also necessary. Especially in these budgetconscious times. advances to the fund from the Treasury financed by borrowing on the commercial market and being repaid at lower interest rates cannot be justified. An injustice to the coal operators is also corrected in this measure. by allowing the trust fund to assume liability for claims denied prior to. but allowed subsequent to. the enactment of Public Law 95488. With approval of this law. operators were suddenly made retroactively responsible for claims approved as a result of the 1977 black lung amendments. Problems arose. and still exist. with the insurance companies and their obligations to the coal operators they insure as a result of this law. I urge my colleagues to approve H.R. 5159. the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1981. Most importantly. this measure will help to assure the solvency of the black lung disability trust fund. and keep the promise made by the Congress to the coal miners of this Nation.",

By virtue of this bill coming up under suspension. an amendment cannot be offered by myself or others who feel likewise to amend section 2405 out of the bill. It is indeed quite possible that if this section remains in the bill. in the other body the bill itself might never become law since it taints it to that degree. Section 2405. to which I object. provides unemployment compensation benefits to essentially all exservicemen who voluntarily leave the military. This reverses and retreats from the change we made in the reconciliation bill where we prohibited such payments except under certain circumstances. This reversal or retreat from action we have already taken in the reconciliation bill should be defeated for basically four reasons. The first reason I offer is the fact that this is bad policy. A serviceman and an employee in the private sector should be treated equally. The same rule should apply to either one. In the private sector when an employee leaves voluntarily a place of employment. he is not qualified for unemployment compensation benefits. yet if section 2405 stays in this bill. we are going to treat the serviceman differently than the private employee by allowing him unemployment compensation benefits when he voluntarily leaves the service. It is bad policy to create this difference in treatment. When we used to have draftees. I guess one could rationalize the law being that way on the grounds that we were involuntarily plucking a man or woman out of their employment and putting them in the service of their country and perhaps we should do something for them when they leave. We do not have that anymore. Now we have a voluntary military. People go into the military knowing they are going to leave at a certain time. Most of them are preparing for that date. As a matter of fact. most of them use their last days of leave or they use the service training they are getting in service to prepare for when they leave.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of section 202 of the unemployment compensation amendments to H.R. 4961. Due to a quirk in the Internal Revenue Code as it relates to unemployment compensation. teacher internship programs at our colleges and universities are presently in jeopardy. School districts were first included in unemployment compensation legislation in 1972. In 1973. teacher interns were determined ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits under an exception that prevented individuals who were regularly attending an educational institution from receiving benefits. The work study portion of the statute that prohibits benefits to students under age 22 was not considered at that time. However. in 1977 the statutes were amended to exclude nonprofit organizations and governmental units. from the 1973 exception. By definition. school districts are considered governmental units under the IRS statutes. The work study portion of the statute was now applicable to school districts rather than the 1973 exception. As a result of this amendment. teacher interns. age 22 and older (as 90 percent of them are). have been found eligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits at the expense of the school district they worked in after completing their internship. Many school districts have. therefore. terminated their participation in internship programs. In the long run this will impair the quality of instruction our children and grandchildren receive as future teachers are denied an opportunity to work under the guidance of an experienced teacher before entering the teaching profession. In recognition of the disruptions this quirk in the Code has caused the intern program.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. over the last several years. sheep producers in this country have suffered a steady and serious decline in their herds. In 1950. for example. domestic sheep numbered some 50 million head. As a result of inflationary production costs. increasing predation of live sheep and lambs. and rising imports. by 1978 this figure had dropped to 11.7 million head. As a result. as foreign imports of lamb have increased. the supply of domestically produced product has severely declined. Moreover. lamb is now the staple of the American sheep industry. and imported lamb is currently in direct competition with domestically produced lamb. creating an excess supply in a relatively small market. reducing the ability of the American producer to market the sheep industrys main product. In addition. unlabeled foreign lamb meat is sold in many stores alongside fresh domestic lamb. thus the American consumer may not be afforded the opportunity to choose between the imported product and the usually more fresh domestic lamb. Mr. Speaker. the legislation which I am introducing today along with Mr. ROuSSELOT. Mr. ST NHoLm. Mr. HANCE. and Mr. SKEEN. will correct the oversight created when this important commodity was omitted from current meat import restrictions by providing a modest limit on the quantity of lamb meat which may enter the United States during any year. This legislation will provide protection for both the consumer and the producer of lamb by assuring an adequate supply of domestic lamb meat at a fair price while maintaining the stability of our international lamb trade. and I urge my colleagues support.*",

This extended period of deterioration has impeded our international commerce. eroded our balance of payments. jeopardized our emergency sealift capabilities. and cost the jobs of American seamen. stevedores. and shipbuilders. The first bill I have introduced will speed the depreciation schedule for Americanbuilt oceangoing ships. A number of other countries have garnered a large share of the worlds shipbuilding business by permitting a more accelerated depreciation schedule. While I recommend nothing as radical as adoption of these formulas. our own 14year depreciation schedule is now unrealistic at the other extreme. By reducing to 5 years the full depreciation of Americanbuilt and Americanoperated ships. we can put the United States in a more competitive position. The second bill I have introduced will establish a further tax incentive for construction of ships in American yards. Under this proposal. all profits earned from a ship will be exempt from taxation if they are reinvested in new ship construction within the United States. This will lead to an expansion of the Americanflag merchant fleet. and stem the tide of American firms going overseas for their new ship construction and documentation.

After a 50year binge of reckless Federal fiscal policies. we are suffering from the effects of uncontrolled spending and everincreasing deficits. Those policies have lead us to a national debt in excess of $1 trillion and to a point of near economic collapse. We have begun to take a sobering look at those policies and at the condition that they have inflicted upon us. Economic sobriety is necessary and absolutely essential. However. it must be recognized that the hangover that follows such binge is unavoidable. The symptoms of a hangover are not pleasant and the only proven cure for a hangover is time. The same is true of our economy. There are those who advocate \"quick fixes\" and \"sure cures.\" There are also those who find the hangover intolerable and yearn for another drink from the bottle of red ink and high inflation. Such solutions have not worked in the past and will not work now. If we are serious about bringing Federal spending under control and balancing the budget. then we must allow the inevitable economic hangover to take its course and not revert to the proverbial \"hair of the dog\" logic.

Speaking at Eureka College last Sunday. the President proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union each reduce their arsenals of nuclear missiles by onethird. No more than half of the remaining missiles could be based on land. This latter point is particularly important. since large. landbased missiles contribute the most to nuclear instability. they are the likeliest firststrike weapons. and the weapons most vulnerable to a first strike. This first phase of arms reduction would be followed by a second in which. to use the Presidents words. the United States willSeek to achieve an equal ceiling on other elements of our strategic nuclear forces including limits on the ballistic missile throwweight at less than current American levels. If both phases of the Presidents proposal were implemented. the United States and the Soviet Union would be left in clearly defensive positions. and the threat of a first strike by either power would shrink dramatically. This is the sort of creative thinking about arms control that all Americans should support and applaud. Many of us had feared that in the necessary push to modernize our strategic forces. arms control had been pushed aside and almost forgotten. We had become concerned that unintentionally. a climate might be created in which the use of nuclear weapons could become much more likely. This concern gave birth to the nuclear freeze movement. Ground Zero. and other organizations.

Today. social security has become an unnecessary obstacle to the budget process. This proposal is an attempt to separate the two questionsthe budget and social securitybecause this would be a better process for solving both problems which do not have to be solved at the same time.

The Export Trading Company legislation which will hopefully soon come to the floor for our consideration is a remarkable trade bill. Passage of the legislation would create over 300.000 new American jobs by encouraging small and midsized companies to begin to export their goods and services.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to make briefly just one general and one specific observation. In the general sense. in recent years Congress has been called upon to bail out certain large corporations that have gotten into financial trouble. This bill is a novel precedent: We are asked to bail out. through burdenpassing to the consumer. large corporations that are financially healthy. This is legislative nonsense. Finally. one part of this bill calls for consumers to accept the burden of building a gasconditioning plant in Alaska. Gas processing plants have been built many times in this country. but this is the first one that the consumers are asked to take the risk of paying for. Part of the reason. frankly. is that we have an overbuilt gasprocessing industry. Yet it is interesting to point out that during the debate on the rule this morning the gentleman from Alaska indicated. in response to a question. that his State was considering certain burdensharing for the people of Alaskathat they might consider helping build this gasconditioning plant. If that is the case. this bill before us today should be defeated because that is a change which should be made in a new bill to come up in the future. This bill is before us without the right to amend. which is certainly not common coming from the committees of jurisdiction which reported it. If the gentleman from Alaska is going to assure us that maybe the people of Alaska would consider building this processing plant. then all I would say is we must defeat this bill because this costly plant represents $4 to $5 billion worth of new information.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I must rise in strong opposition to the resolution of waiver of Federal law relating to the Alaska natural gas pipeline. This bill makes a mockery of the democratic process in several ways. First. we are allowed only 1 hour of debate on a bill which will undoubtedly cost consumers billions of dollars. Second. no amendments are in order. Proponents will have you believe that this Nations energy future rests on approval of this waiver. Not so. The Prudhoe Bay reserves represent one of this countrys most precious resources. There is little question that this gas ought to be exploited. and certainly its use can help in reducing our crippling dependence on imported oil. Unfortunately. we are not presented with a measure which allows for even decent methods for recovery. This bill will allow rich. multinational oil companies to bill their customers long before any gas is delivered. Prebilling is an unconscionable means of making the public. rather than those who will reap the huge profits. take the risk that the pipeline will not come on line. Furthermore. the State of Alaska stands to make some $20 billion in severance taxes on Prudhoe Bay gasthat is $40.000 for every citizen of that Statewithout investing one cent. This measure only exacerbates the flow of capital from energyconsuming States to energyproducing States. To make hardworking natural gas consumers pay for a pipeline that will make the State of Alaska richer is to make a mockery of every principle of equity. Mr. Speaker. the plain fact is that if this pipeline were such a good deal. private capital would be easily available. and private investors would rush to the breach. This resolution is on the floor today because the developer cannot live up to his promise to use private capital. There are solutions to this dilemma. but a multibillion dollar tax on consumers should not be one of them. It will be a sad day for this House when we can be steamrollered like this. In closing. I would like to share with my colleagues a transcript of Bill Moyers commentary on the CBS \"Evening News\" last night. Mr. Moyers has given us a clear example of why most Americans think so poorly of their elected representatives: (CBS Evening News. Dec. 8. 1981]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we have just heard my colleague. the gentleman from Michigan. describe the cost to us in terms of increased energy costs across the board. whether it is coal. gas. or oil. in terms of energy equivalent costs. the increased cost to us of deferring this gasline. Let me give you another cost. In 1980. when we were beginning to resume filling our strategic petroleum reserves. Sheik Yamani of Saudi Arabia. their Energy Minister. reportedly instructed President Carter to cease and desist filling those strategic petroleum reserves under pain of an embargo by Persian Gulf oil producers. And what did our President do. rightly or wrongly. under the pressures of our then desperate dependence on Persian Gulf oil? He blinked. and promised Sheik Yamani that we would cease and desist filling our strategic petroleum reserve. And he did just that. Now. such a state of supine acquiescence to the whim and fancy of a Persian Gulf oil sheik to my mind was a disgraceful. shameful posture. for the United States to adopt. I am not suggesting that any other President at that time could have taken a more firm. more honorable position for our country. because that was the de facto state of total dependency that we were in. But I say to my colleagues I do not know if we could quantify the cost to us of that dependence in terms of increased oil prices which reflect. as my colleague from Michigan said. in all other energy prices. and in the ability of the United States to withstand an embargo.",

I am very much opposed to the process by which we have to consider these waivers. It seems if one ever wants to get Congress to act. the first thing one does is create a crisis that is larger than life. Preach doom and gloom to the Congress of the United States. Go out and hire yourself a corps of lobbyists. the best that can be found. and pretty soon one can get the Congress to consider an allornothing package. and that is what has happened here. There are alternatives to this. Maybe the alternative is not for Mr. McMillan to continue to have the exclusive right to build this pipeline. Perhaps he is not able to do it. But perhaps there are other parties who can do it. I think we have to consider whether or not the producer should do it. since the estimates that we are all working off that have been provided to both committees are that those producers will receive the 50percent rate of return. If. in fact. that is possible. I question whether or not they would be able to raise the capital in the private market. I would think they would be able to. I do not think we ought to be voting on this package and have the Representative from Alaska tell us that the State of Alaska is considering or has under consideration whether or not and the extent to which they will participate. We ought to know the extent to which they participate. because we are certainly mandating the extent to which the consumers in the lower 48 will participate. I can appreciate that it is a windfall and it is a wonderful thing. Under their severance tax. they will get $20 billion. But let me tell the Members: Apparently without the consumers in the lower 48 underwriting this pipeline. they will not get anything from the severance tax. because the gas will be reinjected into the ground. and the oil companies told us they can reinject it there until hell freezes over. So could we not ask them to continue to help the consumers participate in the construction of this project?",

The reason the proponents want to talk about Ralph Nader and our general energy problem rather than talk about the real issues in this legislation is because they do not have answers to the real issues. First. there is a real marketing problem. a real risk of marketing $13 to $20 gas. That is why there is not financing for this in the private sector. That is why we need this waiver package. That risk is real. They refuse to talk about it. Second they do not tell us why the consumer should be asked to pick up this risk. rather than the State of Alaska. or the producers. who will profit from this waiver package.

How about regulations that are designed to help with alternatives to oil? Applicance efficiency standards. on the way out. Thermostat settings. gone. How about real national security protection?

We have heard from several. \"Why dont the producers participate in this? Why dont they get involved? Why dont they put up some of their money?\" Well. that is exactly one of the components of what we are trying to do with this waiver package. The previous law said they could not be involved. they could not put up their money. We are simply saying let us pass the waiver package so they will participate in this process. They are going to have to put up a minimum of $7 billion of equity which cannot be prebilled to the consumer in any way. Until the gas flows and is marketable. there will be no return on that particular investment. We also heard today about the risk to the consumer. Of course there is a risk to the consumer. There is a risk in obtaining any energy source in this country and paying for it. The consumer will ultimately do that. But what is the greater risk? The greater risk the American people have demonstrated so vocally over this decade is continuing dependence on OPEC oil. What is that risk to the American consumer and what is the risk of not having energy supplies available to our people in this country. domestic energy sources. as an alternative to the blackmail that we have suffered under during the 1970s? What is the risk of the economic decline and disaster that faces this country if we face another oil crisis as we did in 1973? Those risks abound. Of course risks are faced in doing this. But we must move forward. We must demonstrate to the American people that we are willing to utilize and find our existing resources. and domestic resources. to give us energy options available for the future to run this country so we do not have to continue this dependence on OPEC.

It goes something like this: \"We need the governments help to facilitate private sector financing. and if we do not get it. some enterprise. some venture is going to fail.\" That is the new song of corporate America. It is the new song of business. business people. who ordinarily complain and rail against Governments involvement in private enterprise. And so. what we have now is a complex arrangement of loans. direct loans. indirect loans. loans guarantees. guarantees that are funneled through Federal financial banks. almost every conceivable way to assist people. particularly corporate America and businesses in getting credit. We are trying to stop that. We have fashioned a credit budget because that is growing faster. believe it or not. than spending in the country. We are not taking about 40 percent of the credit market from one sort of Government credit extension program or another. and that is ruining the credit market and free enterprise system. But now we see devices like prebilling. we see all sorts of imaginative ways to do the same thing by indirection. So. the list gets longer and longer. and is going to continue. and while we are out cutting everybody else. we ought to start cutting out some of this corporate welfare. It has been said here that if these waivers are bad. you should have seen the ones they tried to get before they got these. So what it seems to me is. that the Congress is giving way and giving way. and finally have come up with this sort of help for corporate America. We have got to start saying no. and until we start saying no. they are going to continue to be in here at the door and this problem is not going to get better.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 3512 and wish to address myself specifically to the provision in the legislation which will have the effect of providing an additional $5 million in funds for title IIIB of the Older Americans Act. A $10 million rescission was proposed for title IIIB. which is responsible for the various social services provided by the Older Americans Act. This was an especially significant action because at the same time funding was being reduced for the programthe 1978 Older Americans Act had mandated that title IIIB assume a number of new responsibilities. These included the provision of transportation services for the all important nutrition program. It had been conservatively estimated that 20 percent of overall nutrition funds were being spent on transportation. Based on fiscal year 1981 appropriations. this would involve more than $64 million. Meanwhile funds for title IIIB were being reduced by $10 million. This partial restoration of funds will avert service delivery in a number of areas across the country. Corresponding with this action was last weeks vote in the House Education and Labor Committee which reported out H.R. 3046. a bill to extend the various programs of the Older Americans Act for 3 years. Included were increased but defensible authorizations for title IIIB. I wish to praise Chairman NATCHER on the LaborHHS Subcommittee for his leadership in this small but important area. In February I sent a letter cosigned by some 20 of my colleagues on the House Select Committee on Aging urging that this rescission not be approved. The actions taken by the committee are reflective of a commitment to the social and human service needs of our seniors.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to join with the chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs in his recent comments regarding this supplemental appropriations and rescission bill as it affects the Veterans Administration. I believe that the chairman and ranking minority member of the full Appropriations Committee. and also the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on HUD and Independent Agencies. have done an admirable and sympathetic job in steering appropriations toward their areas of greatest need within the VA. Both I and Chairman MONTGOMERY have been deeply concerned for several years over the personnel levels within the Veterans Administration. and particularly the levels of hospital care staffing. It was for this reason that we and the other members of the Veterans Affairs Committee strongly supported language in last years appropriations measure that would legally bind the Office of Management and Budget to staff those positions that the congressional appropriations process funds. I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee continues to place this matter in the same priority that we on the Veterans Committee do. In this regard. Mr. Chairman. I was also gratified to see the clarification provided Chairman MONTGOMERY with respect to the limitation language on page 125 of the bill. Legislation which places a cap on parttime medical employees could be interpreted by the unknowing as an effort to cut back on medical care at a time when the Veterans Administration hospital system has its back to the wall. However. when the limitation of parttime employees is read together with the mandate that the Administration hire the number of fulltime equivalent employees dictated under the appropriations process. it clearly follows that the parttime limitation is intended to require greater hiring of fulltime personnel. I am not certain that this is the best way to go about obtaining such a result. but I do applaud the committee for its concern. We are. indeed. seeking the same guarantees. Hopefully. however. once the viability of the appropriations mandate is accepted by OMB as legally binding. we can explore methods that will be less restrictive of the discretion of the VAs Chief Medical Director to create his best mix of full- and parttime employees.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the supplemental appropriations bill we are considering today duplicates the priorities of the 1982 Reagan budget this House had the poor judgment to approve last week. In short. this bills priorities are the opposite of what this country needs. Like the Reagan budget. the supplemental bill is distinctly unbalanced in favor of defense. Fully onehalf of the nonmandatory costs included in the supplemental authorizations are slated for defense. $6 billion. The bill cuts almost as large a figure. $5.2 billion. from housing assistance programs. But the slashes in social programs do not stop there. Other significant rescissions and deferrals are made in education. jobs. economic development. health. and alternative energy programs. Assistance for refugees. minority education. health professionals training. alcohol. drug abuse. and mental health programs. energy conservation. alcohol and biomass fuel. urban waste fuel conversion. and the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank. are all cut back. In many cases. the committee would rescind smaller amounts than the administration requested. but the damage remains. Indeed. the largest rescission exceeds the administrations request by $120 millionthe housing assistance cutand would reduce assisted units by 45.000 nationwide. The rescission of a total $985 million in CETA programs for both the structurally unemployed and for countercyclical public service jobs is a particularly inappropriate step. At this time of economic hardship. it is important to expand Governments role in providing employment and training. not reduce it. Certainly the costs of providing for the many workers who will be forced to go on unemployment and food stamps will far exceed the costs of providing these worthwhile programs. Mr. Chairman. the budget priorities of this Nation are dangerously out of whack. Nothing more aptly illustrates this imbalance than the continuing emphasis on overspending for defense. Such excessive spending will only fuel inflation. accelerate the arms race. and concentrate Federal dollars in a sector of our economy that produces fewer jobs than almost any other. We run the grave risk of even worse inflation than we already have by persisting in this pattern of spending. yet no voice is raised asking how we can afford to pay for it.

As our daily newspapers and electronic media increasingly turn their concerns to international. national. and regional news. the role of the community newspaper has to expand to fill the void created by a lack of attention to local news. The community newspaper provides the public with important local events information such as changes in housing. commercial properties. sanitation. police protection. zoning. and other matters that affect the community on a daily basis. An outstanding example of such a community paper is the Herald in New York City. With a circulation of 40.000. the Herald serves the Manhattan community from 14th to 60th Street and Park Avenue to the East River. Three reporters and two editors comprise the editorial staff and produce a weekly newspaper that has served its community for 11 years. The Heralds reporters also work as their own photographers and since the paper is accredited with New York University and Columbias Journalism School. two interns a semester are able to join the production staff of the Herald for valuable practical experience. The Herald is unique in that it serves as a notforprofit. taxexempt community newspaper. The paper does not rely solely on advertising revenue but is also supported by reader contributions and has successfully transferred the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) concept of fund raising to publishing. I cite the July 17. 1981. issue of the Herald as a colorful and detailed example of the community services provided by such a publication. Writer Beth Sherman complied \"Right in Your Own Backyard.\" an enlightening community guide issue of events in and around the Manhattan area to keep New Yorkers busy for \"a month of Sundays.\" The guide was printed in large type for easier reading by senior citizens and provided tour schedules. locations. and hours of opening for visitors to everything from the New York Stock Exchange to Lincoln Center. Services such as those the Herald provides are invaluable to all citizens since. more often than not. it is the events in our own backyard we are least aware of.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Smoaks of Charleston. S.C.. have been trying to get their adopted daughter. Elizabeth Ann Jones. naturalized as a U.S. citizen. Under current law. the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot approve her application for immigration because. for naturalization purposes. she does not qualify as an adopted child. Therefore I am introducing a private relief bill to relieve the Smoaks of the restraints which prevent them from naturalizing their adopted daughter. Elizabeth is the niece of Mrs. Smoaks and was adopted inasmuch as she has been living with the Smoaks for many years. She is a British citizen and a resident of Liverpool. however. a very unpleasant family problem exists there. partially due to the fact that her mother has remarried. Elizabeth is a fine young lady who has a very strong desire to live and work in America and to be near her new family. The adoption proceedings that the Smoaks went through to adopt Elizabeth were completed and approved March 10. 1981. with the approval and encouragement of Elizabeths natural mother. The Smoaks love and care for Elizabeth very much and have demonstrated their responsibility for her well being. I should also add that her natural mother approves of her becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. Mr. Speaker. to deny this relief to the Smoaks will create undue hardship on all parties involved. I would hope that my distinguished colleagues could find the compassion to support this bill. The text of the bill follows: H.R. A bill for the relief of Elizabeth Ann Jones Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That in the administration of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Elizabeth Ann Jones may be classified as a child within the meaning of section 101(b)(1)(F) of the Act. upon approval of a petition filed in her behalf by",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to insert my Washington report for Wednesday. October 28. President Reagans longawaited and farreaching $180billion program to modernize and improve our strategic forces includes: Installation of 100 giant MX missiles. with at least one thousand nuclear warheads. in existing but hardened silos. Acceleration of research on antiballistic missiles and on ways to base the MX. Construction of 100 new strategic bombers patterned after the B1 bomber. Development of the radarevading Stealth bomber at a faster pace. and Deployment of several hundred nucleartipped cruise missiles on 84 attack submarines. The President is putting off for three or four years a decision how to deploy most of the MX missiles. in effect postponing the choice of basing mode. In the interim. several basing modes will be thoroughly studied. Mr. Reagan acknowledges that he does not yet know which basing mode should be made permanent. It is not easy to decide how the MX should be based. President Carter believed that the United States should confuse the Soviet Union by shifting 200 MX missiles among 4.600 shelters in the deserts of Utah and Nevada. In making his decision. President Reagan has rejected this \"shell game\". in part because the Soviet Union could build more missiles to destroy the MX than the United States could build shelters to hide them. Mr. Reagan is considering three ways of protecting the MX: putting it aloft on large transport planes. siting it in extremely deep underground silos. or ringing it with antiballistic missiles. The Presidents decision on the MX has prompted much debate. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. the nations top military officer. has flatly stated his doubt about the decision. Two former defense secretaries. Messrs. Brown and Schlesinger. have spoken of their serious reservations. commenting that the decision does not close the \"window of vulnerability\" (the phrase describes a time just ahead when improved Soviet missiles will. in theory. be able to destroy most of our landbased missiles). The Chairmen of the Armed Services Committees in the House and Senate oppose the decision for the same reasonit does not diminish the exposure of Americas landbased missiles to Soviet attack because basing the MX in existing but hardened silos does not sufficiently enhance the missiles survivability.

The 1961 Conference laid the groundwork for the landmark medicare legislation of 1965. and Older Americans Act programs and antiage discrimination laws grew out of the 1971 Conference. With the 1981 Conference now only 1 month away. the Nation looks forward to a full and free debate of the critical issues this Nation faces as a result of a burgeoning aging population. For the millions directly impacted by the important decisions before us. and for those of us in policymaking roles. we expect the Conference to provide an open forum for the exchange of ideas on social security. pension laws. and health care to name a few. Sadly. that full and free debate is now threatened. Attempts to politicize the Conference through the establishment of rules which will limit debate and controversial votes cannot be tolerated. A Republican National Committee telephone survey of delegates to learn of their attitude toward the administrations social security recommendations and their reaction to current budget cuts as they impact the elderly is entirely inappropriate. How sad it is that the administration is so sensitive to the reaction of this growing and important political constituency over its reprehensible social security and budget proposals that it feels compelled to destroy the tremendous value of this Conference. Toplevel staff changes with just weeks to go. efforts to stack committees of the Conference with administrationappointed delegates well beyond what was initially conceived. and such blatant tactics as political polling and rules changes designed to restrict debate are deplorable. The activities of the Conference must be left to the participants. The Conference must not be politicized at the risk of intimidating some participants. stifling debate. and casting a cloud over the recommendations of the Conference. If that happens. the Nation will be the loser.*",

The devastation wrought by handguns is frightening. Last year. nearly 12.000 Americans died from handgun inflicted wounds. More than 5.000 Americans are wounded in crimes involving handguns each week. One out of every five fatal firearms accidents involves a child under the age of 15. Nearly 4.000 handguns are stolen from private residences weekly. These stolen handguns provide more than half of all the firearms used by criminals. During the next 12 months. there will be over 250.000 more Americans victimized with handguns. All levels of society are touched by handgun violence. Unfortunately. this violence has become a fact of our everyday life. We flip past articles in newspapers dealing with firearms violence. rarely giving them a second glance. Firearms fatalities never even make the papers or television news shows unless a prominent citizen is involved or if the incident is particularly grissly. We have become so callous to violence that the actual number of Americans who meet their end by handguns seems insignificant to us. More Americans were killed by handguns on their own soil during the peak years of the Vietnam war than were killed in action in Vietnam. In addition. nowhere in the civilized world are firearms fatalities as high as in the United States. In 1979. there were 48 handgun fatalities in Japan. 8 in Great Britain. 34 in Switzerland. 52 in Canada. 58 in Israel. 21 in Sweden. and 42 in West Germany. During the same period of time. there were 10.728 handgun fatalities in the United States. Or. in another comparison. the handgun fatality rate in Japan is about 1.6 deaths per 100.000 persons per year. and Great Britain and West Germany both have a fatality rate of about 1.3 deaths per 100.000 people. Unfortunately. the United States tops the list with 9.7 handgun murders per year per 100.000 persons. The National Coalition to Ban Handguns organized National End Handgun Violence Week to heighten public awareness of this problem and to mobilize citizens to help stop the rising tide of violence.

We must not let the appointment of a woman to the Supreme Court obscure our view of this administrations effect on womens position.

Recent budget cuts will severely restrict womens health programs. The earned income disregard for AFDC. and other welfare cuts. will have their harshest effect on single mothers. the largest percentage of citizens below the poverty line.

There is no other Government program that is so important to so many of our people. Social security is not a luxury. for millions of Americans who have spent their adult lives working to build our economy and strengthen the foundation of the American dream. social security is a necessity. It is the difference between a secure. dignified retirement and very real economic hardship. Given the obvious importance of this program it is unfortunate indeed that the Senate is taking up the issue without first ascertaining what the President and the chairman of the Budget Committee have agreed to in the way of major program changes.

Ill tell President Brezhnev that the United States is ready to build a new understanding based upon the principles Ive outlined today. Ill tell him that his government and his people have nothing to fear from the United States. The free nations living at peace in the world community can vouch for the fact that we seek only harmony. And Ill ask President Brezhnev why our two nations cant practice mutual restraint. Why cant our peoples enjoy the benefits that would flow from real cooperation? Why cant we reduce the number of horrendous weapons? Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

I rise in support of H.R. 3337. the Youth Employment Demonstration Amendments of 1981. which provides a 1year extension for programs under title VIA of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. The problems of youth employment are severe and growing worse with every day. In an economy plagued with high unemployment. minority and disadvantaged young persons are the last to be hired. first to be fired. and have the lowest expectations of becoming productive. taxpaying citizens. The youth employment and demonstration project was created to directly address this situation and to explore a variety of approaches to alleviate youth unemployment. Since mid1978. when YEDPA became operational. the impacts on youth unemployability of the various programs under its mandate have been studied and analyzed. Although we have only preliminary data at this point. it is generally felt that YEDPA has been successful and that our Nations young people have benefited from its implementation. The investments we are making in human capital through youth programs can only increase the productivity of our country by providing the labor market with better skilled. more efficient workers. The Education and Labor Committee. under the leadership of my colleague Gus HAWKINS. has wisely recommended the extension of YEDPA through 1982. at which time the other titles of CETA will expire. It is the committees view that these youth programs have proven too valuable to be lost in a melange of allpurpose training programs. and that the special problems experienced by youth in entering the job market must be addressed through a separate emphasis. I would urge my colleagues to support this simple extension of YEDPA. recognizing that the amounts available for its continuation will be subject to ceilings established through the budget reconciliation process. I am sure you will agree that a 3035 percent unemployment rate for disadvantaged youths merits Federal attention. and I suggest that Congress show its concern by agreeing to H.R. 3337.e",

We all know that this gentleman has authored this Nations most important laws to address the critical problems of unemployment and joblessness. His accomplishments have seen millions of Americans provided with training and more importantly job opportunity making the difference between punching a clock and wasting time on a street corner. As you know. during the 96th Congress the House moved with deliberate speed to approve H.R. 6711. the Youth Act of 1980. Since it was not possible for the Senate to consider its bill before adjournment. H.R. 3337 is necessary to extend the authorization for youth employment and demonstration programs through 1982. The extension of title IV gives the Congress the much needed time to develop a comprehensive youth employment bill. Our youth unemployment rate is an alarming 16 percent and among our Nations minority youth it stands at 40 percent. We cannot stand idly by and let our Nations most valuable resourcesour youthswaste away. As summer approaches. Congress should give special attention to the plight of our Nations innercity youths. We should keep the present youth employment mechanism in place for now. so that our Nations disadvantaged youths may use their unlimited energy developing resourceful and constructive job skills to help themselves as well as their communities. If we fail to act on this measure. we may see countless idle young people on the streets of our cities in 1982. We should not allow this to happen.

Amendments to the law from time to time made this benefit available to Korean conflict and Vietnamera veterans. This basic benefit. Mr. Speaker. has made it possible for thousands of young veterans to enter the home buying market. Todays spiraling mortgage interests rates and the inflated price of housing. however. have virtually eliminated the GI home loan program and its availability to young Vietnam veter.ans. If the Nations veterans are to have any hope of becoming homeowners as intended by Congress. then it is necessary that we embrace alternative methods of financing. The bill before us authorizes the Veterans Administration to guarantee home loans that are financed in the same manner as the Department of HUDs graduated payment mortgage. This program as set forth in the bill before us will allow a veteran to purchase a house with a reasonable downpayment and lower initial monthly payments in the early years of his loan. The mortgage payments rise gradually for a certain number of years and then level off and remain constant for the balance of the mortgage. It will enable the young veteran to tailor his monthly payments to meet his increasing income.

The Senatepassed version of this would only allow a States objection to a repository siting decision to stand if either the House or the Senate passes a resolution upholding that objection. Such a process is inadequate. Nuclear waste disposal decisions are far too important to allow an override of State and local concerns by congressional inaction. The State of Wisconsin may be a potential future home for a permanent nuclear waste repository. The stable granite bedrock beneath scenic northern Wisconsin has been targeted by the Department of Energy for further study as a burial site. and the citizens of Wisconsin have a right to be concerned over the role the State of Wisconsin will be given in the final decision. Justified or not. there is a perception by States that the Federal Government cannot be counted on to keep its word on radioactive waste management programs. One only has to look at the problems the State of New Mexico has had with the waste isolation pilot project to realize a similar situation could occur anywhere. In fact. in the State of Wisconsin. the Governors office has been having a great deal of trouble with the Department of Energy over receiving information as to what the Department is doing in northern Wisconsin. The Department of Energy cannot be allowed to build a disposal facility without giving the States a meaningful role in the siting and construction decisions. A longrange nuclear waste disposal program is critical to our Nations energy future. and the proper role to our Nations energy future. and the proper role of States in the siting of disposal facilities is critical to the success of this program.

As the Senator mentioned there was a 20percent cut in the bill. I desired. along with the administration. to have a progression of those cuts to the second and third years of the bill that would have taken an additional 20 percent for a total of 40 percent. and I have an amendment that had been entered more than a week ago to do that.

It is kind of paradoxical that on the one hand we are spending money in this bill for highways and on the other hand we are in effect reducing operating subsidies which will put greater burdens on those highays as they push more and more people off the mass transit system. So I would hope that the conference would give some consideration to the need for this flexibility. and indeed my amendment provided for that. in allowing States and municipalities to exchange a dollar of capital assistance for a dollar of operating assistance instead of what the present bill is $3 of capital assistance for $2 of operating assistance. I would hope that there might be in the conference a possible positive compromise. Would the Senator have a comment about that?",

There is no question about mass transit. Bringing back to mind how this whole program started. that money would be paid by the Federal Government only for capital expenditures. We have moved to the point of saying to the local communities. \"You can get more and more of the Federal dollars for operating expenses.\" Well. there may be a good case made for that. I am not one who feels so strongly that that is right or wrong. But I know there is one subject about which I feel very strongly. and that is the fact that throughout this Nation the administrators of the transit authoritiesI do not care whether it is in San Francisco. Chicago. Washington. or whereverare becoming the highest paid public executives in the Nation. They are getting more money than the mayors of their communities. They are getting more money than the Governors of their States. They are taking trips all over the Nation into the most luxurious areas. because they know that the Federal Government is picking up a very substantial portion of that tab. I think it is high time that the Congress provide some limits that officials working for regional transit authorities. mass transit authorities. not be permitted to receive a salary in excess of the highest paid official in the community in which they are operating. I think maybe we ought to send the message as well that it is time for them to cut back on their fancy vacations to all the luxurious areas of this Nation. I know it is happening in my own State. and I am quite certain. from what I have heard. that it is happening in other States as well. What happens is that there is an independent board created. They treat themselves well and their executives well. We here in Washington are always criticized for being big spenders. but I hope we will send word back to those who operate the mass transit systems of the country that they. too. should not be big spenders. and that they ought to be concerned about those dollars.

This action has the ability to increase imports up to 1 million additional fur pelts per year. The U.S. pelt industry would be devastated. The State of Idaho. which I represent. and 22 other States would feel the impact of H.R. A large number of meat processing plants would also be adversely impacted by passage of this legislation. Many meat byproducts have no other value than being used as mink feed. With a declining domestic production of furs. the only result can be a less favorable income picture for the meat processing industry. The fur industry and the meat processing industry. as has much of the economy. have had difficult times. Passage of this bill would only exacerbate the situation. Because this is a suspension vote and no amendments are in order. I am requesting a \"no\" vote on H.R. 6867.",

Also. diabetes is the third leading cause of death from disease and is the first leading cause of new cases of blindness. In addition. the complications of diabetes lead to many other serious health problems. About a decade ago. a number of parents of diabetics banded together because they did not know there was enough known about diabetes. there was too little research into the causes. effects. and a possible cure for diabetes. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation was formed as an organization of volunteers to find ways to fund research and to comfort and help newly diagnosed diabetics and their families. On Sunday. September 26. the northern Virginia and District of Columbia/ Maryland chapters of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation are sponsoring Bike n Hike 82. All funds raised through this event will go toward research in diabetes. Participants will solicit money pledges from sponsors for each mile they ride or hike.

This bill. which may be considered by the House before the end of the session. is fatally flawed. H.R. 6046 narrows the scope of Judicial review in extradition cases. handing this responsibility over to the State Department. Expanding the power of the executive branch at the expense of the Judicial branch is an unnecessary abridgment of our system of checks and balances. This transfer of authority creates an open space for possible abuse of the civil rights of foreigners and U.S. citizens alike. H.R. 6046 allows the United States to hold. without bail. Americans or foreigners who have been charged with a crime by a foreign governmentwithout one scrap of corroborating evidence. The bill gamely calls for a promise that evidence will be produced sometime in the unspecified future. Further. subsections of the bill would deny benefit of the political crimes defense to any person charged by a foreign government with committing a crime of bodily violence or a crime involving the use of a firearm. except in extraordinary circumstances. For all the above reasons. and more. the Extradition Act of 1982 runs contrary to our proud history of respect for the individualthe cornerstone of our political system.

In effect. the bill was nothing short of special interest legislation to allow the producers of small personal computers a special deduction for gifts of a single type to a particular group. I am hesitant to give one industry a tax advantage not available to other industries especially when that advantage will enable the industry to promote the training of students across the country in the use of its particular products.

Wishing does not make it so. Several recent polls. ABC/Washington Post. George Gallup. and the Harris Survey. along with a U.S. News & World Report leadership survey. show that the Reagan administration is significantly less popular with women than with men. In fact. until 1980 men and women generally polled alike on political preferences. But more women voted for Carter than Reagan. and that trend continues in 1981. Why? One of the most compelling social facts of the 1980s is the feminization of poverty. Femaleheaded families and female senior citizens. to cite two examples. are growing pockets of poverty in America. The ERA is an economic issue. Equal pay for equal and comparable work is an issue that enlists women clear across the political spectrum.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since we are debating the authorization of the Legal Services Corporation today. I want my colleagues to know that I have just introduced legislation that provides an alternative to the continuation of the Legal Services Corporation. My bill would allow as a credit against the income tax imposed on an attorney an amount equal to 25 percent of the value of the charitable legal services performed for an eligible client in noncriminal proceedings during the taxable year. The provision of legal services to poor people is one of societys important responsibilities. The problem is how best to accomplish this while minimizing Federal funding and inhibiting the continuation of a Legal Services Corporation bureaucracy that has been too often more interested in changing society. rather than representing poor people. My legislation will encourage the private legal community to do more charitable work by providing a reasonable tax incentive. In our effort to return duties and responsibilities to the private sector that have too long been exercised by big Government. this bill is a gesture in the right direction.",

It embodies most of the recommendations made by the Department of Justice in its written analysis of the bill. and is supported by President Reagan and the Attorney General. National public opinion polls have consistently shown that a large majority of the American public supports the imposition of the death penalty for capital crimes.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on January 5 of this year. controversy and debate over inequitable party ratios on our House committees once again rang on the House floor. And once again the effort was to no avail. As usual. the majority voted along strict party lines to stack selective committees in their favor in clear violation of the democratic principle of \"one person. one vote.\" Although the debate has regrettably subsided. the pernicious fact of malapportioned House committees remains. It needs resolve once and for all. In a February 2 editorial. the Wall Street Journal called for reform of the majoritys \"arrogance\" but termed a courtresolve a \"thoroughly crummy idea.\" The Wall Street Journals editorial. however. did not address the pertinent question of how. then. to reform this \"committee ratio racket.\" If not by the court. how? If not now. when? And if not by us. who? Recent polls indicate the GOP may become the House majority next year. After years of underrepresentation on House committees. it is highly unlikely that the Republicans will be overcome by sentiments of generosity toward the Democrats should the GOP regain the House. History and human nature demonstrate this truth. The time for reform. therefore. is now. At the beginning of the 97th Congress. 2d session. a formal amendment to the House rules should be adopted providing for permanent proportional party representation on our House committees. None of us. whether Republican or Democrat. should fear a rule of one person. one vote. After all. such a principle forms the foundation of our system of representative democracy. If we fail to reform the \"committee ratio racket\" now. we may miss the opportunity to reform. Justice and equity are badly abused by our current system of committee representation. The American people deserve better and there is and will be no better time to insure they have it than now. In the next 3 days. I will discuss committee malapportionment in depth. I hope my colleagues will give serious thought to this serious issue and be guided by their conscience.",

The amendments do not insure the accountability of the Corporation. which has strayed from its original mandate of providing daytoday legal assistance to indigent clients. It has become an instrument for social engineering. subject to the whims of those individuals intent on correcting every imagined social ill in our society. The Corporations performance record clearly shows misuse of public funds. Taxpayer dollars have been squandered on litigation to evolve social change that has little bearing on the ordinary legal needs of poor Americans. Lawyers from the Legal Services Corporation have engaged in activities of lobbying Members of Congress and filing classaction suits against Government entities. All of this from an autonomous structure that is insulated from congressional oversight. I am proud of a much better record for Legal Services Corporation in Oregon. I support the blockgrant approach to accomplish the goal of legal assistance for those who cannot afford traditional methods. This will allow States such as mine to continue the services originally intended. Given the past record of Legal Services nationally and its unwillingness to heed congressional directives. how can we justify continued funding of the organization? I do not think we can.",

Another young fireman. Mark Rhinier. was also overcome in that attempt and is now in the hospital seriously injured. These are people who serve us day in and day out. Volunteers are the folks we turn to in an emergency. They are people who risk their lives every day. often unheralded. This tragedy took the lives of three brave. conscientious young men.

Unlike the previous amendment. which essentially sought to hold the status quo in place while the Clean Air Act was under consideration. this amendment seeks to make a major weakening of our Clean Air Act and regulations through this appropriations bill. Essentially what it wants to do is to take out the enforcement of the requirements that States. under certain circumstances. have to have vehicle emission control inspection and maintenance programs. I happen to think that where you have an air pollution problem. that kind of a program is a very important part of the process of cleaning up our air. I very much hope that Members of this House would not use the vehicle of a rider on an appropriations bill to weaken our clean air legislation through the vehicle of this amendment. The fact of the matter is that what we have done in Clean Air Act amendments in the past to improve the quality of the air by restrictions on motor vehicles will. to all intents and purposes. be significantly dissipated if this amendment is allowed to pass. at least for the period of time it takes effect. and from the fact that this is the second year in which it is offered. it seems rather obvious that its sponsors intend this to be an ongoing thing.

Mr. Chairman. for the past 5 years my home State of New Jersey has operated a popular and costeffective program to clean up its airthe inspection and maintenance program for automobiles. Polls in our State have found that automobile owners are willing to help do their part to clean up our air by participating in the program. But I have been disappointed that other cities and States which violate national health standards for automobile pollutants have not adopted this program. The present Clean Air Act requires that cities. which need until 1982 to meet the national ambient health standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. must adopt an inspection and maintenance program. Today. I urge my colleagues to join with me in voting against the amendment to H.R. 6956 which attempts to block EPA enforcement of requirements for State inspection and maintenance programs. I believe that EPA enforcement of I&M programs is a crucial deterrent in preventing the deterioration of national air quality standards. What is more. inspection and maintenance programs are working quite effectively. I have reviewed EPA projections which State that auto I&M programs are critical in determining whether areas attain air quality standards. Cooperation between States and the EPA has reduced hydrocarbon emissions by as much as 20 percent and carbon monoxide by up to 36 percent a steady increase in auto use. We simply cannot ignore the very real contributions which I&M programs are making in the fight for clean air. And I fail to see why we should reward inaction and gross disregard for the public health and welfare. Finally. the amendment before us this afternoon does not change the law requiring State auto inspection programs. It merely eliminates EPAs ability to enforce this statute opening the way for enforcement by the courts. I believe that leaving a program mandated but unadministered creates a tension in the law which would no doubt lead to a rush of citizen lawsuits and a depreciable decrease in air quality. We cannot afford to gut a program which is effective in maintaining national air quality standards. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against the amendment to eliminate I&M enforcement by the EPA. A vote against this amendment is a vote for the environment.",

So if we extrapolate that nationwide we would have a factor of at least 10 times that for the cost nationwide on the consumers of this Nation for a modest reduction in smog. Is it really worth it? I mention this because I think it deserves repeating time and time again. There is nothing in the pending amendment that precludes any State from adopting annual inspection and maintenance of motor vehicles if it chooses to do so. We are not dealing with that. All we are saying here today is shall we continue the Federal mandate which says to the States of the Union. independent of what their legislature says. if you do not do this. friends. in those States of the Union. some 30. if you do not do this you are going to lose highway funds. you are going to lose sewer construction funds. you are going to have a construction ban imposed on your region of the country precluding any economic development of any type at all. In conclusion. just let me make this observation: I think that the prudent thing for us to do is to adopt this amendment. to tell the EPA that they may not use the appropriated funds in this bill for the purpose of enforcing a measure which the people of this country do not want. which has marginal benefit in terms of smog reduction. which is going to place a regulatory burden on all of the automobile owners of our country.

Pennsylvania will be faced with a hardship where many of its own programs and the Federal Governments programs to improve our air quality will be set back for at least a year if not longer. Millions of dollars of EPA programs will be held up. And if this is allowed to happen. clearly our own Commonwealths track record of improving its air quality will be forced to turn backward.

Because the administrations proposal provides for several substantive changes to existing law. we would expect that some opposition will surface. Accordingly. we view the bill as a starting point for discussions with the various affected principals whose concerns are entitled to be heard. An explanation of. the bill. which is comprehensive in scope. is embodied in Secretary Schweikers May 15. 1981. letter of transmittal to the Speaker. The Secretarys explanation follows: The draft bill would authorize appropriations through fiscal year 1984 for health services research. health care technology activities. health statistics activities. National Research Service Awards. immunization programs. and assistance to medical libraries. and would enact changes to provisions of law concerned with health emergencies to permit a rapid and effective response to such emergencies. The draft bill would in addition promote improved efficiency and management of Public Health Service programs. The draft bill would provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with greater flexibility to provide additional special pay to Public Health Service Commissioned Corps physicians only if such pay were actually needed to recruit and retain physicians in certain specific locations and in certain specialties in which extraordinary recruitment and retention difficulties have been experienced. The Administration believes that Public Health Service physician requirements can be met under a more flexible and targeted approach and at less cost to the taxpayer than under the approach of current law. which maintains artificially high special pay levels for Commissioned Corps physicians. The draft bill would also eliminate Federal payment for institutional support services in connection with National Research Service Awards. We estimate that total costs of $216.742.000 for fiscal year 1982 would result from the draft bills enactment. Detailed cost estimates and summary of the draft bills provisions are enclosed.",

One matter that we examined in the course of our hearings was the adverse impact on smaller communities of large corporations moving executives in and out of town.

The administration wants to reinvigorate the economy. spur development. and control inflation. We all agree that this is essential for the stability of the United States. In addition. the administration wants a strong national defense. Again. we all concur that this must be so. What the administration fails to see. or to understand. is that a welleducated population is the very backbone of a stable economy and a stong national defense. And. a firm foundation for a successful education begins at the nursery school and elementary school level. Title I serves disadvantaged children who might otherwise not receive the attention they need to build that firm educational foundation. As the following New York Times article points out. \"there is a growing body of evidence that early intervention can reverse declines and lead to dramatic increases in the achievement levels of disadvantaged pupils.\" I believe that Federal dollars spent on programs such as title I are a real investment in the health and stability of this Nation and I urge my colleagues. on both sides of the aisle. to read the following article and well consider their axwielding approach to putting our economy back on the track.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am reintroducing legislation which would allow a person over 65 a refundable credit against Federal income taxes for the amount of State and local real property taxes they pay. paid directly or indirectly through rent. Elderly homeowners often have their homes paid for. and in most cases they do not have the opportunity to deduct real estate taxes from their incomes. Because of their reduced incomes. a credit will be more beneficial to older taxpayers than a deduction. For many elderly homeowners. real estate taxes are a major expense and often can force them to sell their homes as inflation pushes property values. and therefore property taxes. higher and higher. Our present tax policies have a definite bias toward homeownership. In an attempt to assist elderly renters. however. my legislation will permit eligible persons to take a credit for the portion of their rents which are used to pay property taxes. As defined in the bill. rent constituting property taxes shall equal 25 percent of the rent paid during a taxable year. Tax credits are especially helpful to lowincome persons who usually do not itemize their deductions. In order to insure that the tax credits allowed by this legislation go to those most in need. there is a limit to the credit based on the adjusted gross incomes of the eligible persons. The credit will be reduced by the amount by which the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds $10.000. In addition. there is an absolute limit of $300 on the credit itself. Mr. Speaker. I believe this legislation merits the serious attention of the Congress. It will provide some real assistance to our elderly homeowners and renters alike.e",

Consumer. and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee. which I chair. has been conducting an investigation into the public policy implications of the dramatic increase across the country in the number of conversions of rental units to condominum and cooperative ownership. We are concerned with how governmental programs and activities impact on the conversion trend. The trend toward rental conversionswhich the Department of Housing and Urban Developments recent study predicts will accelerateraises vital public policy issues affecting the rights of tenants. the cost of housing. the availability of rental housing units. the distribution of scarce mortgage funds and the role of Government. Investigation discloses that conversions contribute significantly to increased housing costs and housing inflation. often fueled by speculator purchases of units. Conversions also result in severe displacement problems. particularly impacting on the elderly. the poor. and the handicapped. Condo and coop conversion is a particularly insidious problem where there are few available rental alternatives for the people forced from their homes. This has been true in Chicago. Boston. New York. Philadelphia. San Francisco. Dallas. Houston. and other places throughout the country. The situation in Philadelphia has become especially acute in the past few months. One of the byproducts of the conversion phenomenon is the deterioration of existing rental housing while rental owners wait to be bought out by condo developers. In Philadelphia recently this failure to made needed repairs in rental buildings which are in the process of conversion resulted in great hardship to tenants. many elderly. when the heating system in one building failed in 7 degrees temperature. The building in question had recently been sold to a developer which made cosmetic changes but avoided fixing a long malfunctioning heating system. The Philadelphia Inquirer had an editorial on January 6. 1981. attributing this situation to \"the evils of unrestricted condominium development.\" I commend to my colleagues this editorial and another article by Jill Porter from the Philadelphia Daily News of January 5. 1981. as examples of the human trauma caused by condo and articles follow: [From the Philadelphia Inquirer]",

Recently. the Board gave the goahead to the Postal Service to procure and install ninedigit ZIP code. equipment at an estimated cost of $887 million.

With the insulation of postal management and minimal oversight by the Postal Governors. the American people hold their elected representatives accountable for postal policy. This bill simply gives the Congress the necessary authority to deal with this issue. Postal policy is far too important to be left isolated from the Congress. The postal system will undergo still more radical changes in the future and the American people rightfully expect their representatives to deal with these issues. H.R. 169 takes one modest step toward meeting this responsibility by providing that each capital investment in excess of $5 million undertaken by the Postal Service. shall be submitted to the House and Senate authorizing committees for review.

Among the Nations 30 million veterans. and especially within the ranks of the 2.3 million serviceconnected disabled veterans. are thousands of blind or visually impaired exservicemen.

Presently. eligible recipients between the ages of 65 and 72 have their npisl sepurity henpfit.. redimpr if they are earning an income greater than $5.500 per year. The rate of reduction is $1 for every $2 earned. Thus if an individual becomes eligible for social security benefits at age 65 and continues to work. he or she must pay what amounts to a tax of 50 percent on their income. Mr. Speaker. this is grossly unjust on a number of grounds to those so penalized. First. to deny the recipient his full benefits is to imply that social security is a welfare programthat if someone is earning outside income. he or she does not need the income from social security. But this is not what those who have been paying social security have been told by their Government. The program was and is presented to them as a retirement program. And. although they are forced to pay into it for their own good. the payments are earned income held in trust by their Government to be repaid at age 65. In other words. social security beneficiaries are not welfare recipients or wards of the state. but selfrespecting Americans who have paid for the benefits they thought they would receive at age 65. They are entitled to receive these benefits as a matter of right. Second. the earnings limitation is discriminatory. hitting hardest those who have limited means and who wish to continue working to supplement their income. Not only are their social security benefits reduced or eliminated. but they are taxed on their outside income to finance the social security benefits which they are not receiving. A person of greater means. on the other hand. may receive his full social security benefits while drawing a large income from his investments. Third. by punishing those who work. the earnings limitation punishes and discourages productivity. Every individual has an unalienable right to pursue his own goals in life and his own happiness. and thus to continue to be productive after age 65 if he so chooses. for whatever reasons. be they financial or psychological.

I have not yet learned all the complexities and procedural ins and outs of the Committee on Rules and the rules that govern this body. but I have lived enough years to recognize a stacked deck when I see it. We have heard a lot today from our friends on the other side of the aisle about the fairness of the rule that was reported. about the democratic processes of the committees and all the input that all the Members have had into the content and the substance of the legislation that is reported. For those who are not part of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and who might be thinking each committee had equal input into this process. let me just remind the Members that the minority has had not one word of input as to the Energy and Commerce Committee bill. because the chairman signed off before we could look at it in any instance whatsoever. So we now have the Democratic bill coming out of the Committee on the Budget with one vote up or down. with no chance to put our input into it. And on the other hand. we have the minority bill and the opposition Members. under the stacked rule reported by the Rules Committee. have the opportunity under the rules to slice it up any way they want it. I would suggest. Mr. Speaker. that it might be important to point out that the definition of fairness as defined by the Committee on Rules has taken on a new meaning and perhaps our friends on the other side of the aisle ought to know that that word \"fairness\" does not apply equally to both sides of the aisle.",

Mascioli has demonstrated great leadership qualities on and off the court during his high school years. Popson. 6 feet. 10 inches tall. was an Associated Press AllState selection as a sophomore this year at Bishop OReilly High School in Kingston.

These amendments are in response to the savings mandated by the recently approved first concurrent budget resolution. As you know. the magnitude of those savings presents us with a difficult task: Curbing the growth of Federal health costs while standing behind our commitment to the poor and elderly in need of health care. Bold and prompt action is needed to meet this challenge successfully and to allow the States sufficient time to prepare for the changes. These amendments are designed to allow States the flexibility they need to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of Governmentfinanced health care for the poor and the elderly while maintaining essential services. These measures are intended for consideration in conjunction with various other proposals that are being advanced to achieve this goal. The first of the proposed amendments would allow States to begin acting as prudent buyers of medicaid services by employing more efficient means of procuring medical goods and services. This approach has recently been endorsed by the National Governors Association as a major area of urgently needed reform. Under existing law States cannot act as prudent buyers since States are required to reimburse medicaid providers without regard to the cost effectiveness of a providers operations or delivery system. By contrast. my amendment would give the States the latitude to discourage utilization of excessively expensive providers under medicaid and the authority to use competitive bidding or negotiated rates for standardized services or products.

The frontpage article. which appeared on May 22. 1981. focused on the case of Arkansas where a constitutionally imposed 10percent interest rate cap on consumer loans is depressing the States economy. Not only are retailers being driven out of business by the disparity between the interest they can charge consumers and the interest they pay to borrow money but consumers end up paying higher prices to subsidize low- interest rates or find themselves being denied credit. This is a disastrous situation. As the article points out. Arkansas is an extreme case because of the electorates continued refusal to acknowledge the realities of these inflationary times. Nevertheless. the problems experienced by businessmen. lenders and consumers in Arkansas represent a clear reminder of what could happen in other States with low usury ceilings on consumer loans as long as inflation remains a serious economic problem. I urge all Members to read this article closely and then take a serious look at H.R. 2501 which I have introduced.

Indeed. it will strain our economy and promote waste at the Pentagon. Rather than look at our defense needs objectively and submit a defense budget in line with those needs. we have just had the Carter shopping list with some modifications as to the MX and B1. But. on the whole. the administration defense package is an indiscriminate list of weapon systems. a scattered shot approach to defense in which the inefficient concept of \"more is better\" seems to underlie the whole package. Few would argue that a military buildup that saps our economic vitality will not in the long run also sap our military security. This is precisely what the administrations military plans threaten to do. The administration has indeed suggested some cuts in defense but these reductions have been too small and borne primarily by programs which contribute to our readiness. It has been proposed that we cut military pay. ammunition and spare parts. These are precisely the areas which we should not cut. These items are not redundant. wasteful or inefficient. They are crucial to our ability to project conventional military force when we need to do so. I believe that where we must cut is in the area of major weapons systems. For example. traditionally our strategic systems have been based on a triad of responses. We are now seeking to erect what is basically not a triad but a pentad consisting of: First. landbased ICBMs. second. submarinelaunched ballistic missiles. third. manned penetrating bombers. fourth. airlaunched cruise missiles. and fifth. sealaunched cruise missiles. I seriously question the need for this pentad. especially since it appears that it will be paid for in part through reductions in conventional military readiness. While some strategic redundancy is necessary to protect ourselves against Soviet technological breakthroughs. no case has been made for moving from three to five strategic systems. We must move away from the belief embodied in these defense plans that our resources are endless and that the more nuclear systems we have the more secure we are. My amendment will force the Armed Services Committee to look beyond the operations and maintenance budget for defense cuts and to make some hard choices in military weapons systems.",

I am certain that every Member in this House has his or her own priorities about how such a cut might be accomplished. However. such decisions are beyond the scope of this resolution. which only gives the authorizing committees targets for budget authority. not assignments on what must be included or what must be cut. The important feature of this amendment is that it is intended to require the elimination of unnecessary weapons systems rather than ratify shortsighted cuts in readiness functions. Because adoption of our amendment would mean we are not spending as much. we would not have to raise taxes as much in order to achieve the same deficit level. Consequently. the amendment also reduces the revenue aggregate in the Jones resolution by $4 billion. This is necessary because the Jones substitute revenue figures are apparently intended to jeopardize the third year of the individual income tax cut. Tax increases under the Jones budget substitute would be equal to 35 percent of the tax reductions for fiscal year 1983 provided in last years tax bill. While there may be sections of the tax cut that could be repealed or other revenue raising measures which could be adopted. I feel strongly about the personal tax cut. Americans have lost a great deal of their income because of inflation. and while there has been some slowing of the inflation rate. that slowing simply does not make up for the loss from bracket creep in past years. The third year 10 percent cut is a contract we should not break with the public to rectify that bracket creep.",

With adoption of our amendment. the Jones substitute would continue to have fewer cuts in domestic discretionary spending than either Latta or Aspin. It would continue to have fewer cuts in entitlements than either Latta or Aspin. It would have a smaller increase in defense spending than either of the other two. and. obviously. $4 billion less in defense outlays then Jones before our amendment. Finally. it would fall between Aspin and Latta in tax increasesproviding more revenues than Latta but a smaller increase than Aspin. I think that adoption of the GreenHollenbeck amendment would make Jones by far the most reasonable of the three major proposals. It reduces the increase in defense spending. though still providing for a 4percent real growth in defense outlays. and it increases the likelihood that Americans will have the opportunity to enjoy the 3d year of their welldeserved personal tax cut.

We are not debating some trivial amendment. We are debating the mode by which the greatest nation on this planet will secure its national defense against its enemies. It has not been divined somewhere what the right number for defense ought to be. As a matter of fact. it has been suggested. and I think it is beginning to take hold infectiously in this body. that numbers may not be the whole story on what constitutes a strong defense. It may be that a scrutiny of the weapons systems and the military strategy out of which they are conceived might be more important to determining how well and how prepared the United States of America is in the 1980s. I dare to posit such a premise during this debate. I would suggest that we begin to examine the fallacy of continuing to fund weapons systems that cost more and more money and that destabilize world order more and more. Now. it has yet to be said in this debate that the General Accounting Office has for the last 10 years uncovered more waste. more duplication. more fraud. if you will. in the defense portion of the budget than in any other single portion. or agency in the Federal Establishment. bar none. And yet. all the cost cutters apparently have not considered his. Apparently those of us who want to save from $30 to $40 billion a year by merely being efficient can only turn their skill and examination on the welfare chiselersand I am for weeding out each and every one of those mothers and their children who are drawing checks illegally. But the big chiselers. in the Pentagon. for example. the ones who rip off by the millions. are the ones that we are ignoring. So as one who can come to this well as a former member of the Armed Forces. who has served overseas in combat. who is second to no one in the defense of his country.

I have become convinced that congressional action is necessary to bolster our oversight of how the Federal Government manages its litigation. Wasteful duplication of effort and mismanagement of litigation on the part of lawyers both in the Department of Justice and in the client agencies contributes to an incessant drain on taxpayers dollars. One problem is that the authority to conduct litigation is consistently being diffused and delegated out to client agencies thereby undermining the Departments control of the management of litigation and causing unnecessary duplication. Another problem is that once litigation is initiated it is not adequately monitored.

One needed step is the enactment of export trading company legislation which will help promote a significant increase in U.S. exports. According to a study done by the National Association of Manufacturers last year. imports of manufactured goods increased nearly four times as fast as exports since 1970. with that margin growing in the last half of the decade. The study reported that our industrial competitiveness is declining. measured both by increased import penetration here and loss of export markets elsewhere. The U.S. share of world markets declined from 21.3 percent to 17.4 percent over the past 10 years. the largest relative decline among major industrial exporters. We have lost market share in 8 of the 9 EC countries and 12 of the 13 OPEC countries. While our manufactured goods trade has stayed in rough balance. Japan and West Germany in 1979 had surpluses of $70 billion and $60 billion respectively.

In particular. by overly dramatizing the military threat to the present Government of El Salvador. the administration seems to be downplaying those internal political issues that should be fundamental in shaping U.S. policy toward that nation. While I am sure that it is tempting for some in the State Department to attempt to fit the conflict in El Salvador into a larger global context. such an interpretation is inappropriate and appears designed to stampede Congress. the American people. and our allies into an uncritical support of increased levels of U.S. military assistance. The interpretation is flawed because it does not take into account those internal political factors that are fundamental. As the New York Times noted in an editorial last week: Conditions inside El Salvador. not arms from Moscow and Havana. are the main causes of this revolution. Blaming the Salvadoran explosion on imported arms is like blaming the Polish explosion on Radio Free Europe. American global interests are not well served by a definition of the problem that ignores the fundamental political nature of the conflict in El Salvador. and we can only hope that the administration will revise its course and focus attention on the real causes of the crisis in that nation.

Although the current emigration figures are nowhere near the 1979 figures of 51.000. the upward swing of the past 2 weeks cannot go unnoticed. This trend could represent a step toward Soviet willingness to comply with previously agreed international accords and could be a hopeful sign for all those concerned with human rights. Yet our optimism must be cautious. We must not relinquish pressure on the Soviets to end the mistreatment of refuseniks and prisoners of conscience until all human rights violations have been eliminated. One such violation remains in the case of Vladimir Kislik. a distinguished scientist at the Kiev Institute of Nuclear Research in the 1960s. who has been attempting to emigrate to Israel since 1973. Since the denial of his visa application. Kislik has held only menial jobs and has not worked in the scientific field in any capacity. Mr. Kislik was forcibly separated from his family when his wife and son were allowed to leave for Israel in 1973at which time he was given the impression that he would soon be allowed to follow. Mr. Kislik has been subjected to constant harassment. including threats. KGB surveillance. interrogations. and brutal beatings. Last July.

After the resolution I introduced condemning Mr. Kisliks mistreatment passed the House. he was released from the mental institution but remains locked in the Soviet jail denied emigration rights. Vladimir Kisliks case is not an isolated one. but yet another example of Soviet violations of principles set forth in the Helsinki Final Act.

Either we step into the open grave of economic collapse caused by 50 years of criminal economic policy. or start a third century of liberty and prosperity based upon the revitalizing truths of constitutional law and free enterprise. These are the choices we face. This country has seen similar moments of decision before in its history such as when we started this great Nation and at several points during the intervening years. There are. however. no guarantees we will again surmount the insurmountable. choosing the right path of constitutional law and free market economics. and even fewer assurances than ever before because of this Nations hidden enemies. My allusion is to the many individuals who have chosen to violate their stewardship as free men at this moment and have advocated the superficial. the dishonest. the criminal as solutions to our problems. This ignorance or malice is historically reprehensible. For the path that we must take and the solutions we must choose are as open and plain as they have been before. An example of just such a path and one of the men of proper convictions advocating it is Congressman RON PAUL and his bill to reestablish the gold standard. In Representative PAULS \"Freedom Report\" dated January 1981. he explodes five myths that have done much to confuse the issue of a gold standard in this country and in the world. In a succinct fashion he points out the fallacy in believing that there is not enough gold. a gold standard would enable Russia and South Africa to hold us hostage. gold causes depression. gold causes inflation or that gold would be speculative. Because it indeed points out the clear and historically proven course we must take. I commend it to the attention of my colleagues. It is about time we started facing the decisions we must make as a nation and doing so immediately if we are to avert a national disaster. The report follows:",

He received no wages for his work but did it as a volunteer. In addition. he contributed financially to the project. and has paid for materials out of his own pocket so the project could continue and CETA workers would have materials with which to work. Who can say what family might be pulled closer together by an afternoon spent at that park. or what child might stay out of trouble because he or she has an opportunity at constructive recreation?

New futures contracts were inaugurated in agricultural products as well as in metals. fuels. construction materials. Treasury instruments. bunk paper. and other items. The new CFTC had its hands full attempting to monitor this growth and to administer new programs at a time when it was creating the bricks and mortar of the agency itself. There was no gradual beginning: all of these tasks had to be performed simultaneously. Under these burdens. the CFTC appeared to start slowly. Within about 2 years. however. the agency was fully operational. In the ensuing years. the CFTC confronted major market disruptions in coffee. potatoes. and wheat. as well as the Soviet grain embargo. It tackled each of these problems. relying in several instances upon its potent emergency powers. The Commission also confronted a major crisis in the silver market that was unlike any disturbance in the 125year history of futures trading. Nothing quite comparable to this crisis has occurred before or since. there was no record of tradition or experience to draw upon in responding to this crisis.",

Despite these crises which occurred infrequently in a vast and varied futures market. I have been impressed by the maturity that the CFTC has demonstrated in responding to these events and in developing responsible new procedures to regulate futures trading. The risk of a repeat of the silver market crisis. for example. has been greatly reduced by the CFTC. which now requires limits on the size of holdings by speculators. I am equally impressed by the CFTCs commitment to address its tasks in a timely manner. For example. the agency has processed 22 new futures contracts. many of them novel and complicated. since last summer. During the same period. the CFTC constructed an options pilot program. approved the new National Futures Association. established speculative position limits. reviewed two major exchanges selfregulatory programs. and reached an agreement on jurirdiction with the SEC. Last year. the CFTC assessed nearly $2 million in penalties. or about 10 percent of its entire budget. It has rendered useful service in safeguarding Americans against fraudulent boilerroom operators and has closed more than 100 of those offices. saving millions of dollars in customer funds. During reauthorization. the CFTC urged a number of changes in the law to strengthen its enforcement powers and sought greater powers for other law enforcement agencies. Reauthorization of the CFTC is a period of intense review. and its purpose is to identify areas for improvement. This process can be used to highlight shortcomings in the agencys performance and to portray the agency in a negative way. It is important to maintain a sense of proportion. however. and to weigh the need for further improvement against the already very considerable achievements of the CFTC.*",

Superlatives seem to diminish when used to describe the career and the accomplishments of Coach \"Big John\" Merritt. But Just listen to a few of the highlights: Tennessee State University has never had a losing football season during the 19 years that John Merritt has been coach. Tennessee State University has never lost a homecoming game during Coach Merritts career here. His teams have won more than 200 games. More than 200 of the players he has coached and trained have gone to play in professional footballstars like Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Claude Humphreys of the Philadelphia Eagles. Those are some of the numbers that quantify the success of Coach Merritts service as coach. But those do not capture the inspiration and winning spirit and the contagious enthusiasm that Coach Merritt instills in his players and in the students and the alumni. He is a winner. He is royal bluea king in his profession. He is Big Johnhe dominates his opposition. But more than thathe teaches his players the important ingredients of a successful life. He leads them down the right path. His creed is: pride and poise. selfrespect. and selfcontrol. that is what he instills in his players. And his success as a teacher and coach is reflected in the success of his players in later life. So I am honored today to have this opportunity to pay tribute to a man whose heart is as broad as the boulevard being named in his honorwhose courage is as profound as any philosophical doctrineand whose abilities have brought Tennessee State University fame and renown throughout the land.*",

The projected cost for congressional printing in fiscal year 1983 comes to $90.247.000. I am sure Senators will agree that $90 million is an enormous sum of money. I fully realize that printing costs have risen dramatically in recent years. A visit to any bookstore will convince you that the \"dime novel\" is a thing of the past. We have all come to expect the costs of congressional printing to climb also. Nevertheless. I learned recently an important reason for the dramatic rise in printing costs at the GPOthe wages paid GPO employees are excessively high. In fact. wages now constitute 80 percent of the costs associated with printing at the GPO. Mr. President. in September 1981 the average hourly wage paid those engaged in private sector printing was $8.39. At GPO the average hourly earning came to $11.78. That is a difference of $3.39 per hour. Mr. President. I do not understand why the wages at GPO must be so high. Congress has the ability to control the wages of GPO employees. Under section 305 of title 44 of the United States Code. the Joint Committee on Printing is empowered to settle wage disputes at GPO. and according to the law. \"the decision of the Joint Committee is final.\" Congress has a serious responsibility to the American people to exercise fiscal restraint whenever possible and to keep our own house in order.

Recently we were treated to a headline in the Washington Post that read: \"Unemployment Rises to 9 Percent. Matching the Postwar Peak.\" But. Mr. President. as the old saying goes. \"no matter how thin your pour your pancakes they always have two sides.\" I have here a column by William F. Buckley. Jr.. entitled \"Unemployment Isnt That High\" that appeared recently in the Washington Post. This column presents the other side of the unemployment picture. Mr. Buckley points out the need to put the official unemployment figures in perspective. reminding us that the unemployment figures reflect the percentage of Americans who want to work but cannot find jobs. The official unemployment figures do not. as popularly believed. necessarily reflect the number of Americans who lose their jobs. Now let us look at the other side of the official figures. In 1979. 59 percent of workingage Americans had jobs. This is the highest percentage of employed workingage Americans in history. Mr. Buckley reminds us that in March of this year we had the highest official rate of unemployment since World War II. But 57 percent of all workingage Americans had jobs in March. just 2 percentage points below the alltime high reached in 1979. So in the same month that we had the highest official unemployment figure since World War II we also were only 2 percentage points away from the highest rate of employed workingage Americans. The reason for this dichotomy. of course. is that today more Americans than ever before want to work. Mr. President. unemployment is indeed a serious problem. It has a devastating effect on the fabric of our Nationbreaking up families. raising the Federal deficit. and undermining our economic wellbeing.

We did our work on the tax side. We increased taxes as part of the revenue enhancement program.

In testimony before the subcommittee on July 27. 1981. Dr. Donald Marlar. of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. stated: It is twice as likely that a miner would contract black lung from working in an underground mine as opposed to a surface mine.

I must say. as I have indicated earlier. that when I was asked by the administration to move quickly on this proposal.

That is where the disparity occurs. The tonnage that you are taxing in strip mining per employee potentially exposed to the disease is some huge ratio. maybe 15 or 20 times as much as underground miners. Yet you tax strip mining 25 cents per ton. raising it to 50 cents per ton while the tax on underground coal is only double. My premise is that this is not an equitable way to tax in terms of which. miners contract the dreaded disease. I am not arguing that we should not pay from strip mined coal. I just think to double it. when we do not have any understanding of why we are paying the benefits for occupational disease. is not the right thing to do.

That provision had to do with ending the practice of people taking a tax advantage by having a second home. a vacationtype home. where they would make it available for rent. and in some cases not even rent it. but they would use it for their personal use as a vacation home. To end the practice. we provided that if one lives in the home with his wife for more than 14 days. he can only deduct the depreciation and the cost of the housing to the extent that he has rental income from that house. Clearly. that is not the situation of a Member of Congress. Members of Congress did not rent their housing or did not buy housing. as the case may be. for tax avoidance purpotes. They had no gimmick in mind at the time they acquired the housing. They could not deduct it all. They had a $3.000 limitation. Under that provision. a single person would not be adversely affected but a married person would. and that was a discrimination that certainly no one intended.

The act of July 2. 1962. authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to declare an extraordinary emergency and take certain specified actions when he finds that a State or other jurisdiction is not taking adequate measures to control the existence of any dangerous communicable disease of livestock or poultry that constitutes a threat to the livestock or poultry in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture presently does not have authority to prevent the intrastate movement of animals or poultry or their products unless he can prove the animals or poultry have been affected or exposed to such disease. then he may seize. quarantine. and dispose of the particular animals or poultry. This legislation would allow the Secretary of Agriculture to quarantine specific localities and control the intrastate movement of animals and products which are not necessarily found to be affected with or exposed to a dangerous communicable disease of livestock and poultry. This additional authority would make it possible to implement more effective quarantine controls to prevent the inadvertent spread from affected localities. This is similar to the authority I was privileged to sponsor which was incorporated in the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 for control of plant pests under the Federal Plant Pest Act. Certain safeguards are provided in that several conditions must be fulfilled by the Secretary. He must notify the Governor of the State or other jurisdiction. make a public announcement. and file a notice in the Federal Register of the action he intends to take. together with the findings and reasons for his action.

This legislation amends the Federal Seed Act to change certain labeling and testing requirements that have been rendered obsolete due to a number of advancements in seed technology and marketing. These amendments are primarily technical in nature and will eliminate undue burdens and expense on both the seed industry and the Federal Government. This legislation as introduced by my California colleague. Congressman FAzio. resulted from some administrative action taken by USDA. The proposed budget for the fiscal year 1983 calls for closing of four regional seed laboratories. One of the primary functions of these laboratories is to provide technical backup in regulating the import of seed. Concurrent with the closing of these labs the administration of title III of the Federal Seed Act is transferred to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service from the Agricultural Marketing Service. This is logical since APHIS already has the responsibility. under separate legislation. for administration of the Federal Noxious Weed Act and the phytosanitary regulations governing imported seed. Another purpose in amending the Federal Seed Act is that of eliminating conflicts between Federal and State seed laws and providing flexibility to the Secretary of Agriculture in administering the act.

The industry has worked long and hard in trying to see that their tests. their labelings. abide by all of the requirements of protecting consumers and protecting the users of those seeds. but nonetheless. this is a changing technology and the needs not only of consumers but of commercial producers are such that the basic Seed Act was obstructing some of the commercial flow of these seeds which are sold not only through hardware stores and drugstores. et cetera. but through commercial seed suppliers.

And I can assure the Members of Congress that this Member and I know others will do everything that we can to make sure that any vessels that are operating in U.S. waters that are turning toxic wastes. which are very. very sensitive and very. very dangerous. will in fact be doing such in a manner that we can all feel comfortable with. knowing that they in fact are meeting the highest safety requirements.",

I would say to heck with that notion. If we can require that cotton and grain be shipped in U.S.-built vessels. we certainly should have a requirement that toxic wastes be handled in U.S. vessels that are meeting the highest possible safety standards that the United States can possibly require. We are not dealing with cotton. We are dealing with toxic chemical wastes. So we have been very strict I think in carving this very narrow exemption. I would only say that as a committee I know we will insist that the Coast Guard make sure that all vessels meet the high safety standards that we have placed in this legislation. I think it is also very clear that the narrow exemptions that we have provided for these two vessels cover only these two vessels and should not in any way be construed to cover any replacements of these vessels should one of them have an unfortunate accident or need to be replaced for whatever reason. that we are talking about these vessels. We are in fact not talking about any replacement of these vessels. but only these two vessels.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to commend the distinguished Senator from Idaho for having favorably concluded negotiations of this Federalaid highway bill with the House thereby providing us with a compromise bill that will enable the Department of Transportation to immediately apportion overdue interstate construction funds to the States. that will add the fourth R to the existing interstate 3R program and furthermore. when compared to the existing 3R program. will almost triple funds that will be available to the States in 1982 for the purpose of preserving. maintaining. and reconstructing that most valuable national asset. our Interstate Highway System. However. just as I am pleased that this Congress will at last provide adequate funds in 1982 to begin to reverse the rapid deterioration of our Interstate System I am equally disturbed that the compromise does not provide adequate 4R funds in 1983. As the distinguished Senator from Idaho knows. on November 16. when the Senate amended H.R. 3210 with the language of S. 1024 and passed that bill. we provided $1.3 billion in funds for the Interstate 4R program. This was a fiscally responsible amount that had the support of the administration. At that time. I joined with the distinguished Senator from Idaho along with my good friends and colleagues. the chairman and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in advocating this level of funding. At that time. I said that I could think of no single provision in the highway bill that was more important. However. the bill we have before us now provides $500 million less for the interstate 4R program in 1983 than our earlier bill. This is just not enough to prevent further deterioration of our Nations Interstate System. I am quite sure that my colleague from Idaho agrees with me and is now reluctantly accepting the House proposal that interstate 4R funding for 1983 be only $800 million because he is convinced that the House would have it no other way. that a refusal to concede to the House on this point could leave the Congress with no compromise highway bill to pass.",

The resolution provides authority for the President to assign U.S. military personnel and civilians to the Multinational Force (MFO). U.S. military participation is limited to not more than 1.200 persons. The administration also is authorized to provide up to 60 percent of the MFO budget through fiscal year 1982 and onethird the cost in subsequent years. Israel and Egypt will pay equal shares of the remaining costs. The cost for the first 15 months will be $135 million. The resolution authorizes U.S. participation so that the MFO can provide the functions for which it was designed. At the same time. restrictions are placed on U.S. participating forces so that they may perform only that limited role.

I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. H.R. 1465s paramount purpose is to make the Federal Government--and Congress in particularmindful of the costs that many of its bills and resolutions will require of State and local governments. At a time when Congress and the administration are working ardently to gain control over the escalating costs of the Federal budget. it seems odd that we should allow ourselves to remain ignorant of what our actions demandoften without compensationof State and local governments. Clearly. congressional statutes and resolutions are not the only national actions which impose a financial burden upon State and local governments. The agencies of the executive branch. through the promulgation of rules and regulations. and the Federal courts. with their rulings. are also the conscious and unconscious perpetrators of State and local governmental financial strain. While the Federal Government is prohibited under the Constitution from imposing direct taxes on State and local governments. it has been able to circumvent this stricture and force them. like private industry. to shoulder the costs of complying with a wide variety of Federal requirements adopted in pursuit of national objectives. The unconscionable aspect of this problem is that as we deliberate on legislation that requires State and local participation. we have not required for ourselves a necessary piece of information. namely. information that would tell us what these bills and resolutions would cost our State and local counterparts. And while State and local governments can theoretically avoid the costs of complying with some requirements simply by refusing some or all Federal aid. this option isas a practical matteran impossible recourse. Suffice it to say that this \"Theory of Avoidance\" is what it appears to.bea myth. The dimensions of this problem were brought home to me through a study done in 1980 by the Missouri Office of Administration. This study estimated that it would cost the State of Missouri. excluding any county or municipal expense. $3.832.881 in fiscal year 1979: $14.345.367 in fiscal year 1980. and",

The American Conservation Corps Act of 1982. creates a program to carry out conservation and rehabilitation projects with an emphasis on hiring disadvantaged youth. Projects can be implemented in both urban and rural areas. It is expected that Federal revenues generated from various leasing and permitting activities would be used to fund the program. Additionally. a sustained portion of the program funding goes to States for Statebased programs. This bill combines concepts from the Young Adult Conservation Corps and the Youth Conservation Corps. both scheduled to be terminated in fiscal year 1982. I recognize that there were concerns regarding both programs. but I believe that this bill remedies many of those problems. There is a considerable backlog of needed conservation work in this country. With reductions in agency budgets and personnel directly responsible for conservation efforts. the approach offered in this bill needs to be supported. Other programs that might provide similar types of services. such as the Job Corps and title V of the Older Americans Act. have also experienced reduced budgets. We need some means by which the deteriorated condition of our public lands and communities can be maintained and improved. The situation I have expressed most concern about though. is our Nations youth unemployment problem. Unemployment among youth. especially minorities. continues to grow dramatically. Even though previous youth conservation work programs suffered from lack of coordination. lack of direction and did not clearly focus on conservation. they returned more than $1 in assessed value for each dollar invested. This bill attempts to better target the program to disadvantaged youth and to those who live in areas of high unemployment. It provides youth with meaningful work. teaches transferable skills and benefits more than just the youth involved. Not only can we conserve and improve the Nations national and cultural resources. but we will make a major investment in the future of our youth.",

I campaigned vigorously in favor of a CCCtype program. The Young Adult Conservation Corps and the Youth Conservation Corps were enacted during my second term. The bill before us today. like the YCC and the YACC. enjoys strong bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker. we need to pass this bill. This program will enhance our natural resources by supplying the young men and women needed to accomplish critical work on our public lands. From Forest Service campgrounds to fish and wildlife refuges. there is much to be doneand this type of program is the most efficient way to do it. Studies of the YACC and the YCC consistently show that the Federal Government gets more in work accomplished than it costs. The other obvious benefit from this bill is that it addresses the problem of youth unemployment. The rate of unemployment among our young people. particularly those who are disadvantaged. is at an alltime high. Before it climbs higher. we should send a signal of hope by passing this bill. Mr. Speaker. I urge Members to vote for this billit is good for our public lands and our young people.",

Youth unemployment is a serious problem that needs national attention. but as usual. Congress has decided to address a problem by throwing money at another new program. In this case. the amount being thrown is at least $11/2 billion. just based upon the amounts that are in the bill itself. that is $1V2 billion of money that we do not have and as a result of this bill we will not get to aid us with our budget deficit problems. No matter how wellintentioned. the question is can we afford this program at this time. The answer is that we cannot.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4861. the American Conservation Corps Act of 1982. which is in my opinion a very timely attempt to address both the needs for maintenance and revitalization of our Nations resources and the high incidences of unemployment among disadvantaged youth. This bill was approved by both the Education and Labor Committee and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. where I am pleased to be able to state that it enjoyed broad support. This proposal is a vitally needed effort in view of rising youth unemployment rates and lowered availability of funds for maintenance of public properties. Its costeffective approach would speak to both problems in a comprehensive manner and with a minimal expenditure of Government resources. Last year you will remember. the administration was successful in defunding the Youth Conservation Corps as authorized under CETA. I must say that I received substantial amounts of mail urging continuance of the program. This mail came from the participants themselves. whose concern lay not in their own potential loss of employment but in their belief that the work they were doing truly benefited the Nation and their knowledge that no one else would fill the gap this programs demise would create. In Puerto Rico. the conservation corps has been duplicated on the State level. teaching many of our underprivileged youngsters to take pride in their land and to value their abilities to make contributions to the labor force. Passage of this bill will foster other such programs. and will reinforce existing State efforts in this area. The $50 million appropriation level in this bill would allow an extension of services to the community well beyond its monetary value. Mr. Speaker. I believe this program to be a truly effective method of dealing with the dual problems of youth unemployment and conservation of publicly owned lands. and I fully support its passage. I urge my colleagues to join with me in approving H.R. 4861.6",

H.R. 4861 presents all of us who are so concerned about the alarming level of unemployment among our Nations young people a chance to provide them a job and do something good for our natural resources at the same time. This bill was developed by the Subcommittee on Public Lands and National Parks. of which I am a member. to specifically address these two concerns and does so quite successfully. In hearings before our subcommittee. we have been reminded time and again of the serious deterioration of lands. resources. and facilities in our Nations system of parks and refuges. Literally hundreds of millions of acres are considered substandard and this figure is growing every day. At the same time. youth employment opportunities are what I would call substandard. and without a bold program like this one. the situation will only worsen. The proposal to establish an American Conservation Corps builds upon our countrys previous experience with the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Depression and more recently on the Youth Conservation Corps and the Young Adult Conservation Corps. These latter two programs are slated for termination despite an impressive record of returning a greater dollar value of work for every dollar expended. Let us today go on record in support of efficient. costeffective conservation programs that have the added benefit of providing training and jobs for unemployed youth. I congratulate my subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from Ohio. for his imaginative approach to solving these two critical problems. and I am proud to be his cosponsor of this measure.

We need to utilize and not throw away the resources of American youth. This bill. which would provide jobs for more than 100.000 young people on Federal. State. local. and tribal lands is an important investment in the minds and futures of our youth. We have an opportunity to establish a costeffective program to improve our public resourcesour parks. forests. and other lands. Young people who want to work would be given valuable training and experience while performing important public service. Because funds to support the American Conservation Corps would be derived from fees collected from private firms using Federal lands. it would have little inflationary effect. This program has a highly successful predecessorthe Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. It was one of the most successful of the New Deal programs and deserves to be emulated. The American Conservation Corps would be a significant partnership between rural and urban interestsproviding meaningful work for unemployed urban youth and improvement of our public land treasures through conservation work. The significant bipartisan support this measure has attracted shows that it is reasonable. it is prudent and it is necessary. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.*",

As every Member of Congress from a coastal district knows. fishermen are in deep economic trouble today. High fuel prices and increasing interest rates are destroying hopes of making a good income. Our Nations fishermen are in deep economic trouble today and without support. they might as well call it quits. They cannot survive much longer without assistance. Fishermen are on the downhill slide economically. In 1980. almost 8.400 fishermen were licensed in Oregon. Last year. 400 simply gave up. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife predicts a further decline in the number of licenses for next year. What is happening to the industry can best be explained by fishermen themselves. Earlier this year. I held a series of hearings in my district on the plight of small business and fishermen all across the board agree with an experienced fisherman. who told me how fishing fleets \"were built with money that was readily accessible at very reasonable rates. Today. intense competition makes the slice of our pie very thin. And when you add mortgages that are on floating interest ratesit is almost impossible to stay current.\" The fisheries loan fund will simply provide financial assistance where it is needed. Lowinterest loans are made available to owners of fishing vessels. First priority is given to federally guaranteed loans under the fishing vessel obligation guarantee program. But one may still ask why should there be a fisheries loan fund? Fishermen in my district tell me that most banks are reluctant to loan on commercial boats but will make a loan with a Federal guarantee to back it up. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support reauthorization of the fisheries loan fund and give fishermen an opportunity to make a decent living.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently there have been some misguided congressional efforts which suggest that the United States ought to ban permanently nuclear reprocessing or otherwise stated. the production of plutonium. This is the result of some unfortunately. hastily considered rationales. The legitimacy of such unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear option was ably refuted by the 66nation study initiated by President Carter in 1977 and concluded in early 1980. These nations. including the United States. found that foregoing reprocessing did not offer substantial nonproliferation advantages. It should be noted that there are proliferation threats to not reprocessing spent fuel. In fact. what better way to remove the threat of diversion than by burning the plutonium to produce useful energy? Today we have available for use the technology to reprocess spent fuel in such a way that it renders the plutonium totally unsuitable for use in a weapon. If we leave plutonium in spent fuel without reprocessing. we may be increasing the potential threat of diversion from hundreds of temporary storage locations. Spent fuel may become an attractive target to be raided for its plutonium content. Indeed. the technology of the future may enhance the likelihood of this prospect. whereas. burning the plutonium now effectively removes it as a potential weapons material later. When the United States enacted the Nuclear NonProliferation Act of 1978. we attempted to turn the clock back by unilateral action. However. what we actually accomplished was to encourage nuclear proliferation by driving the rest of the world toward selfsufficiency in nuclear fuel cycle technology. What can we expect to accomplish by unilateral action except further isolation of the United States from the rest of the world? We no longer have the exclusive rights on nuclear technology. The United States must regain its reputation as a reliable supplier to be in a position to discourage other countries from developing their own nuclear fuel cycle facilities. Our only rational approach is to work with nations desiring nuclear technology to create multinational fuel cycle facilities. so that we can influence what other countries may or may not develop and at the same time encourage effective safeguards.",

Similar legislation was recently introduced in the Senate by a bipartisan majority of the Finance Committee.

Employers who hire individuals from any of several categories of target groups can get a credit against income tax of onehalf of first year wagesup to $6.000 per employeeand onefourth of secondyear wages. Thus. an employer can potentially receive a tax credit for up to $4.500 for hiring an individual from one of the targeted groups.

Fiodorov and Murzhenko surely knew the fate that awaited them if their plan to escape failed. Both men had already spent time in Soviet camps for socalled antistate activities.

This shortsighted and uninformed proposal demonstrates just how out of touch some members of the Agriculture Department and others are with the longterm best interests of the farm community and the American consumer. Simply stated. it is a drastic overreaction to an admittedly serious problem of overproduction. The Congress has already addressed the problem of overproduction in the dairy industry twice this year when it voted to eliminate the April adjustment in March and when parity was decreased from 80 percent to 75 percent in reconciliation. These reductions have already saved over $500 million in outlays on the dairy program in fiscal year 1982 alone and must be given time to bring about the necessary adjustment in dairy production. Now. in addition to these previous sacrifices. dairy farmers will lose another $2.3 billion annually in cash receipts if the administrations. proposal is incorporated into the farm bill. This would be a death blow to thousands of young dairy farmers who are barely making it now in this time of soaring production costs. Similarly. consumers will also be forced to suffer with high prices and production shortfalls when there are insufficient dairy farmers to meet the demand for dairy products. I call upon my colleagues to exercise reasonnot reckless abandonwhen we consider the dairy price support program in the coming weeks.",

September 15. 1981. the Department of Agricultures Office of the Inspector General. and several other law enforcement officials in southeastern Virginia arrested 40 persons for exchanging food stamps for cash. The investigation showed that the. cash was being used to buy cars. guns. television sets. and drugs. including heroin and marihuana. . This investigation is one of several being conducted by the Office of Inspector General into criminal activity in the food stamp program. Yesterdays arrests bring to 600 the total indictments for food stamp fraud this year. Persons arrested for food stamp trafficking say that the stamps are just like moneythat they can buy anything with food stampsnot only food. but cars. guns. and drugs. Mr. Speaker. this years budget for food stamps is $11.5 billion. This program is intended to feed the poor and disadvantaged of America. Clearly. it is not intended to provide a second currency for criminals. Food stamps are not intended to purchase guns. illegal drugs or other such items. Mr. Speaker. as ranking member of the Food Stamp Subcommittee. I rise to assure my colleagues that I will continue to do all I can to reduce waste. fraud. and abuse in the food stamp program. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and in working with the Inspector Generals Office and law enforcement agencies in their continuing effort to crack down on illegal trafficking of food stamps.",

We. in Congress. know that we in the Halls of Congress are the ones who are responsible for inflation and high interest rates. because in 1970 we were looking at $200 billion that Congress spent to run this country and today Congress is looking at $725 billion. Congress has gone from $200 billion to $725 billion. Everyone in my home town says they cannot think of one thing the Government is doing for them today that they were not doing in 1970 except spending more money and giving America more inflation. I was interested in a statement that was made by Mr. Butcher. who is chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. and he said: There is a difference between using a dollar to finance a deficit. which is inflationary because it adds nothing in the long run to the economy. and a dollar that ends up in private investment and thereby improves productivity and creates jobs and real wealth.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the death of Roger Baldwin on August 26 deprived America of our most persistent and effective advocate for civil liberties. In all his 97 years. he never ceased working on behalf of the Bill of Rights. Roger Baldwin helped to found the ACLU in 1920. For the next 30 years he served as its executive director. He defended the constitutional rights of those as disparate as Nazis. Communists. Henry Ford. the Ku Klux Klan. Socialists. and Jehovahs Witnesses. He understood that effective protection of the rights of all citizens required the defense of \"people you disliked and feared.\" he said. \"as well as those you admired.\" Simply stated. he was deeply committed to democracy. His goal. he said. was \"a society with a minimum of compulsion. a maximum of indivdual freedom and of voluntary association. and the abolition of exploitation and poverty.\" It is a tribute to Mr. Baldwin. I believe. that today most Americans accept his credo as their own. Many of the ACLUs cases during Baldwins tenure. and since. are landmarks in the evolution of American law and society. The two that gave him the most satisfaction. he said. were the 1925 \"Monkey Trial\" in Tennessee. where the ACLU defended John T. Scopes teaching of evolution. and the 1962 case. Baker against Carr. which established the oneman. onevote principle. Roger Baldwin was truly a giant among Americans. Perhaps more than anyone else. he is responsible for insuring that the Bill of Rights is vigorously applied. We all owe him an enormous debt.

Second. the author of the article is Donald Kennedy. currently the president of Stanford University and a former Commissioner of FDA. hence his stature and ability to evaluate this process is of significance. Thus. when Dr. Kennedy suggests that the congressional oversight of FDA produced more good effects than bad. one would have to consider that an endorsement of particular note. Third. former Commissioner Kennedy goes to great lengths to describe my dear friend and former colleague. John Moss. as an individual who understood the importance of oversight and was deeply dedicated to its principles. I not only agree with Dr. Kennedys assessment of the man who helped perfect oversight techniques but as the current chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.

To lead this sensitive and delicate mission to pick up Layton. an associate of former cult leader Jim Jones. the U.S. Marshals Service chose Howard Turner of Pittsburgh. Previous missions had failed to win Laytons release from Guyana. One of Turners main difficulties was to arrive at this small South American country. via a circuitous route through the Caribbean. without publicity. Because Turner and his two assistants. Paul Pongrace and Stan Holland. were armed. getting in and out of various airports was no simple matter. The American Embassy in Guyana handled the secret release of Layton to the marshals just before their plane took off for Trinidad. By the time they arrived in New York City. the word of the arrest had leaked out. Escorting Layton to his arraignment there. flying him to San Francisco and delivering him safely to the county jail from the airport were made difficult by hordes of newsmen.

Americans have a deserved reputation for generosity and caring. The long tradition of charitable and philanthropic work and voluntarism in this country is one in which we can all take pride and which we can draw upon as an example in renewing the private network of assistance. The need to intensify private efforts in this field was recently the subject of an editorial published in my district by the Oxnard (Calif.) PressCourier. As the PressCourier points out. the result of such a shift in emphasis from Federal dollars to private dollars could well mean stronger and more effective programs. The inevitable weight of overhead and regulations attending Federal programs can be eased and money directed to the areas of most need by people on the scene. One way to assist this revitalization effort would be for this House to pass one of the half dozen or more bills which have been introduced in this session to allow the use of the charitable deduction by all taxpayers. whether or not they itemize or use the long or short income tax form. This legislation. which has been introduced by many Members. including Messrs. ASHBROOK. HORTON. ROE. HINsoN. and myself in the general membership. and Messrs. GEPHARDT and RouSSELOT on the Ways and Means Committee. would provide a needed incentive for charitable giving and a shot in the arm to private organizations engaged in this work.

I hope we will not delay any longer in taking the steps needed to have a functioning. viable. and strong network of private assistance in place as these programs are phased over from the public to the private sector. and would ask that the PressCourier editorial be printed in the RECORD.

The Fairfax Symphony is a 116member orchestra that has a stated purpose \"to bring to Fairfax County and environs an outstanding season of symphony concerts featuring international artists as well as local performers.\" The orchestras members include professional musicians. music teachers. and students plus parttime musicians who represent a variety of professions and interests. The symphony also sponsors a variety of other activities including. \"Hello. Symphony\" and the chamber orchestrafor elementary children. concert previews. open rehearsals. workshops. and masterclasses by noted artists. The yearround program emphasizes the involvement of the community in the arts with particular emphasis on the opportunities for the entire family. A highlight of the symphonys program is the sevenprogram concert series for the summer. held in conjunction with the Shenandoah Valley Music Festival.

Every time I hear him I am struck by his ability to look behind the conventional wisdom and zero in on the heart of the underlying national security problem. He has now addressed the question of tactical nuclear weapons in typically cogent fashion. While my view of the neutron weapon is somewhat different from his. he makes a far more important fundamental point. which seems to elude the sheeplike apostles of the conventional who supply most of our military commentary. Admiral Gaylers fundamental point is that longrange theater nuclear weapons are of no military significance. They do not do anything that cannot be done by existing strategic forces. If they are used to attack a target on Soviet soil. there is no way this will be less escalatory or provocative than if a strategic weapon were used against the same target. similarly. if London is attacked and destroyed by a Russian missile. the retaliatory policy of the West will be not one whit different if the missile is a strategic SS19 or a tactical SS20. If I may extend Admiral Gaylers reasoning one step further. a corollary to his proposition is that the current emphasis on arms limitation of theater nuclear forces is a sham. If we want to insure the survival of our Nation. strategic arms limitation is the key. beginning with the SALT II Treaty already signed but not ratified.

Tobacco and Firearms has played an important role in assisting State and local law enforcement and revenue officials in their efforts to stem illicit trafficking in contraband cigarettes. This effort has helped assure that States and localities receive the tax revenue from cigarette sales to which thev are entitled. For example as a result of the BATF effort. the State of Florida enjoyed a $19 million increase in revenue last year: New York. $10 million: and Ohio. $3.8 million.

In 1969. the Federal Government commenced a study for a public park. a Federal park in Hawaii. entitled KolokoHonokohau. Since 1978. this park of three private parcels has been so authorized for purchase by the Federal Government. The only problem is that there has not been an appropriation for this land. The owners have now grown old and are perhaps in their last days. They are incurring very large medical bills. They have no way to dispose of their property and if they should pass on and their heirs inherit this property. the heirs will have to pay estate and other taxes. So we have a hardship not only of the moment. but a pending hardship. What this amendment provides is that the GSA would be authorized to exchange or trade Federal land of equal value for this Federal park. in order to relieve the present burden of the ownership of that land. This would give them a clear opportunity to retrieve the value of that land which they have otherwise no ability to sell to a private party because of the cloud that is over their land. The Federal Government shows no immediate plan to purchase the land. I might say as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. that I do not see under this kind of budgetary restraint. moneys available in the park budget to make such a purchase. But we could move to relieve this unfair burden and this hardship by the opportunity to exchange Federal excess or surplus land of the same value.

It also provides clarification of authority to make an exchange beyond the borders of Hawaii. Again. we are dealing with a very restricted area unlike. say. in the Senators State or my State. where we may have a multiplicity of Federal ownership from various agencies and acreages. We have a greater restriction in Hawaii itself. So this would authorize Interior and GSA to perhaps exchange excess or surplus land without geographic limitation.",

On page 43 of H.R. 4121. section 609. it is very brief and I shall merely recite it. No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act. shall be available for Interagency financing of boards. commissions. councils. committees. or similar groups (whether or not they are Interagency entities) which do not have prior and specific statutory approval to receive financial support or instrumentality. Mr. President. this simply deletes that provision which prohibits such moneys in the support of interagency activity. We passed in this Chamber the bipartisan proposal here a week ago to set up a new Hoover Commission to study the reorganization of the Federal executive branch of Government. This does provide the kind of ongoing reorganization and review that should occur. I think too frequently we think of these Hoover Commissions as a oneshot affairit happens every 10 years or every 20 yearsand there is nothing that has to be done in between. I think one of the problems we have is an accumulation of things that should have happened in between these major reorganization studies. I. therefore. would not want to encumber any President. Democratic or Republican. from carrying on certain activities that involve interagency review or interagency cooperation. These activities attempt to break down some of the balkanization that exists by nature between the agencies. I think under such circumstances. the President should be free to reform and to propose alternatives that reduce the duplication and overlapring which occurs so readily amongst these various agencies. This amendment merely deletes that section in order to empower the President to continue interagency activities and interagency reviews. They may not need to have authorization. That is. this authority need not be set into statute. They may just be informal. ad hoc. commissions or task forces. in existence for a 2week period or a monthlong period. I do not think we should have to pass a law every time there is an interagency action that is geared toward the elimination or streamlining of the Government. which may save us money.

I believe. a very noncontroversial amendment which was approved by the Senate in a different form on the tax bill but was dropped in conference. The amendment provides that none of the funds available for the IRS can be used to impose any excise taxes on the Nations custom gunsmiths in those cases where these individuals manufacture 50 or less items annually. Presently excise taxes of 10 or 11 percent are now imposed on American firearms producers. The problem that we have today is that there are many. many custom gunsmiths throughout the Nation that manufacture only a few firearms a year and do not properly regard themselves as firearms manufacturers. These custom gunsmiths produce a limited number of handcrafted guns either for themselves or for gun collectors throughout the country. They really are not firearms manufacturers. Because there are some inconsistencies in the definition of what constitutes a firearms manufacturer many of these custom gunsmiths are concerned that the IRS will improperly judge them to be firearms manufacturers and thereby be held liable for back excise taxes. These custom gunsmiths legitimately fear that their small businesses and hobbies will be disrupted or even wiped out by just the threat of an IRS ruling.

I support the floor amendment to H.R. 6214. which. among other things. authorizes $1.853.000 for the construction of a new National Guard armory and organizational maintenance shop in Gary. Ind. The existing National Guard armory facility. built in 1924. is located in a downtown area with little training area or room for adequate expansion. The facility is old. obsolete. and is substandard for security of weapons and equipment. The Indiana adjutant general. Maj. Gen. Alfred F. Ahner. concluded the need for a new armory building because of the \"old. inefficient space with high rehabilitation costs * * *\" Authorization for a new armory and maintenance shop for Gary. Ind.. was scheduled to be included in the fiscal year 1979 program. However. the project was deferred by the National Guard bureau because of the cost. the lack of State matching funds and the lack of a suitable site. After 3 years. all problems have been favorably resolved. The State of Indiana has appropriated $580.000 in matching funds for the construction and has purchased land for the new armory in Gary. The architectengineer report has been sent to the National Guard bureau. and the completed design of the armory building and the OMS building is scheduled no later than August 31. The project will be ready to begin irmediate construction at that time. The Indiana National Guard has requested that this project be included in the fiscal year 1983 budget. However. the National Guard Bureau has not scheduled inclusion until fiscal year 1984. barring unexpected delays. Chairman BRINKLEY and Chairman GINN have indicated their full support for this project. Since all State commitments have been met. I ask for your support of Chairman BRINKLEYS amendment that will allow construction of the new Gary National Guard Armory to begin next year. The House Appropriations Committee has this date. reported its fiscal year 1983 military construction appropriation which includes $1.853.000 as authorized by the amendment.",

It adjusts the amount of land to be exchanged on a fair market value basis between the Air Force and the Houston County commissioners. The fair market value basis of the exchange is not changed. The change simply reduces the amount of land that would be involved in the exchange. The second amendment involves section 804 and is technical in nature. It simply clarifies the committees intention to conform to the requirements of section 402(a) of the Budget Act. The amendment makes section 804 of the bill effective on October 1. 1982. the beginning of the new fiscal year and makes the provision of any payment subject to the availability of appropriations. The third amendment adds a new section 806. The section includes clarifying and conforming language pertaining to the Military Construction Codification Act that was recently signed into law. The first part of section 806 clarifies the authority of the defense establishment to undertake military construction or family housing projects on land that is held on other than a fee simple basis. A recent Justice Department determination indicated that interpretation of the existing authority meant that construction could begin on land held temporarily before the Justice Department approved the title to the land. In actual practice. the defense establishment had interpreted the existing authority to mean that they could build on land held on other than a fee simple basis. Therefore. the purpose of the new language is to clarify the matter. The other two parts of section 806 involve technical corrections to section headings and including conforming language between the section headings and the reference table in that section of the code. With reference to the fee simple item. I think the gentleman from Colorado is on the floor. Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado .",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. as you know. section 804 of H.R. 6214. the Military Construction Authorization Act of 1983. is substantially different from the Senate bill. The Senate amended section 804 of its bill. S. 2586. to allow the President of the United States or his designee to sell or exchange any real property and associated facilities under the jurisdiction of the military. notwithstanding any other provision of law. I am deeply concerned about the implications of this language. This Senate amendment would virtually remove all Federal oversight by allowing the Department of Defense to sell or transfer military properties. In addition. it would supersede all existing laws which were enacted to assure congressional approval of properties recommended for sale. Fort DeRussy. a military installation used for recreational purposes located in my district in Honolulu. Hawaii. is a case in point. Existing statutory language prohibits the sale of any portion of Fort DeRussy unless Congress expressly authorizes such a sale. The Department of Defense has advised me that the Senate language. as it appears in section 804 of S. 2586. would render this statute meaningless. Finally. since the Senate language allows the Department of Defense to keep a percentage of the money made from any sale. I am concerned that the result of this policy would be to encourage the disposal of properties because of their current monetary value only. This policy would not give any consideration of the value of the asset to the Federal Government in terms of its potential to increase in value. Mr. Chairman. for the reasons stated above I believe the Senate language in section 804 would result in a significant and undesirable policy change. This provision did not have the benefit of committee hearings and analysis. I feel that this issue merits more careful and deliberative analysis than has thus far been provided. I appreciate the commitment of the chairman of the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee to oppose this provision in conference and I hope that the other conferees will review the implications of this amendment and will see fit to delete it from the final conference report.

(in my district). from the Department of the Army to the State of Illinois for the purpose of constructing a new National Guard armory. The property involved has been licensed for a National Guard maintenance center since 1949 and all maintenance of the property has been on a sharedcostbasis between the State of Illinois and the Federal Government. The State of Illinois would like to obtain transfer of this property for the construction of a new National Guard armory to replace the outdated Chicago Avenue armory in downtown Chicago. The amendment allows for the transfer of land after the State has paid an amount equal to the appraised fair market value of the land to be conveyed. less appropriate credit for costs which were previously incurred by the State of Illinois in improving the land while under license from the Secretary. The State of Illinois has already spent $650.000 filling and reclaiming this property. The value of this work transformed this land from a swampy. near worthless piece of property into a prime construction site. The amendment also includes an oversight provision which is given to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees in order to supervise and facilitate the amendments adoption. Mr. Chairman. this amendment would not result in any cost to thie Federal Government.

The modifications and additions which the bill now contains are not only acceptable but desirable. They will permit small projects to go forward in the interest of sound water resources development and will cure several other problems that are of limited scope but of local importance.

A provision of that bill prohibits the Corps of Engineers from removing houseboats and other structures from their lake and reservoir projects prior to December 31. 1989. It was the intention when we passed that bill that cabins and docks which were originally built illegally and are dangerous encroachments were not to be protected by the provision. As I say. this intention is clarified in this legislation. The Corps of Engineers must properly take action. in the face of a threat to life and property to seek removal. especially of illegal cabins which may be constructed within the area that the reservoir waters fluctuate. However. it is not our intent that modifications made to legally constructed cabins and docks are to be affected. In other words. the Corps of Engineers cannot look to some structural modification made to an otherwise legal dock or cabin and claim that it is illegal and must be removed. With this understanding.

It does not mean. however. that an individual with such a conviction would get in the country. It would merely allow the discretion to the Attorney General. At present he has no such discretion. and what is required is a private bill to come before those of us in the committee. This would allow him to exercise that discretion.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation which should enjoy bipartisan support. during this era of high unemployment and private sector initiatives. My bill concerns the disabled veterans outreach program (DVOP). which is funded under the Department of Labor. In 1977. the Congress directed the Department of Labor to implement a disabled veterans employment program. to be administered through the Job Service offices of the 50 States. All the States except one agreed to this arrangement. The State of Maine elected to fund and administer its DVOP program through a contract with the American Legion. and it has been a very effective and worthwhile program. indeed. As of November 1981. Maine DVOP had placed 3.220 veterans in jobs. at about $200 per placement. This figure represents a 61percent success rate. which is very commendable. by any standard. The bill I have introduced would permit the Secretary of Labor to fund the State DVOP programs through the transfer of funds to organizations such as the American Legion. which have had a better success rate than many of the State job service programs. In the case of the Maine American Legion Department. many of the job counselors are Vietnam veterans with prior experience in the State job service or other related areas. Since these counselors are viewed as friends with shared experiences. and not just bureaucrats. Maine veterans are more willing to approach them for assistance in finding employment. Almost 9.000 veterans have been counseled to date. and 81.6 percent of the veterans placed in jobs by Maine DVOP have been Vietnam veterans or disabled veterans from another conflict. 31.4 percent of these jobholders are disabled veterans from the Vietnam era. The Maine DVOP program operates out of five counseling centers in Portland. Lewiston. Augusta. Bangor. and Presque Isle. The total yearly budget for the Maine DVOP program is approximately $260.000. and that includes all expenses. even utility charges at the centers. I do not see how anyone could argue with the costeffectiveness of this private/public sector partnership. and. in fact. the Maine DVOP program has already received a commendation from the Secretary of Labor. I have very good reason to believe that the administration will support my legislation. and I would hope that other States will look into the desirability of this type of approach for the management of their own DVOP programs.*",

In a State of over 36 million acres of land. less than threetenths of 1 percent would be designated wilderness by the Michigan Wilderness Heritage Act of 1982. In every instance boundaries were drawn to exclude private inholdings to the maximum extent possible. Six of the areas contain no private inholdings at all. It should be noted that there is currently no congressionally mandated wilderness in the State. The areas to be designated wilderness by this legislation contain many superb national treasures including lakeshores. wetlands. and some of the only remaining stands or virgin white pine in the State.

Thereafter. in order to recognize the special needs of the smaller transit properties. that cut has been reduced to 10 percent. since operating assistance for the smaller properties is much more critical than it is for the larger properties. So that for cities under a million. cuts for transit authorities will only be 10 percent. For the smaller communities of under 200.000. their cut in operating assistance will only be 5 percent. This has been a very delicately crafted bill that has the support of the American Public Transit Association. the National League of Cities. the National Association of Counties.

The construction. rehabilitation. and modernization of commuter rail and fixed guideway systems. The construction. rehabilitation. modernization. and replacement of bus facilities and related equipment. The renovation and improvement of historic transportation facilities with related private investment. and intermodal terminals. I can tell the Senator what that means for my Statezero.

First of all. my State is one that because the House put the 85percent provision inthat is of 4 of the 5 centsno State shall receive less than 85 percent of that money back. If it were not for the House having put that language in. my State would have only received 40 to 50 percent back of the 4 cents we paid in. When you take that combined with less than onehalf of 1 percent that we will get back. and certainly that is about what we will get back. you are asking the people of Arkansas to levy a 1cent tax on themselves to send to Washington and never see a dime of it. We are just not disposed to do that. That is what the net effect of it is and I would be very hard pressed to go home and say to my people \"Yes. we levied a 5cent tax but unhappily we are only going to get 4 back. We are a poor State. with lots of unpaved roads. We have the same deteriorating highways everyone else has but we are going to give a penny to the Secretary of Transportation. who. to the extent practicable. will send us onehalf of 1 cent back if he is so disposed.\" Mr. President.

It represents a huge series of compromises with the House on subjects as diverse as a funding for abortions. a Federal pay raise. and an MX missile basing plan. As we all know the conference had to deal with at least a dozen highly controversial issues. Many of them never should have arisen in connection with a continuing resolution. which was originally devised as a means of extending the operations of the Government for a relatively short period of time while we dealt with the regular appropriations bills. However. these issues have been forced upon us by our refusal as a body to abstain from adding everything but the kitchen sink to this sort of appropriations measure. I am sure that several Members feel that we conferees should have done much better. I wish they could have been with us in the conference so that they could have experienced the pressures and difficulties created by the fact that the Government closed down at midnight on Friday and that to avoid a disastrous interruption in Federal operations we had to come forth with a conference report in less than 24 hours. Mr. President. I take no pride in this product. But given the legislative mess we had to deal with in conference and the short time period in which we had to act. I think it is about the best compromise we could come up with. especially if we were to avoid a veto that would delay Federal agency operations even further. Mr. President. I would like to pay tribute to my distinguished colleague. the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator HATFIELD. who did a really marvelous job in chairing the conference.

The Senate also had a title II having to do with a jobs program. The House package was $5.4 billion. the Senate proposed committee bill was $1.2 billion. In both of those. there was a $50 million appropriation that was made under FEMA. which would have meant that $50 million would have been distributed through United Fund groups in order to provide for immediate relief of needy people. In the conference. the House conferees indicated that they felt that it was very important to get a Presidential signature on whatever final product we came up with. And the President indicated publicly on a number of occasions that he would probably veto a jobs program at this time. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. WHITTEN. at one point in these negotiations made reference to that point and indicated it might be best for the House to recede from the jobs bill title I and that the Senate recede from its title II. the lesser package of the jobs program.

Mrs. Colvin worked with professional reading consultants to develop a training workshop to equip nonprofessionals to tutor basic reading and writing to adults and teenagers in need of these skills. All volunteer tutoring was. and continues to be done. on a 1to1 basis free of charge to the student. From that small but successful volunteer effort in Syracuse. the program grew far beyond what its originators had expected. Literacy Volunteers now operates 150 local programs and has 8 State literacy volunteer organizations. In addition to helping adults and teenagers acquire basic skills. Literacy Volunteers branched out and established a tutor training workshop for English as a second language students. In 1978. the \"Read On!\" instructional series of readers was published to accommodate the special needs of students who need a more structured learning format. Adult basic education agencies. Ibraries. correctional facilities. and community colleges have received technical assistance from LVA and use LVA methods and materials in their programs. 23.000 tutors and learners are currently working in LVA programs in 26 States and two Provinces of Canada.

During its consideration of the bill. the other body agreed to an amendment offered by the Senator from Alaska. Mr. STEVENS. which would establish a Commission on Executive. Legislative. and Judicial Salariesknown as the Quadrennial Commissionwhich would report its recommendations to the President by November 15. 1982. The President is instructed to submit his recommendations. based on the report of this Commission. soon afterwards. These recommendations take effect 30 calendar days after they are submitted to Congress. unless a concurrent resolution is adopted during that time to disapprove the raise. Put simply. this amendment means a large pay raise for Members of Congress immediately after the elections. This Commission was originally created under Public Law 90206 in 1967. In 1969. pursuant to this Commissions recommendations. Members pay was increased 42 percent from $30.000 to $42.500. In 1973. the next time the Commission worked. the Senate disapproved its recommendations. In 1977. the recommendations of the Commission were greatly scaled down before Congress failed to disapprove a 28.9percent increase from $44.600 to $57.500. And. last year. the proposed raise of 23 percent from $60.662.50 to $74.800 was vetoed. After the mess we got in by raising our pay so much in 1977. we passed a law. Public Law 9519. saying either House could veto the proposal. So. if history is a guide. we can expect the Commission to recommend an increase of 30 percent to over $80.000. The amendment adopted in the other body perverts the Quadrennial Commission. since it is not supposed to meet until 1984. returns to a twoHouse veto. and virtually guarantees us a large pay raise right after the election.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the provisions of this much needed bill were included in comprehensive postal legislation which passed the House in both the 95th and 96th Congresses. but never reached the Senate floor. I am now happy to report that the Senate has finally acted on this issue. On July 29. S. 2073 passed the Senate by voice vote. Upon its passage by the House today. and final enactment. we will at last have corrected a longstanding anomaly in our postal law concerning the mailing of parcels. As the Senate report accurately points out. the purpose of this bill is to eliminate a statutory relic which discriminates against mailers in the Nations urban areas. Since 1952. there have been statutory size and weight limits on parcels traveling through the mails. One set of limits. 100 inches in girth and length combined and 70 pounds. applies basically to parcels mailed to or from rural or outlying areas. Another. more restrictive set of limits. 84 inches in length and girth and 40 pounds. applies to parcels mailed between larger. urban post offices. The only justification for the enactment of these differing standards was to protect the Railway Express Agency (REA). which was a private sector corporation in the business of transporting large parcels by rail between major cities. The Congress believed that the Federal Government should not compete for this specialized business. Because REA served only urban areas. a more liberal standard was applied to parcel post delivery in rural areas. REA ceased operations in 1975. thereby terminating the need for the restrictive and discriminatory parcel post limitation which are still found in the statute. Unfortunately. a variety of circumstances totally unrelated to the merits of this issue have prevented repeal of these limitations until today. S. 2073 would remove the statutory restrictions and make parcel size and weight limits subject to the same administrative classification proceedings to which other types of mail. such as letters. are subject. Under this bill. appropriate nondiscriminatory size and weight standards will be determined in public proceedings before the Postal Rate Commission. All interested parties will have the opportunity to participate. S. 2073 is totally noncontroversial. Even the Postal Services most vigorous competitor for the parcel delivery business. United Parcel Service. has no objection to this bill. It is sound. publicspirited legislation. I urge the passage of S. 2073.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this is progressive legislation designed to come to the aid of the overregulated American public. What this bill does is repeal outdated size and weight limitations imposed on parcels mailed from certain post offices. The bill would standardize regulations to allow all post offices to handle packages that weigh 70 pounds and that are 100 inches in length and girth. Right now. post offices in big cities cannot accept packages that weigh more than 40 pounds and exceed 84 inches in length and girth. However. smaller post offices can process for delivery parcels that weigh up to 70 pounds and that are 100 inches in length and girth. The weight discrepancy which now exists between large and small post offices is the result of legislation enacted in 1951 to protect the old Railway Express Agency. which had offices located in the larger cities across the Nation. By limiting the ability of the old Post Office Department to process large packages. Congress made it clear it did not want the postal system to compete with private firms in the parcel post business. The REA went out of business in 1975. and the United Parcel Service. the largest competitor to the Postal Service in the parcel business. has no objections to the bill before us. This bill was passed by the other body on July 29 without opposition. It is a positive step forward in the elimination of an unnecessary regulation which has been a source of confusion to the public.*",

One of these days we are going to have to take the advice of all economists and correct the indexing. That is a fundamental thing that has to be done. Second. I would point out to my colleagues that we have to be very careful about what really causes the social security difficulties. and that is this inflation problem. One of the causes for inflation is that during the Vietnam war we had a 5year period of defense increases with no tax increase to pay for it. I think all economists are pretty much in agreement that is one of the causes for our inflation today. We had an increase from 1965 to 1970 of $26.9 billion in defense expenditures. For the next 5 years. from 1981 to 1986. we are going to have an increase in defense expenditures projected by the administration of $197 billion with no tax increase.

Since the coin slots on bulk vending machines cannot be increased above a certain size. increases in the price of items sold through the machines make it uneconomic to continue in business. The number of bulk vending machines in the United States and particularly in Texas has been declining over recent years because of this phenomenon. Under the circumstances. relief from the tariff rates. which range up to 22 percent of the imported value of the products concerned. appears appropriate.",

    "speech": "The White House. Washington. D.C. DEaR MR. PRESIDENT: Aware that you are considering a renewal of a grain sales agreement with the Soviet Union. my colleagues and I respectfully urge you to approve another longterm accord. It is essential that the United States continue to rebuild its reputation as a dependable supplier of agricultural products. The embargo imposed during the previous Administration had a devastating effect on this countrys ability to develop and maintain overseas markets for our agricultural products. Before the embargo. American farmers supplied 70 percent of the Soviet Unions agricultural imports. now. we provide less than 25 percent We commended the Administrations action last year of lifting that selfdefeating embargo. and your subsequent statements of assurance to our international trading partners which have done much to promote the perception of our reliability. We believe it is now important that the United States take actions which will substantiate those assurances. While we concur with the administration that the martial law situation in Poland is unwarranted. we dont believe that punitive action against the agricultural sector of the American economy is the proper response. It is likely that this course of action would be far more devastating to the American farmer than to the Soviet Union. With the Soviet Unions apparently substantial need for food imports and an American farm economy in desperate need of increased sales. it seems this nation has much more to gain with a longterm grain agreement. Your favorable consideration of this request would be greatly appreciated by this nations farmers. Sincerely. Don Nickles. Edward Zorinsky. Roger W. Jepsen. Max Baucus. John Melcher. William L. Armstrong. S. I. Hayakawa. Steven D. Symma. Dave Durenberger. Thomas F. Eagleton. Charles E. Orasaley. Rudy Boschwitz.. James Abdnor. Mack Mattingly. John C. Danforth. Robert Dole. Richard 0. Lugar.

All Americans have been affected by soaring energy costs since late 1973. The elderly. however. have been harder hit. in large part because they spend a greater proportion of their more limited income on energy. Since October 1973. the overall costofliving has more than doubledincreasing by 108.1 percent. However. home heating fuel oil has risen more than 3 % times as rapidly a the overall inflation rate. It has increased by 375.9 percent from October 1973 to April 1982. Other energy costs have alno risen sharply. Residential natural gas increased by 262.4 percent and electricity by 147.3 percent during this same period. In addition. gasoline has soared by 201.1 percent during the past 8% years. These mounting costs have oftentimes imposed a heavier burden upon the rural aged living in Frost Belt States. especially those struggling on limited incomes. Rising energy expenditures have caused their purchasing power to shrink more and more. The net impact is that a retirement income crisis affects a large proportion of the rural aged today and threatens to engulf many more. The legislative council for the American Association of Retired Persons is also deeply concerned about the impact of spiraling energy costs upon older Americans. The legislative council has prepared a statement analyzing our serious energy problem and its effect upon the Nations elderly. Mr. President.

As the standard bearer of those basic human rights we must not allow a weakening of our resolve or our credibility through apathy or neglect. Unfortunately. indifference to human rights is historical and welldocumented. and it is not necessary for me to recite a litany of the inhumane acts that have resulted from that indifference. Instead let me quote the eloquent opening remarks of Secretary of State Alexander Haig at the October 26. 1981 International Liberators Conference of the U.S. Memorial Council: Let us therefore remember well the signposts on the road to genocide. First. individual rights were revoked. then individual dignity was denied. and finally. in the abyss of despair. came murder itself. And genocide succeeded because the defenders of individual rights allowed themselves to be divided. because they sought refuge in illusion and weakness. They failed to fight for their own principles. They betrayed not only those who lost their lives. but themselves. Mr. President. can we as a people afford to live with that kind of betrayal? We revere our Declaration of Independence and its enunciation of mans basic rights. We honor our Constitution. the embodiment and protection of those rights. These ideals and institutions have become part of the American fabric and are known and respected throughout the world. Mr. President. one critical instrument for our continued advocacy of Human Rights is the Genocide Convention. which was specifically created for the protection of the most fundamental human rightthe right to exist. We need to constantly reaffirm our beliefs in these enduring rights. As Secretary Haig so aptly pointed out. we must not fail to fight for principles. One important reaffirmation of our 200yearold human rights tradition would be our ratification of the Genocide Convention. I thank my good friend. the minority leader.",

The Senate Committee on Appropriations increased that amount by $80.000.000 to a total of $265.970.000. which is approximately $33.000.000 above the Presidents September request and more than double the same appropriation for fiscal year 1981. The $80.000.000 increase above the House committee recommendationis for a chancery and residence complex at Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. The plan for construction is in two phases. Phase I envisions an expenditure of about $40.000.000 for the construction of a new Embassy. a new residence for the Ambassador. and a new quarters for the Marine security detachment. Phase II would use the balance of the funds appropriated to construct staff housing for Embassy personnel. The administration did not request funds for phase II. This account is already $147.538.000 over the 1981 appropriation. an increase which represents a percentage addon of about 117 percent at a time when virtually every other Government account is being reduced substantially. Although I know that added expenditures can always be justified on the basis that inflation will cause expenses to increase. it is also true that that argument carried to a logical extreme would have us appropriate now for the next decade. and not simply 1 year at a time. In my view 880.000.000 for an Embassy is somewhat high. Indeed. even considering communications equipment and the like. which I am confident is included in the price of the construction. $80.000.000 borders on the extravagant. Accordingly. I ask the managers of the bill to modify the committee amendment to reduce the amount proposed to be inserted from $265.970.000 to $230.970.000. for a reduction of $35.000.000. which I understand is compatible for construction of phase I only through fiscal year",

The committee restored an $80 million cut by the House for the construction of a new American Embassyincluding chancery. residence. and staff housingin Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. In December 1983. the Ministry of Foreign Relations will formally open in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia. At that time. the U.S. Embassy and staff must be fully functioning. In March. the administration requested $82.1 million for the construction of an embassy complex which includes staff housing. The House denied all funds for this project. The current request of the administration is for $45 million to construct only the chancery and Ambassadors residence. The staff housing project would be delayed until the fiscal year 1983 budget. The Subcommittee and full Committee on Appropriations approved $80 million to allow the Department of State to go forward with the entire Embassy complex. We rejected any proposal to delay construction because. first. it does not postpone the need. and second. it will result in immediate and substantial cost increases. I want to stress that if the administration proposal to delay staff housing is agreed to. the minimum additional cost in 1983 will be $17.150.000. The administrations proposal to delay funding $35.8 million for staff housing results -in net savings of $1.5 million in outlays in fiscal year 1982. Thus. to save $1.5 million in outlays this year. it will cost us an additional $17.2 million next year. By supporting the House action and denying funds for the entire project. we will save $3 million in outlays now and the project will cost us approximately $37 million more next year.

Ed was appointed fulltime city of Brookfield fire chief in 1965 with the task of organizing and developing a fulltime city fire department. He began with three fulltime men and a small fire station. Under Eds administration and guidance. the department now has three wellequipped stations. strategically located for quick response to all areas of the city. and a force of 42 men. well trained in all aspects of firefighting and disaster response.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is general agreement in the Congress and the Nation of the need for reductions in the Federal budget. Surely the major job of the 97th Congress will be the thorough examination and paring of Federal expenditures. As we undertake this task. I think it is extremely important that we make clear to the American people just how difficult the job will be and how dramatic the impact of budget reductions will be on the rate of inflation. It is my hope that the administration will keep in mind the need to use realism as well as rhetoric toward this mutually desired end. Utilization of inaccurate statistics and jumbled analyses in order to serve partisan political purposes would be very unwise. The American people have indicated their support for budget cutbacks. even if they are painful. the Congress will hopefully join the administration in challenging the vested interests of the powerful as well as assaulting the programs designed to assist the unemployed. the ill. the poor. and the hungry. A recent column in the Washington Post by Clayton Fritchey illustrates the rhetorical excesses of some recent administration statements about the economy. Mr. Fritchey suggests that we utilize more realism in describing the severity and nature of our economic plight: perhaps then we would find Americans better informed about our problems and more willing to cooperate in solving them.",

The new playground is especially geared to handicapped children in the area and is the first park not associated with a facility for handicapped children to center on developing motor and perceptual skills. Many recreational facilities for handicapped children are isolated and set apart from areas reserved for socalled normal children. This new playground will allow mentally and physically retarded children to interact on a onetoone basis with nonhandicapped children. allowing each to benefit from the other. It is intended to be not only a device for exploration but also an extension of the more traditional methods of teaching handicapped children. An interesting aspect of the facility is its use as a device for the physical therapist. Both handicapped children with poor muscle tone as well as children with broken bones can benefit from a program of exercises designed to use the playground equipment in strengthening muscles and maximizing muscle tone and movement. In fact. a local physical therapist is developing rehabilitation programs using playground equipment as a part of the therapy. Regarding the equipment itself. each piece is to be accessible to handicapped children and surprisingly enough that includes almost all of the usual playground apparatus. One of the most important parts of the program is the role of volunteers in making Adventure Island a success. If the time of these volunteers were to be counted in determining the total cost. the bottom line figure would be considerably greater than it is. However. numerous individuals in the Pascagoula area have given of themselves and their talents to make this a prime example of a program which successfully incorporates Federal and local efforts and financing to reach a common goal. The people of the city of Pascagoula are bubbling with excitement over this novel idea which has become a reality. They deserve to be proud of such an achievement and I congratulate them on their success.e",

The time for ratification of that amendment expired on March 22. 1979. except for those who believe that the extension. passed by the 95th Congress. removed all doubt about the ultimate ratification of the ERA. Although reports of opposition to the ERA have centered on such matters as the drafting of women into the military. abortion rights. and other controversial implications. I believe that an underlying concern in the minds of many State legislators is the fact that section 2 of the proposed ERA empowers only the Congress to enforce the principle of equal rights by appropriate legislation. thus potentially preempting considerable areas of current State authority. For example. could not an argument be fashioned that there should be a uniform. national law on the procedures for divorce. property settlement. and child custody? What about marriage. licensing of occupations and professions. contract law. probate law. and perhaps other areas of law traditionally within the authority of the States. but potentially affected by differences related to sex? Because I believe that there is a need for clarification of the law in this respect. I am again introducing a new ERA which recognizes and protects the appropriate jurisdiction of the States to share in the enforcement of equal rights. I realize that the thought of starting all over again with another ERA is anathema even to supporters of the current ERA proposal. That was a major reason behind the push for an extension of the ratification period. Nevertheless. there is a need for the principle to be established and the pending proposal appears very unlikely to be ratified. Thus. I offer my alternative with the hope that those who believe in the principle of equal rights will come to support this new proposal.e",

The adoption of this bill will give the States the opportunity to combat the Nations No. 1 highway problemdrunk driving. Drunk driving on our highways is a threat to every man. woman. and child. In the State of Connecticut in 1981. there were over 4.000 accidents involving drivers who were found to be under the influence of alcohol. Unfortunately. 166 citizens of the State of Connecticut lost their lives in 1981 because of drunk drivers. The slaughtering of innocent lives will continue on our roadways unless there is some immediate action taken to confront the drunk driver dilemma. The legislation I have cosponsored will implement a national program which will encourage the States to reduce traffic safety problems resulting from individuals driving while under the influence of alcohol. This legislation. H.R. 6170. will encourage the States to implement uniform systems to both punish and rehabilitate drunk drivers. We cannot afford to continue to ignore the fact that those driving under the influence of alcohol threaten to destroy the lives of innocent victims. By endorsing this measure. we will send a clear message to State and local governments that the Congress is willing to take action to remove drunk drivers from the highways. Although numerous States have taken the initiative and adopted stricter drunk driving statutes. I believe that this national problem must be addressed by the 97th Congress.

In addition. a national driver register will be established which will provide State licensing agencies with updated information on whether an applicant for a drivers permit has had action taken against his driving privileges in another State. Over the past decade alone. an estimated 250.000 Americans have been killed in alcohol related auto crashes. and millions more have been seriously injured. some crippled or maimed for life. Many of those killed and crippled were innocent children. The fact is. drunk driving is the most often committed violent crime in the Nation. 26.000 people were killed last year alone. by drinking drivers. For too long. we have done little to combat this serious problem. Other countries. including many Eastern bloc nations. impose severe penalties for drunk driving. In Romania. if a driver is stopped while driving under the influence he will face a lifetime revocation of his driving privileges. We should take this example and encourage all States to strictly enforce their drunk driving laws and close all the loopholes so drunk drivers will be punished and kept off the highways.

The average is more than one person per week killed in each congressional district. The numbers and averages tend to anesthetize us to the needless human suffering resulting from this criminal abuse of driving privileges. That suffering is more easily evidenced in reading the daily newspapers. both in Washington and from our districts. Check in the obituaries for deaths of persons under 55 years of age. See how often each of those deaths is the result of a drunk driver. See how many days you can go without finding an alcoholrelated automobile fatality. A number of 25.000 victims per year is too large for most of us to relate to. But. those obituaries I mentioned will show that the fatalities happen one. or two. or three. at a time. The newspaper will give you some details about the victims and the families they left behind. The frequency of these stories will give you much pause for reflection. This bill is about reducing that frequency. The two key elements of H.R. 6170 will be very important in combating drunk driving. We have heard from several States that a grant of this type from the Federal Government will make a very substantial difference in their ability to pursue the types of programs needed in their own areas. The national register of problems drivers will allow States to reject the license applications of drivers who have had their licenses revoked in other jurisdictions. It is currently all too easy for a convicted drunk driver to get a license from another State. I would like to thank the chairman of the Public Works Committee.

There is a particular provision of this bill that consitutes the reason for my reluctant support. and that is the rather back door approach to wilderness designation for parts of the lakeshore. I am not so much objecting to the actual effect. as I am objecting to the methodology used to do it. For all I know. the lands may merit the kind of protection afforded by wilderness designation. However. this bill does not provide the traditional approach to wilderness designation: rather. it merely provides that these particular lands shall be managed in such manner as to assure retention of their wilderness character pending further later consideration by the Congress. If the Congress never returns to reconsider this action taken today. we have effectively designated these lands as wilderness without the normal. more deliberate and detailed attention usually accorded such a congressional designation.

With the enactment of the provision in this bill. I doubt there will be any hurry to get around to ever considering the formal proposal in a more conventional way to follow through with an outright designation.

The first state of the parks report to Congress and the testimony presented at the oversight hearings by the Subcommittee on Public Lands on this issue leave no doubt that our national parks are being degraded by both external and internal threats to our natural resources. including pollution. development. and visitor overcrowding. Adequate protections are clearly needed now to prevent further deterioration of these important areas. Essentially. the bill requires the systematic and ongoing evaluation and management of our park resources through Park Service reports on the state of the parks and a review process by the Interior Secretary of proposed Federal actions inside and outside the park boundaries which may have adverse effects on the park resources. It is important to note that this bill does not provide any additional authority to the Secretary of Interior. nor does it apply to private actions in or near the parks. Included in this bill is an amendment which I offered in the subcommittee to help address the current problems associated with providing certain tax benefits to landowners in return for a donation of interests in 25986 C( their property for conservation purposes.

I support the resolution expressing the will of the House of Representatives to preserve the $122 minimum monthly social security benefit. This proposal is not binding but it is our only vehicle to express the overwhelming support in the House to the House and Senate conferees on the budget reconciliation bill. The conferees should listen to this mandate and act accordingly. This resolution is made necessary because the budget reconciliation bill backed by President Reagan. included the Presidents request for elimination of this minimum monthly benefit. At the time of consideration of the budget. the gentleman from Oklahoma . the chairman of the Budget Committee. had requested the opportunity to offer an amendment that would have restored the $122 minimum monthly benefit. I supported Mr. JONES request. but it failed by a razorthin margin of 212 to 215. The overall budget reconciliation bill which cut $40 billion of Federal spending and which I supported. contained some spending cuts with which I did not agreethe $122 minimum monthly benefit being one of the items. Therefore. I am grateful to the gentleman from Texas for offering this resolution in order to let the House express its opposition to this social security cut. This cut recommended by the administration would affect 3 million elderly Americans1.8 million who are poor senior citizens. and rely on this monthly $122 check for bare subsistence. It is unfair to cut those less fortunate in our society. I strongly urge adoption of this resolution.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the impending loss of the social security minimum benefit is a matter of grave concern for many elderly Americans. As my colleagues know. this House on June 26 took an action without prcedent in American historyit voted to reduce social security benefits for a group of people who were already receiving them. This action will adversely affect many of our oldest and poorest citizens. individuals whose daily budgets are already stretched to the limit and to whom the minimum benefit represents an essential means of support. Approximately 3 million people currently receive the minimum benefit. but the loss will not be felt equally by all recipients. While every recipient will obviously experience a decline in monthly income. for several hundred thousand of the most needy that decline will drastically reduce their ability to provide for themselves. A disproportionate number of those most severely affected will be women and a significant number will be over the age of 80. The loss of the minimum benefit will be especially severe for individuals in these groups because they possess no ability to make up the lost income through other means. The House Ways and Means Committee recommended that the minimum benefit be eliminated. but it realized that steps had to be taken to minimize the impact of the lost income on those least able to bear it. By eliminating the benefit only for prospective recipients. the committee acknowledged that the loss of something being received was much more harsh than the loss of an expectation to something which might be realized in the future. The committees approach was a sound one that was unfortunately not followed in the substitute reconciliation amendments offered by the Republicans. Mr. Speaker. we still have a chance to resolve the minimum benefit question in a more equitable manner. I would hope that the overwhelming approval of House Resolution 181 today would demonstrate a commitment on the part of the House to take the steps necessary to insure that the minimum benefit continues for those already on the social security rolls. To do otherwise would be a grave mistake and would work an unwarranted hardship on many people who cannot. and should not. bear it.e",

I rise in support of the gentlemans resolution which expresses the sense of Congress that those presently receiving the minimum social security benefits should not have those benefits reduced. As a former member of the House Select Committee on Aging. I am very familiar with the many financial hardships forced on our elderly population. Because of this. I cannotin good conscienceignore these financial difficulties and vote for what I believe to be a breach of faith between the U.S. Government and its elderly citizens. I cannot vote to cut minimum benefits for people already receiving social security benefits. for people who were lead to believe they could count on those benefits. I believe a person should do what he says he will do. and I believe the U.S. Government should do what it has pledged. We have a contract with American workers who participate in the social security program and with retirees who rely upon social security for a portion of their income. We must not make drastic or abrupt changes which do not give workers enough time to adjust their retirement plans. and we should not change the terms of their contract after they retire. Changes within the social security system will be necessary. and I am prepared to make the tough decisions required to save social security from pending bankruptcy. But. I do not feel it is fair to force people who are now receiving minimum benefits to step lower on an already sinking financial ladder. For these reasons. I support House Resolution 181.e",

It is clear that this resolution will pass and pass overwhelmingly. I must say that I am somewhat surprised to see the large number of Republicans who seem to be in opposition to cutting the minimum benefit. After all. many of these same Republicans supported the GrammLatta reconciliation package which eliminated the minimum benefit. Many of these same Republicans opposed a rule which would have allowed us the opportunity to vote to preserve the minimum benefit. Now they will join the Democratic majority in a lastditch effort to save the benefit. Unfortunately it may be too late to save the benefit. This resolution is not a binding one on the House conferees. The Senate conferees have not been instructed in this area. Supporting this resolution may take some of our Republican friends off the political hook but it probably will not save the minimum benefit. I would urge our Republican friends to tell the President and OMB Director Stockman to back off on this issue. Public sentiment is clear. Most Americans do not want to penalize our neediest senior citizens. Elimination of the minimum benefit will reduce the incomes of 1.5 million elderly people. Tens of thousands of Americans above 90 will be forced to the edge of poverty if we strip them of this benefit. As I have said again and again. we must notwe cannotbalance the Federal budget on the backs of our senior citizens. Eliminating the minimum benefit will not do much to balance the budget but it will greatly increase the sum total of human misery in this country. The minimum benefit must be preserved.*",

JIM WRIGHT. in support of House Resolution 181. and I was proud to cosponsor this bill to put the House of Representatives on record in opposition to reducing social security benefits for those who now receive them. On June 26. by a vote of 217 ayes to 211 noes. the House voted to abolish the $122 social security monthly minimum benefit as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. I voted against this legislation for many reasons. but I felt that one of the saddest and most inexcusable parts of the bill was the section removing social security benefits. without warning. for many helpless. elderly people who are now on the rolls and have no other way of planning for their retirement. The minimum benefits goes to about 3 million elderly citizens. most of whom have no other source of income. Many of them are women over the age of 70. and are dependent on that $122 payment each month to buy groceries and pay rent. The HouseSenate conference committee on the budget bill will soon meet. and I strongly urge my colleagues to give their overwhelming support to House Resolution 181. and put the House of Representatives on record in opposition to this cruel cut in social security benefits for our senior citizens who already receive them.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the debate on minimum benefits to social security is not a technical financing question. We have a fundamental question that has to be asked before we go to the details of social security. Are the elderly in this country. by and large. being given too large a share of the national income? I think the answer is manifestly no. And that is the answer that leads us to the minimum benefit question. A few people may be getting the minimum benefit who are not very much in need. but for a large number of people. that minimum benefit is the difference between absolute. grinding poverty and some margin of existence that is tolerable. To take away that minimum benefit from existing recipients totally without regard to need is wholly unjustified. Let me read just one letter symptomatic of many I have received from recipients of the minimum benefit. who will now lose it and will lose their homes in consequence. Teachers are notably poorly paid. Consequently. how do you save for old age? We have never gone to the government for any help in our long lives. This current legislation to take away our minimum Social Security seems an unforgivable way to reward a truly admirable life. That was written by a woman about her husband. He is going to lose the minimum social security benefits. They are going to lose their home. They will not starve to death. but they will live a minimal existence. hardly what at the age of 73 they are entitled to from this country.",

I believe that we must draw the line with regard to social security retirement benefits which are the foundation for the basic necessities of life for millions of our senior citizens. I believe that we all agree that the social security system must be stabilized. It has been my position that any legislation involving the social security system must meet three basic criteria: First. it must stabilize the system. Second. it must not reduce benefits to current recipients. Third. changes for future recipients should be several years away to allow for appropriate planning for retirement. The senior citizens presently receiving social security benefits have paid their dues. have made their contribution and were given a contract by the Federal Government. That contract should not be violated. We have a responsibility to our senior citizens to keep our commitments. I am presently supporting and seeking a separate vote on the social security issues included in previous budget packages. I believe such a vote is possible and necessary. I also plan to push in the future for the same type of separate vote on the twiceayear costofliving increase (COLA). Additionally. it is important to bring Members of this House and groups of organizations together who are concerned about these issues to develop a more reasonable alternative to the administrations proposal on social security.@",

Cutting the minimum social security benefits is the cruelest cut of all. Almost twothirds of 3 million minimum beneficiaries are over age 70. 500.000 are over age 80. Most elderly women did not have the opportunity to make a higher salary when they were in an earning position. Approximately 2 million of these people will actually suffer an average social security benefit reduction of more than onethird next April.

I do not favor pulling the rug from beneath the older citizens of our country who depend on their social security checks to help make ends meet. In a country as rich as ours. I believe our Government can and should afford to help those older Americans who are least able to help themselves. Now this Government is sending all kinds of signals and omens that there is not going to be any more social security program if we do not take drastic steps. And this administration has taken the ultimate drastic step in suggesting that Congress eliminate the minimum benefit. that small $122 a month which some 2 million current social security recipients receive because of the low wages they earned throughout their working lives or because they had not been covered by the required number of quarters to earn a more respectable benefit. This administration is not merely proposing to eliminate the benefit for those who will come on the rolls in the future and determine other ways to take care of these people. This administration is demanding that we cut off this meager resource for those who are right now receiving this small monthly benefit. Mr. Speaker. I voted against the GrammLatta II budget which contained the provision to eliminate this minimum benefit. but I am proud that this body has had the foresight to reconsider this proposal and has given the Members a chance to reconsider the issue.

I know she has expressed. as some of the members on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee have expressed some concern with this section. The gentlewoman raises some very valid questions and concerns dealing with section 414. The committees intention by including this provision in the bill was twofold. The first objective was to place some uniformity upon overtime payments for agencies funded in this bill. Currently. different agencies funded in the bill have varying cutoff points above which overtime is not paid. The committee felt these levels should be more uniform and believed that the provision would accomplish that. In addition. the limitation would result in not insignificant savings. Although it is hard to determine precisely the amount of overtime which might be paid to GS10s and above in 1982. a rough estimate would be approximately $5 million. However. let me assure the gentlewoman from Ohio and this committee that the Appropriations Committee did not intend to cause serious problems with this general provision. It has come to our attention that the interpretation of certain sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act would require revision if the provision is adopted in this form. Section 213 of that act states that within the Government service. administrative. executive. and professional employees are exempt from the overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act. An Office of Personnel Management regulation details which specific classifications and grades are considered nonexempt under the actand thus due overtime pay for additional work. The committees provision as reported in the bill would require certain revisions to that regulation. In addition. certain people have questioned the effect of the overtime provision on health care within the Veterans Administration health system and upon responses to disasters under the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The committee certainly does not intend for the overtime provision to impair in any way VA health care or FEMA disaster relief responses. The Appropriations Committee will review these issues very carefully and make appropriate adjustments in conference with the Senate. I thank the gentlewoman for her concern in this area.",

Neither of these policies are in our countrys national security interests. I strongly urge those who will shape the course and direction of ACDA in the next 31/2 years to make a sound arms control agreement one of this administrations highest priorities. The United States cannot have an effective national security policy without an arms control treaty which would limit specific Soviet weapons and alter the way the Soviets shape their strategic forces. Nor can we afford the cost to our economy and our efforts to fight inflation of an unlimited nuclear arms race. I hope Mr. Rostow will follow through on his pledge to do all he can to shorten the time it takes to get new negotiations with the Soviets started. We cannot afford indefinite delays in such a critical endeavor. I also hope the administration will reconsider making certain Soviet action a precondition for resuming negotiations. This approach flies in the face of the very reason we should be negotiating -a treaty. Arms control agreements are not needed among friends. By definition. they are between rivals. if not outright antagonists. The purpose of strategic weapons treaties is to reduce the possibility that alreadyexisting tensions will escalate to nuclear war. In fact. the more one distrusts the Soviets. the more one assumes a continued weapons competition with them. and the more one assumes a continued strategic buildup by them. then the more one should support arms control agreements which put limits on the Soviets. Unless and until we are able to achieve a new arms control agreement with the Soviet Union and thereby reduce the chances of nuclear war. we will never be a country that is truly strong and secure.*",

Unlike the kinds of environmental impacts that are now routinely considered pursuant to NEPA. psychological health and wellbeing are not objectively determinable or measurable. I feel that the courts decision in the Pane case will lead the Commission. and perhaps other Federal agencies as well. into a morass of speculation and subjective judgement. This decision might well lead to protracted hearings in which competing panels of psychologists and psychiatrists argue about the state of mind of the community. Perhaps the decision may even require public referenda in cases where psychological stress is alleged. Certainly. whatever means the Commission selects for assessing psychological health and wellbeing is likely to be challenged as inadequate. leading to further litigation and delay.

We discussed this matter with the Commission in our budget hearing earlier this year. Although several of the Commissioners expressed serious concerns about the Pane decision. particularly if it extends beyond the restart of TMI1. the Commission was unable to provide us with an assessment of the precise scope and impacts of the decision. Thus. as a consequence of the courts failure to complete its work in this case. the committee has not yet been able to assess the scope of the decision or its likely impact. Given the seriousness of legislating any changes to NEPA. some of our colleagues have urged postponing any legislative action until after the courts opinions become available and the committee is able to assess the scope and impact of the decision.

If passed. this bill would require that imported potatoes certified as seed stock must actually be used as seed in order to receive the favorable tariff treatment provided for imported seed potatoes. Currently. virtually all imported seed potatoes are from Canada. By including an enduse requirement in the tariff classification of seed potatoes. this bill would close what many potato growers perceive as a loophole in our tariff laws. Under the agreement negotiated during the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. there is a tariff of 36.5 cents per 100 pounds on potato imports. At specified levels. the tariff rises to 60 cents. This level is 114 million pounds for seed potatoes and only 45 million pounds for table stock. Once the lower table stock quota is reached. there is an incentive for importers who want to sell potatoes for human consumption to purchase seed potatoes and repackage them as table stock. This gives the importer tariff and grading advantages associated with the lower quality seed potatoes. This marketing of imported seed potatoes as table stock has been a major complaint of Maines potato growers. In recent years. they have witnessed the Canadians filling their table stock quota first and then labeling their imports as seed potatoes. This is unfair to U.S. potato growers marketing table stock potatoes and unfair to consumers who are unknowingly purchasing seed potatoes. This practice is not prohibited by law. since the tariff law only requires that potatoes be certified as seed. not actually used as seed. Failure to have an enduse requirement in the definition of seed potatoes essentially renders the distinction between seed and table stock meaningless. Adding this enduse requirement to the tariff law would deny the tariff and grading advantages to imported seed and allow U.S. potato growers to compete on a fair basis with imported potatoes.* By Mr. MOYNIHAN:",

This bill will allow companies to donate computers and other technological equipment to elementary and secondary schools. This donation will give public school systems the opportunity to significantly expand their capacity to provide students with training and instruction in the use of technological equipment of the future. In addition. this legislation will allow a company to donate a maximum of 30 percent of its taxable income for a temporary period of time. The current ceiling for such donations is set at 10 percent of the companys annual income. In an era of budget cuts and limited funds for educational programs. I appreciate the desirability of obtaining such costly items as computers and technological equipment by private sector donations. Basic technological and computer training for Americas youth is a necessary step to insure our countrys future position in the worlds rapidly expanding and competitive high technology areas. I therefore urge my colleagues to support and pass this vital legislation.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5573. relating to contributions of computers to certain schools. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 established special rules governing the deductibility of contributions made to colleges or universities of scientific equipment used for certain types of research. These rules are not applicable to contributions to primary and secondary schools. Current budget problems prevent many school boards and districts from providing pupils with computers and related equipment needed to develop the skills required in the Job markets of the future. H.R. 5573 attempts to correct this problem to a limited degree by extending the principles of the 1981 act to certain contributions of computers that are made to primary and secondary schools. Specifically. the computers must be donated during 1983 and within 6 months of their completion to primary or secondary schools under a program that results in the computers being distributed to schools that are diverse in terms of location and economic status. Other requirements are provided. H.R. 5573 Thus provides a limited incentive.*",

I wish to express may strong support for this legislation and urge its immediate passage. Consideration of this bill comes at a time when we find education at the crossroads. School budgets at the local level are being stretched to the limit as a result of massive cuts in education fundingnearly 25 percent in the past 2 years. This bill will provide a small. but important incentive for incorporating educational technology into our schools. It allows a 1year rule. for 1983 only. for charitable contributions of newly manufactured computers to primary and secondary schools. It provides assurance that in the provision of such equipment to schools. that there be geographical equity as well as educational access to the services of these computers by children of all income levels. This legislation was generated by the offer of the Apple Computer Co. to give their computers to schools next year. At a hearing conducted before our Select Education Subcommittee last week on educational technology. we learned that a variety of computerIzed devices are available to schools to assist them in teaching both studetns and teachers. We also learned that there are a number of companies which are involved in this area. It is my hope that this legislation would provide a substantial incentive to other computer companies to follow the lead of Apple and donate there equipment to schools. The companies will benefit. as will the students and their teachers. Mr. Speaker. in light of our present lack of adequate resources for educational programs. we must look to alternative methods of instruction which will serve the greatest numbers of people at the least cost. It is clear that computers are and will continue to be vital to this effort. particularly with advances in technology which make greater numbers of computers available to more people at lower costs. This bill is a forwardsighted piece of legislation that would provide important incentives to schools and private industry to look to technology for our schools. I urge its immediate adoption.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 7093 deals with certain taxes imposed by the Virgin Islands on payments of passivetype income to U.S. corporations and individuals. Under present law. the Internal Revenue Code of the United States is generally applied as the local tax law in the Virgin Islands. Under the code. the Virgin Islands may reduce its income tax only for United States and Virgin Islands corporations that earn a significant portion of their income in the Virgin Islands. The Internal Revenue Code requires the Virgin Islands to impose a 30percent tax on passive investment income paid by Virgin Islands persons to nonVirgin Islands persons. including U.S. persons. The Virgin Islands cannot now forgive this tax. Although there is some dispute about this tax liability for the recipient of passive investment income from the Virgin Islands. it is the position of the Internal Revenue Service that the recipient is liable for the tax. The current 30percent tax on the gross amount of passive investment income paid by Virgin Islands persons to U.S. persons discourages investment by U.S. persons in the Virgin Islands. Because no deductions . are allowed. the tax on this income. in mahy cases. is higher than the regular corporate or individual tax would be if deductions were allowed. Reduction of this tax will remove as impediment to investment in the Virgin Islands by U.S. persons. H.R. 7093 will reduce the 30percent tax imposed by the Virgin Islands to 10 percent when the recipient is a U.S. individual or corporation. and will impose a corresponding withholding obligation on the Virgin Islands payor of the income. The bill will allow the Virgin Islands Government to reduce this 10percent rate further in Its discretion. The bill will not affect payments of Virgin Islands source passive income to nonU.S. persons. The bill is expected to have a negligible effect on budget receipts. Mr. Speaker. I urge adoption of H.R.

I think the House should adopt it. But I think we should all understand that this implies no obligation on the part of the U.S. Government to make up any of this revenue foregone. I am delighted to see that the people of the Virgin Islands have become determined supply siders. They believe increased investment is actually going to increase tax revenues. So do I. There may have to be. however. a slight lag. I Just want them to be sure that they are prepared for that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

First. it permanently eliminates the duty on products which have not been made domestically for years and are not likely to be produced here in the foreseeable future. Second. the bill makes temporary duty suspensions on items which are not now being made In this country. but which might be produced domestically at some time in the future. Third.

This bill is a compilation of various tariff measures that were referred to the Trade Subcommittee during previous months. Each provision has been carefully examined for its effect on the economy and for its consistency with U.S. trade policy. The subcommittee worked closely with the administration and sought privatesector comment. Any measure that was found to be controversial. or that required further study. was put aside to be worked on at a later date. H.R. 6867 includes duty reduction and suspension measures designed to change outdated items in the Tariff Schedules of the United States. One such provisionsection 120resulted from legislation that I introduced last year to repeal the tariff on an industrial prepolymer resin. The substance. allyl resin. is used in making engineering plastics that eventually go into producing electric and electronic components. There is an 8percent ad valorem duty on the substance that is scheduled under the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) to be reduced to 5.8 percent by 1987. This is a protective tariff: Prior to 1980 a domestic producer furnished the substance. The U.S. firm has ceased production. however. and there no longer is a domestic interest to protect. H.R. 6867 will remove this unnecessary tariff that is ultimately passed along to consumers. Additionally. the electronic connectors that are manufactured with allyl resin go into computers. process controllers. and telecommunications equipment. Spokesmen from the full political spectrum have acknowledged the role that hightechnology advancement holds in creating jobs. revitalizing the economy. and making the United States more competitive in international trade. It is to our advantage to relieve the industry of this nonproductive tariff. I urge my colleagues passage of H.R. 6867.

April 24 marks the 66th anniversary of the planned and systematic massacre of Armenians of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. This is how the Encyclopedia Britannica describes that terrible moment in world history: The greatest single disaster in the history of the Armenians came with the outbreak of World War I. In 1915 the Young Turk government. regarding the Turkish Armenians. despite pledges of loyalty. as a dangerous foreign element with friends among the enemies who had launched the Dardanelles campaign and with cousins in the Russian army on their eastern front. resolved to deport the whole Armenian population of about 1.750.000 to Syria and Mesopotamia. The chances of survival in these illprepared desert regions were slight: it was a death sentence. a \"final solution\" that Adolf Hitler was to emulate consciously in Germany. This summary does not. of course. even hint at the documented atrocities committed against innocent human beings during this extermination. \"Starving Armenians\" became a phrase that was on everyones lips for a few years. But. as Hitler later pointed out. people forget. The attempt to eliminate the entire Armenian populatin of Turkey was forgotten. Hitler was betting on the same kind of historic amnesia. brought about by ignorance and laziness. when he went about his own campaign of calculated slaughter of innocent civilians against the Jews and the Poles and others. Today the ideological fanaticism that led to the slaughter of the Armenians and the Jews still exists in the world. Ask the Cambodians. and the boat people. ask the survivors of the Soviet gulag. We owe it not only to the memory of the Armenians but to our children and to their children to make certain we never forget that such things have happened. and that such things can happen again unless we are vigilant.*",

The worlds first genocide almost succeeded. for it left less than onequarter of the entire Armenian population living. Hundreds of individuals at a time were systematically and brutally murdered. merely for being Armenians. Those who escaped death were forced to flee their homeland and separated from family and friends. The Armenians became few and scattered. yet never giving up hope that their persecutors would be punished for their atrocious crime. Today the Armenian people remain scattered around the globe. still hoping that someday justice might be delivered for their great suffering. Today the Members of this great House ask that the Armenians receive justice. and their grievances be brought before the General Assembly of the United Nations for resolution and redress.

His mother. father. and four sisters were given permission and forced to leave the Soviet Union. while Mr. Bogomolny was drafted in the army. Completing his service in the army. Benjamin Bogomolny applied in November 1972. for permission to emigrate. His application was denied in April 1973. on the grounds that he may have learned state secrets while in the army and that he constituted a threat to national security. Benjamin Bogomolny has been under constant harassment since he first sought a visa. His telephone has been disconnected. his apartment ransacked. Hebrew books stolen. and his life threatened during this period. The Soviet police have made no attempt to investigate his complaints. An example of this treatment was reported in the May 1975 Jerusalem Post. It was stated that he was a victim of a minipogrom as the KGB stepped up its campaign to crush the Jewish activists in the Soviet Union. The paper wrote that he was manhandled by two drunks. Returning home later. he found the same two drunks. now fully sober. and 12 other men wielding clubs and shovels and breaking things in his apartment. Benjamin Bogomolny. whom the men threatened to hang. escaped through a back window and immediately complained to the police. On visiting the police precinct the following day. he discovered that there was no record of his complaint. The police denied any knowledge of the incident. In addition. the Jerusalem Post reported that a student who rents a room from Mr. Bogomolny was warned by the police that he should not sublet a room from a man who wished to emigrate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to pay tribute to Americas beloved Joe Louis who died on April 12. 1981. Joe Louis. one of the greatest boxing champions of all time. was much more than the master of the boxing ring. He was a champion of his people. the American people of every color and race. He was a champion of the American dream. The son of a poor Alabama sharecropper. he triumphed over poverty and oppression to become an American folk hero. The \"Brown Bomber\". as Joe Louis was affectionately known. played a prominent role in 20th century social history. His rise to the top of the boxing world gave encouragement and hope to all disadvantaged and minority Americans. especially blacks. With every victory. Joe Louis lifted their morale and spirit. Louis once remarked. \"some folks shout. some holler. some march. and some dont. They do it their way. I do it mine.\" And so he did. Using his legendary power. Louis shattered stereotypes and oppressive social barriers. His courage and candor opened the door for future pioneers like Jackie Robinson and Arthur Ashe. This giant of a man instilled pride in all Americans at a crucial time in our history. As tensions mounted between the United States and Nazi Germany in 1938. Joe Louis dispelled in one round the myth of Hitlers \"paragon of Teutonic manhood\"-knocking out Max Schmeling. When America needed him most. Joe Louis gave generously of his physical and moral strength. By the end of his military service he had fought 96 boxing exhibitions. entertaining some 2 million American troops all over the world. \"I aint fighting for nothing.\" he once said. \"Im fighting for my country.\" Mr. Speaker. I will remember Joe Louis simple dignity. honesty. and compassion. His life remains an example for us and for our children. As one prominent sportswriter of Joe Louis era once wrote of him. \"He is a credit to his racethe human race.\"*",

Everyone agrees there was overproduction. But take a look at what we have done. We began this year at 80 percent semiannual at a cost of about $2 billion. In April we eliminated the April 1 adjustment. saving $190 million. and in reconciliation we went from 80 to 75 percent. saving another $380 million. In the Bedell amendment. which we have just adopted. we went from 75 down to 13.10 this year. saving another $300 million. and by eliminating the semiannual adjustment for next year we save another $100 million. Already this year we have saved in the dairy program $982 million. a 48percent reduction in the cost of the dairy price support program to this Federal Government. We do not ask that of any other commodity. Every other agricultural commodity is getting an increase. Only dairy is being cut. The gentleman from Massachusetts talks about free enterprise. a free market for dairy. I would like to have a free market for dairy if we had a free trade in this country.

Many believe that farmers must only tend to their cows a few hours per day. then rest and wait for their Government checks. Nothing could be further from the truth. Todays dairy farmer is one of the most hardworking productive members of our society. He rises before dawn and works beyond dusk. He provides dairy products at a reasonable price. asking for only a modest profit above his cost of production. Farm income over the years has not kept pace with incomes in other professions. From 1975 through 1979. the farmer had a return on his capital investment of about 4.5 percent. Manufacturing. during that same period. had a return of 14.3 percent.

Ask the consumers. Do we want to go back before 1949? In the winter the price of dairy products skyrocketed and there was shortages in the stores. In the spring and summer they had all the milk they wanted and the prices plummeted and every year 20.000 dairy farmers went out of business. Do we want to go back to those days? This is what the 1949 program set up. a stable system. Sure we may have erred 4 years ago in increasing the price support to 80 percent. How could we foresee what was going to happen?

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill authored by Senator LUGAR which provides emergency legislation to aid the severely distressed housing industry and put over 700.000 Americans back to work. Unemployment in the construction industry is now at almost 19 percent. A large portion of this is in housingrelated Jobs. an unemployment sector which has been extremely hardhit by high interest rates. This. of course. is emergency legislation. This would not be an ongoing Federal program. but rather would be limited to 5 years or until interest rates fell below 12% percent. This program would reduce mortgage interest rates to qualified homebuyers by up to 4 percent. By cutting mortgage costs in this way. this program would allow upward toward 7.8 million American families to afford a new home. The overall cost of this program. if fully utilized would be $5.1 billion. However. these funds will be returned to the Federal Treasury as homeowners who take part in this program sell or refinance their homes. As unemployment grows and the number of bankruptcies increases. we are undercutting future growth in home construction in the future. If we do not have the construction base necessary to meet demand when recovery occurs. then new home prices will zoom. similar to that experienced in the mid1970s. as pentup demand competes for Just a few new homes. But perhaps most important of all. this legislation wou.1d revitalize the American dream of owning ones home. Currently. most low- and middleincome families have been priced out of the housing market because of high interest rates. No longer are they able to contemplate owning their own home. This legislation would provide an immediate and substantial stimulus to the housing industry and would make available to lowand middleincome families affordable mortgage homes. If this particular legislation is adopted before June of this year. over 700.000 Americans could be put back to work. Construction starts alone could be raised by as many as 450.000 units. This is temporary. emergency action designed to create jobs immediately. While Congress has taken many steps to lower Federal spending. reduce taxes. and encourage investment. it is clear that we still need shortterm help for the failing home construction industry. We must build upon this firm basis and insure that economic recovery will be felt by all sectors of the economy.*",

These hearings are especially timely in a world which seems to contain increasingly repressive and intolerant regimes. Religious persecution may seem like a distant problem to a nation which has put its intolerance behind it. However. totalitarian regimes. those governments that cannot rely on the will of the people they claim to represent. have been stepping up their campaigns of repression. Religious persecution is a hateful policy especially pursued by the Soviets and the Iranians. In Iran. the plight of the people of the Bahai faith is tragic. Since the 1979 revolution in which the Ayatollah Khomeini took power. 111 Bahais have been executed. Reliable reports indicate that these people were murdered solely because of their religion. They were arrested and executed without even the pretense of the trial. We may only speculate as to how many more are languishing in prisons. their fates and conditions unknown. Mr. Speaker.

I find the bill wholly unacceptable for reasons of commission as well as omission. This conference report like the original Senate bill fails to correct an obvious inequity in the pricing of irrigation benefits by two Federal agencies. Under S. 1409. beneficiaries of irrigation water from Bureau of Reclamation projects will be required to pay the full costthat is. the principal and interest for the water received to irrigate lands above the 960acre limit. Corps of Engineers projects on the other hand. will not be subject to these same fullcost provisions. even though these projects provide identical irrigation benefits and have a specific percentage of project costs allocated to irrigation. There is no rationale for the Federal Government to charge a different price for the same service. I offered an amendment on July 16. 1982. to correct this inequity and the Senate rejected the amendment. The bill as a whole remains seriously flawed. At my request. the Department of the Interior prepared a cost estimate of the conference agreement on S. 1409. According to the Department. a mere $17 million in additional revenue will be returned to the Treasury in each of the next 3 years. increasing to $34 million thereafter.

In truth. the General Accounting Office found that this program returns only 10 cents to the Federal Treasury for every dollar spent. On paper. the supporters of the Bureau of Reclamation claim the program pays for itself. In reality. the Congressional Budget Office and the Water Resources Council have found otherwise.

It is for these reasons that I shall vote against S. 1409. Mr. President. I repeat briefly as to the reclamation reform bill that. with respect to Federal funds. it neither reclaims them nor does it reform the program. The conference report is a marginal improvement. but no more than that. We once again see the old boodle. the immemorial larceny of these programs. Mr. President. the law provides that irrigation programs pay for themselves. that they not cost taxpayers 1 cent in the long run. This does not do that. There Is a certain truth in packaging that ought to be applied. To call this reform and to describe as reform what it makes marginally worse struck me as a decline in the language. The General Accounting Office has found that this program returns only 10 cents to the Federal Treasury for every dollar spent.

Mr. President. simply by noting that when we think of the state of the water supply systems of our country. the municipal water systems. the imbalance of our congressional water program is so striking. Of the last 25 years. only 6 percent of Federal water resources expenditures went to the Northeast. 39.7 percent to the South. 35.7 percent to the West. There is no equity here. In the end. these programs are going to come to a halt and all of us will be the worse off because there is no sharing. neither cost sharing nor sharing among regions.

It is addressed to the chairman of the committee and says: You will recall that the Congressional Budget Office had produced an estimate of $10-$13 million in additional revenue under the original House version of the bill. That was based on certain assumptions they made. The conference report. however. will produce additional revenues over the original projections for the House bill. because there are increased incentives for districts to amend their contracts and come under the new pricing provisions. I will skip some portions of it. It then goes on to state: Your projections produce an estimated minimum annual increase of $17 million to the Treasury for the initial years after enactment. Is that not great because that compares with the $1013 million that was in the original House bill? They go on to say: After 4% years from enactment. additional revenues will jump to a minimum of $34 million. if everyone elects to come under the 960acre limitation. It goes on to state: On the other hand. if 75 percent of the districts decide to amend after 4% yearsAnd there are incentives for them to do thatThen the remaining quarter will pay 12 percent interest on landholdings over 160 acres and will thereby generate an overall revenue increase due to title II of S. 1409 of $70 million. I point out that that is a difference between $10 to $13 million up to a figure of $70 million. The letter goes on to recite. Again. we should emphasize that these are minimum projections and a number of factors could generate increased revenues. Mr. President. having said that progress was made. I should point out that if this legislation were not to be enacted. there would be far greater benefits rebounding to the Federal Government because the courts have ordered the Interior Department to enforce the 160acre limitation there does seem to be some problem.

Senator MCCLmU. as the chairman of our committee. for indeed he is a modern Solomon who can sit and work out thickets. not one but many thickets. that confronted us on this great isasue. Mr. President. the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 contained within title II of S. 1409 is a monumental piece of legislation for Western water interests. Not only does the legislation remedy a number of allegations of abuse within the Federal reclamation program but it removes an onerous cloud from many small farm operators who were faced with the possibility of complying with the antiquated 1902 law. The 960acre limitation on the amount of owned land which can be irrigated with subsidized reclamation water accommodates a large number of existing farm operations and at the same time provides sufficient opportunity for growth and expansion within the reclamation program. Still the 960acre limitation is substantially less than the 1.280acre and 2.080acre limitation of earlier Senate adopted proposals. I am glad to see this legislation move to smaller more efficient farm operations. As well the \"full cost\" interest charges which will be assessed against leased lands above the 960acre ownership limitation is an equitable resolution to the absolute prohibition on leasing which was proposed in earlier bills to eliminate abuse within the reclamation program. In other words. farm sizes can expand beyond the basic 960acre limitation but not at the expense of the Federal Government. These two provisions. Mr. President. the 960acre ownership limitation. and the interest charge on leased lands in excess of that limit. are the cornerstone of the revised reclamation program to which the House and Senate have Just agreed. Mr. ?resident. I want to congratulate Senators McCLumz. WALLOP. and JAcKaoN for their leadership on this highly controversial and complicated piece of legislation.

I want to say to my good friend from Missouri that I am not one who opposes this amendment on the basis that sufficient hearings have not been held. I oppose the amendment in principle. I come from a State that is heavily dependent on shipping. a State whose future depends upon international maritime trade. As my good friend from Washington knows. we recently held a hearing on the issue of maritime trade and subsidized shipping. During the course of the hearing we examined the question of whether or not it would be proper to allow subsidized shipping to stop. for example. at Dutch Harbor. Alaska.. The matter of subsidized shipping is critical because in many instances. there is not enough service available to meet the needs of domestic trade. As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee I have received repeated requests for additional naval capacity. As the distinguished Senator from Maryland stated. it makes little sense to have this tremendous emphasis on increasing our naval capacity and increasing our ability to be involved in the oceans of the world on the basis of being a military power. without having a viable merchant marine to go along with it. Perhaps if the Senate and the Congress were to adopt the position of the Senator from Missouri. I would predict that we would be in position of then being asked to build. with military dollars. the type of capacity we are now able to keep going through the subsidized shipping which is the subject of this amendment. I support the exist.ng practices of the ex.stng law in earmarking through cargo preference. and I oppose taking them out. I think my friend understands my position in this regard. It seems to me we should be doing more. not less. to stimulate the rebirth of our own merchant marine so that we will have our vessels available to assist our Navy in the event of difficulty.",

I want to take note of one provision in the legislation that I believe will prove of great importance in our effort to cut off the flow of illicit narcotics into this country. The Chiles amendment. adopted by the Committee on Foreign Relations. will repeal the existing prohibition on the use of U.S. funds to support the spraying of marihuana with paraquat and other herbicides. while continuing needed safe guards to insure that no health risk is posed for U.S. citizens. A renewed and aggressive drug law enforcement effort is urgently needed if we are to turn the tide on the narcotics trade. We should be under no illusion. however. that winning this battle will be anything but a long and difficult task. There is no simple solution. There is no single step we can take that will rid our Nation of this menace. Rather the point is we should be taking every step possible that promises to improve our capacity to thwart the drug flow. As the Congress and Federal law enforcement agencies grapple with programs and strategies to combat the narcotics flow. there is one inescapable conclusion: The most effective means to stop drugs is at the source. Any enforcement strategy that does not include an effort to cut off the drug supplies in producing countries. such as Colombia. is doomed to failure. As long as marihuana and opium are produced in bumper crops in foreign nations. a good portion of these drugs will end up on our shores. In an effort to foster an effective narcotics control program in the Republic of Columbia. $16 million in foreign assistance funds were made available for the purchase of aircraft. patrol vessels. com-",

These institutions. which are the predominant type of thrift in New England. must have new powers to stop the hemorrhaging of red link. We must give them the capacity to compete in todays volatile economy. During the first quarter of 1981. thrift institutions overall lost nearly $900 million. In June. Chairman Richard Pratt of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified that a full onethird of Americas thrifts are no longer viable under current conditions. Our largest 79 savings banksrepresenting 75 percent of the industrylost $400 million durng the first 5 months of 1981. Savings and loans are in the same boat. Chairman Pratt has estimated that nearly threefourths of them will lose money in 1981. Why do the current high. volatile rates of interest make new powers for thrifts essential. Quite simply. it is because money market funds and money market certirates hRve made regulation Q a moot point. Thrifts must reward savers at competitive rates if they expect to keep and attract funds. Money market funds have been paying interest at rates in the high teensand most financial analysts expect these rates to remain high. Thrifts must offer market certificates in order to compete. In a time of skyhigh interest rates. they must have flexibility on their asset side to have any hope of long term survival.

Mr. Grinberg applied for permission for him and his family to emigrate to Israel. As a result. both he and is wife lost their jobs and the Grinbergs suffered a divorce in order that Mrs. Grinberg and their two sons could apply independently. She and the children did receive visas and emigrated to Israel 2 years later. In a letter dated October 1. 1980. to U.S.S.R. Secretary Brezhnev and Ambassador Dobrynin. I expressed my deep concern about this case. thus I was especially pleased to learn that Karl Grinberg is now a free man. On March 16. 1981. Mr. Grinberg received official permission to leave Moscow. With his departure Grinberg was reunited with his wife and two children. Mr. Speaker. the apparent successful conclusion of the Grinberg case has been most gratifying to me.

It is therefore particularly significant that he should blast the Reagan administration for its really outrageous disregard for law and morality in the conduct of its affairs. He is well justified in his criticisms of Reagan for attempting to hold his administration above the law. or alter existing law in the four instances he sites: First. Disregarding his son Michaels influencepeddling in seeking to gain Government contracts. Second. Seeking to change the law requiring special prosecutors to be used to investigate allegations of administration wrongdoing. Third. Seeking to relax our laws against foreign bribery. and Fourth. Seeking to gut the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Safire is correct on all counts. and I trust the appropriate committees will assure that efforts to emasculate or evade these important laws will not be tolerated. What Mr. Salire criticizes is symptomatic of even larger defects in the Reagan administrationa willingness to tolerate on a broad scale corporate abuses of civil rights and the health and safety of our populace. Equally disturbing is the willingness of the administration to tolerate even the grossest abuses of racial persecution and violations of human rights abroad. Indeed. as Mr. Safire points out. it is doubtful that those who voted for President Reagan were endorsing such worrisome transgressions of fundamental responsibilities and alteration of laws protecting our liberties. If these attitudes are not changed. I believe they will spell the downfall of the Reagan administration and seriously impair the strength and respect of the United States.

This provision would change the current incentive for Federal employees who are members of the Guard and Reserve that allows them to receive both their military and their civil service paychecks when they perform their annual 2 weeks of active duty training each year. The change would essentially permit them to receive only the greater of the two salaries. but not both salaries. Last year the Congress rejected a similar proposal. An editorial in the June issue of the Reserve Officers Association (ROA) magazine. the Officer. clearly points out that the proposal leads in the wrong direction. Mr. President. such a change would hit especially hard on the many thousands of enlisted Reserve members who find this compensation an important incentive for participating in our Guard and Reserve programs. Further. making the change would be perceived by many guardsmen and reservists as evidence of weakened support by the Federal Government for Reserve service. -It is widely believed by military experts. including those in the Defense Department. that if the proposed policy change is enacted. we will lose many dedicated people from the program.

I had sent word to the distinguished majority leader that I thought it might be possible to vote on Mr. Crocker on that day. Thursday. if I received certain assurances in my conversation with him. Unfortunately. through a misunderstanding. the majority leader. in all good faith. thought that I was releasing the hold immediately. and entered into a unanimousconsent agreement to proceed to bring up the Crocker nomination yesterday. Monday. I suggest that all interested colleagues refer to the colloquy which took place on the floor yesterday in the REcoRD on pages 1169011696. Unfortunately. the ouestion of the leaks from Mr. Crockers office has not yet been resolved. There has been a pattern of leaks of confidential information. some of it extremely sensitive. to the press both in the United States and in Africa.

He was 72 years old. A native of Nanafalia. Judge Gewin received his A.B. degree cum laude from BirminghamSouthern College in 1930. a bachelor of library science degree from Emory University in 192. and a law degree from the University of Alabama In 1935. He served as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1934 to 1943 and was a member of the codification commission which prepared the Alabama Code of 1940. He practiced law in Greensboro. Birmingham. and Tuscaloosa and was a U.S. Referee in Bankruptcy when he was appointed to the the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. In 1976. he became a senior circuit judge and in 1977 he was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger to serve on the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals of the United States. Judge Gewin was honored during his lifetime by being elected president of the Alabama Bar Association. He was awarded honorary doctor of laws degrees by his alma maters. BirminghamSouthern College and the University of Alabama. In addition. BirminghamSouthern College honored him with its Distinguished Alumnus Award. while the University of Alabama Law School honored him with its Deans Award. Walter P. Gewin was a judges judge: Learned. compassionate. courageous. His legal scholarship reached its apex during his service on the bench. Judge Gewins imprint is found on many of the landmark civil rights decisions of the sixties. one of which was his order directing the desegregation of the University of Mississippi. Dispassionate in spirit. thorough in detail. his life was the epitome of the proper judicial temperament. Judge Gewin leaves behind his widow. Anna S. Gewin. of Tuscaloosa. two sons. a daughter. four sisters. and a halfbrother. But most of all he leaves behind a rich legacy of justice applied and a void which will be difficult to fill.",

What I am asking is that goals be fulfilled. General Rogers. our Supreme NATO Commander. told us that even at 3 percent. we are struggling. and that if we are truly to posture ourselves in a way designed to meet whatever threat exists in Western Europe. then clearly what the allies are doing now is inadequate for military purposes. it is inadequate for our own economic purposes. it is not conducive to what the American taxpayers feel is a proper share. particularly in light of the fact that we have made substantial economic and military contributions to our allies in the last 40 years.

One construction fund in this bill will go to the American troops for housing. for living. in Europe. The second type of fund. which the Eckart amendment is aimed at. is called infrastructure funds. which is operational funding where other nations participate in this funding. As I understand the Eckart amendment. the gentleman says that if certain nations do no come up with 3 percent. then the United States will not participate. Well. the problem with that is. of these funds we are talking about now. they are operational funds. They are for readiness. to be prepared to meet the Warsaw Pact forces if they would happen to move. For gun emplacement. for AWACS construction sites. and for other operational projects that we need in Europe. So what I am trying to say here is that this amendment will throw total chaos into construction programs in working with other nations. Yes. some nations have done a better job. The United States has pushed other nations. There are some percentage tables in the Committee tonight that in effect show that nations have increased their funding. It is not enough. but we think they will continue to move up and might. in several years. meet the criteria that the Eckart amendment is asking for.

It touches the lives of 300.000 American soldiers. sailors. marines. and airmen in Europe. and Iceland. which is a bilateral situation. in Turkey and in Greece. And we ask ourselves why are we there. Is it in our national interest? What are we doing there? Well. I think we should speak of our being there as being the guests of the NATO countries involved. They are not our adversaries. They are our friends. We should not make gratuitous insults about those who are trying to do the best they can. I would like to point out that this subcommittee in our hearing record pointed out very early on that Europe and NATO countries must measure up or the alternatives would have to be to take the troops home. for it is they who suffer if we provide substandard housing. I would simply point my colleagues to Turkey. Do we need to be in Turkey? Do we need to monitor the Soviet Union? I think we would agree that the answer is \"Yes.\" And if my colleagues should see those housing conditions over there. they would know that we should not do anything like this. It is not a good logical thing to do. because of the fact that there is prefinancing under the infrastructure program. under which we build the housing and then we get the money back.

It seems to me when this country went forward with the Marshall plan some 34 years ago. the intent of the Marshall plan was to help provide for the defeated countries defense as well as the victorious countries. like England. The activity was to help them provide for their own defense while they rebuilt their own economies. Well. Mr. Chairman. 37 years later they have rebuilt their economies. The Western European economy today combined is larger than the U.S. economy. I think it is time they start meeting up to their end of the defense expenditures which we had planned on when the Marshall plan was put forward back in the late forties. Now. in the last several weeks. if you have read the headlines in the papers. we have seen that we have had battles with the Western Europeans over subsidized steel. We have had battles with our Western European allies over agricultural subsidies. We have had battles with our Western European allies over the pipeline: so it is very clear that they are a very potent economic force. a force that is very capable of meeting their 3percent goal under the agreement we reached back in the late 1970s. We this year will have a real growth rate in our defense expenditures of somewhere around 7 percent. I think it is not too much to ask our Western European allies to have a real growth of 3 percent. as much of our 7 percent is used to help defend them. I would hope that my colleagues would vote for this amendment. As most of the things we do on this floor pertain to symbols. I think this would be a tremendous symbol and a tremendous message to our Western European allies to shape up.",

I hope that the President shares the strong. traditionally bipartisan view that our Nations investment in basic scientific research and in research and development efforts is a critical element in economic growth and American competitiveness in world marketsthat maintaining our Nations traditional leadership in the sciences is one of the keys to our economic future. As with many other areas of the Federal budget. the President has proposed reductions in scientific programsat NASA. in National Science Foundation programs. and in other scientific efforts in other areas of the budget. I hope that the President intends to continue to pursue the strong investment in research and development efforts pursued by past Presidents and past Congresses. in the context of his overall program of budget restraint. There are a number of proposals which concern menot because I believe that programs in the sciences should be immune from the kind of careful examination to which the entire Federal budget should be submitted. but because they appear to have been dictated by budget policy alone. and not by twin priorities of budget restraint and sound scientific investment. Among these are the Presidents proposal to defer the 5year program begun last year of upgrading our Nations university laboratory facilities. which are rapidly becoming obsolete. Mr. Speaker. investments in science and research and development which are very small in budget terms may have very large effects on our Nations scientific capabilities 5. 10. and 20 years from now. As a member of the Budget and Science and Technology Committees. I look forward to working with my colleagues to guarantee that our scientific investments are carefully channeled. and that what reductions must be made are not made in fields which sacrifice the important contributions which sound scientific investment can make to our economy. from spurring new growth to improving our Nations sagging productivity.",

However. it is important to point out that an attempt to solve our inflation problem by simply dealing with Government spending and taxing policy does not go nearly far enough. In fact. nearly onehalf of the inflation today comes from the increasing cost of energy and if we are going to solve our inflation problem we must produce more energy and use less. Also. we must produce the right kind of energy. In the Presidents proposed budget cuts he cuts important programs to help produce more energy. namely. alcohol fuels. solar energy. and others. and I believe that is unwise. I just think that the American people should understand that if we cut the Federal budget in half. we would not reduce the price of a barrel of oil by 1 cent and that is what is causing a major part of todays inflation. The Presidents program is just the first rough draft chapter in the inflationfighting handbook. But we need a chapter on energy and interest rates as well. Also. just a comment on the tax cut proposals. In the 1970s. it has been the middleincome wage earner who has seen a real and significant increase in the tax burden. Now we see the tax cutters aiming their benefits at the rich and the large corporations. It is the old cakeandcrumbs theorythe big interests get the cake and the little guy gets the crumbs.

I just came from the Committee on Armed Services where General Rogers is testifying. He tells us that even before the new defense increases that the United States is putting in. even before those took place. Europe is only contributing onehalf as much of their GNP as we are to defense. They are only contributing onehalf as much per soldier enlisted as we are. and that is before we add and take on this very serious burden. We are still paying over 66 percent of NATOs costs.

President Reagan has given the American people a blueprint for breaking out of the maddening maze of Federal spending. taxing. and regulation that has stalled our economy. crippled our ability to compete. stifled our initiative. given us doubledigit inflation. and threatens our standard of living. The proposed cuts in the growth of spending. taxation. and regulation. together with fiscal and monetary restraint. constitute the first coordinated and concerted effort to reshape the relationship of the Federal Government to our economy in nearly 50 years. Furthermore. President Reagan has shown that we can reduce spending and taxs and leave intact the safety nets of the social programs which are vital to the disabled. the elderly. and the truly needy. Social security retirement benefits. medicare. and veterans benefits will not be reduced. neither will Project Head Start. summer youth jobs. and school breakfasts and lunches for children of lowincome families. But. it must be recognized that the President has not set out a recovery program from which Congress and special interest groups can select only those proposals they find appealing. He has brought forward a comprehensive. integrated package. It would be foolish. for example. for the Congress to pass a tax cut while continuing its businessasusual attitude toward spending programs.

We remember how the Democrats tried to save social security. We remember that their alternative budget actually proposed a cut in the costofliving adjustment for all social security retirees last year. Yes. that is right. Their budget wanted to cut the COLA for every social security retiree in this country last year. That is saving social security? And he talked about the students. Well. yes. we Republicans have been trying to save the program for the people who depend upon it. who are retired. and so we have changed some of the provisions that affected people who are nonretirees. That is accurate and it shows clearly which party really cares about the older citizens who depends on his or her social security. And what about those social programs? Indeed. in the 1983 budget there are billions of dollars more for the poor this year than there were last year. That is what the President said. That is wholly accurate. We Republicans recognize our obligation to this Nations truly needy and have budgeted accordingly. How about that WIC program that feeds women. infants. and children? It is folded into a block grant. What does that mean? That means that all of the money in that block grant. if needed. could be used for WIC. In other words. if we really wanted to establish as a priority to meet the nutritional needs of those Americans who need a program like WIC. we could in fact use all of that block grant money and there would be more money than was in this years budget for WIC. That is the accurate story. That is the kind of thing that needs to be portrayed to the American people. That is what the President was saying last night.

I do not want to continue to refer to visuals. but I again call attention of Senators to the charts in the back of the room which indicate how the Federal cost of medicare and medicaid has grown. We can stand here all day long and talk about senior citizens and elderly Americans and the impact we are going to have on them. but if the program goes bellyup or we find out we are not going to be able to fund the program. then I am not certain how we are ever going to address it. In the package of the Senate Finance Committee. we are reducing our savings by about $400 million by this amendment. I do not think we should do that. but in the spirit of trying to make everyone feel and understand that we are not impacting adversely on beneficiaries. Again. however. I should indicate that on the colored chart we are addressing numerous concerns. hospital costs. physicians costs. employers and health insurance plans. and finally beneficiaries. After all. they are a part of the program. I think the compromise is a reasonable one. It continues to reflect the intention of the committee that all parties of the medicare program including beneficiaries should participate in efforts to try to reduce the rate of growth. otherwise. we are not going to have a program.

I was giving some thought to offerIng an amendment which would have increased the amounts that the physicians be eligible to receive and at the same time. require physicians to accept assignment. Under the Finance Committee proposal. you save about $1 billion in terms of the amount of money that would actually be paid out by the medicare program for physician reimbursement by putting a cap on the economic index. Of course. they can always go. the elderly person. and recover more. which in fact they will do. I was just wondering. as I listened to the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Kansas talk about getting some handle on the cost containment. whether we might not give the physicians some costofliving increase in the amount that they could actually receive but then require. when they do get the payment. that that be payment in full. That would save the elderly people over $1.8 billion next year alone. It would cost about an additional $500 million in this program compared with the committee proposal. but it really would then begin to get an important handle on the escalation of the health care costs. That is another way of trying to relieve the burden on elderly people. It would save them about $1.8 billion out of pocket. because then the physicians would not be able to go and charge the elderly more than what medicare determines is reasonable reimbursement. What it would do is give the physicians in the country a reasonable compensation for the treatment of medicare beneficiaries but would limit them from charging the elderly even more. It seems to me. if we are talking about trying to get some control on the costs of medicare and medicaid and also give a degree of equity to the elderly people. that this is a more fair and equitable way of distributing the burden.

Let us not at this particular point in time add another burden. an unnecessary burden from the point of view of the soundness of this trust fund. an additional burden in many States of this Union. to over 30 States which are completely up to date in terms of their trust fund. which do not owe any money in terms of their trust fund. They will have an additional tax burden placed upon them. one which they cannot afford. Why should we be taking action which will just weight the scales a little more heavily against the survival of many small businesses whose survival is in the balance on a daily basis? I commend my colleague from Texas for offering this amendment. I am proud to join with him and express my strong support for it.",

The tobacco program is a control program that has been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. They upheld a program that limited production to those who hold an allotment. If those allotments are ever released. we will never again be able to return to a control program like such as we now have. If this program is abolished. production will increase. Even though proponents of the amendment concede that by their arguments an increase in production. is sure to result in an increase in consumption. It is inconsistent to spend money to discourage smoking and at the same time pass an amendment which would increase smoking. In some countries. like Mexico. Thailand. Peru. and other places. we buy out of production those kinds of plants that are harmful to people and otherwise try to reduce availability of harmful substances.

Lyng. the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agriculture. so that we at least can understand where the administration is coming from and that their position is clear on the pending amendment. This letter was dated the 19th of October. and addressed to me. It reads as follows: This is in reply to your recent request concerning the Departments views on possible changes in the tobacco price support program. At this time. we do not support any major changes for several reasons. As you are aware. the tobacco price support program has permanent authorization under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. and the Agricultural Act of 1949. The Department did not include any changes in the tobacco program as part of the Administrations Farm Bill because of the many other programs which must be reauthorized. Since there are so many controversial and complex issues surrounding the programs that must be reauthorized for the next four years. the Department believes that major changes in the tobacco price support program would be counterproductive at this time. In addition. the tobacco support program is an important part of our economy with over 200.000 farms and 545.000 allotment holders. Many are small farms that depend on tobacco for most of their income. While tobacco represents only 0.3 percent of the Nations cropland. it accounts for about 4 percent. or approximately $3 billion. of total crop sales annually. Over onethird of the tobacco crop is exported. contributing about $2.5 billion to our trade balance. I am sure you know that there are no direct Government payments to tobacco producers. Rather. loans are made to cooperative associations to pay advances to growers for tobacco that does not sell for at least the price support rate. Loans are repaid with interest. Historically. the cost to the Federal government has been small. Also. a recent change in the law requires tobacco producers to pay the full cost of grading and inspection services that historically have been borne by the Federal government. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond on this important matter. Again. Mr. Chairman. this was signed by Richard E Lyng. who is Deputy Secretary and was the Acting Secretary of Agriculture at the time this letter was signed.",

So it seems to me that there is a strong argument against the Shamansky amendment in that it would tend to make it easier for tobacco to be produced freely in this country. reduce the price of it. and make it more plentiful. If the Surgeon General is correct. broader production and consumption would hardly be in the public interest. At the same time.

This is exactly what the marginal tax reductions of President Reagans economic program are all about: working toward a balanced budget through greater economic productivity. not through increased tax rates and a weaker economy. But the majority of the Budget Committee would prefer. instead. to substantially increase taxes in order to work toward a balanced budget. These are old and tried policies that have clearly failed us. Listen to what Keynes had to say about increasing taxes to achieve this aim.

In response to increasing concern over the status of Americas space program. 46 of my colleagues and I formed the bipartisan Congressional Space Caucus. in order that Congress gain a greater knowledge of and interest in the benefits that have accrued. and will continue to accrue. from a strong national space policy. Mr. Chairman. Americas space exploration program is not a partisan issue. The frontiers that we gain. the advances in technological development that are generated by the space program benefit all Americans. Other benefits are not as tangible. but just as importantthe ability of our achievements in space exploration to raise our sights to new horizons. to increase our confidence in our capabilities to reach still further. In the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbias first flight. President Reagan said that \"the Space Shuttle did more than prove our technological abilities. It raised our expectations once more. It started us dreaming again\".

The Lewis aeronautical program is focused on technology that will provide safer. more efficient. economical. and environmentally acceptable air transportation systems. Lewis contributes significantly to our national defense effort by maintaining an aeronautical propulsion technology base enabling the military to develop superior aircraft. Lewis is the key U.S. center for fundamental longrange aeronautical propulsion research. The Lewis role is vital to the national defense. The military must focus on nearterm development of weapons systems. It does not become involved in longterm research and development to the extent that NASA does. But. Lewis has the necessary prerequisites to engage in vital longterm research and development that is an essential complement to the military work. This same capability enables Lewis to carry out civil aeronautics research and development that are high risk and too long term for the aircraft industry to undertake by itself. Specifically. in the area of aeronautical propulsion. Lewis has pioneered in the development of special skills that resulted in a collection of large facilities to simulate the environment in which an aircraft engine must operate. Lewis possesses unique and critical capabilities including wind tunnels. laboratories and support facilities for aeronautical research and development in important technology areas applicable to future military and civil aircraft. This capital investment in facilities is valued at $1 billion. Also. Army rotorcraft propulsion and power transmission laboratories are colocated at Lewis. Lewis has compiled an impressive record of major technical accomplishnients in aviation since the ground for the Center was broken in 1941. This unique NASA facility has made tremendous contributions in the areas of transonic compressors. aircooled engine technology. bearing and lubrication technology. high temperature materials. aeroelasticity in turbine engines. highperformance inlets and nozzles. and internal combustion fluid dynamics. In addition. Lewis has made steady progress in studying the role of cobalt in hightemperature gas turbine alloys. This study is a significant step in the U.S. effort to reduce our dependence upon imported strategic metals. Lewis represents a wealth of American scientific and engineering expertise which can keep the United States in the forefront of aerospace technology. Mr. Chairman.

The targeted jobs tax credit is an important private sector incentive to hire hardtoemploy individuals. The existing jobs tax credit program will expire this year. and the amendment now before us is essential to extend one of the few remaining programs to combat structural unemployment. When the original general jobs tax credit terminated. overall unemployment had been reduced. The Congress. therefore. decided to target the credit to certain disadvantaged groups. specifically vocational rehabilitation referrals. economically disadvantaged youths. economically disadvantaged Vietnam veterans. supplemental security income recipients. general assistance recipients. cooperative education students. and economically disadvantaged exconvicts. People in these disadvantaged groups have had the most difficulty in finding employment in the private sector. The targeted jobs tax credit was intended to improve the employment chances of these individuals. with the hope that they would acquire useful work habits and work records. That experience would then enable these disadvantaged individuals to enter the mainstream of working society. The administration of the targeted jobs tax credit program. I must admit. has not been praiseworthy. A year passed. before implementing regulations were issued. Notwithstanding administrative foot dragging. 450.000 people have been hired under the program. As our economy slows downand there are economists who predict a recession coming onunemployment will increase and the disadvantaged groups will encounter greater problems in securing jobs. The need for the targeted jobs tax credit will become all the greater. I had hoped that displaced homemakers would be added to the categories now eligible under the program. Most of these women have met serious difficulties in reentering the job market. and they have real economic need to secure employment. However. revenue constraints as well as objections from supporters of this amendment to go:ng beyond the original targeted jobs tax credit. have prevented the inclusion of displaced homemakers. They argued that displaced homemakers are so numerous that the projected revenue loss was unacceptable to the other amendment cosponsors. The large number only stresses the problem faced by displaced homemakers. I truly regret the failure to include this category of needy individuals. Nonetheless. because of the meritorious purpose of the bill. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

If Congress does not act swiftly this fledgling program will expire on December 31 of this year. Congress created the targeted jobs tax credit in 1978 to provide employment in the private sector through tax incentives to individuals who have difficulty finding jobs in both good and bad times. Under the program. if a firm hires an eligible individual. the credit in the first year amounts to 50 percent of the first $6.000 of the employees wages. In the second year. the credit is 25 percent of the first $6.000. Mr. President. the program serves a valuable purpose. Youth in workstudy programs and economically disadvantaged youth make up the majority of the population eligible for the targeted jobs tax credit. In this Nation. unemployment among teenagers stands at a shockingly high rate. For all workers. unemployment over the first 6 months of this year averaged 7.4 percent. teenage unemployment was 19.2 percent. The targeted jobs tax credit makes it a little easier for a young person to find that important first job where he begins to acquire the skills that allow him to establish independence and attendant selfesteem. The annual cost of the program is $300 million. And although this seems a large sum. it is. in fact. relatively small in comparison to other jobs programs. Outlays for public service employment in fiscal year 1981 are expected to be $4.4 billion. Mr. President. the program is yielding results. By the end of 1981. 600.000 persons will have found private sector jobs as a result of the targeted jobs tax credit. This is despite the fact that the Treasury did not offer final regulations on the proper use of the credit until 18 months after the law became effective. Employers have indicated to me that such a failing makes them hesitant to implement a new program. Mr. President. I believe that Congress should proceed with speed to extend the targeted jobs tax credit. Time is short and the calender is crowded in this legislative session.

The targeted jobs tax credit program reduces employment. creates new jobs. creates better quality. permanent jobs. increases the cash flow for businesses needing expansion capital. and offers sufficient incentives to businesses. thereby creating special interest in hiring and retraining targeted groups. This amendment will improve the living standards in local communities by putting people to work on a permanent basis. allowing them the opportunity to improve their social status within those communities.

But he is in Utah today attending a funeral. I am certain we can work that out.

It is my intention and my hope that we can hear at that time not only someone to tell us again about the problem but maybe help address something we might do. if there is anything we can do from a legislative standpoint. to help address the problem. There have been others who have expressed a deep interest in this problem. I know the distinguished Senator from South Dakota has been discussing this at length. and certainly at this time any other Senator who had an interest would be welcome to participate. But I will say to the Senator from Mississippi that the problem is real.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. along with my colleague from Kansas. Mr. WHITTAKER. I am today introducing legislation to stem the tide of recent attempts by Canadian companies to acquire U.S.-held energy interests in Canada. These takeover attempts are a result of the new Canadian national energy policy. Im sure my colleagues in the House have been following recent press accounts of these takeover attempts. to which three companies have already fallen victim. Many more attempts are expected in the future. Action by our Government to forestall further confiscation of American energy company subsidiaries in that country is urgently needed. For this reason. we have introduced legislation which does three things to address the problem. First. it imposes a 9month moratorium on further Canadian takeovers of U.S. energy companies. to give us time to study the problem more carefully. Second. it imposes on foreign investors who want to acquire significant portions of U.S. energy companies the same \"margin\" requirements which we currently impose on American investors. And third. it calls upon the Secretary of Energy and other Cabinet officials to report to Congress on the problem of direct and indirect foreign investment in our Nations energy resources. Because of the urgency of the problem. we hope the Congress will take quick action on this necessary legislation. Canada is a good ally and close friend to all the people of the United States. It is my hope. and I am sure the hope of every Member. that this troublesome issue can be resolved quickly and effectively without jeopardizing in any way the relationship we have long enjoyed with our neighbors to the north.",

I have been concerned about what the budget process and the proposed budget cuts will mean to rail passenger service in this country. President Reagan suggested in his budget proposal a plan to cut the Amtrak budget to $613 million. Mr. Boyd told me yesterday that at that level there would be no Amtrak rail passenger service any place in this country except the WashingtontoBoston corridor. In other words. under the Presidents budget request we are talking about the abandonment of rail passenger service all across the country except the Northeast corridor. The committee has worked its will in this Congress. and will be reporting to the floor a proposal for funding Amtrak at $735 million. which the president of Amtrak indicated will allow rail passenger service to continue for the rest of the country. Mr. Speaker. this is not a time for this country to abandon rail passenger service. The French. the English. the Japanese. and the Germans all subsidize rail passenger service more heavily than we have in this country. There will be attempts to further cut the budget in presentations to the House in the next couple of days. The president of Amtrak has indicated to me that if those cuts are made they will mean the loss of rail passenger service in this country in 1983 and I hope. Mr. Speaker. that we will work together to continue rail passenger service in this country.",

Many more with fixed incomes are experiencing increasing difficulty in meeting their subsistence needs including health care. home maintenance and taxes in todays world of inflation and increased longevity. Seventy percent of Maines elderly own their homes. Ironically while inflation makes older people less able to meet their expenses and retain upkeep of their homes. It is at the same time making them richer by boosting the value of the very home they are having trouble supporting. In short. the old are becoming \"asset rich\" and \"income poor.\" In the State of Maine. plans are underway for an innovative program to offer alternatives to these elderly. including the option to \"cashin\" the values of their homes while retaining residency and receiving income to meet expenses. Another alternative would allow large. old energy inefficient singlefamily homes to be renovated or converted into group or shared homes in which several elderly would come together and share skills and resources. This home equity conversion program. cosponsored by the Bureau of Maines Elderly. the Maine State Housing Authority. the Maine Savings Bank and the University of Maine School of Law. plans to offer home equity options to Maines elderly through public education. counseling. training. and estate planning services.

I saw firsthand the personal pain. family suflering. and disruption this terrible disease caused in the lives of others. Fortunately for my four children. and millions of other youngsters. the development of an effective vaccine and an aggressive policy of childhood immunization has virtually eliminated the terror and fear we experienced at the mere mention of polio. But. the Reagan administration now wishes to turn back the clock by implementing a drastic 10percent reduction in the childhood immunization program grants to States to control not only polio. but also rubella. measles. mumps. tetanus. diphtheria. and whooping cough. This is an unbelievably shortsighted policy that would use the health of our children as fodder for some paltry savings barely visible on this years OMB budget chart. We have clear evidence as to the longrange effect such a cutback will have in what can be called dollars and commonsense. In 1969. Congress briefly halted Federal participation in the measles control program. which prompted many Statesincluding New Yorkto do likewise. The result was a 30percent drop in the number of immunizations at New York public clinics. The very next year. the incidence of measles among New Yorkers tripled. The fiscal foolishness is also obvious. Immunizing a pregnant woman against rubella costs between $2 and $3. If no immunization occurs and the child contracts rubella. the cost of treating that child over its lifetime for serious and irremediable mental retardation amounts to $30.000 to $40.000 per year. or more than $1 million. When this administration talks about the kind of health programs to which it is committed. it talks of health promotion. disease prevention. and cost effectiveness.

Seven hundred and thirtyone years ago tills coun -y was independent. and sixtyfour years ago its independence. which had been lost in tile interval. was reinstated. Then again independence was taken away from Lithuania by agreement between two dictators. Stalin and Hitler. We have watched from this side of the Atlantic the suffering of these people under the Stalinists and now under the present regime. But perhaps we can say. to paraphrase the poet. that \"no empire lasts forever. and even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea.\" What will that sea be? The sea of justice and independence. tile right to practice ones religion and to speak freely. Those rights have been denied to the Lithuanian people. even though they were again affirmed in tie constitution of the Soviet Union and in tie pact signed by the Soviet Union and the United States and 33 other nations at Helsinki in 1975. Yes. Mr. Speaker. no empire lasts forever. We look forward to tile independence of the Lithuanian people.",

For example. they are creating a myth that somehow the President is making draconian cuts in those areas of the budget that relate to the poor. The poor. in the budget last submitted by Jimmy Carter in flcal 1981. only 2 years ago. were receiving In servicesthings like medicare and other health programs. public assistance. food stamps and other aid. education. manpower. and social services$140.3 million. In this budget they will be getting $142.1 million. Now. that means they are getting more. not less than they were in the last Carter budget. which was generally thought to be running completely out of control. So this particular President is not cutting back on the poor. and I think to say so is a myth. There is also another myth. that somehow we are taking away by cutting tax dollars the ability of the Federal Government to operate. In fact. we are going to be collecting more tax dollars this year than we did last year or we did In 1981 by almost $60 billion. We will be collecting more in individual taxes than we were in 1981 by some several billion dollars. So we are hearing myths about this budget.

But the contribution of the American Council of Learned Societies has not been wholly academic or cultural. During World War II it was the ACLS that took the initiative in modernizing methods of language training for the U.S. Army desperately needed by our troops. ACLS also helped the Armed Forces in area cultural studies. Today the ACLS establishes libraries on American culture in foreign countries. The record of accomplishment goes on and on. I strongly support a Federal charter as the least we can do for the American Council of Learned Societies.",

The evidence is clear that heroin addicts commit thousands. indeed. tens of thousands. of crimes. Of course on the streets of Newark. and every large city. the police have been aware of the drug addiction and crime connection for many years. What we have learned is that drug abuse can be treated. Persons who are addicted to heroin can. be cured of the habit. A recent study has shown that a heroin addict after treatment on the average commits 84 percent less crime. That is a tremendously important improvement. This program has the strong support of judges. They are able to have much better control of persons sentenced to probation and parole through the urinalysis screening. The bill has been recommended by the Judicial Conference of the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill to continue a relatively inexpensive program that helps fight crime in our Nations cities.*",

The House has included $1 million to continue funding the Washington State Department of Games steelhead data and management program. Funding for this program. which is necessary to manage the steelhead trout resources of Puget Sound. the coastal rivers. and the Columbia. as directed by Federal court decisions. has come from the Fish and Wildlife Service budget both in 1980 and 1981. Management of the steelhead fishery and implementation of courtordered allocations will be impossible without this program. I understand that the committee did not include this item because it had been informed that such funding would be premature under the terms of the Salmon and Steelhead Enhancement Act of 1980Public Law 96561. This information was unfortunately incorrect. This steelhead management program is the ongoing effort by the department of game to m~vage the steelhead fishery in compliance with the Federal courtordered allocation of the resource between sportsmen and treaty tribal fishermen. This program is unrelated to those programs authorized during the last Congress in the enhancement legislation. This program is in fact essential for continued management of the steelhead fishery and continued implementation of courtordered allocations.

I would have voted in favor of final passage for this most important bill. There are several important programs which will be reauthorized in this legislation that I wish to point out. One is the Green Thumb program. Over 300 South Dakotans are employed in Green Thumb which targets lower income elderly Americans for public service work in their local communities. On several occasions I have had the opportunity to visit these programs in South Dakota and I have always been impressed by the dedication of these workers and their desire to perform public service work. I am most pleased that this legislation will enable existing programs and services to be maintained. Another program which has been of considerable value in South Dakota is the retired senior volunteer program (RSVP). RSVP seeks to encourage elderly persons to perform volunteer work in their local communities. RSVP participants play an active role in working with school age children. The Senior Companion program provides meaningful opportunities for lowincome elderly persons to help other elderly persons with special needs. especially in the areas of health. education. and welfare. Senior Companions have been most valuable in helping their fellow elderly citizens in preventing or delaying institutionalization. This 3year reauthorization strengthened many of the programs under the act and will enable virtually all of the current services being offered to be maintained. The programs and services reauthorized in the Older Americans Act will encourage elderly citizens to remain active and in the workforce when possible. Their wisdom and experience benefits many of the less fortunate of our citizens and I am convinced that these programs are cost effective and worthy of reauthorization.e",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I do have a very short response. Before I make those brief remarks. I want to indicate once again my agreement with the Senator from South Dakota on the important role played by the storefront counseling centers in meeting the needs of Vietnamera veterans. I think that role is very obvious. I also concur with my colleague from California that the budgetary needs of the VA mental health clinics in standard VA facilities must be adequately considered in the 1984 and thereafter. I am pleased to accept this amendment presented by my good colleague from California which. as he has so well described. would provide a GI bill education delimiting date extension beyond the 10year limit in current law. an extension which would be expressly targeted toward two groups of Vietnamera veteransthose without a high school diploma and those who could possibly still benefit from participation in apprenticeship or other onjob training programs. Mr. President. although I did support a very similar provision in the 96th Congress as a part of S. 870. I opposed this amendment when it was again proposed at the full committees May 13 meeting on the pending legislation. My opposition at that time was not directed to the substance of this targeted extensionindeed. I continue to feel. just as I did in the last Congress. that this is an effective way to reach and provide assistance to those Vietnamera veterans who are in need of employment or minimal educational assistance. No. my concern in May was that sufficient funds to cover the cost of this provision--CBO had estimated at fiscal year 1982 cost of $63 millionwould not be available in the VAs budget as being within the limit the committee had projected in that budget as being part of the effort to meet the Presidents goal of curbing Federal spending. Since that time. however. the Congress had adopted the first concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1982. House Concurrent Resolution 115. and the budget level for veterans programs in that resolution does appear to assume sufficient funding for this extension. Thus. Mr. President. I do accept this amendment and I thank my good friend from California for his patient and most persistent effort in obtaining this important eligibility extension.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I commend Senator CRANSTON for this amendment and for the opportunity to join him as a cosponsor. What we are proposing. very simply. is to provide Vietnam veterans who do not have a high school diploma with an additional 2 years in which to apply for GI benefits. Without this amendment. many thousands of educationally disadvantaged Vietnam veterans will soon lose their eligibility for benefits. Mr. President. approximately 1.7 million Vietnamera veterans or onefifth of those discharged from active duty do not have a high school diploma. Only about 35 percent of these veterans have utilized their GI benefits. In the meantime. the rate of unemployment among Vietnam veterans continues to increase. in April 1981 it was 10.4 percent higher than last year. and is expected to increase further. This amendment is targeted at those Vietnam veterans most in need of assistance. We are talking about young people who have been out of the military now for a decade and still lack a high school diploma or the skills necessary to obtain a decent job. Mr. President. it is never too late to start. I do not think this country can afford. economically or morally. to write off these young people who have fought in defense of our freedoms. By providing a onetime extension to those veterans who have never utilized their GI benefits. we are offering them an extension of the opportunity to become more productive citizens. And we are helping ourselves by upgrading our labor force. In urging approval of this amendment. Mr. President. I can only state that we have an obligation to those who have served our Nation in its time of need. We did not place any limits on the danger to which they were exposed. and I believe we can extend the limits on their ability to take advantage of benefits they have earned.* (By request of Mr. CRANSTON. the following statement was ordered to be printed in the RECORD:)",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in support of Senator CRANSTONS amendment to S. 921. the Veterans Programs Extension and Improvements Act of 1981. I am a cosponsor of this vital amendment which would provide for a limited extension of the socalled delimiting period for the use of GI bill benefits. According to the Veterans administration. educationally disadvantaged Vietnamera veterans. or those without high school diplomas. account for nearly 20 percent of the Vietnam conflict veterans population. That is nearly 1.7 million Americans. Mr. President. who significantly underuse their GI bill benefits. High unemployment rates continue to plague the Vietnam veterans. Half of these veterans are unemployed. and most have already passed their 10year postservice delimiting period. The amendment now before the Senate would extend. to September 30. 1983. the period of eligibility for 01 bill benefits for apprenticeship training or a high school diploma or vocational objective. It is not an acrosstheboard extension. It is a wellthought. targeted extension to grant GI bill benefits to those veterans most in need. I have stated time after time. Mr. President. that we cannot turn our backs on the Vietnamera veteran. The amendment now under consideration provides concrete. positive assistance to those who are just now beginning to take steps to readjust fully from their wartime experience. In testimony before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. Dr. Arthur Arnold. chief of psychiatry at the Bay Pines. Fla.. VA Medical Center. considered employment and education assistance \"essential\" in the treatment of posttraumatic stress syndrome. The lack of such assistance. he noted. would prevent \"any improvement in practical living.\" In similar testimony. Dr. Stephen Sonnenberg of the American Psychiatric Association stated that education. employment. and training assistance was \"a crucial component of a comprehensive human service effort.\" Thus. Mr. President. there is a clear need for an extension of GI bill eligibility for certain Vietnamera veterans. Legislation already passed by the House of Representatives contains a similar provision. evidence that the House believes in the need to extend the delimiting period. In closing. passage of this amendment will help educationally disadvantaged Vietnam veterans make the contribution to society of which they are capable.

June 10. marked the 75th anniversary of the Federal Meat Inspection Act. and a special commemorative ceremony was conducted at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Todays consumer takes meat inspection for granted. We automatically assume that our meat and poultry products are clean and wholesome. In 1906. however. the concept of inspecting every animal for disease was a new and revolutionary idea. Then. as now. the catchwords of meat inspection were safe. wholesome. and accurately labeled. Seventyfive years ago each inspector made a personal judgment that a product was accurately labeled and free from contamination or disease. While USDAs professional inspectors still are responsible for making this determination. today they do so on the basis of objective data. uniform standards. and solid training and experience. And they are working with an industry of professionals. IndustryGovernment cooperation should be the standard in meat inspection today. In fact. industry expertise has helped to strengthen meat inspection. Mr. President. this is particularly true of the quality control approach to processing inspection. After World War II the food industry developed quality control programs to reduce costly production mistakes and to assure finished products of consistent quality. Through these systems the company assures uniform quality by checking products at different stages in processing. then making adjustments if necessary. For example. the condition of ingredients is checked before they are added. Cooking times and temperatures are doubledchecked to make sure they are safe and consistent with the companys formula for the product. Finished products are weighed to make sure they are uniform. USDA has applied this industry concept to processing inspection. In 1980 a regulation went into effect allowing plants to participate in this new total voluntary quality control program. Twentyseven processing plants have now been approved for quality control inspection. The USDA inspector uses the objective data supplied by the companys approved quality control system to supplement onsite inspection. This program is entirely voluntary. It provides the same level of consumer protection as traditional processing inspection. but more efficiency and more cost effectively Quality control inspection is but one example of the sort of reform which Government can make to assure consumers of safety while minimizing unnecessary burdens on industry. I commend the Department of Agriculture on the 75th anniversary of the Federal Meat Inspection Act. and encourage them to continue involving industry in reforming inspection.",

We have debated the highway and bridge situation at great length. I think too long. We have debated the MX missile. and we have debated appropriations which we should have passed a year ago. However. Mr. President. we have not addressed a very serious problem which our Nation faces. and that causes me great concern. We have failed to address the serious and economically disrupting problem of natural gas pricing. This is a problem which affects millions of Americans. Early in the debate on the socalled gas tax bill. we briefly touched on this subject. And much to my disappointment. the Senate declined to proceed on proposed solutions by myself and the distinguished Senator from Kansas. Mrs. KASSEBAUM. It was pointed out in that brief debate that this is a serious problem affecting lowincome and middleincome Americans. This problem is here today. The solution to the problem is needed today. As I have said before. Americans have a right to expect that their energy conservation efforts and the natural forces of the marketplace work properly and fairly in their behalf. That is clearly not the situation now. I commend the Appropriations Committee for including funds in the continuing appropriations resolution for lowincome energy assistance. This helps to address part of the problem. But the situation extends far beyond that area to include middleclass Americans. They are in need of some form of assistance also. In doing this. we are addressing not the natural gas problem. but rather. one of the results of that drastic problem. In effect. Congress has once again proposed a solution to the symptoms rather than a solution to the problem. Skyrocketing natural gas prices are the problem. If we take action to control this. lowincome energy assistance will become less necessary. Rest assured. Mr. President. this problem will not disappear. In fact. it will in all likelihood get worse.

To those accounts have now been added others reporting the increase in the budget of the Corporations Board of Directors from $113.721 to $273.731 in the period from October 1. 1981 through September 30 of this year. the increase in board appointees consulting fees from $72.029 to $156.201 over the JanuaryNovember. 1982 period. during which members collecting the fees have continued to serve on recess appointments. This information was presented to the Subcommittee on Courts. Civil Liberties. and the Administration of Justice of the House Judiciary Committee at a hearing held Tuesday. December 14. Mr. President. there are several obvious and deplorable inconsistencies evident here: Between the administrations oftenexpressed desire to dismantle the office which makes legal counsel available to those who could not otherwise afford it and its willingness to give a free hand. financially speaking. to Legal Services appointees. between the administrations concern with budget cuts. notably with cuts in important and effective domestic programs from childhood immunization to housing. and its indifference to the dramatic escalation in consulting fees which the Presidents own appointees are drawing from the Corporation. The actions of the Administration with respect to the Legal Services Corporation and the actions of the administrations appointees to the Legal Services Board have been widely reported and also condemned. and I ask that these newspaper stories and editorials be printed in the RECORD:",

The Federal Government. in its legal role as trustee. has been negligent in pursuing resolution of these claims. While thousands of claims have been identified. few have been litigated. In addition. there are more claims yet to be filed. The administration would have allowed the statute of limitations to expire December 31. 1982. leaving thousands of Indian people without the necessary financial resources or evidentlary material necessary to pursue these claims. House Joint Resolution 553 requires that within 90 days all Indian claims currently identified be published in the Federal Register. Within 180 days. the Secretary of Interior must publish additional claims submitted. after which time no additional claims would be considered. The statute of limitations on published claims would be extended until the United States has filed litigation. the Secretary of Interior has reported his decisions to reject claims to the affected Indian people. or the Secretary submits legislation to Congress dealing with these claims. In the latter case. the statute of limitations would expire 3 years after the legislation takes place. A lawsuit filed by the Native American Rights Fund resulted in a recent decision by a Federal judge that the Government has failed to properly represent Indians. and ordered the Government to file lawsuits for them by December 31. or to submit legislation by December 15 to resolve claims the Government will not pursue through the courts. In addition. the judge ordered the Government to notify Indian people of the status of their claims. I understand that the administration has now tempered its opposition to this legislation in light of the recent court decision. The administrations past vigorous opposition. however. shows once again its lack of concern that peoplepoor people in particularbe able to pursue their legal rights. It also shows an alarming disregard for the Federal Governments trustee role in the matter of these claims.

Some of them are substantial amendments. amendments of some substance. despite the fact that they are part of a Technical Corrections Act. Then the last item. the item wherein the committee chairman suggests that we accept the amendments of the Senate with some exception. subject to an amendment. involves the extension of the time within which municipalities have to register the issuance of taxexempt bonds. Now. this is an interesting subject. Mr. Speaker. and it seems to me that we probably are likely to compromise it eventually. The chairman of the committee feels that that provision should be postponed for 1 year. primarily because small issuers. that is. school boards and small municipalities. are going to have to go through substantially greater redtape in the issuance of taxexempt bonds than they have previously. The bankers and brokers do not object to this registration proposal. but the small municipalities or public bodies do have a problem with it. I quite agree with the chairman of the committee that there should be some postponement of the effective date. The Treasury has suggested 6 months. and the chairman is suggesting 1 year. We do not know what the Senates attitude may be. and. of course. they may very well disagree with what we have done and confer about this matter also.

H.R. 5470 belongs in conference where the bills managers from both bodies can work out an agreement on its important features. One significant feature is the Durenberger amendment which exempts certain foster care payments from Federal income tax treatment. I strongly endorse the amendment. and I believe the modest restrictive amendments to it. made by the House. will not alter the purpose of the original Senate amendment. Foster parents in my State. who had for years assumed their payments from the State for caring for special children in their homes were tax exempt. have been. in the past year and a half. subjected to IRS audits in which such income has been claimed to be taxable. Large tax claims have been made against parents who believed they had no liability. In most cases. perhaps all. the foster parents had incurred expenses equal to. or greater than. the income they received from the State. Because they thought the income was exempt. they kept no records. This amendment liberates such payments from Federal income tax. It recognizes the special services of the foster parents. It helps the States save the money and emotional heartbreak which institutionalization would cause. It also saves a good deal of record keeping which would benefit no one. The cost of the amendment is minimal. The Treasury says it will cost less than $5 million. At that price. the amendment is a bargain. I am pleased that the House has accepted the spirit of the Durenberger amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 5470 and in particular the provision in this bill which provides for the tax treatment of foster care payments for children. Mr. Speaker. the passage of legislation to make difficultyofcare payments and basic payments as nontaxable income is desperately needed. \"Difficulty of care\" payments are the additional payments that foster parents receive for the care of physically. mentally. and emotionally handicapped children. These payments. which are provided by nearly every State. are not significant. They do not enrich foster parents. Indeed. they barely cover the unique costs that these children present. While these payments are not a gold mine to foster parents. they do. however. represent a significant cost savings to the State. Rather than funding the full costs for the institutionalization of a child. the State. under the difficulty of care payment is payable to pay a smaller portion. Obviously. this approach has several positive features. The child is removed from the institutional background and is placed in a home environment. the States financial burden is significantly reduced. and foster parents are provided with a small modicum of financial assistance for the burden that they have assumed. Unfortunately the Internal Revenue Service has chosen to ignore these substantial benefits. Instead. the IRS has initiated a review of foster parents in my district and other areas of Minnesota and in California. The intent of this interview is to charge back taxes for difficulty of care and other foster parent payments. Rather than recognizing the costs associated with the care of foster children and the nature of foster care payments. the IRS is treating such payments as taxable income. That. Mr. Speaker. is simply not the case. Individuals acting as foster parents do not assume such awesome responsibilities for financial gain. The penalties now being imposed by the IRS will have a negative impact on our Nations foster care programs. While there is talk of a need for increased voluntarism. the IRS is panelizing such commitments. Mr. Speaker. the bill before the House does not address all the problems facing foster parents but it is an important start. By passing H.R. 5470. Congress is showing clear support for the cause of foster parents. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.o",

S. 2710 would setaside a 12.900acre tract in southcentral Indiana as a national wilderness area. Much of this area. which contains very impressive hardwood and wildlife populations. is found in my congressional district.

We. the living. must bear the responsibility of insuring that no individual. institution. or government can ever again decide who shall have the right to live. The holocaust has great significance for Americans. American soldiers liberated many of the camps and were the first witnesses of what the rest of the world. including our country. had ignored. Many of the survivors of the holocaust finally immigrated to the United States and became U.S. citizens. and many went to Israel. where outside threats to Jewish life still exist. Instead of monuments. the holocaust survivors have stressed the importance of studying the lessons of the holocaust. We must teach ourselves and others. Jews and nonJews. to understand the unique and universal implications of the annihilation of 6 million Jews. not as an accidental occurrence. but as a primary goal of the Nazis. We need to comprehend the holocaust and to apply that understanding to the present and to the future. The prevention of genocide against Jews. Armenians. or any other people. must be a constant concern. Mr. Speaker.

It has been my distinct honor over the past few years to have the opportunity to work with distinguished statesmen. scholars. and other esteemed public figures in an effort to determine appropriate and fitting ways in which to commemorate victims of the holocaust. Our efforts have always been guided by a simple yet critical principlethat we must never forget the victims of the holocaust. As Santayana said. \"Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it.\" It is the task of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council to keep the memory of this terrible tragedy in the minds of all Americans. now and in the future. Only by maintaining that memory will present and future generations be able to learn the lessons that the holocaust can teach us all. One lesson. a political lesson. was aptly stated in the Holocaust Commissions report to the President. It stated: Nazism was facilitated by the breakdown of democracy. the collapse of social and economic cohesion. the decline of human solidarity. and an erosion of faith in the political leadership and in the ability of democratic governments to function. We must always cherish and be grateful for our democratic way of life yet at the same time we must be vigilant and watchful to insure the continued strength. justice. and freedoms that are provided by our system of government. And finally. we must remember. Not only on those days that are set aside for our remembrance. but every day we should remember the bravery. the courage. and the nobility of the victims of the holocaust. And we must pledge to stand strongly and unremittingly for the human rights. human freedoms. and democratic principles that are the only certain safeguards against such oppression and human tragedy.9",

I was a proud cosponsor of the bill to establish the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. This legislation is now Public Law 96388 and is a living memorial to the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the holocaust during World War II. The Councils mandate is to establish a memorial museum on behalf of those who perished in the Nazis death camps. and to lead appropriate ceremonies each year in commemoration of their martyrdom. We as Americans have been privileged to live in freedom. and we must never forget the terrible Hitler massacres of the Jews because these murders are the most horrifying example of what can happen in any nation which loses its dedication to the ideals of liberty and the dignity of all human beings. The people of our beloved country must never waiver in their determination to continue their efforts to prevent genocide. wherever it occurs in the world. and remain vigilant in defense of our precious heritage of freedom.e",

There have been innumerable books written and many dramas and motion pictures and television films made about the terrible events of the holocaust. Nothing I can say today can add anything to the documentation of that tragic occurrence. But simply by joining those who care enough to rememberand to learn fromthe holocaust. one can contribute something to the cause of human freedom and human rights. And that is why I believe that commemoration of the holocaust can and should be the source of hope and concern. Nowhere has George Santayanas famous statement been more compelling than when dealing with the holocaust: Those who are not willing to learn from history are condemned to relive it. We must and can learn that totalitarianism. ideological fanaticism. racial. religious. national and other forms of hate and discrimination are common enemies of the human race. Our task today is to see to it that these evils do not get the chance to exercise the demonic power they are capable of. This means we must remain strong. both economically. and militarily. We cannot change the pastbut we can shape the future. By shaping it for freedom. for our values. and for our best hopes and dreams. we will be remembering the victims of the holocaust in the best way.*",

This annual commemoration. sponsored by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council which was formed during the 96th Congress. is a significant and appropriate event. These Days of Remembrance will focus national attention on the horrible acts committed by the Nazis in killing millions of innocent people throughout Europe. It is important that we keep alive the memory of the holocaust in order that ours and future generations can work to prevent similar atrocities from occurring. This commemoration also serves to remind us that human rights violations around the world cannot go unchallenged. We must be increasingly vigilant in these violent times. when oppression and brutality are perpetuated by nations less dedicated to promoting individual freedoms and basic human rights. The memory of the holocaust should strengthen our resolve to resist the many forces at work around the world which tend to undermine the advances made by civilized nations in the area of human rights. These Days of Remembrance will do much to advance the cause of human rights around the world. For this reason. I believe it is especially important that we take this time today to lend our voices to this momentous undertaking.9",

Even today the horror of those years and the terrible dehumanization of our civilization can and should continue to serve as an example of how man can hurt his fellow man in a frenzy for power. We cannot fail but continue to be amazed at how thin the line is between a civilized society and one in which the basic human rights of individuals are not only violated but denied. And we must ask why? Why is it that we often cannot tolerate people who are of different nationality. religion. political beliefs. or language. The key to it is that we should ask ourselvesdifferent in relation to what? For we are all different in any given place and at any given time. It is this difference which allows us to grow and learn. for in being continuously challenged to defend our beliefs and ideas we have to define them more clearly and logically. The holocaust symbolizes all that can go wrong in a society and that is why it is particularly important that we take this moment to say a silent prayer on behalf of all those innocent victims that perished in it and to also pray that it will never happen again.*",

The holocaust victims can best be memorialized by rededicating ourselves to fighting bigotry. scapegoating. and indifference to human suffering in the here and now. The victims of the holocaust must be remembered by all of us and should be a constant reminder of the dangers of narrow nationalism and the excesses of collective selfpride. There was a feeling in the 1930s and 1940s that our Jewish brothers and sisters were somehow strangers and that what happened to them was not terribly important. Such a feeling allowed most of the world to remain silent and in our country led to the rejection of Jewish refugees from Hitlers terror. Similar instances of indifference and callousness toward human life and human rights plague humanity today and while it is good that we remember. it is imperative that we honor the victims of the holocaust by rededicating ourselves to the politics of reconciliation. nonviolence. and bringing good news to the suffering poor and oppressed here at home and abroad.*",

Equally important. as Americans. we must take this opportunity to reexamine our own role in this ordeal and its aftermath. and to reaffirm our commitment to justice and our humane concern for all peoples confronted by genocide. oppression. or poverty. The holocaust was the systematic and brutal extermination of innocent Jews. The dimensions of this unspeakable crime were awesome. the events that characterized it unprecedented. The sheer quantity of violence and the horror of the mass slaughter itself. make the episode unique in the annals of history. However. we must not let the senselessness of the destruction of European Jewry allow us to believe that an event such as the holocaust is too fantastic to reoccur. Idi Amins merciless killing of some 300.000 Ugandans or the Pol Pot governments reported slaughter of 2.5 million Cambodians serve as compelling evidence of the potential for history to repeat itself. Remembering can instill caution. As the Presidents Commission on the Holocaust writes. \"Memory can avert future errors.\" As Americans. and peaceloving people. the memory of the holocaust points out to us the necessity of preserving our democratic values. It allows us to strengthen our belief in the inalienability of human rights and to appreciate the pluralism and ethnic diversity of our own system. Our own failures during the tragedy. particularly turning our backs during the war on millions of Jewish refugees. have obliged us to reflect inwardly and to reaffirm our commitment to helping others. Today. as we honor the 6 million innocent victims of the holocaust. we pledge that such atrocities will never again occur. To adhere to that commitment. we must keep to memory of the holocaust alive.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment simply restores the Superfund provisions in the budget resolution to that modest level proposed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. namely. to a total of $250 million in budget authority and $119 million in outlays for fiscal 1983 and corresponding numbers further down. The actual outlay increase in the coming fiscal year is $28 million. It appears in the budget resolution as zero. The outlays for fiscal 1984 increased by $33 million and appear in the budget resolution as zero. Only in fiscal 1985 does the outlay increase round up to $100 million. In our view. Mr. President. in the view of many Members. not necessarily all. of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. this is a good faith amendment. In good faith. the Congress passed Superfund legislation following the revelations of the Love Canal experience at Niagara Falls. We imposed a tax on 42 toxic chemicals produced by a relatively small number of firms. That tax revenue is committed to this fund to be used to cleanup hazardous waste sites. The fund will have available in it some $582 million in fiscal 1983. Mr. President. even under this amendment outlays would represent about only 20 percent of the fund during fiscal 1983and the fund continues to accumulate. Fiscal 1983 will be the third year after the Environmental Protection Agency began to exercise its responsibility as well as its mandate under the Superfund law. A $250 million funding level for fiscal 1983 would allow some 197 sites or spills to receive assistance. There is currently a priority list of some 115 sites that EPA announced last October. and there is a further list of some 400 priority sites now being prepared. We know how to do this. In very considerable measure. it needs to be done. If we handle ourselves well. and there is no reason we shall not. this is a onetime exercise to rid ourselves of poison left in the Earth. seeping into drinking water. a result of the great chemical revolution of this century.",

The Committee on Environment and Public Works. which drafted this legislation after extensive hearings and inquiry. recommended a modest program for fiscal 1983. and we ask that the budget resolution reflect the judgment of the committee. Mr. President. I hope the Senate recognizes that this amendment has zero impact on the budget this year in outlays. a zero impact next year. and only in 1983 do we add $100 million in outlays. We are talking about money committed for the purpose of cleaning up hazardous waste sites. Seveneighths of the trust fund will come from a tax levied on the producers of toxic chemicals. The trust fund will continue to accumulate. We only ask that it be spent at a somewhat more modest but goodfaith rate.",

The gentleman from Missouri has stated on more than one occasion that he is waiting for this to be straightened out by the Government Operations Committee or the Judiciary Committee or somebody else. Let us make it perfectly clear that the reason we are here is because there was included in the food stamp law several years back a criminal provision. and it was put into the hands of the Department of Agriculture to administer this criminal law. That came out of the Committee on Agriculture. and our problems started there. We are trying to build on that and enlarge the problem today. I hope we do not do that. I think it is entirely useless to say that some other committee ought to straighten out the mess that the Agriculture Committee started in the first place. What we ought to do is not deepen the mistake. I realize that there is a need for law enforcement activity in this field. Let us place it where it belongs. But there are those of us who are not going to stand idly by while these steps are taken in succession to dissemble the fourth amendment. one of the very important parts of the Bill of Rights. and to disperse through these various departments and agencies the law enforcement powers and create a number of law enforcement agencies. That is wrong. The Inspector General Act did not create this problem. It did perpetuate it by allowing the Office of Inspections in the Department of Agriculture to continue in existence with the function of enforcing criminal laws. But the first mistake was putting criminal law enforcement in the Department of Agriculture. Let us correct that problem. I am sorry that the gentlemen who made these assertions are not listening at the present time. but perhaps they will work out something to withdraw this amendment or something of the sort. At any rate. it is not just a matter of what committee jurisdiction is involved. This is a matter of much deeper moment than that.",

In 1977 a bill emerged on the floor of the House which sought to give the personnel of the National Park Service the right to search and seize without warrant people who are driving through the national parks if. in the opinion of those National Park Service people. a crime was probably being committed. This House. with the backing of conservationists and civil liberties peoplepeople who adhere to the Constitutiondefeated that effort. Every once in awhile one of the committees that does not have full jurisdiction. such as the Judiciary Committee. gets a bright idea. The motivation is perfectly sound. but they sometimes tend to forget that we are a constitutional government. The gentleman from Missouri has kept on saying that all this amendment which he has offered does is to allow someone to make an arrest when he sees a crime being committed in his presence. That happens not to be so. I read section 1. which would authorize these people to make an arrest without a warrant for any such criminal violation if such violation is committed or if such employee had probable cause to believe that such violation is being committed in his presence.

Latvia and Estonia by the Soviet Union. This anniversary should perhaps best be commemorated not as one more year of Soviet occupation. however. but as one more year of Lithuanian resistance to that occupation. The struggle by the Baltic States for independence and freedom from domination by the Soviet Union has not wavered throughout the past four decades. The Baltic countries experienced a brief period of freedom and economic expansion between World Wars I and II. By 1938. the Baltic States of Lithuania. Estonia and Latvia had elevated their position in world commerce to such an extent that their combined volume of trade had far surpassed that of the Soviet Unionthe latter a nation with 18 times the Baltic population. However. the Soviet military occupation of the Baltic States in 1940 and the subsequent Sovietengineered incorporation of the region in August of that same year brought the period of Baltic prosperity to a crashing halt. Mr. President. Americans have never recognized this illegal action by the Soviet Union. and on the 41st anniversary of the occupation we must once again recall the words of then Secretary of State Sumner Welles on behalf of the People of the Baltic States. and on behalf of the human rights struggle around the globe: The people of the United States are opposed to predatory activities no matter whether they are carried on by the use of force or by the threat of force. Nor can we watch without protest when powerful states intervene in the domestic affairs of their less powerful neighbors. The United States will continue to stand by these principles because of the conviction of the American people that. unless the doctrine In which these principles are inherent once again governs the relations between nations. the rule of reason. of justice. and of law. in other words the basis of modern civilization itself. cannot be preserved.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the issue of nuclear power has been the subject of many hours of debate and. no doubt. will be discussed at length in the future. The economic growth of the United States in past years has been attributed in part to the major role which low cost and abundant supplies of energy have played in our development. Today we are confronted with the fact that fossil energy is no longer cheap and there is not an unlimited supply of fossil fuels. More important for future generations is the fact that these valuable natural chemicals should not be burned as fuel any longer than absolutely necessary. If this Nation is to have a reliable source of low cost energy. it is essential that we continue to develop new technology of alternative energy resources. One such technology is the High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR). A recent article in Scientific American points out the March 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear reactor accident is a shock from which the nuclear power industry has not yet recovered. Author Harold M. Agnew. the former Director of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. notes: Perhaps the principal lesson of Three Mile Island is that the current generation of nuclear power plants is vulnerable to certain rare events that can lead to a condition where the time available for responding correctly can be less than a minute. Dr. Agnew appropriately asked: Do we need to be content with nuclear reactors of a design such that operators must react correctly within a minute in order to prevent damage to the reactor? All but one of the 71 nuclear power plants commercially in operation today are an adaptation of the first reactor used to power the U.S. Nautilus launched in 1954. The exception is a heliumcooled reactor. and HTGR. operated by the Colorado Public Service Company at Fort St. Vrain. As noted in Dr. Agnews article: The Fort St. Vrain experience has verified several important safety and operating advantages of the HTGR. Because the HTGR reacts slowly to unexpected operational changes. an operator has suffcient time to take appropriate corrective action. Dr. Agnew further stated. \"hours rather than seconds.\"",

U.S. utilities will \"look favorable on the FITOR when they are again ready to place orders for nuclear power plants. Mr. President. the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has recognized the potential of this form of nuclear power. \\In the committee report on the fiscal year 1982 authorizations for the Department of Energy civilian programs. the committee directs the Secretary of Energy to pursue commercialization of this technology. The House Armed Services Committee has directed a feasibility study on the prospect of using this nuclear technology to meet the energy requirements of two national research labs. Sandia National Lab at Albuquerque and the Los Alamos Scientific National Laboratory. A key element in congressional support for the HTGR has been in recognition of the strong support by the utility industry. The House Science and Technology Committee recognizing the potential for this technology has recommended a fiscal year 1982 funding level of $40 million. During consideration of the fiscal year 1981 supplemental. both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees rejected a reduction of $21 million in the funding of this program. I would strongly encourage my colleagues to familiarize themselves with the HTGR. as I am certain you are going to be hearing more about this advanced technology in the months to come. Mr. President.

Yet as soon as he took office he supported the Reagan administrations slashing of LWCF moneys and he abolished the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service. the successor agency to the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. which administered the fund. HCRS was the agency within the Department of the Interior which provided grants and technical assistance for natural and cultural preservation and recreation to Federal agencies and State and local governments. Since HCRS was not a landmanaging agency. it could focus on developing strong ties with State and local governments. The agency was an excellent one and very popular with communities in California. It was the regional staff of HCRS that laid the groundwork for designation of 1.200 miles of northern California rivers as national wild and scenic rivers to be administered by the State of California. From 1977 to 1980. HCRSs record in natural preservation was impressive. The agency accelerated the national natural landmarks program. designated over 400 national recreation trails. completed a nationwide inventory of Americas wild and scenic rivers. and worked closely with State and local governments to identify and protect important natural areas.

Rael Jean Isaac and Erich Isaac document the massive ideological and financial support provided by some American church organizations for international terrorism. Although the leftist minority directing the terrorist support effort from within the church groups is comparatively small. the enormous sums of money they have given to terroristssuch as the $350.000 donated to the Sovietbacked African National Congress and SWAPO. as well as large sums channeled to the PLOdeserve serious attention. The authors also trace the origins of the Marxist propaganda effort within organized American religion from the \"social gospel\" of the early 20th century to the current \"liberation theology\" which masks the MarxistLeninist doctrine of class warfare with lip service to Christian teachings. I commend this article to the attention of my colleagues in the Senate and of the public in an effort to publicize the serious problems for American security and foreign policy posed by these supporters of terrorism within our own borders and within our churches.

Dr. Thurow points out that \"Current wagesetting procedures make it difficult to stop inflation and dont encourage productivity growth.\" After analyzing several possibilities. he settles on the value which workers add to the firms products as a measure which would give workers a direct incentive to help raise productivity. Mr. Speaker. these are precisely the points I have been making for the past several weeks when discussing H.R. 5682. my Productivity Incentive Act. This bill encourages employers. with the consent of their workers. to adopt a flexible compensation system in which a portion of the workers pay is based on profits or some mutually agreed on measure of productivity growth. A similar pay system is used in Japan. and as Dr. Thurow notes: The higher productivity growth rates of the Japanese may ... be due to their bonus system that encourages labor to take a direct interest in raising productivity. Mr. Speaker. we have to improve our productivity growth rate if we are to remain a strong competitor in world markets.

But I think. seriously. if we want to get to the solution. and the quicker we want to get to the solution. some type of freeze. the concept of freezing. that is. if you get a dollar this year. you will get a dollar next year. but no extra dollars. is going to have to be done throughout the budgetary process.

That does not mean cutting them way back. as the gentleman has stated. It merely means holding down the increases for a short time. and that that in and of itself would produce a great result on the spending side of our budget. It would treat every single element of our society that benefits by those entitlements the same way. and it would be the most positive and constructive way of dealing with this problem of trying to bring Federal spending under control. I had an opportunity last weekend. while in my district. to discuss this issue with some of our Federal retirees. some of those who have retired from the military. some of those presently serving in the military and some on various kinds of social security benefits. Though no one is happy with the thought of freezing or putting a freeze on spending increases. especially in the many entitlement programs. the overwhelming majority of those people to whom I spoke and discussed this issue said that they thought that that fairest way to handle this problem was to have it equal across the board. I think they made it clear that. though they probably would not be happy with it. that was the best way to deal with the problem. if everybody was required to sacrifice an increase under automatic escalation clauses that presently exist in law. And so I again wish to join with my other colleagues in saying to the gentleman from Oregon. thank you for bringing these facts and figures to the attention of the House. to making it clear how we could achieve a balanced budget. far more quickly if we were willing to establish some type of a fair freeze across the board on all entitlement programs and all basic programs in our Federal budget in the various categorical areas of our Federal budget.",

I want to reinforce the fact that in going into my district and talking to a number of people in the district who receive social security and also I believe I have the fourth largest district in terms of military retirees. and the number of people who are in both those retirement systems and the social security system. the almost universal reaction was a feeling that if they could work out an equitable provision. a fair provision. they would be more willing to forgo what they consider windfall increases in social security because of the inflation rate and that the time that we were locked into a costofliving increase for the social security system we are looking at a 5to 7percent inflation rate. The actuarial tables indicated that we would have sufficient funds at that kind of an inflation rate. In the last administration we got into doubledigit inflation and when you examine what happens with a 5percent inflation rate increase. no one anticipated that rate. and one of the problems is we were paying in at a rate that had been anticipated paying out at a rate that was not anticipated. That is one of the reasons we have achieved the shortfall. the unanticipated shortfalls we are in. In discussion with those people who are receiving those benefits. they are more than willingin fact. one gentleman indicated to me if we would devise a program across the board that would establish increases at 40percent above the poverty level. he would accept that. if that money would be applied to the deficit problem. So what we have gotten ourselves into is an economy that was overheated with an inflation rate that no one anticipated but somehow we think that we are obligated to make those payments when in fact the people receiving the payments are more than willing to adjust what they consider to be an appropriate amount coming in if that amount that they were not going to receive was to be applied to the deficit.

We do not want to cut anybodys benefits and nobody is talking about that. yet when the media picks up on this and talks about what is going to be done. the elderly people in this country hear nothing but social security cuts.

I think the politicians in this country who are very sensitive to social security. and should be because of those folks who laid the foundation for what we have today. ought to get reasonable compensation. think that they have to maintain a system even if it will devour us. and the point is that the folks receiving those benefits do not think the same way.

GAO found that although each country had laws penalizing employers of illegal aliens. such laws were not an effective deterrent to the hiring of illegal workers for primarily two reasons: First. employers either were able to evade responsibility for illegal employment or. once apprehended. were penalized too little to deter such acts. Second. the laws generally were not being effectively enforced because of strict legal constraints on investigations. noncommunication between Government agencies. lack of enforcement resolve. and lack of personnel. I urge my colleagues to read the GAO report. There is a possibility that H.R. 6514. the Immigration and Control Act of 1982. may come before us in the lameduck session.

Acid rain is now threatening many of our Nations lakes and rivers. it is damaging. perhaps significantly. the growth of our forests and may eventually have a significant impact on our agricultural crop yields. It is eating away at many of our public buildings and monuments. One area of the United States that is being severely threatened by acid rain is northern Wisconsin. Since I represent a very big portion of that area. I have spent a good deal of time looking into the issue and reporting what scientific data is available on it. particularly as it relates to the acidification of lakes in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest to people in my district. The following statement is excerpted from some of the weekly newsletters I have recently written to the district on that subject. It is important for the Members of Congress to be aware of the kind of Impact which this type of pollution can have in some regions. A majority of the 18 counties in my district are heavily dependent on tourism as a source of Jobs and economic stability. In several counties. one third of all Jobs are directly involved in tourism. That tourism is largely based around our beautiful lakes and superb fishing. We have 2.880 lakes in the Seventh Congressional District. nearly onetwentieth of the total lakes in the United States. About half of them have very low levels of calcium or other alkilating agents which means they will probably be able to handle only small amounts of acid before turning rapidly more acidic. The rain that is now falling in northern Wisconsin is considerably more acid than any fish found in the State could live in.",

The purpose of H.R. 6156 is to resolve jurisdictional questions involving the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The language of the bill indicates that options on certificates of deposit are to be treated as securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act. regardless of their status under other securities laws. Although case law leaves the status under the Investment Company Act of certificates of deposit uncertain. as a matter of administrative practice the SEC and its staff have consistently adhered to the view that certificates of deposit are securities under the Investment Company Act. H.R. 6156. which is designed to resolve jurisdictional questions only. is an inappropriate vehicle in which to address the status of certificates of deposit. Therefore. it should be emphasized that the purpose of the language contained in sections 4 and 5 of H.R. 6156 was to leave the prevailing Judicial and administrative interpretations intact. and thus to leave the status of certificates of deposit under the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act unchanged.

Mr. Hays has been teaching a course in politics and government at the University of Massachusetts. in Amherst. in the First Congressional District of Massachusetts. While there are many here undoubtedly who have missed the enlightened and always articulate contributions by Mr. Hays to our debates. the students at the University of Massachusetts quite obviously do not mourn the fates that cost Mr. Hays his seat in this Chamber. To them. that calamity is something less than calamitous. Mr. Hays. through his brief series of lectures to date. has won a lasting place in the hearts and minds of those students who have been fortunate enough to find a chair in his classes. Because I am certain there is much interest among many of us here in what our most distinguished former colleague has been up to lately.

The one that I think I have enjoyed telling the most is that Brooks Hays said that the nice thing about running unopposed is that you did not have to laugh when you were not tickled. Having had the privilege of running unopposed once. I can tell you that that is true. He has so many humorous stories in that book as he intertwines his philosophy about government and the need for politics in government that I could heartily endorse and ask our colleagues to read that book. Something else that Brooks Hays did that our older Members will realize and I only realized because I accidentally bumped into a little book that Mr. Hays had prepared and it was on the decorum that should be used in this body. At one point apparently the decorum that was used on the House floor had gotten pretty sloppy and people had quit referring to people by their proper names. and so forth. so they went to Mr. Hays and they asked if he would put this book together. I think it has such a strong historical significance. if we could find additional copies I think we ought to see if we could get it reprinted and distributed. because every now and then I think some of our good colleagues on the floor could stand a reminding from Mr. Hays and let them read his comments and maybe we could show just a little bit more courtesy on the floor.

Brooks Hays has been aptly recalled by the Washington Post as: A gentle. preaching man who raised his voice for racial moderation in his native South and for foreign aid for the less fortunate of the world. He displayed a rare combination of courage and gentleness. determination and yet willingness to engage in realistic compromise. seriousness of purpose but with a sense of humor delightful to all who knew him. Brooks served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1951 until 1958 and will always be remembered as one of its most influential and active members. Some of his reminiscences of that period are included in a book which was published last summer. entitled: \"Politics Is My Parish.\" Just recently. in fact. Brooks sent me an autographed copy of that work. which recalls a study mission we both undertook together to West Germany. including a memorable meeting with thenChancellor Konrad Adenauer. These memoirs. like its author. provide much humorous commentary and characteristically. even more wisdom. I commend them to my colleagues attention. The public career of Brooks Hays. as well as his private life. reflects his personal involvement in many of the major national and international issues of our time: He was a leading advocate of emergency aid to Great Britain after World War II. an avid and articulate proponent of the Truman Doctrine. which laid the groundwork for assistance to Greece and Turkey. and a consistent supporter of funding for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. His many domestic accomplishments are equally well known. ranging from his fight against segregation to his activities as a religious leader. Much more could. and undoubtedly will. be said about the role of this great man in our national life. The legacy he leaves to all of us in this Chamber. however. is his conviction that politics cannot only be ones \"parish.\" but above all. a most honorable profession.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the pending resolution and share tile concern expressed by many Amricans over the tragic events which have occurred in Poland since the imposition of martial law nearly 1 year ago. The declaration of martial law by the Polish Council of State. under the leadership of Gen. WoJciech .Taruzelski. represents an attempt to deal a serious blow to the freedom and rights of the Polish people. Nevertheless. it is important to remember that the Polish authorities have not acted alone. Under constant pressure from the Soviet Union. General Jaruzelski has sought to extinguish the free spirit of the Polish workers. denying them the right to strike as well as imposing stringent control with respect to personal travel and communications. Despite repeated statements that the Government would remove restrictions instituted since December 12. 1981. the situation in Poland today. nearly a year later remains grave. The recent outlawing of the free trade union solidarity has only served to exacerbate the domestic tension already present in Poland. While there have been some encouraging signs. including the release of solidarity leader Lech Walesa from confinement. thousands of workers remain imprisoned. In addition. the volatile domestic situation in Poland has been further frustrated by a deteriorating economy. Food supplies remain at critically low levels with even basic commodities in short supply. Meanwhile. the governments foreign debt has grown to more than $26 billion. As a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. I am particularly concerned over the flagrant violation of human rights as outlined in the Helsinki Final Act and the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights by the Jaruzelski regime. I deplore the actions of the Polish Communist authorities designed to suppress even the most basic civil liberties and share the sense of outrage expressed by Pope John Paul II. President Reagan and others in response to the events in Poland. It is more important than ever that Americans stand in solidarity with the people of Poland. Therefore. I have Joined as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 501. expressing the sense of the Senate that it is vital that Americans continue to protest martial law repression in Poland. This important resolution calls upon the President to proclaim a national day of solidarity and prayer with the Polish people.*",

The first transmitter should be located in the Florida Keys. as close to Cuba as possible.

However. both Peninsulares and Creoles were opposed to any attempts from Spain. egged on by England. to alter or abolish slavery. the key to the prosperity of Cuba. Consequently it is not surprising that when Spain appeared to be veering toward supporting abolition of slavery. thus seemingly abandoning its role as protector of white Cubans against blacks. schemes of annexation to tile United States. where slavery flourished. emerged. But as the fears that Spain would Interfere with slavery subsided. annexationist sentiment In Cuba lost Its main appeal. Annexationism continued. but the main Initiative now came from the predominantly proslavery groups In the United States who saw In the annexation of Cuba a vast area for the expansion of the Cotton Kingdom and the acquisition of Increased political power in the national government. In tile end. Spains refusal to sell the Island to the United States and the opposition of antislavery expansionist forces in the North either to purchase or capture of Cuba through filibustering expeditions. doomed the annexationist movement In the United States. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. annexation. for the time being. was dead. In 1865. Spain. suffering from Internal dissension and political and economic difficulties. and fearing the rise of Independence movements In Cuba. adopted a policy of conciliation toward its colonial possession. A royal decree of November 25. 1865. established a Colonial Reform Commission to discuss proposals for reforms in tile Island. Despite conservative opposition in Madrid. the Spanish colonies In the Antilles elected twenty commissioners. sixteen of whom came from Cuba. and the remaining four from Puerto Rico. The election of commissioners in Cuba and the debates In Madrid created a wave of excitement in the Island and fostered the hope that at last the longawaited reform of Cuban political and economic life was on the way.

Convention Center from H.R. 7144. the D.C. appropriations bill for 1983. Tile amendment would delete language in the bill which would preclude the use of the center for any concert. athletic event. or similar entertainment activity. I support the concept and philosophy of home rule for the District of Columbia. The District should be free to run Its own internal affairs without interference by the Federal Government. except in matters Involving a clear. overriding Federal interest. My Senate colleagues should join us in the amendment to strike this language. Multipurpose use of the facility will provide additional revenue to help pay for the center. it will help avoid \"dark days\" during which no convention or trade show can be booked. In addition. because of its design and booking policy. the center will be used primarily for conventions and trade shows. Thus. It will not become a major competitor of local sports and entertainment facilities. For example. although the centers schedule has been substantially filled for 1983 through 1985. only conventions and trade shows have been booked to date. The emergence of \"restrictive use\" language Is relatively recent in the legIslative history of the center. The early history does not indicate that Congress contemplated imposing such a restriction. and the record contains no adequate justification for doing so. It would be unfair to saddle the center with use restrictions when no other major city. that is of the 21 largest cities. impose such restrictions on the use of their convention centers. Furthermore. since there is no overriding Federal Interest in this instance. it is philosophically unjustified for Congress to interfere with the use of this facility by the District of Columbia. I hope that the Senate will follow the action of the House of Representa. tivcs which recently deleted similar restrictive use language from its version of the D.C. appropriations bill for 1983.

DICK BOLLING Is a man whose interests have ranged over a variety of areashe has been honored for his contribution to the fields of law. art. athletics and political science. His widespread interests may be due to the fact that DICK BOLLINO is. above all. a strategist. He is committed to political process and legislative technique as the essential means to an end. and he has never limited himself to a single area of interest. BOLLING was instrumental in formulating the new budget system. and in softening the existing seniority system. He protected the 1957 civil rights legislation when it was in danger being buried in committee. And. he gave rise to the first vote to put the House on record as supporting restoration of minimum social security benefitsthis technique may have been the most important impetus in getting actual legislative change. DICK has always shown us a contempt for rhetoric over detail. His work to change the committee system and make voting procedures on the floor more accountable attest to his belief in the importance in the way a thing is done. and his expertise in the art of strategy. The Rules Committee chairman is a strong party man and he taught many of us the meaning of party loyalty. Yet he is individualistic in his approach to issues and always encourages personal decisions in others. DICK is a man of the highest integrity and dedication. he is a perfectionist whose opinions and strategies will always influence me. I understand that DICK is retiring to write a \"modern version of Machiavelli.\" I think he underestimates himself in the comparison. He is one person whose political advice I will always listen to with a great deal of trust.*",

It is an honor and a privilege for me to have served on the committee during his chairmanship.

He has brought to his chairmanship a deep appreciation for history and an enduring respect for the integrity of the House and its procedures. He has always been aware that even the smallest procedural skirmish can have lasting implications for the manner in which future Congresses conduct themselves. He has treated the rules of the House with great respect. and worked to insure procedural fair play and the protection of the rights of the minority on any given issue. He has loved this institution too much to tolerate the abuse of its processes. I think it is accurate to say that DICK BOLLINO simply cannot be replaced. No chairman in the future will be able to duplicate his special style. humor. and intellect. We may have other great chairmen. but we will never have another DICK BOLLINo. He is one of a kind.

Admiral Rickover ushered our Navy into the nuclear age through his diligent efforts from March 1949 until January 17. 1955. when the Nautilus put to sea and signaled her historic message. \"Underway on nuclear power.\" Since that date he has labored tirelessly to make our nuclear ships the safest and most sophisticated in the world. He has personally interviewed all the officers who have served on nuclear submarines to Insure that only superior men serve in that capacity. Admiral Rickover has singlehandedly guaranteed superior quality in our nuclear ship building program that is so vital to our defense. Therefore. it is befitting and proper that he be accorded the high honor as the first person to be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for a second time. In conclusion. yesterday. January 27. was Admiral Rickovers 82d birthday. I ask that the Senate join me in wishing him a happy birthday.",

A woman who exemplified that spirit was Hazel Hunkins Hallinan. Hazel died on May 17. 1982. At age 91. she was the last living leader of the suffragist movement. Hazel was along with Alice Paul. a founder of the National Womens Party and a leader in the struggle for the equal rights amendment. I am proud to say that Hazel was a westerner. She was born in Colorado and lived a great deal of her life in Montana. It was in Montana that she first heard a speech in favor of equal justice for women. It was in Montana that she became an active leader in this fight. I had the great pleasure of meeting Hazel a couple of years ago. She was still tough as nails. I listened to her intently as she told me how she chained herself to the White House. went on a hunger strike. went to prison. and suffered all kinds of abuse while fighting for womens equality and womens right to vote. She elaborated on the history of the SewallBelmont House. which first was a house where young women could stay when in Washington. This was important. for. as she told me. \"Women in those days could not travel to places by themselves.\" Her stories pointed out how far womens social role has changed in the past 60 years. However. womens constitutional status has remained exactly the same. Women still do not have equal legal status guaranteed by our Government. I want to assure my colleagues that the women of America will continue to fight until we get in the Constitution. We will follow Hazel Hunkins Hallinans example.*",

Now that the Space Shuttle is becoming fully operational. we should make sure that we are taking full advantage of the Shuttles enormous capabilities. In order to fully utilize the Shuttle for the Department of Defense and commerical high Earth orbiting satellites and NASA planetary exploration missions. a high energy upper stage is required. The fiscal year 1982 NASA budget included the Centaur high energy upper stage in lieu of the inertial upper stage (IUS) to perform NASA Galileo and ISPM mission. NASA changed from the IUS vehicle to the Centaur vehicle for technical reasons. The change to Centaur provided NASA with the opportunity of integrating a high energy upper stage into the Space Shuttle at a minimal cost in fiscal year 1983. In December of 1982. NASA shifted back to the less capable IUS to save a limited amount of money in fiscal year I am very concerned that the money spent by this Congress be used as wisely and as efficiently as possible. It has become clear to me that if we are not willing to spend the limited amount of money needed for the remainder of fiscal year 1982 and fiscal year 1983 to integrate the Centaur high energy upper stage into the Space Shuttle. we will be forced into beginning a reinvention of this high energy upper stage technology in the fiscal year 1984 budget. Such a new development will cost the taxpayers of this country well in excess of $1 billion. and I find that prospect to be totally unacceptable. The IUS was originally planned in 1975 as a temporaryinterimstage. Due to a variety of problems. the IUS has experienced approximately a 500 percent cost escalation and is years behind in coming into the inventory. The IUS will provide a lift capability of 5.000 pounds to geosypehronous orbit. Compared to lift capability of 10.00014.000 pounds provided by the Centaur. this capability is woefully inadequate to the expenditure. There are several reasons why the additional lift capability provided by the Centaur is needed: First. NASAs Galileo mission is fully achieved. The Centaur would provide a flight time of 26 monthslaunched May 1986and would guarantee 11 satellite encounters compared to a flight time of 54 monthslaunched in August 1985and the",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing two bills to restore benefits to widows and children of certain veterans who were killed while on active duty in Vietnam. The benefits which would be restored were paid under the provisions of the Social Security Act prior to the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law 9735). One of the bills I am introducing would require the branch of the Armed Forces in which the veteran served to pay the benefits. The other bill would require that the benefits be paid by the Social Security Administration. It only seems fair to the families of those killed in Vietnam that these benefits be restored. One of the provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act ended entitlement to social security benefits for a surviving parent caring for a child or children when the youngest child reaches 16 rather than 18. This provision of the social security program is generally referred to as a mothers benefit. The mothers benefit provision took effect in September 1981. but did not include. for an additional 2 years after the effective date. those who were receiving the benefit in August 1981. Another provision of the Budget Reconciliation Act has ended or reduced educational social security benefits effective August 1. 1982. paid to adult children ages 18 through 22 who are taking postsecondary education courses. Effective August 1. 1982. no payments are permitted past age 18 for a child attending college or taking higher education. or past age 19 for a child attending high school. Payments to children on the date of enactment are being gradually reduced or phased out over a 4year period which began on May 1. 1982. Later on. I will make available a more detailed explanation of these and hope that many of you will join me in cosponsoring these two measures which are intended to provide justice and equity for the survivors of those who gave their lives for their country.",

This concern is a response to the most significant issue we face today. It involves the welfare of every man. woman. and child in the world. It is time to realize that. because of the current buildup of our nuclear arsenals. the military posture of the superpowers is no longer one of defense. but of provocationprovocation based on the stockpiling of weapons which have the combined capacity to annihilate the human race. Mr. Speaker. there cannot be a \"limited\" nuclear war. There cannot be a \"survivable\" nuclear war. Any act of madness or miscalculation which triggers a nuclear exchange will escalate into allout global warfare. notwithstanding various claims to the contrary by warmongering fanatics. And after such a crime against mankind. there would be no human being left to walk the face of the Earth. Nevertheless. the administration and its allies propose to spend $1.6 trillion for our military budget over the next 3 years-$1.6 trillion of taxpayers money which must come out of the mouths of hungry children. out of health care services for senior citizens. out of environmental programs which will preserve the planet rather than destroy it. Mr. Speaker. the American people are frightened by the irrationality of this continued buildup. They are incredulous that a Secretary of State can actually think of firing a \"warning shot\" with a nuclear weapon. They cannot understand how David Stockman can claim that we do not have the funds to feed the hungry in this country and yet propose to spend $4.2 billion in the next 5 years for a civil defense bomb shelter evacuation plan which will not save anyone in the event of nuclear war. It is in response to such muddled thinking that Americans throughout the country are turning to the nuclear freeze movement for sanity. As Members of Congress. we dare not ignore that public sentiment. As human beings. we cannot deny mankind a future. From either perspective. it is our duty to support a nuclear freeze.

I am pleased to have join me in sponsoring this legislation the House majority whip ToM FOLEY. and my colleagues from Washington State. NORM DICKS. AL SwIrFT. and MIKE LOWRY. Both the House Committees on Agriculture and Interior soon will take action on this bill. which follows several hearings and meetings with scientists. conservationists. and timber interests. Resolution of the Mount St. Helens Volcanic Area is critical to my southwest Washington constituents. many of whom still are reeling from the economic impacts dealt by this awesome volcano in May 1980. Increased tourism will help to diversify the economic base of communities such as Longview and Kelso. Furthermore. preservation of this invaluable resource is critical for scientific study and recreation. This bill calls for a 115.000acre national volcanic area. and strikes a balance among demands for the land. While scientists need the opportunity to study and recreationists want the area preserved for posterity. it is also crucial to preserve the timber base. The legislation likely will encompass less than 2 percent of the annual yield of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. and far less of the annual yield in southwest Washington State. Small mills in my district. which I have long supported on many issues. support a 40.000acre area. the Forest Service supports its 85.000acre area. scientists support a 155.000acre area. environmentalists a 216.000acre national monument. Significant addons in this proposal. over that proposed by the Forest Service. include the Goat Creek drainage to the north of Mount St. Helens. headwaters of the Green River to the northeast of the volcano. and Kipuka lava caves and tree casts to the south.

That is where they pick up part of this additional money in school lunch and child nutrition. But actually. with our proposal. we do much better. We give 17 cents for the paying customer. but on top of that we mandate regulatory reform. The most ridiculous thing anyone could ever mention that the Federal Government does is to tell the local school nutrition people. the people who are trained to carry that on. that they do not know how much a secondgrade child should have in the area of fruit. but we will tell them they should have threefourths of a cup. That is where we would get some more savings for them. and anywhere from 8 to 10 cents. So their paying customers under our proposal would actually get more like 25 to 26 cents. where they are showing 21 cents. There are several other areas where we have that same kind of saving. Where the greatest fraud has been in the summer feeding program. which is the one other area where they appear to pick up additional money. is in the private sector part of it.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. title VIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 contains the reconciliation provisions reported by the Committee on the Budget with respect to matters under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. These provisions assure total reductions of $2.8 billion in budget authority and $2.5 billion in outlays for fiscal years 198284. The reductions made by the committee are greater than the reductions directed by House Concurrent Resolution 115 by $600 million in budget authority and $1.1 billion in outlays for the 3 fiscal years. The provisions in title VIII place ceilings on budget authority for the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. While these ceilings assure that total reductions projected over the 3year budget reconciliation period will more than meet the reductions directed by House Concurrent Resolution 115. they also retain flexibility for the relevant legislative committees and their House and Senate Appropriations Committees counterparts to decide on specific items within these spending levels at the appropriate times in the congressional decisionmaking process. While this approach recognizes that decisions on specific items will be made during the appropriations process. it does reflect the concerns of our committee about some items of particular interest. For example. it specifies that there shall be appropriated $275 million for the land and water conservation fund. $30 million for the historic preservation fund. and $100 million for payments in lieu of taxes. Finally. title VIII includes provisions to offset appropriations by over $250 million by increasing uranium enrichment user fees and noncompetitive oil and gas fees and rentals.",

We succeeded in our efforts. We came up with a program that county and local governments across this Nation appreciate. understand. and relied upon. There are counties who rely on PILT for most of their operating income. We have one county in my home State of New Mexico. which relies on PILT for over 77 percent of their expenditures. We have five counties which rely on PILT for over 50 percent of their expenditures. One satisfying aspect of PILT is the fact that the cost of administering the PILT program is less than 1 percent of its funding level.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. section 9001 of H.R. 3982 contains the authorization of appropriations for certain programs of the Maritime Administration. In attempting to meet budgetary targets. the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries made substantial cuts in the authorization for research and development expenses. These cuts were made in the MARAD research and development authorization for two reasons. First. the committee wanted to target more money for the State maritime academies to help them in the financial emergency they face due to increased fuel costs and critical ongoing maintenance programs for their training vessels. Second. the committee had some concern that the research and development program has not been as productive as it could beand that a temporary lower level of funding was appropriate while the program was being reevaluated and restructed. While I agreed with that action of the committee. there is one part of the Maritime Administrations R. & D. program that. in my opinion. is highly valuable. This is CAORFthe ComputerAided Operations Research Facility. This is a ship control simulation facility. It is valuable not only as a research and development tool but as an effective training device. It is now being used to study the reactions of ships and their crews to various operating situations. The objective. of course. is to reduce accidents and improve maritime safety. This facility is also used to test the use of simulators as training devices. I am hopeful that. within the admittedly stringent research and development budget we have recommended. the Maritime Administration will be able to continue its work at this valuable facility. CAORF promises direct payoffs in safety at sea. That should be a top priority in the utilization of available funds.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. let me list briefly how the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee has responded to the reconciliation mandate. No. 1. We have eliminated new funding for construction differential subsidy. commercial shipbuilding in fiscal 1982. We assume that there will be $100 million annually for this program in each of fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1984. This is in total compliance with the assumptions of the budget resolution passed by Congress. At this point. I would add that we have also included most of the text of our maritime authorization bill for fiscal 1982. Of course. we modified the language to eliminate all new funds for construction subsidies. However. we did include $417 million for operating subsidies for Americanflag vessels. This amount was requested by the Reagan administration. No. 2. It was assumed that our committee would eliminate the entitlement to free health care through the public health system now enjoyed by merchant seamen. We have complied substantially with this resolution. Our language states that these beneficiaries can still receive health care through whatever system may remain. but they will be required to reimburse the Federal Government for that care. This will provide a savings of $92 million in fiscal 1982 and greater savings in subsequent years. I might point out that language in the Broyhill amendment would repeal the entitlement entirely and. therefore. if the Broyhill amendment is adopted. there will be a contradiction between title 9 and title No. 3. The committee has also provided for a fee to be imposed on the dumping of materials in the ocean in fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1984. The fee can be as much as $5 per ton. This will produce revenues of at least $300 million per year in fiscal 1983 and fiscal 1984. I might note that Public Works Committee has reconciliation language also affecting dumping fees. and there will have to be a resolution of the differences in conference. Finally. I might note our committee would include language providing for a comprehensive system of oil spill liability. Because of jurisdictional questions. the Budget Committee has chosen to drop this section.",

The Republican budget resolution would have us sacrifice the security of one group of older Americans in order to finance the growing defense budget and extravagant taxgiveaways for the rick. The effort to cap COLAs for Federal annuitants is neither justifiable nor equitable. In fact. Just 2 months ago. the House voted overwhelmingly. 327 to 94. to reject a cap on benefits for military and civil service retires. The situation facing Federal retirees has not changed since then. There are still half a million survivors. most of them elderly women. who receive only about $5.000 a year from the system. They absolutely cannot afford further reductions in their source of livelihood. Federal retirees face the same inflationary pressures as do social security and railroad recipients. They deserve the same protection. Utility companies. supermarkets. doctors. and landlords exact the same price increases from Federal annuitants as they do from the rest of our Nations retirees. Federal employees and retirees know all to well that they have shouldered more than their share of the burden in recent rounds of budget cuts. Their job security has been Jeopardized. their pay has not kept up with the private sector. their health insurance has been slashed. and their retirement benefits have been reduced. Is this the way to treat those men and women who have devoted their lives to public service? I applaud the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service for refusing to break our commitment to Federal retirees who contributed to their pension funds in good faith.

The committees amendment to section 3 of the bill will require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission. to select an appropriate frequency for Radio Marti. Prior to selecting a frequency. the NTIA must provide an opportunity for public comment. The committee feels very strongly that an opportunity for public comment is essential to insure that members of the American public. especially those domestic broadcasters who may suffer severe consequences as a result of the operaton of Radio Marti. will be able to make their views known to the Government before a domestic radio frequency is selected for Government use. The Committee on Energy and Commerce is concerned that the integrity of the broadcast industy in this country be protected and maintained. The committees amendment sets forth four explict criteria for the NTIA to meet when selecting a frequency which are designed to provide some guarantees that the U.S. broadcast system will continue to function as the best in the world. First. the frequency which is selected must afford nonGovernment broadcast stations the level of protection currently prescribed in the FCCs rules and regulations. Those rules define protection in terms of objectionable interference. Thus. the operation of Radio Marti must not cause interference which exceeds the FCCs objectionable interference standards. The second criteria requires that the frequency selected must result in \"the least\" interference possible to nonGovernment radio broadcasting in the United States as a result of any countermeasures taken by the Government of Cuba in response to Radio Marti. These countermeasures might take the form of Jamming Radio Martis broadcasts within Cuba or in the United States. highpowered broadcasting on the frequency selected for Radio Marti. random or generalized Interference within the nonGovernment radio spectrum. or increased Cuban broadcasts into the United States to counter broadcasts to Cuba.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1486 would establish the Protection Island National Wildlife Refuge in Jefferson County in Washington State. Protection Island consists of 400 acres located in the entrance to Puget Sound in the State of Washington. Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Washington have identified it as a unique seabird habitat of national significance. This island is particularly valuable for two species of birds that have highly specialized habitat requirements. the rhinoceros auklet and tufted puffin. Owls. nighthawks. swifts. finches. and many types of western songbirds also reside on Protection Island and in recent years two pairs of bald eagles have nested on the island. A larg pod of harbor seals uses the island for whelping and resting. The island has been subdivided for residential and recreational development since 1968. In 1974. the county placed a moratorium on building until a Stateapproved water system could be developed. As a result. only a few houses have been constructed. If a water system is constructed and largescale development results. there is a real concern that the result would be the reduction or elimination of the seabird habitat and the loss of a natural resource of national significance. Of particular concern is the potential for the release of rats or feral cats. both of which would have serious effects on ground nesting species such as the auklet. H.R. 1486 would create the Protection Island National Wildlife Refuge which would be managed by the Secretary of the Interior through the Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System. An authorization of $5 million for acquisition. beginning in fiscal year 1983. is included in the bill. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1486. as reported by the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. would direct the Secretary to offer life estates or other extendeduse reservations to those who own habitable residences on the island. The number of the residences is not great nor is their present use damaging to the birdlife on the island. I believe that. with this amendment. the legislation strikes a fair balance between the protection of the birdlife and respect for the rights of the landholders and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I support the passage of H.R. 1486. a bill to assure that the integrity and values of Protection Island in Washington State are retained and perpetuated for the nesting seabirds and the harbor seals found in Puget Sound. The island serves as an extraordinary breeding area for six species of seabirds. Over 40.000 seabirds utilize the 400acre island for nesting. In addition. the beach areas serve as habitat for pupping and hauling out activities of harbor seals. In 1968 a development company purchased the island and initiated plans to develop it as a residential and recreational home subdivision which included nearly 1.100 lots. To date nearly 600 lots have been sold. but in 1974 a building moratorium was imposed on Protection Island until a Stateapproved water system could be developed. Consequently. development has been limited to a small airstrip. an unapproved road system. a marina. and a small number of residences. However. there is no doubt that should the water problem be resolved and development commence. the value of this island as a seabird nesting site would be dramatically reduced. Many of the property owners on Protection Island have indicated a willingness to sell their lots in order to facilitate the establishment of a national wildlife refuge. However. other landowners are opposed to selling their property. Many want to continue to visit or reside on their property. and others want to maintain ownership for investment purposes. The legislation before us today will authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the lands. waters. or any interest in such lands and waters on Protection Island as are necessary to carry out the purposes of the refuge. At the same time. those lotowners who had structures on their lots suitable for personal residence on January 1. 1981. are assured of being offered life or other extendeduse reservations on their property. The bill assures the protection of the birds and marine mammals and their important habitat while providing for the continuation of a limited number of activities. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I want to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 1486.",

I first would like to thank my colleague from the State of Washington. who introduced this legislation. for all his help in getting the bill to the House floor for consideration today. I would also like to commend the members of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee for their unanimous support of this bill. The abundant wildlife resources on this 400acre island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca has been identified by both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Washington as a unique seabird habitat of national and international significance. The islands location and topography are also ideally suited for some marine mammals as well. In contrast. the lack of potable water and high winds make human habitation on the island difficult. Protection Island has two histories: A long history of being perhaps the most important seabird nesting area in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. and a relatively short. unsuccessful history for recreational development. Other islands in Puget Sound and the San Juans possess far better recreational development potential than Protection Island. However. few. if any. locations are left which would provide suitable habitat for these species. Although the island is relatively small. there are a substantial number of private lot owners. A survey conducted last year by the Protection Island Property Owners Association revealed that many would be interested in selling their property to the Federal Government for the purpose of creating a wildlife refuge. Others expressed specific reservations about selling their lots to the Federal Government. This legislation addresses those reservations by incorporating an amendment adopted during the subcommittee markup. which provides the Fish and Wildlife Service with the necessary flexibility to treat all the property owners fairly. I urge that this bill be passed with the support of the full House. Thank you.",

This fund was established under title IV of the 1978 amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953. It was intended to compensate commercial fishermen for damage to fishing gear resulting from oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. Unfortunately. the Administrative Law Judge proceedings set up for processing claims by regulations implementing the act have proved to be cumbersome. costly and timeconsuming. For example. of the 176 claims filed under title IV. only 11 had been paid when H.R. 3816 was introduced. and it had required an average of 22 months to process each of these claims. The purpose of H.R. 3816 is to simplify and expedite the claims process. to substitute a simple new \"Loss of Profits\" formula. and to assure that claims hereafter are heard and determined within a maximum of 120 days. The bill increases the total amount of the fishermens contingency fund from $1 million to $2 million. but continues to derive the funds from fees charged Outer Continental Shelf oil exploration permittees and oil line easement holders. The bill authorizes no appropriations. It does just what its title says: It improves the operation of the fishermens contingency fund which was established to compensate commercial fishermen for damages resulting from oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. The motion to suspend the rules incorporates four amendments designed to improve the bill. In a moment. the gentleman from Louisiana will explain the amendments. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I join my distinguished colleague in supporting H.R. 3816. I support this legislation because it will insure the smooth operation of what was intended to be an effective conservation program for fishermen whose vessels or gear are damaged by OCS oil and gas exploration. development. and production. When the OCS Lands Act was amended in 1978 to establish the gear compensation program. it was in anticipation of the expansion of oil and gas activities which we expected would lead to conflicts between the offshore oil and gas industry and commercial fishermen. We also expected that the procedure for determining the validity of fishermens claims would result in timely and equitable payments to fishermen. As the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee stated. our expectations have not been fulfilled. Not only has the amount of money spent on administration of the program far exceeded the total amount of claims paid. but some claims filed up to 3 years ago still have not been acted on. Long delays have occurred even after a claimants eligibility for damages has been acknowledged. The continuation of such delays is intolerable. Mr. Speaker. this Nations fishermen should not be asked to assume the economic burden of OCS oil and gas activities. The issue before us today is whether our fishermen should be forced to wait an average of 22 months for the Federal Government to act on their claims. My answer is no. and the answer in H.R. 3816 is no. The legislation before us today establishes a simplified procedure for determining appropriate compensation and for processing the paperwork associated with claims decisions. H.R. 3816 will provide necessary relief to domestic fishermen who are now overburdened with the excessively complicated requirements of title IV. In this sense H.R. 3816 is not a new direction in congressional policyrather it furthers one of the basic policies intended to be established by the 1978 law. Further. by simplifying the claims procedure it is expected that the cost of administering the program will be reduced between 15 and 25 percent. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 3816 will remove the roadblocks that have plagued implementation of the fishermens contingency fund. I urge my colleagues to join me in responding to the needs of domestic fishermen by supporting this legislation.",

In 1792. on a beautiful May morning Capt. George Vancouver set out destined for a small island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He recorded in his journal. \"we found the sea almost covered with aquatic birds.\" As Vancouver ventured onto the island and scaled the plateau he continued in his journal. \"a landscape almost as enchantingly beautiful as the most elegantly finished pleasure grounds in Europe.\" He later named the island Protection Island because of the haven it provided from the harsh winds. Today. aquatic birds still continue to nest there. 21.000 pairs of seabirds nest on this haven representing six major bird species and 72 percent of all seabirds breeding in the strait and the Puget Sound. In addition. Protection Island provides a habitat for harbor seals for loafing and pupping. Without a doubt. Protection Island should be part of our National Wildlife Refuge System. In addition. it is a prime candidate because often the most difficult problem in any Federal acquisition has been worked out. Provisions for property owners who would like to maintain their present level of usage and for those who would like to sell have been arranged in this bill.

I wish to reemphasize some fundamental principles which I believe should guide all of the concerned parties on this issue. First. there must be no physical intervention by the Soviet Union. As I mentioned previously. the Polish Government could not have initiated this crackdown on Solidarity without Soviet prior approval. But actual direct Soviet intervention would raise the confrontation to a new level. It would make a mockery of the Helsinki Final Acts and demonstrate a callous disregard for the need for alternative governmental and economic models within the Warsaw Pact. Such Soviet intervention should be met in the West by swift economic and diplomatic reprisals. Second. the gains won by Solidarity over the last year should not be rolled back by the Polish Government. A government which purports to represent the common worker cannot maintain legitimacy if it proceeds to overturn solemn commitments previously made to millions of Polish workers. Demands on both sides should be subject to debate and negotiation. Restraint must be manifest on the part of the Polish Government. Failure to do so merely exposes the Polish Governments policy of slavery. and in the long run. benefits neither the Polish people nor the Government. And finally. the Polish and Soviet Governments must respect human rights. They are obligated to follow this course as a consequence of the Helsinki accords. Should they deviate from this commitment. then they must expect appropriate responses from the West. as well as from independent internal sources in Poland.",

The language of section 103(a) requires that in order to be eligible for dutyfree status under this bill an article must either be \"wholly the growth. product or manufacture of a beneficiary country\" or must be changed into a \"new or different article of commerce\" in such country. The language prohibits products from being considered new or different merely by having undergone \"simple combining\" operations. Tobacco growers in this country are understandably concerned that the Customs Service will rule that imports of unmanufactured tobacco from Brazil or some other country can meet this new or different article test by simply being shipped to the Caribbean. stripped or cut. and then blended with a small amount of indigenous Caribbean tobacco.

I would point out that on page 12 of the committee report we state the following about section 103(a): The object of these provisions is to prevent passthrough operations in which the work performed is of little economic benefit to the Caribbean and constitutes avoidance of U.S. duties. That is exactly the kind of abuse that the gentleman is referring to. the mere changing of leaf tobacco from one form to another by cutting and blending and stripping. I should add. to avoid duties.

I am satisfied that the 35percent value added rule has proven its effectiveness in preventing this from happening in other areas and can do the same here. If we exempt every imaginable product. then this important Caribbean Basin Initiative will not involve any risks for anybody. but it will be worthless and insulting to our neighbors. If we exempt almost every product. then any few remaining dutyfree products could have a serious impact on American producers. It would be far better in my opinion if we allow a wider range of dutyfree trade opportunities for our friends in the Caribbean.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I believe that the Bradley substitute represents an attractive alternative to price and allocation controls. It would allow the market to allocate supplies during a shortage and recycle revenues back to consumers in order to address the equity problem associated with a free market response to a shortage. The Bradley proposal could be designed to protect the financial problems faced by the poor in a way not possible or likely with allocations and price controls. This is an innovative approach and should be vigorously pursued. However. I have some reservations about the form in which this amendment has been offered. I would prefer that it was not a substitute for S. 1503. the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act. There remain too many questions at this time as to how it will work for it to be relied upon by itself. How it would be implemented? How would the levels of tax and the recycled revenues be set? How would the tax be enforced? Those who are most hurt by price increases are frequently those most difficult to locate and provide payments. There must also be found a way to avoid the delay in recycling the revenue which can cause economic slowdown. Most importantly. assured methods of equitable and rapid revenue recycling throughout the economy must be found before we should rely on this approach alone. I would have preferred that we would pursue the Bradley proposal and keep the program contained in the Energy Petroleum Allocation Act as a backup until the proposal is ready for effective implementation. I do not expect the amendment in its current form as a substitute to prevail but I intend to vote for it to express my suoport for the concept. It offers the potential for developing an innovative alternat.ve to direct Government intervention in energy markets with price and allocation controls. an alternative that does not just leave consumers to the mercy of the market but also offers the potential to address the economic inequities inherent in the market and protect low- and middleincome consumers.*",

I think the comments of the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Louisiana again return to the traditional patterns of looking at these issues. The Senator from Idaho remarked that the market is not equitable. I do not pretend that the market is equitable. I have stated onlyand repeatedlyin this debate. that the market is efficient. It is Governments role to address the equity issue. and that is precisely what this amendment does. It allows the market to allocate oil. and it allows the Government to address the equity issue directlynot with any new taxes. as has been implied. and not with programs that are established by bureaucracy. Those who want price controls and allocations are for Government bureaucracy. It seems to me that the election last year was also. in large part. about Government bureaucracy. Let us be clear that it is not the Senator from New Jersey who. in this amendment. is proposing a great expansion of Government bureaucracy. It is the proponents of price controls and allocations. As I have said. the choice is clear. We have to begin to look at our problems in this country by breaking out of the old categories. If you were for redistribution. you were for Government programs and higher taxes. Mr. President. I am for taking care of the people who will have to pay the price for the higher oil prices that will come from letting the market work. but I am for that by cutting Government bureaucracy and providing tax cuts.

Mr. President. the SPR now contains over 210 million barrels with another 25 million on order.

The reserve should now be used in lieu of a crude oil allocation program. The early use of a portionsay 10. 15 or 20 percentof the SPR would serve two principal purposes: First. it would provide the incentive for all refiners to store crude oil in anticipation of oil supply disruptions. second. it puts oil on the market early in a supply disruption to soothe uncertain markets and put downward pressure on the world oil price.

This May. the State Department closed the Libyan Mission in Washington. In closing the mission. the State Department cited \"a general pattern of unacceptable conduct.\" and \"a wide range of provocations and misconduct. including support for the international terrorism.\" Also in May of this year. Secretary of State Haig stated. in a speech in St. Louis. that Libyas oil revenues \"are almost exclusively diverted to the purchase of armaments. the training of international terrorists. and the conduct of direct intervention in the neighboring states of Northern Africa.\" In briefing the press on the speech. a State Department spokesman called Libya \"the patron saint of terrorism.\" Mr. President. we will be spending millions of dollars in military aid and assistance to Tunisia. Sudan. and Morocco in order to permit those countries to resist Libyan terrorism. Mr. President. to sum up. what we are talking about is basically an outlaw regime. headed by an international renegade. There is a clear inconsistency in U.S. policy. On the one hand. we condemn terrorism as a part of foreign policy. on the other hand. we condone terrorism as a part of our energy policy. What our amendment is attempting to do is to provide some consistency in condemning terrorism. not only as a matter of foreign policy. but also as a matter of energy policy. It is immoral and inexcusable for the United States to pay billions of dollars a year for Libyan oil. The fact of the matter is: Our dollars speak much louder than words. Now is the time for us to take this clear and firm action. Oil from Libya is tainted with the blood of Libyan terror. Libyan murder. and Libyan assassination. Unquestionably.

This longoverdue measure is designed to correct what I feel is an unintended application of our maritime tort laws. Under present law. a foreign citizen who is injured while working on an oil rig located within the territorial waters of a foreign nation is encouraged to file suit in U.S. Federal courts because of the record of generous settlements. Mr. Speaker. I do not believe that our maritime tort laws. which were enacted to protect workers employed on traditional blue water merchant vessels. were ever intended to cover the activities of these oil rig service workers. In an effort to clarify this situation. H.R. 4863. stipulates that an injured foreign worker must first seek relief in either the court system where the accident occured or the courts of his own nation. If the worker is unable to obtain redress in either of these court systems. then and. only then. may he utilize our court system and petition for relief. In short. this bill directs those foreign injured workers to utilize our court system as a remedy of the last resort not of the first. as is currently the case. Let me also emphasize that this legislation will have absolutely no effect on American seamen and more importantly is not retroactive in application. Therefore. those families of workers who were regrettably killed on the ocean ranger are not precluded from seeking relief in our court system. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4863. sets forth an equitable solution as to when foreign offshore oil and gas workers may seek U.S remedies for alleged injuries which occured overseas. I am convinced that with the passage of this bill our offshore service companies will be able to remain strong around the world and that there will be thousands of jobs for Americans overseas.

If H.R. 4863 is enacted. such a foreign worker would not be able to obtain a remedy in U.S. courts if he had a remedy available in his home nation. or in the nation with jurisdiction over the accident site. if different.

Federal investments in the past have helped encourage development on these relatively unstable areas. There is potential for very high cost in Federal disaster relief. flood insurance. and other programs if the Federal Government continues to encourage development of the undeveloped barrier islands. I would stress that this legislation does not affect previously developed barrier islands. Although there is still some question as to exactly which portions of mapping done by the Department of the Interior will be included. I am confident that the final maps will reflect appropriate protection for the most important undeveloped barrier islands. Development on the relatively unstable islands will not be prohibited. of course. but those developing will have to do so at their own risk. What is eliminated is the commitment of Federal funds to provide services or recovery in case of flooding or similar problems. The Committee on Public Works and Transportation has jurisdiction over the Disaster Relief Act. EPAs construction grants program for sewage treatment plants and the Corps of Engineers water resources programs. among others. It is these types of programs which would be limited through this legislation. In carrying out this legislation. the Federal agencies must. of course. insure that existing facilities and projects continue to be protected and maintained. In addition. activities in the area of undeveloped barrier islands by. for instance. the Corps of Engineers. may be necessary in order to protect a project located on the mainland or on the channel between the barrier island and the mainland.

Members who represent districts which would be affected by the legislation have been consulted and. to my knowledge. all disputes concerning their districts have been resolved or otherwise compromised. I would like to compliment the gentleman from Delaware for an excellent job of bringing everyone together to move the bill. Without the gentlemans efforts. I doubt that we would be debating this measure at this time. The chairman of the full committee. Mr. JONES. and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment. Mr. BREAUX. as well as the subcommittees ranking minority member. Mr. FORSYTME. should also be recognized for their hard work and support for this legislation. Mr. Speaker. this bill has the laudable goals of reduced Federal expenditures and enhanced environmental protection. I urge my colleagues to support it.",

I am very much aware of the sincerity of the view expressed by the able gentleman who just concluded. I realize it is always not an easy matter to decide between one age and another. but this House has a fine record of opening up the doors of opportunity for work to older people. When we started the legislation that originated in this House. even in the Federal Government. where there was a mandatory period when you could mandatorily require anybody to quit work on account of age. We have eliminated that for the Federal Government. except in specific instances. At the time in private industry you could mandatorily retire anybody at 65. We raised that to 70. Not long ago there was an instance of the Foreign Service. A lot of the Foreign Service personnel complained that they were being required to give up their employment for certain professions which they had given a lifetime of effort at 60 years of age. This House finally originated a change in the law that moved it to 65. so that now in the Foreign Service you may continue to work. that is. you cannot be mandatorily retired for age alone below 65 years of age. We have a statute on the law books of our Government that forbids discrimination on account of age. I realize there may be instances where there should be exceptions. but it does seem to me that this House should push forward the boundaries of opportunity for older people. To say that a man absolutely cannot be fit to work in a prison if he is 352 years old is wrong. He could be a champion prize fighter. he could be a champion baseball player. he could have whatever mental and physical excellence a man might possess. and yet the fixed age. fixed by the Attorney General pursuant to the law of this Congress. says that you cannot work if you are over 35 years of age in a Federal prison.",

We have come to that stage. but this House has been pushing back the borders of discrimination for years here and there. I do not see this amendment would do any harm.

When you can pick up any newspaper in this country and see the unrest and the overcrowdedness within our prisons. I think it would be deplorable for us to fail to enact this amendment today to let people over 45 years of age obtain these jobs. There is nothing mandatory in the amendment. It simply says to the Justice Department that if you can take advantage of the abilities of these men and women who are now retired and cannot find jobs. then perhaps you should put them to work to restore peace in the prison facilities throughout this country.

It is an acute problem in all their offices. but especially in the Miami field office. In Miami. they have only 3.2 percent of all the INS personnel outside Washington and yet they are processing 4.7 percent of the nationwide applications for changes in status and they are processing 6 percent of applications for naturalization. This amendment as offered would correct that imbalance. so although I intend to support the chairmans bill. the committees bill. on the much needed restoration of these positions that are targeted for destruction. these positions that were targeted for elimination. I would hope that through this statement on this amendment that INS will understand that the priorities need to be rearranged and some additional personnel are needed to address the problems of just being swamped with applications in Miami.

It is through simply being overwhelmed with the paperwork and not having at their disposal the kinds of machinery and equipment that would enable them to provide prompt answers. As the gentleman has already cited. and I appreciate his mentioning it. of course. the bill before this House today. which I hope is approved overwhelmingly. would restore 973 positions of the 1.355 which the administration proposed to cut and in that case some 200 adjudicators who do a great deal of the kind of work the gentleman cites.

They expect their taxes to continue to decrease as we have promised. and we must insure that this is one promise we do not break.

If Members will look. he demands that the House Committee on Agriculture reduce budget authority by $271 million for fiscal year 1983. and that we reduce budget outlays by $2.742 billion in 1983. Go to any of the agricultural experts. go to the economists on the Committee on Agriculture. and ask them how that can be accomplished. There is only one way that we can have a cut in budget outlays of $2.7 billion with only a cut of $271 million in budget authority. and that is to cut the guts out of our price support program. The only way that we can get that cut in budget outlays for next year is to totally abolish the dairy price support program. reduce loan rates for corn and wheat and cotton and every other crop in this country. But. I do not think anyone has focused on this yet. I was just over in the Agriculture Committee and we are having hearings on the Farm Crises Act for this year. and I know that a number of my rural colleagues on both sides of the aisle have cosponsored that bill which calls for additional loan rates for setaside programs for next year. There is no way under the Rousselot instructions of reconciliation that that can possibly be accomplished.",

Members should go out and talk to their coops and see how they would like that one. It abolishes the Packers and Stockyards Administration. Members should go out to their livestock producers and see how they would like to have the Packers and Stockyards Administration abolished. The Office of Transportation is cut out of the Department of Agriculture. Ask those of us from Iowa. who are having problems with our roads and with our railroads. whether or not we want the Office of Transportation stricken from the Department of Agriculture.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the budget debate with which we are currently engaged is confusing and complex. to say the least. The serious condition of our economy has been eloquently described by Members on both sides of the aisle. that the business and financial communities await the result of our deliberations with great anticipation is an understatement. The single most stringent impediment to economic recovery remains the persistence of high interest rates. The disastrous state of interestsensitive industries. such as autos and housing. bears stark testimony to the effects of doubledigit interest rates in terms of foregone output and investment and of lost jobs. It is generally accepted that the single most important cause for high interest rates in the projected size of the fiscal year 1983 budget deficit. as well as outyear projections. Unfortunately. with but one exception. all the budget proposals before us contemplate fiscal year 1983 deficits totaling more than $100 billion. The adoption of such a budget can hardly send the appropriate signal to either the financial community or our constituents in general. The adoption of such a budget reflects a continuing inability to limit Federal spending to a level consistent with our means. There is. however. a viable alternative. The Rousselot substitute provides for a balanced budget in fiscal year 1983. and. in so doing. enables us to finally control the runaway spending that for so long has plagued us. There can be no question that the size and scope of the Federal Government must be reduced. the Rousselot substitute achieves this objective by obtaining budgetary balance without increasing taxes. I am well aware that most of us in this body support the concept of a balanced budget. I particular. I am pleased to note that several of our colleagues on the Democratic side have. as evidence by our debate this week. joined what I might call the bornagain budget balancer club. Unfortunately. most of the balanced budgets so eloquently advocated are to occur sometime in the futureperhaps 1985. If the past is any guide. we should know that our record of achieving outyear budget targets is pretty slim. Mr. Chairman. we now have the opportunity before us to vote for a balanced budget in fiscal year 1983. We can go on record in support of immediate fiscal responsibility and the promise of early economic recovery. I trust that we will do so.o",

On the basis. of this single criteria. and this criteria alone. I support the balanced budget substitute. I strongly support a balanced Federal budget. As the author of a balanced budget constitutional amendment and as the author of additional legislation which would prohibit an unbalanced budget. I strongly believe restraint and discipline in the Federal budget must be reestablished. In March of last year. President Reagan said. \"the impact of spending reductions will be shared widely and fairly by different groups and the various regions of the country.\" I believe this commitment to fairness and equity must be honored. The balanced budget substitute is a success when it is judged on the single criteria of balancing the Federal budget. but is it less than successful when judged in terms of fairness. equity. and a fair shake for all of the American people. Inequities which are contained in current policies. such as tax loopholes devised and enjoyed by the few. are preserved and enshrined in the balanced budget substitute. My support for the balanced budget substitute proposed by Mr. RouSSELOT is a strong endorsement of a balanced Federal budget. but is not an endorsement of the inequitable means which have been proposed to achieve this important goal. The goal of balancing the Federal budget can be achieved while the commitment to fairness and equity is honored. Fair play does not prohibit a balanced budget. The Rousselot balanced budget substitute achieves but one of these goals. both are needed.*",

We do not cut social security. We do provide that there will be savings of some $26 billion by providing a 1year freeze. a suspension of further costofliving adjustments for that one fiscal year. without cutting anybodys check but leaving it at the same level for that one year. whatever it is on October 1. I believe that that sacrifice which is widely shared is a patriotic sacrifice. I will say that again. A sacrifice which is widely shared is a patriotic sacrifice that Americans can courageously believe in and accept. especially when they know that the benefit of doing that is going to be that their neighbors and their children and they themselves will be better off if we get interest rates down. as only this amendment can do. Now. we began some time ago in the budget deliberations with an illusion that cropped up. and apparently everybody began to believe in it. I myself began to believe in it during all the debate in the Budget Committee. The illusion was that the best anybody can do is to reduce that 1983 deficit from $182 billion down to about $100 billion or $110 billion. That was an assumption that people began to work on. that the best we could do is to cut that deficit in half. What happens. if you make that assumption. is that you come to a selffulfilling prophecy. What you do. if you believe that all you can get is halfway results. is you accept halfway measures. and if you propose a halfway measure. you get halfway results and you get a halfway recovery and you get interest rates coming down halfway and you get relief for unemployment in a halfway fashion. Halfway recovery leads to halfhearted investment and job expansion. With such a half recovery. indeed you do end up having to expand all the crutches. the subsidies. the bailouts. the compassionate generosity that will not be necessary if instead you go for a full recovery with a full press to get the budget into balance.",

October 14 will mark the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and is an important date in the history of the struggles of subjugated peoples for independence and statehood.

Ukrainian nationalists boldly and with right and justice on their side. declared their independence and issued a proclamation of the restoration of independence. Defiantly throwing off the yoke of oppression. the UPA launched a national liberation struggle against Hitlers Germany on one front and Stalins Soviet Union on another. The UPAs struggle to recapture their independence was a light in the Ukrainian story that was bright but all too brief. It was darkened by the German occupation forcesthe Proclamation of Independence was negated and the Ukrainians proclaimed prime minister. Yaroslaw Stetsko. was forced into a concentration camp. Later. the Red army took control and to this day. the Soviet Union maintains an oppressive government in Ukraine which persistently tries to obliterate all dreams of regaining independence. It saddens. and at the same time angers. freedomloving people everywhere to see that where the Ukrainian spirit of independence once soared without restraint. it now is in the stranglehold of the Sovietsanother \"captive nation.\" Mr. President. during the first half of October. the Ukrainian community throughout the United States will be commemorating the founding of the UPA and its heroic actions.

Under present law construction workers who are away from their permanent homes at a temporary job site for more than a year are not permitted a tax deduction for their everyday travel expenses to and from the Job site. To take a typical example: A con. struction worker has lived and worked in a particular community for many years. He has a home in that community. his children go to school there. he and his wife vote and pay taxes there. Solely because of the nature of the construction industry. construction work becomes temporarily unavailable in the local area. The worker has two choiceshe can look for work at distant jobs until work becomes available closer to home. or he can remain unemployed. If he takes work at a distant Job. he must either move his family to that job or he can drive to the job each dayoften 50 or 60 miles each wayor he can rent a room near the Job. The first optionmoving his family to the jobis simply not a realistic option. Accordingly. the travel expenses are clearly necessary to the conduct of the taxpayers businesssince the worker must incur those expenses if he is to practice his trade.

I wish today to clarify and reiterate a provision in the Senate committee report on the continuing resolution pertaining to section 625 of the Education of the Handicapped Act for regional postsecondary programs for the deaf. The purpose of this provision is twofold: First. to insure that there continues to be four contract awards to programs serving the deaf. and second. that those contract awards receive the same portion of funding as in previous years. The three initial grantees under the regional education program were the California State University at North. ridge (CSUN). the Seattle Community College. and the St. Paul (Minnesota) Technical Vocational School. In 1975. Delgado College in New Orleans was added. The four original programs: Delgado. CSUN. St. Paul TVI. and Seattle Community College cover the spectrum of types of postsecondary institutions. Delgado is a college. CSUN Is a university. St. Paul TVI is a technical vocational institute and Seattle is a community college. These four regional education programs taken together serve a national constituency. Students have been served from every State. including Alaska and Hawaii. the District of Columbia and several territories. As much as I would like to see that these four programs be guaranteed continued funding I understand the necessity of competition for these contract awards to help insure that the best possible programs are serving deaf students. I am confident that these programs will fare well in a competitive situation. However. I am concerned that the funding for these contract awards could be diluted if many more awards are made under section 625 and that deaf students would not be as well served if the money is spread too thinly. Therefore. while postsecondary institutions will compete for the contract awards to serve deaf students under section 625 our intent is that four contract awards be made and those four awards receive the same portion of the available funds under section 625 as in fiscal year 1982. I would like to thank Senators WEICKER and ScHmsrr for their help in protecting postsecondary educational opportunities for deaf students.

This debate is a historic opportunity for the country to focus on its fiscal procedures. But remember that all that is intended is a presumption. Such a presumption is necessary if this Congress has not historically exercised the judgment that is required to keep the country in a sound condition. Congress should be a place of judgment.

Currently. there are approximately 300.000 permit holders. The party committees have about 130 of those permits. I do not believe it is at all unreasonable to grant our party committees the same advantages as we have granted the National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation. Inc.. the Moral Majority. Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress. Ralph Nadars Public Citizen. American Tax Reduction Movement. National Taxpayers Legal Fund. Inc.. National Coalition To Ban Handguns. Zero Population Growth. Ford Foundation. PTAs. Common Cause. State Agriculture Extension groups. all the labor unions. and college fraternities and sororities. Mr. Chairman. for the last decade. editorial writers. academicians. election law specialists. leaders of our parties. Democrats and Republicans have been distressed over the weakening of our twoparty system. When the Congress -passed the legislations allowing party committees access to the lower mail rate. we took a small step to slow down the decline of our parties. I am pleased that the amendment to deny our political parties the right to compete fairly with other special interest political groups will not be offered this year.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to this amendment. This is a flagrant attempt by the Reagan administration to cater to those who oppose gun control. The NRA continues to lobby against the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms. But at issue here is not gun control. it is crime control. We are discussing the possibility of inadequate staffing of two of our most vital Federal law enforcement and revenue collection agenciesthe BATF and the Customs Service. I strongly object to this sneaky attempt to cripple them at a time of increasing need for law enforcement. Criminal misuse of explosives and firearms is reported daily by the news media across the country. Reductions in personnel in BATF. the agency responsible for investigating criminal activities involving firearms. may result in losses in life. property. and revenue. the cost of which may be far higher than any savings from the proposed reductions. We must provide the Bureau with as many law enforcement personnel as needed to function at current levels. To do less would imperil its mission. Customs is a revenueproducing agency. Every dollar spent for enforcement of our customs laws returns $18 to the U.S. Treasury. Customs has an essentially uncontrollable workload. International trade and travel continue to grow. and the Customs Service must cope with this rising workload. A cut may mean shortterm savingsbut longterm costlier effects. There is invariably social cost for reduced enforcement. especially in a reduction in customs efforts to stem the tide of drugs being smuggled into this country. The shortterm savings quickly bound back as longterm costs in other parts of the Federal. State. or local government budgets. There is growing concern over the rise in violent crime in this country. Congress should see that levels of employment in law enforcement agencies are maintained. This amendment would permit reductions in personnel. While it is recognized that there is extreme pressure on Congress to reduce spending. these cuts should be rejected. It would cripple the ability of these law enforcement and revenuecollecting agencies to control crime and maintain compliance with our Nations revenue collection system.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise to offer a twopart amendment to reduce the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms to the Presidents request and remove the mandated employment level from the bill. On page 3. line 23. strike out \"$155.591.000\". and insert in lieu thereof \"$150.591.000\". On page 4. line 7. strike: \"Provided further. That none of the funds made available by this Act shall be available for administrative expenses in connection with the affecting the reduction of employment in the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms below the level on April 30. 1981.\". Mr. Chairman. it seems clear from the testimony of many groups and individuals that there is no need to add this amendment to the BATF. which is $5 million above that which the President requested. The administration has carefully reviewed the programs of this agency. Certain programs have been reduced and emphasis shifted from lower priority activities to those of the higher payoff. Nowhere has anybody found any evidence that an added $5 million for BATF is needed or will produce any significant added gains in the fight against violent crime. In the absence of any compelling argument to the contrary. I believe that the administrations judgment on the funds needed for BATF to function effectively should be sustained. The second part of the amendment is to remove the mandated. and I stress that. mandated employment floor from the Bureaus budget. I believe this amendment is worthy even if the BATF amount is not even reduced. Mandatory minimum employment levels are bad per se in any case. Such restrictions make it impossible to meet the Presidents goal of restraining the size of the Federal Government. But here we find in this bill a mandated employment level as of April 30. 1981. These restrictions strike at the heart of the distinction between the executive and legislative branches. Since the administration has carefully reviewed the program and reduced or eliminated lowpriority programs and instituted management efficiencies. they must have the flexibility to carry out these changes. They cannot do so if their hands are tied with an artificial. and I stress that. artificial constraint which bears little relation to the agencys real needs. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I urge adoption of this amendment.",

Information given to me indicates that the BATF Firearms Criminal Enforcement Agency makes appreciably less than oneone arrest per agent per year. On the average. 18 months between arrests. Agency funding for criminal enforcement in this area works out to approximately $60.000 per arrest made in agency cost alone. That is considerably above State and local prosecution costs of approximately $5.000. And yet. we are saying that if we cut this agency $5 million the heavens are going to fall down when they make one arrest a year. Who are we trying to kid? Given the BATFs own productivity figures. at any given moment during fiscal year 1980 only 79 firearms agents out of a 1.463man work force were actually working on cases that would end in arrest. My friends. I think we ought to take a look at the costs of making one arrest. They ought to be able to do better than that. They come before this Congress and say. \"My. look what we are doing. We need more manpowJSE 17737 er. We are working ourselves to the bone.

As part of the national observance. the American Film Institute at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is presenting two films about the holocaust. Both films will be screened on April 28. starting at 8:45 p.m. Yesterday. I spoke about the first film in the series. \"Night and Fog.\" a halfhour documentary on the concentration camps. \"Night and Fog\" contrasts actual blackandwhite footage of the camps during the war with contemporary. color shots of Auschwitz today. Its factual tone contrasts dramatically with the story tone in the Institutes second film. This second film. \"The 81st Blow.\" is in Hebrew with English subtitles. It is the story of a Jewish boy living in the ghetto who suffers a merciless beatinga full 80 blows. After the liberation. he tells his story but nobody believes him. which to him. of course. is the 81st blow. The film is comprised of documentary footage and still photographs shot during this period. and the narration comes from the 1961 Eichmann trial in Jerusalem. The Long Island Press said of \"The 81st Blow:\" Seeing this film is not a depressing experience. It is a memorial to the spirit and courage of those who survived. Mr. President. the Days of Remembrance perform a vital function. We must remind ourselves of the holocaust. But we must do so in a substantial way. not a symbolic way. The American Film Institute is doing what they can to commemorate the Days of Remembrance. What can the Senate do? Is there no way for the Senate to show our dedication to this idea? Of course there is. We can take this opportunity to ratify the Genocide Treaty. Mr. President. have we not waited long enough to take action on this crucial treaty? Is 32 years not enough? Thirtytwo years is more than enough. We should take action now and ratify the Genocide Convention.",

These agents. acting on behalf of our Government. and in the interests of the people of the United States of America. are subject to the outrageous public exposure by individuals. some of whom are former members of those agencies. who have deliberately put them at risk. It was beyond any question In my mind that those people who are deliberately engaging in this practice are fully aware of the fact that such exposure can and has resulted in the loss of life and the breach of security and. consequently. affected the interests of the United States of America.

This measure aims at protecting the identities of those individuals whose anonymity serves the interest of the country. Moreover. this legislation would insure an appropriate balance between individual rights and the absolute necessity for secrecy in intelligence collection vital to the security of the Nation. The prohibitions contained in S. 391 are directed at punishing those individuals who intentionally and without authorization disclose information identifying intelligence officers and agents of the United States. This bill is not intended to apply to members of the press or others engaged in legitimate activities protected by the first amendment. It is intended. however. to stop those people who are in the business of \"naming names\" of our covert agents.

On this amendment. in which I am Joined as a principal cosponsor by Senator JAcxsoN of Washington. and by some 25 other Senators. I now review a bit of history. if I might. on the background of the amendment. The language which I am presenting along with Senator JACKSON is the language which was originally proposed and referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. It emerged from the Subcommittee on Security and TerrorIsm headed by the distinguished Senator from Alabama. and then was considered in the full committee. There this language was rejected by a very close vote of 9 to 8. In my Judgment. the committee language. which was adoptedand let me call it the committee amendmentsubstantially weakens the language which was originally in the bill which was adopted by the House. and which is in my amendment. Therefore. I am presenting this amendment. which passed in the House of Representatives last fall by a vote of 354 to 56. It is the language which the Senate Intelligence Committee originally adopted in 1980 by a vote of 13 to 1. Now. President Reagan has stated that our languageand by our language I mean the ChafeeJackson languageis \"far more likely to result in an effective law that could lead to successful prosecution.\" than the committee language. Mr. President. the key difference between the committee and the ChafeeJackson language relates to the standard of proof that would be used in a prosecution. The committee language requires that there be an effort to identify and expose agents with the intent to impair or impede the intelligence activities of the United States. Our language requires that there be a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose agents. with reason to believe that such activities would impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States. In other words. the difference is the committee language depends on the subjective intent of the person engaged in naming names whereas our language uses an objective standard of proof.",

If they will do so I will start with the first one by referring to page 11 of the committee report. committee finding No. 3. That finding states: The disclosure of such relationships to unauthorized persons is detrimental to the successful and efficient conduct of foreign intelligence. counterintelligence. and counterterrorism activities of the United States. My question for both Senator CHAFEE and for Senator BIDEN is: Did the committee by that finding intend to find that every disclosure causes a harm sufficient for Congress to regulate the disclosure. that is. does this finding recognize a generic harm on the part of such disclosures?",

These operations. concentrated in Africa. the Middle East. and South America. are said by these sources to have involved dozens of the thousands of former Army Special Forces veterans. better known as Green Berets. There are some very disturbing quotes by U.S. officials basically saying. \"Gee. we cant do anything about it.\" But. the other body thought something should be done about it. and even though we realize this is a delicate and very tricky area to legislate in. this amendment asks that the President report to the Congress within 6 months on current legislation and administrative remedies to prevent U.S. citizens from working in support of international terrorist leaders. the effectiveness of those legislative remedies. and available legislative and administrative alternatives. with an evaluation of their potential impact and effectiveness for dealing with the problem.

I share the gentlemans alarm and disgust regarding the unfolding saga of American involvement in Libyan terrorist activities. It seems exCIA agents Frank Terpil and Edwin Wilson have been exporting explosives. recruiting Green Berets for terrorist training. and recruiting American pilots and mechanics for the Libyan airforce. American involvement was so extensive in Libyan military activities in Chad that Michael Bedwell. a former U.S. Army pilot. said. \"If the Americans left. not one Chinook helicopter would be flying.\" These Americans are allegedly being paid out of a Swiss bank account controlled by Terpil and Wilson. The State Department has acknowledged that Americans were involved in Libyan activity in Chad. However. a Justice Department spokesman said that such activity was not illegal because it does not violate the Neutrality Act. This may be the case. but it does not make the actions any less heinous. And it does not mean we should sit by and allow these types of activities to continue. That is why this amendment is an important first step. to find out exactly what we can do to stop this. Colonel Qadhafi has been called. among other things. a madman. a cancer. and less than human. I tend to agree with such assessments and find if reprehensible that American citizens are assisting this lunatic in his terrorist efforts.

Members on both sides of the aisle have worked very hard to bring about legislation to combat international terrorism. Fighting international terrorism is the cornerstone of the administrations foreign policy and by passing this amendment. we can go far toward clamping down on a major source of international terrorismthe Libyan regime of Colonel Qadhafi. The issue which we must really consider is not whether America can tolerate the loss of Libyan crudebecause we can. The latest figures indicate that only 2.9 percent of American domestic deliveries come from Libya. Yet over 40 percent of all Libyan oil revenues come from the United States. Rather. the question we ought to consider is can Libya continue to carry out its terrorist plots if the United States cuts off all trade? I believe the answer to this question is \"No.\" Simply put. Libya needs American dollars and technology to finance its terrorist binges. Last year. the Libyan Government earned some $22 billion from the sale of its crude. Qadhafi has used this money to turn his country into an armed camp. He has purchased some $12 billion worth of arms and has some 5.000 Soviet and Cuban military advisers working in his country. Obviously. his intentions are anything but peaceful. But this is really only the tip of the iceberg. Qadhafi has spawned a network of international criminals whose sole function is to destabilize legitimate regimes and undermine Western interests. Qadhafi has financed such terrorist organizations as Italys Red Brigades. the PLO. and the Japanese Red Army. And recently. we have all read reports that Qadhafi has sent a 10man hit squad to the United States to assassinate the President and top administration officials. It is indeed sadly ironic that the Federal Governmentas the fourth largest consumer of Libyan oilmight very well have indirectly financed the training and equipping of this death squad. Simply put. then. we have a moral imperative to end the financing of Libyan terrorism through the purchase of Libyan oil. Granted. this cutoff may not stop world terrorism overnightbut it is a start.

If there is anything that one can say is amusing about Libya. it is that the newspapers and the media are expressing dismay at the fact that the administration is talking about this so much. And here we find Congress. in its capacity as junior Secretaries of State. issuing amendments condemning Libya. suggesting economic and political pressure on Libya to cease such activities. and asking for reports from the President. and so forth. Now. this is a very serious matter. and those people who are most competent to deal with it. I can assure every Member in this body. are dealing with it. I would hope that we could wait until this matter has been fully discussed and alternatives and options considered by the State Department. by the Defense Department. and by the White House before we interject ourselves into a posture of involvement in asking for reports. Let me just say this: I am no fan of the country of Libya. I was shocked when the brother of our former President had such an intimate relationship with that country.

The administration will consult with all interested congressional parties as soon as our view is completed.

Because of the direct nature of these payments. the program operates with under 1percent overhead. In Arizona. where more than 70 percent of the land is federally owned. county governments are very dependent on this source of revenue. The argument that counties are otherwise compensated by the development of resources on these lands does not hold water.

We have confidence in the Forest Service management. that they will dispose of the slash in the most effective possible way. and I do not think it is necessary to earmark funds for this particular purpose. As a matter of fact. in many of the national forests they have made them available to the public. and we find citizens going in on the weekends with trailers and taking the waste material out. I think this is a good way for the people to become acquainted with the national forests. It is good recreation and provides them with wood. and I do not believe it is necessary to earmark money to drag this out to the road so that it can be conveniently secured by those who want to use this energy material. The Forest Service is doing an excellent job of handling it and this amendment just simply is not necessary. But further. I would agree with the remarks of the previous speakers that we do not want to tamper with the road fund. It is probably too low as it is and in order to have timber sales we need access to the mature trees we are losing. Mount St. Helens is probably the worst case. We are losing mature trees in other parts of the national forests. As with every crop there is a time to harvest. The gentleman from Minnesota would appreciate that fact. There is a time to harvest. therefore. you need roads that we can get to trees otherwise they blow down and rot and are lost to the consumers of America.",

The legislation I have introduced will redress a situation that has continued much too long for the citizens of New Jersey and Delaware. After years of petitioning the FCC the citizens of these two States still have not achieved their objective. My bill calls for amending the Communications Act of 1934 to bring a locally based VHF station to each State of the Nation. New Jersey needs its own VHF station. and the legislation I am proposing today is the quickest and surest way to solve the present problem. With the importance of television in bringing the local news to the people of America. it is beyond reason to allow the Nations ninth most populated State to remain without any VHF television stations. Members of New Jerseys delegation have been working for years to achieve the provisions of my bill. We need to provide each State with at least one commercial VHF television station. At the present time New Jersey residents receive their television coverage from New York and Philadelphia stations. Because of the local nature of TV news reporting. New Jersey citizens receive very little information concerning the affairs of their own State. The situation varies very little in Delaware. However. VHF stations located in each individual State would be required to serve the needs and interests of its local broadcasting area. This would be much better than present FCC attempts to get the Philadelphia and New York stations to provide for better news coverage. attempts that have been well meaning but considerably short of being effective. The legislation I am introducing today will provide a process for the FCC to follow in order to move a station from a State which has more than enough VHF stations to the two States which do not have any. The bill states that the rights of all broadcasters shall be protected. No license can be removed because of this legislation. However. if the FCC in the normal course of its decisionmaking declines to renew. or revokes. a VHF license. it must move that station from a State that has more than one VHF station to a State that has none if it is technically feasible.",

These minerals. such as titanium. manganese. cobalt. platinum. and chromium. are vital to the preservation of our national security. The steel. tool. missile. and other major U.S. industries need these minerals for their operations. I believe that we are quickly rendering ourselves vulnerable to blackmail and price gouging by countries that export the critical metals. Only a few countries do any exporting and many of these. such as South Africa. Zambia. Zimbabwe. Zaire. and Gabon. are located in volatile parts of the world. Thus. they may not be a reliable source for these minerals in the future. In addition. the Soviet Union. another supplier of key minerals to the West. cannot be counted on to continue exporting should EastWest relations erode further. Moreover. the Russians are gaining footholds in Third World countries where they could one day threaten Western access to strategic minerals. Mr. Speaker. the poor state of U.S. preparedness in this regard is disturbing. Imports meet more than 50 percent of our requirement for 20 important minerals. and the situation in Western Europe and Japan is even worse.

It is said that everyone is Irish on Saint Patricks Day and we Members of Congress are no exceptions. So it is with a mutual pride that we can applaud the declaration of March 17. St. Patricks Day. as a legal holiday in the village of Briarwood Beach. Ohio. This declaration was the first official act of Mayor Leonard English after he became mayor of the village January Briarwood Beach is in the 13th District of Ohio represented by my good friend. DON PEASE. I am sure he will join me in saluting this fitting tribute to the descendants of the Auld Sod.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. once again our Nation faces a most difficult decision of foreign policy. which is the proposed sale of sophisticated military equipment to Saudi Arabia for use on its F15 fighter aircraft. This decision is especially important because the outcome is likely to signal the thrust of the new administration of Mr. Reagan. as well as the strength of the new Congress to affect the decisionmaking process in the executive branch. Mr. Speaker. I am disturbed at this proposed sale for two reasons. First. I was very hopeful that the new administration could initiate a Middle East policy that was not alarming to our staunch ally. Israel. I had hoped that one result of our recent national elections would be that the State of Israel. and its friends and supporters in the United States. would know clearly where they stand with us. I am fearful that this sale may already cloud their vision. Second. Mr. Speaker. I firmly believe that U.S. policy in the Middle East should focus on restraining the armament there. Perhaps we can still make some inroads along those lines in the future.9",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing legislation requiring the Federal Government to publish annual consolidated financial statements using the accrual method of accounting. At the present time. the Federal Government has no precise idea of how it stands financially because it does not compile consolidated financial statements. With a $700 billion plus annual budget. huge assets. and a massive public debt which distorts our economy. the Federal Government should know exactly where it has committed the taxpayers dollars. We could know this if we had a central place where all of the immense Government money machines activities were compiled and tabulated. That is where my proposal comes in. We need an accurate. annual accounting of where w6 are financially. Without this. it is difficult for us to intelligently decide on funding priorities. and it is virtually impossible to control backdoor spending. This latter problem. which represents a large leak in the National Treasury. comes from bureaucracies knowing how to hide pet projects in various accounts. where it would take an expert to root them out. Often. this spending is the kind which would wither away if exposed to the public eye. A consolidated financial statement would enable us to bring all Government financial activities together and thereby identify these drains on the overburdened taxpayers. The General Accounting Office and other agencies have already set up a task force to study ways to implement the very provisions my bill contains. Through this legislation. then. Congress has an opportunity to recognize the importance of that work and at last adopt this vitally needed accounting procedure. I urge immediate consideration and passage of the bill.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to honor the memory of Benjamin Kaufman. a Medal of Honor recipient from Trenton. N.J.. who passed away on February 5. Ben Kaufman was a tough soldier and a dedicated friend of his fellow enlisted men. He twice refused the honor of a commission because it would have meant leaving the regiment and his company. His courage was legendary. Blinded by a gas shell during an engagement in France while aiding in the rescue of several of his men. Ben dodged the medical detail and groped his way to find out how his company was getting on. The doctors sent him to a hospital but before he was officially released he made his way back to his unit and joined his men on the front lines. On October 4. 1918. Ben Kaufman performed his ultimate act of heroism during the Battle of the Argonne in France. He and two privates had been separated from their patrol. Within a few minutes the privates were wounded by German machinegun fire. leaving Kaufman on his own. As he charged the machinegun nest. an enemy bullet shattered his right arm. Using his left arm. he advanced alone lobbing hand grenades toward the Germans. When he got to the machinegun nest. he found 11 of the enemy dead. He took a 12th man prisoner and brought him back to the American lines. Ben Kaufmans bravery in the face of great danger earned him awards from nine governments and our country presented him with the Congressional Medal of Honor. A continuing dedication to his fellow veterans led Ben Kaufman to serve for 3 years as the national commander of the Jewish War Veterans and 9 years as the organizations executive director. He also served as the director of the New Jersey Employment Service in Trenton. Mr. Speaker. I am proud that Ben Kaufman was a resident of my congressional district and I am sure that my colleagues are equally proud of him for the service he rendered to our Nation. His bravery and love of country should serve to remind us all that our freedoms are precious.*",
