Specialist Wolf was an engineer assigned to the Headquarters and Headquarters Company of the 52nd Engineer Battalion of the 43rd Area Support Group. based in Fort Carson. CO. He was one of thousands of brave American service men and women serving in Iraq who confront danger everyday. Their tremendous risks and sacrifices must never be taken for granted. In October. Specialist Wolf spent 2 weeks of leave with his family in his hometown -of Scottsbluff. NE. While there. he visited his alma mater. Scottsbluff High School. and thanked students for writing to him in Iraq. Specialist Wolf leaves behind parents. Bob and Chris. brother. David. and sisters. Elli and Rachel. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all at this difficult time. In Iraq. Specialist Wolf assisted with the construction of housing and schools for U.S. soldiers and Iraqi citizens.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the 250 outstanding Vermonters who served in the 10th Mountain Division during World War II. I want to commend the Vermont Ski Museum for recognizing the significant contributions of these exceptional men by inducting them into the Ski Hall of Fame. As a fellow veteran who grew up in the era of World War II. I remember President Roosevelts call for volunteers. It came as no surprise that when the military asked for skiers. trappers. and woodsmen to serve in the 10th Division. many of those who responded to the call of duty were from our own Green Mountain State. For a young boy in Rutland. VT. these men were my heroes. The 10th Mountain Division distinguished itself in fighting on the island of Kiska in Alaska and in the mountains of Italy. Recently we have been reminded of the effectiveness of these soldiers on skis. At a time when modern weapons and sophisticated technology seemed to overshadow the 10th Divisions skills. recent conflicts in Afghanistan and other parts of the world have shown us that much of war boils down to human fortitude and a single man against the elements. Modern warfare has not .proven to be more effective than the 10th Mountain Division when it comes to fighting in these extreme elements over rugged terrain. We are coming back to basics. and hopefully military planners will never doubt the necessity of divisions with skills like the 10th as part of our national defense. After the war. many of the veterans of the 10th Mountain Division came home to leave their mark on the ski industry. Vermont was no exception. and the ski industry has flourished here due in part to the passion these individuals have for skiing. They are indeed members of the Greatest Generation and their selfless contributions are evident throughout our State. I applaud the Ski Museum for acknowledging your individual sacrifices. your defense of our country and your contributions to skiing. It is a privilege for me to join the many others in honoring each of you. You continue to be my heroes.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to recognize an important program that significantly assists our men and women who are fighting abroad. The war on terrorism is being fought on may fronts and around the world. Today. there are more than 140.000 troops stationed in Iraq. Afghanistan. and many more around the world. Many of these troops served in Afghanistan only to be almost immediately redeployed to fight in Iraq. These extended deployments have been trying for those left behind. But they have stepped up and met the challenge. They have answered the Nations call with enthusiasm and dedication. In Colorado. the large deployment from Ft. Carson has shown just how difficult it can be for many military families when our troops must be sent abroad. While the military is dedicated to taking care of its own. the current situation abroad means needs of the family will only continue to escalate. To address this. the four relief agencies representing the Army. Navy. Marine Corps. and Air Force recently combined into one umbrella relief organization in order to better provide assistance. The National Association of Broadcasters and its 1.000 television station and 6.000 radio station members recently produced and disturbed Public Service Announcements that encourage viewers and listeners to contribute to the Armed Forces Relief Trust. Broadcasters have a long history of involvement in this countrys national security. I commend them for dedicating airtime to this worthwhile cause. Last year. together. the four relief agencies distributed $109 million to military families in need. I am confident that by streamlining operations into one entity and with help from local broadcast stations to get the word out. the Armed Forces Relief Trust will be able to assist even more military families. We are counting on our brave young men and women in the field. They are relying on the Armed Forces Relief Trust. and the trust is counting on local broadcast stations. Local radio and television stations are performing an invaluable public service through this program. and I salute them. Since today is Veterans Day. I also salute those who have already experienced the hardships of war much like those currently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe the most important thing we can do for our veterans is say thank you for their service and sacrifice to our country.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in June of this year. the Federal Communications Commission issued a decision relaxing a number of important rules that limit consolidation in the media industry. In the months leading up to that decision. and ever since. a bipartisan group of Senators has sought to sound the alarm about the dangers of unbridled media concentration. Those efforts eventually led to Senate passage of a resolution to reverse the commissions decision. But the battle continues. and the outcome is uncertain. Most of the debate on this subject has focused on the details of rules limiting the national reach of broadcasters and the local crossownership of television. newspaper. and radio stations. But I would like to call attention to another important dimension of media concentration: the demise of independent producers. who are being bought up or driven out of business by the big networks and big studios. More and more. the television programming delivered to the homes of American families is controlled by a handful of executives in a handful of corporate boardrooms. Independent writers and producers are growing scarce. Indeed. there soon may be only two remaining independent Hollywood studies that produce scripted television programming. The others have either disappeared or linked up with one of the major networks. I think that having all programming produced by a few large media conglomerates could pose some real risks for creativity and diversity. That is why I would like to commend my colleague from Arizona. Commerce Committee Chairman JOHN MCCAIN. for his leadership in agreeing to cohost a dialogue with Chairman BILLY TAUZIN of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and representatives of studios. networks. writers. and producers. I am confident that under the direction of Chairman MCCAIN. this dialogue can produce positive discussion and concrete results. such as voluntary guidelines to help ensure diversity. competition. and opportunity in the market for television programming.

There is actually one person who. were he to speak. could speed this whole matter up very quickly. Miguel Estrada has written extensively on his views on very complex issues on law which would be of great interest to those who have to vote on somebody for a lifetime position in the courts. He has written extensively. but he has kept the writing secret. We have ample precedent for similar writings that have been made available for everything from a nomination of a man who became Attorney General to a man who became the Chief Justice of the United States. William Rehnquist. The Democratic leader and I wrote to the President and asked once again: Release those secret writings. Ironically. Mr. Estrada told us. when asked. he had no objection to those writings being released. He has no objection to them being released. It is only the White House has said: We will not release them. If they were released. I suspect we would then have a discussion of what is in those writings. and we would go to a vote up or down. win or lose. At least we would know what we are voting on. We would not have a stealth candidate before the Senate. I think the White House ought to look at the fact Mr. Estrada has said he has no objection to his writings being made public.

When the Founding Fathers decided that this body of 100 people would have the last word. to advise and consent on appointments to the Federal bench of judges who were seeking lifetime appointments. this is no trivial thing. It is not a personal thing when it comes to Miguel Estrada. I think the point I tried to make to the Senator from Nevada: We have approved 103 nominees from the Bush White House without fail. each one of them conservative politically. I am sure I disagree with them on many issues. but so be it. That is the nature of the system. I ask the Senator from Nevada. what is at stake in this debate. the reason it is taking so much time? Is it not a constitutional principle that goes beyond a cute political phrase as to whether or not this Senate is going to meet its constitutional responsibility to make sure that every nominee is honest and open and candid with the American people and the Senate so we do not end up with a secret judiciary. men and women who skate through by keeping their mouths shut?

And I believe. that if this Congress and this President had not squandered the budget surplus we could afford to give our seniors a benefit they deserve. It is well past time to assist with our seniors prescription drug costs. The Democratic substitute provides a reliable and affordable benefit to Americas seniors. This voluntary prescription drug coverage costs only $25 a month with a $100 deductible and provides a $2000 stoploss protection with no gaps in coverage. There are also special provisions to help the poorest seniors with either full payment or assistance on a sliding fee scale. The Democratic substitute I support also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to wield the collective bargaining power of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries to negotiate lower drug prices. And as the ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee. I was proud to help craft a similar plan which has helped our nations veterans lower their out of pocket drug costs. As a member representing a rural district. I also want to highlight the rural health care provisions included in the Democratic substitute. These provisions are essential to create equity in the reimbursement system between urban and rural hospital. They allow fair payments to hospitals that have a disproportionate share of lowincome patients. increases payments to rural home health providers without requiring a copay. and adjusts lowvolume payments for small hospitals. It also takes into account the physician shortage crisis in rural areas by finally correcting the huge disparity between urban rural hospitals. that drives providers from our small towns. All of these reasons make the Democratic alternative to H.R. 1 the right answer to the spiraling costs for prescription drugs for seniors. Medicare works for Americas seniors but. I oppose the GOPs efforts to privatize this system and provide a secondrate prescription drug benefit. I proudly support the Democratic substitute and I urge my colleagues to vote down H.R. 1 and vote Yes on the substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to oppose this Medicare privatization plan. which is masquerading as a prescription drug bill. This bill would force seniors who want prescription drug coverage to get it from private insurance companies. It provides no guarantee that insurance plans will be available. and when they are. premiums and benefits will vary widely. The bill also provides no coverage when a seniors prescription drug costs are between $2.000 and $4.900 per year. This huge coverage gap affects 47 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. This bill is also a giveaway to pharmaceutical companies. as it prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating lower drug prices. The primary beneficiaries of this bill are not the beneficiaries of Medicare. They are the wealthy special interests in the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry that give campaign contributions to Republicans. However. the most outrageous aspect of this bill is what it does to traditional Medicare. The bill would increase seniors cost for visits to the doctors office by raising the Medicare Part B deductible and indexing it for inflation. This could cost American seniors an estimated $8 billion. While this may seem like a tiny fraction of the Republicans $350 billion taxcutfortherich. it is a huge expense for senior citizens. many of whom live on limited incomes. This bill also divides Medicare into 10 or more regional plans in 2006 and then converts the entire Medicare program into a voucher program depending upon private insurance companies in 2010. If the Republicans really want to privatize Medicare. they should be honest with the American people and call this plan what it is. the Medicare Privatization Act. The Democrats alternative prescription drug plan on the other hand provides prescription drug coverage under Medicare with guaranteed and affordable premiums and benefits for all American seniors and no gaps in coverage. It is time for Congress to make prescription drugs available to all seniors who need them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican Medicare Privatization Act and support the Democratic alternative.",

Medicare is already on shaky financial legs. and this will add enormous extra expenses that will make it worse. Do we expect our children to pay a lifetime of higher taxes. and still find theres nothing left for them when they retire? That is what we face. I would like to add prescription drug benefits. but its wrong to promise something we cannot pay for. I want to preserve whats good about Medicare. not destroy it by making extravagant promises for political gain. The enormous extra spending under this bill will be far more than projected. Because todays Medicare is a huge price control system. many doctors already refuse to see Medicare patients. In just a few years this will make it worse. including price controls that will destroy the incentives for companies to create new medicines. What should we be doing? Since 76 percent of seniors already have drug coverage. we could focus on helping those who dont. But this bill undoes the coverage for those 76 percent. and puts them in a confusing new medical experiment. We should be stabilizing Medicare. so it can keep the promises already made. not making new promises that we dont have the money to keep. We should address the reasons why drug prices and healthcare costs are so high. By banning reimported drugs. were forcing Americans to subsidize farlower drug prices in other countries. We should change our policies so Americans only pay the lower world price. not a higher price. We should end the 130.000 pages of federal regulations that have driven the costs of medicine and healthcare through the roof. On average. for every hour they spend with a patient. doctors and nurses spend another halfhour to a full hour doing government paperwork. We should stress personal responsibility in healthcare. just as we did in welfare reform. so government resources are focused on those who cannot care for themselves. not on those who can. Bitbybit. Congress is undoing the principles of welfare reform. and undercutting basic American principles in the process.

The Republican plan before us today fails to offer the types of guarantees that our seniors need and deserve. There is no defined benefit and no standard premium. So when my seniors ask how much their premiums will be or how much their drugs will cost. I cannot answer them. This is unacceptable. This bill allows private insurance companies to decide premiums. prescription drug coverage benefits and even where coverage will be offered. This proposal threatens to dismantle Medicare and replace it with private health insurance coverage for all seniors. This is precisely the problem many seniors facethey cannot afford private insurance. and depend on Medicare. This bill also provides additional funding for rural hospitals. but not urban teaching hospitals. This is a serious oversight. Urban teaching hospitals are facing incredible budget shortfalls. They play a critical role in training tomorrows physicians. and their needs must also be addressed. If the Federal Government is going to offer additional funding to some hospitals. it must offer additional funding to urban teaching hospitals. The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that Americans who contribute to the Medicare program during their working years will have access to dependable. equitable. and affordable health coverage.

On the one hand. this legislation provides for greater equity in Medicare reimbursement which will bring millions of additional dollars to the State and help prevent an exodus of healthcare providers from rural counties. In addition. the brunt of the bill is about providing voluntary prescription drug coverage to Medicare eligible individuals. There is a conservative critique that the program is far too expensive. and a liberal critique that it is not generous enough. Both philosophical perspectives have a degree of validity. but the big picture is that Congress is moving in a direction of providing health security for millions of citizens. Low income individuals will. for the most part. be provided full comprehensive prescription drug coverage. Higher income citizens on a sliding scale will be provided partial coverage and all citizens will be provided coverage for catastrophic expenses. There will be a cost to society in providing these benefits but the benefits far outweigh the costs. There may be better approaches that can be envisioned now or developed later. but this is the only framework approach that has a chance of receiving majority support in both bodies without a Presidential veto. It may not be enough and it may be too deferred in implementation but it nevertheless marks an important first step to meeting the most challenging need of many senior citizens.",

Senator Strom Thurmond will endure as the leading example of a public servant due to his love and devotion to all the people of South Carolina regardless of status. race. politics or region. He was our living legend. Stroms life was dedicated to achieving peace through strength. as shown by his military service in liberating Europe from Nazi fascists. his tireless work in fighting for a strong national defense in Congress which ultimately led to the defeat of Soviet communism. He pioneered the development of the South Carolina Republican Party from effective nonexistence in the 1960s to majority status by the end of the century. He has been a role model of service to South Carolinas young people and our family has had three generations on his staff: my wifes two uncles were staff attorneys. my wife and I were interns. and our three oldest sons were pages. A distinguished highlight for our family was to host Senator Thurmond on the last Sunday before his last election in 1996 at the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia.

Under average wholesale price systems built into Medicare by the Democratic Party all these years. this is what happens. A person goes in for cancer therapy. a senior citizen. and the doctor needs a drug that costs $10. so the doctor buys a chemotherapy drug for $10. The patient ought to have to pay $2 under that. 20 percent copay under law. But that is not what happens. Under the average wholesale price system devised by Democratic administrations in the past under Medicare. this is what happens. The government has a phony average wholesale price posted. It might be $200 for that drug that only costs the doctor $10. and the poor patient has to put up 20 percent. not of the $10 but 20 percent of the $200. The patient puts up $40 for a drug that only costs the doctor $10 when the patient should have put up $2. That is called the average wholesale price system. It is rotten. It stinks. Our bill gets rid of it. And we replace it by reimbursing oncologists in America for not one time what their practice expense really ought to be reimbursed under the law. but we double it. LI 2330 We give them $430 million. twice what CMS estimates they ought to get. So we get rid of this stinky system that is charging American seniors 20 percent of phony prices and costing the government Medicare system tens of times what the drugs are really costing the doctors. and we replace it with a rational. a rational reimbursement system. Now. the Democrats try to settle that system too. Let me tell my colleagues what they do in their substitute. They substitute this average wholesale price system with a system of reimbursement that. according to CBO estimates. is going to cost $14 billion over 10 years. and it is going to cost seniors another $3 billion of copays.

It makes no difference whether you are for or against change in U.S. policy towards Cuba. On this matter we speak with one voice. These arrests are unacceptable. The summary trials and harsh sentences merit universal condemnation. Mr. Speaker. I have had the privilege of traveling to Cuba many times and have met directly with Cuban independent journalists and members of the dissident community. Many of these individuals were arrested in the latest crackdown. They are receiving harsh sentences for actions we take for granted here in the United States: the right to hold meetings. have discussions. and express opinions different from those held by our government. The Cuban Government has said that these arrests are in response to actions by U.S. Ambassador Cason and the U.S. Interests Section that are perceived as deliberate attempts to foment subversion in Cuba. Mr. Speaker. those grievances should be raised and resolved between the two governments. but no action of the United States Interests Section justifies in any way these recent arrests. The right of diplomats to meet with people who represent a range of views. including people who peaceably dissent from the policies and priorities of their own governments. should not be impeded. In fact. Mr. Speaker. I believe the restrictions on U.S. diplomats in Cuba and Cuban diplomats in the United States are just plain wrong. Mr. Speaker. I am seriously concerned about the increased tensions and hardening of positions in U.S. Cuban relations. They do little to advance human rights or open political space in Cuba. in fact. quite the opposite. I fear that without a concerted effort to change our policies towards one another for the better. it will only lead to greater restrictions in both countries and fewer opportunities for moderate voices in both countries to engage directly with one another. I will conclude by urging the Cuban Government to release immediately all these prisoners and all prisoners of conscience.",

I rise today in support of H.Res. 179 that condemns the brutal crackdown of the Cuban Government on the islands peaceful prodemocracy movement and calls for the immediate release of all Cuban political prisoners. Mr. Speaker. I have addressed this House on several occasions regarding Castros continued assault on and disregard for human rights and democracy. I and several of my colleagues have spoken recently of Castros decision to arrest and try over 80 nonviolent human rights advocates. prodemocracy leaders. and independent journalists in what has become a campaign by the regime to silence all voices of peaceful opposition on the island. Inside of a month Castro has arrested. arraigned. tried. and sentenced many of the dissidents. some receiving prison terms as long as 27 years. Mr. Speaker. there is an article in todays New York Times that I would like to enter into the RECORD. and it mentions James Cason. the U.S. diplomat that has been spoken of. and it says that the reason this is happening is because they have become such effective advocates that the government attacks them. The reason this is happening is these dissidents are having an impact. People believe in them in Cuba. They are having an impact on basically changing and reforming the government ultimately. They have become voices of change. That is why it is so important that we here in the United States basically condemn what Castro is doing. because otherwise people like them will not continue. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. These recent actions by the Castro regime are simply the next step in the systematic denial of even the most basic human rights for the citizens of Cuba. Congress must send a strong message to Castro that despite his hopes that the world would be looking the other way. that his actions have not gone unnoticed and will not be allowed to continue.

What is most troubling is that this is nothing new. The recent crackdown is merely a continuation of the systematic human rights violations in Cuba committed by the Castro regime. Today I was most discouraged to learn of the prison sentences that have been handed down to dozens of these dissidents. who have been charged with \"subversion\" and collaborating with American diplomats. among other charges. Hector Palacios is but one Ill mention. Along with Oswaldo Paya Sardinas. Mr. Palacios has been a key organizer of the Varela Project. an effort to win Cuban popular support for a referendum on open elections. freedom of speech. freedom for political prisoners. and free enterprise. Yesterday he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for advocating democratic reforms. Today I join my colleagues in condemning Cubas crackdown on democracy. in calling for the release of all Cubas political prisoners. in supporting the right of the Cuban people to exercise their political and civil liberties. and in calling on the world to insist in the strongest terms that the Government of Cuba adhere to international human rights standards. I enclose for the RECORD a letter to me from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. now Chairman of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. NDI has worked with organizers of the Varela Project to promote the movement internationally. and last year NDI honored Oswaldo Paya Sardinas for his courageous efforts to promote democracy.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to offer my strong support for H. Res. 179. The recent crackdown by the Cuban government on political dissidents is without reason or measure. The Cuban government must recognize that if it wants to become a full member of the family of democratic nations. and reestablish ties with the United States. it must abide by the fundamental rules of a democracy. At the very top of that list is freedom of expression. I believe that the United States can assist Cuba in its move towards greater freedom and openness. The American Congress and the Administration can lead by example. by lifting the travel ban. and lifting the trade embargo. How can we advocate for greater freedom when we prevent American companies and consumers from benefiting from trade with Cuba? How can we call for greater openness when we do not let American citizens exercise their constitutional right to travel freely. to Cuba if they so desire. America can also lead by example by avoiding needless antagonization of Cuba. Wherever they are. our diplomatic community must always act diplomatically. Current U.S. policy towards Cuba has proved a failure. It makes no sense to continue down the path of isolation. The recent actions by the Cuban government. while reprehensible. do not change that central fact. U.S. policy should be based on U.S. national interests. not a system of rewards and punishments for good or bad behavior. In this instance. the Cuban government has behaved badly and they should be properly sanctioned for it. in America and in the world community. This resolution is an appropriate measure. I do not think. however. that it should affect policy. This should not lead to greater restrictions. To the contrary. the response should be greater exchange between the U.S. and Cuba. Greater freedom and openness will lead to a more free and open Cuban society. As we call on Cuba now to change its policy. we must also ask ourselves what we can do to have a more free and open policy. Lifting the travel and trade ban on Cuba would be a good start.",

Today. we continue to defend democracy and freedom in over 100 countries around the world. This war against communism is sometimes referred to as the \"Forgotten War\" because it came at the heels of World War II and was overshadowed by the Vietnam War. Indeed. there are fewer pages in our childrens textbooks about this war than that of other wars. But the cause of freedom was no less important. The bravery of the Nations Korean War veterans was no less significant. And the sacrifices of these veterans and their families were no less meaningful. Twentytwo nations joined 1.8 million Americans in risking life and limb to defend a country they did not know and a people they had never met. Included were the young men and women who fought on the mountains of Korea in places such as Pork Chop Hill and Bloody Ridge. The United States suffered 36.934 casualties and 103.284 wounded during the Korean War. another 8.000 were taken prisoner or met an unknown fate. In my state of Arkansas. 466 brave servicemen and women paid the ultimate sacrifice. These are our Nations heroes and they acted selflessly to bring forth freedom and opportunity for generations. July 27 marks the 50th Anniversary of the armistice with North Korea. I take this opportunity to thank our Korean War veterans and their families for their great service and dedication to our Nation. We owe our Korean War veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. The Korean War veterans defined \"new opportunity for all.\" They defended and promoted the virtues of democracy abroad. providing an emerging Nation a chance to develop and flourish into the viable country it is today. I can not begin to imagine how different Southeast Asia and the world would be if it was not for the true determination and unbelievable courage demonstrated by our soldiers. airmen. marines and sailors. American servicemen and women remain onpoint in Korea to protect freedom along what is referred to as the worlds most dangerous border. I commend them also for their bravery and commitment to democracy. From Korea to Iraq. let us not forget the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform have made on behalf of our great country.",

The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act enables public and private entities to establish and operate centers for runaway and homeless youth. These centerswhich provide. among other things. shelter. counseling. drug and sexual abuse education and treatment for youthserve as alternatives for youths who are in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems. These alternatives have proven successful in keeping children off of our streets and from returning to our juvenile justice system. The Runaway. Homeless and Missing Children Protection Act amends the original Act in the following ways: 1. It includes testing youth for sexually transmitted diseases. 2. It allows an exception to the 20 person maximum capacity to comply with States laws which may allow higher capacities. 3. It allows youths to go to maternity group homes. adds the homes to the list of eligible groups. 4. It increases the maximum amount of time a youth may spend in a home. 5. It requires the centers/groups to inform school districts of the status of youths. and it requires the centers/groups to inform youths of postsecondary education and training opportunities. and 6. It authorizes the Act through fiscal year In addition. the Act reauthorizes the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through Fiscal Year 2008. The Center is a critical component of our Nations battle against child pornography and child exploitation. It is absolutely dedicated to eradicating these evils. and its members work tirelessly toward this end. The Center deserves more than just kind words for these heroic efforts. federal funding is necessary for it to continue this good work. Indeed.

When producers are hurting. everyone in that region hurts. Main streets die. schools close. and rural towns dry up. The economic costs are immeasurable. but the social costs are also substantial. Domestic abuse increases. suicide rates rise. peoples lives are turned upside down. Drought is not something we can ignore. In Montana. agriculture accounts for over half of our economy. Its our backboneboth economically and socially. We can not ignore the drought. According to the National Drought Monitor. nearly onethird of the United States is currently experiencing \"moderate\" to \"exceptional\" drought. Nearly onethird of the United States is experiencing the devastating effects of drought. Yet despite the colossal economic and social costs of drought. we do not have a national drought policy. The last prolonged drought of substantial magnitude in the United States was during the 1930s. While not all of us were around during this time. we have all heard about the dust bowl years. The drought coincided with an economic downturn and rural areas were devastated. Banks closed. schools closed. main streets disappeared. Millions of people migrated to urban areas. The effects of the current drought are frighteningly similar. We are experiencing an economic downturn. schools are closing. main streets are disappearing. Following the dustbowl years. the Federal Government enacted the first proactive response to drought with the creation of the Soil Conservation Servicenow the Natural Resources Conservation Serviceto stress soil conservation measures. Its time to expand this proactive approach and create a national drought policy. We need a national drought policy and we need it now. I am pleased to introduce the National Drought Preparedness Act with my colleague Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico. The National Drought Preparedness Act accomplishes four main objectives. This bill: (1) creates a national policy for drought. (2) improves the delivery of Federal drought programs. (3) provides new tools for drought preparedness planning. and (4) improves drought forecasting and monitoring. We have waited too long for this bill. Drought is occurring now and it will occur again.

U.S. oil imports have increased by more than 10 percent. the cost of natural gas by more than 92 percent. and Alan Greenspan has repeatedly testified that energy prices are the single greatest threat to job creation. Mr. Speaker. to meet our growing needs and address these rising energy prices. this House has passed comprehensive energy legislation three times. All three times it has been blocked through legislative obstruction in the other body. This obstruction hurts America. To oppose the Presidents comprehensive energy legislation while calling for more domestic energy production and lower gasoline prices is hypocritical beyond belief. Mr. Speaker. for too long America has relied on other nations to provide the raw materials for our energy needs. It is time for us to move towards selfreliance so we are not susceptible to the threats. blackmail. and production fluctuations from abroad. The Congress must move forward with a responsible energy policy. Voting \"no\" for the energy bill is not an energy plan for America.",

Americas seniors are now eligible to receive a Medicareapproved drug discount card at their local pharmacies to save between 10 and 40 percent off the price of most drugs. particularly generics. It is important to mention the Department of Health and Human Services is the authorized distributor of these nationwideaccepted prescription drug cards. Seniors should be sure that the cards they acquire are approved by the HHS. Millions of lowincome seniors will receive an additional $600 on their discount card to help pay for prescription drug medicines. Any unused amount of the $600 credit in 2004 will carry over to the next year. The competition between organizations offering cards will also help drive down prices.

Having the House vote on tired proposals for jobtraining vouchers that do not actually create jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work. Unemployed Americans need jobs and benefits immediately so that they can provide for their families. They do not need training vouchers for jobs that do no exist. Democrats have offered proposals that will create real solutions for Americans. We have proposed a highway bill that would create 1.8 million goodpaying jobs more than the Republican bill. Democrats have also proposed enacting tax bills that will keep manufacturing jobs here in the U.S. and end incentives for shipping jobs overseas. Americans also need Congress to extend tax cuts for the middle class. such as a child tax credit. without adding to the deficit. These are real solutions that create new jobs for outofwork Americans and keep existing jobs at home. We should be voting to pass these meaningful solutions to unemployment in this country and not wasting our time on gimmicks.",

Bushs strong economic policies have produced a sustained surge in the economy. Mr. Kudlow rightly said that \"over the past year. following the enactment of the Presidents tax cut plan. real economic growth has increased 5 percent with only 1.6 percent inflation. Aftertax profits have increased 37 percent. Business spending on equipment and software has grown 12.5 percent. Since last August. 1.1 million jobs have been created. Spendable income has increased 4.9 percent. and consumer spending is up 4.3 percent.\" Indeed. not since Ronald Reagan was President has our economy grown faster. There can no longer be any question what effect lower taxes have on the economy. When Americans have more of their own money to spend and invest. the economy soars. President Bush should be proud that despite the battles he faced in making these tax cuts a reality. his vision for more jobs and a prosperous America has come true.

And fees are increasing rapidly while capacity is decreasing. We do have EAS designation for three extremely rural airports in Hawaii. and that is very appropriate. But I could easily make the argument that all Hawaii airportsbig or small. rural or urbanare essentially EAS airports. So in conclusion. I simply want to highlight. as this bill goes forward. the absolute necessity of EAS for states like Hawaii. and to say: think about unique circumstances.",

ILEANA RoSLEHTINEN and MARIO DIAZBALART for bringing this resolution to the floor. I stand with them today to condemn the brutal and inhumane attacks by Fidel Castro on innocent human rights activists. trade union leaders. journalists and ordinary citizens in Cuba. Fidel Castro has taken advantage of the power he has in his country and over his citizens for years. Today. he is taking advantage of the worlds focus on the war in Iraq to once again suppress Cuban dissidents who are trying to exercise basic rights of freedom of expression. seeking a peaceful evolution towards a democracy he so obviously deplores. Mr. Speaker. here in the United States. protesters are using their First Amendment rights to speak their minds on the war in Iraq. Whether they support the Bush administration or not and whether we agree with them or not. people in this country rally to voice their concerns over the war. and other issues. without the fear of being brutally attacked and imprisoned for the rest of their lives. In Cuba however. the freedom to express your mind is nonexistent. The imprisoned dissidents in Cuba are part of a growing movement who are continuously followed. harassed. phonetapped and detained. For merely stating their opinions. signing petitions and writing articles advocating the end of the dictatorship in Cuba. these activists are charged as criminals. They are threatened for gathering in each others private homes to talk about the resurrection of a better life in Cuba for themselves and for future generations to come. Mr. Speaker. these callous and repressive acts by Castros regime are nothing new. They have been occurring long before my colleagues and I came to Congress. Many of the prisoners will probably face years of imprisonment. joining several hundred political prisoners who have been previously sentenced for similar harmless acts. For decades now. Castro has repeatedly used the repression of his citizens as a means of retaining authority and control over his country and over his people. It is for these reasons I stand in strong support of this resolution and ask my fellow colleagues to join me to condemn the arrests of these individuals and insist the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.",

Castro was wrong to think he could tighten his chokehold on the human rights of his people under the radar of the civilized world. The United States may be engaged in armed conflict on the other side of the world. but no fog of war can conceal Castros barbarism. And no freedomloving nation can reward such behavior with trade policies that. however wellintentioned. would enrich a terrorist regime 90 miles off our shores. If Castro cared about the Cuban people. he would stop brutalizing members of the prodemocracy movement. He would release all his political prisoners. and restore individual liberties to his people. He would recognize the human rights of all Cubans. especially those with the courage to speak the truth about his goon squad of a government. This resolution calls on the Cuban dictator to do all of these things. and it puts the House of Representatives once again on the side of our oppressed neighbors and against their oppressor.

For several years now. the House has been focused on the problem of conflict diamonds around the world. Three years ago. the Subcommittee on Africa that I chair held a hearing on these conflict diamonds. and we have had several hearings on Sierra Leone where. again. these diamonds have fueled a conflict. frankly. a conflict that has brutalized many children in that country. a conflict that has led to the forced amputations of the arms and legs of little girls and little boys in Sierra Leone. Concerted international action. including a U.N. curb on the diamond trade in Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia. has helped give Sierra Leone a chance for peace. The legislation that we are considering today builds on that success. We should note that the problem of natural resources fueling conflicts in Africa is not limited to diamonds. Over the last several years. an estimated 2.5 million people have died in the eastern Congo due to a conflict being fueled by an illegal natural resource rush. The U.N. has documented what it calls \"elite networks.\" government officials from Rwanda. Uganda. Zimbabwe. and the Congo acting in collaboration with international criminals and war lords. What are they doing? They are gorging on diamonds. but also other minerals and on farm produce and land and tax revenue. and these characters thrive in an environment of conflict. They thrive on death. and we need to combat all of this exploitation. Today. though. we are focused on a significant part of the problem. and that is diamonds. and this legislation is an important tool to fight this chaos that is going on in eastern Congo and elsewhere. Ending the trade in conflict diamonds is all the more important given reports of terrorists using rough diamonds to hide their funds and to transfer their funds. Again. I would like to commend the gentleman from New York and the other Members. and to name a few.

I understood if we did not curtail trade in illegal diamonds. our failure to act would have a chilling effect on the legitimate diamond trade for countries such as Botswana where legitimately mined diamonds provide a significant source of her income.

Sierra Leone was poor and unhealthy with a life expectancy of 42 years. It was inefficient with a low level of corruption. but it was not dangerous. And then along came these conflict diamonds. blood diamonds. which stimulated greed and provided purchasing power for the weapons and drugs that were used in this very. very brutal war. As the international community responded to the war in Sierra Leone. a lot of Americans may ask themselves. What does that have to do with me? What is wrong with having a cheaper supply of diamonds? Sierra Leone is so far away. Mr. Speaker. drying up the cash that supports terrorism is a very important part of the war on terrorism: but we can freeze all of the bank accounts we want and stop the cash transfers. but somebody can take a sock full of illegal diamonds. put it in their pocket. walk onto a plane. and they have an ability to move wealth all over the world. to bribe and buy weaponry and buy explosives.

Over the past decade. many brutal civil wars throughout Africa have been financed with the sale of diamonds. These socalled conflict diamonds have been especially useful to the brutal Sierra Leone rebel organization. the Revolutionary United Front. which has been trading these diamonds to fund its war against the government of Sierra Leone. This bill implements the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme. which prohibits importing rough diamonds into the United States unless they have been certified as not originating from areas where the diamond trade finances or generates violent conflict. In essence. this bill prohibits the importation of any rough diamond that has not been controlled through the Kimberly Process. Mr. Speaker. I plan to introduce a bill in the next few days that also supports and endorses the Kimberly Process. but also encourages the global diamond industry. as represented by the World Diamond Council. to step up to the plate and establish a fund to support a variety of programs that will aid in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of African nations traumatized by civil wars financed through the diamond trade. I believe the diamond industry. which has reaped the financial rewards of trade with nations engulfed in civil war. must also take responsibility in assisting these nations to heal the wounds of war and creating a just and lasting peace in those countries.

I commend the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman TOM DAVIS) on our side of the aisle for guiding this bill through this legislative body at this time. It is very important that we have a strong and viable postal service. and that is why during the last Congress I was disappointed when we did not pass the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. The gentleman from New York and others worked very hard on that legislation. and it would have helped a great deal. As the gentleman from Virginia just said a few minutes ago. there are a lot of problems with the postal service that need to be addressed. but this is a very important one. and that is why I am happy to see this bill before us today. Why is immediate action needed? Because. if we do not do anything. that simply is not an option. If Congress does not correct the retirement benefit formula in current law. postal rates will probably increase in the nottoodistant future. and everybody who deals with the postal service and has businesses understands how important that is. Such an increase in postal rates in the current economic environment threatens the postal service. its employees and the entire country. as well as the mailing industry. Congress has a duty to ensure that the U.S. Postal Service is on a sound fiscal footing and to protect the American postal customers from unstable rates. Changing the way the U.S. Postal Service retirement payments are made is going to go a long way toward accomplishing that goal. Without this change. businesses throughout the country will continue to be unfairly taxed by having postal rate increases. This bill is very. very needed and will ensure stable postal rates into the foreseeable future. and I think will help facilitate an economic recovery in many sectors of the economy. Once again I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Chairman TOM DAVIS) for his hard work on this. He is doing a great job as a new chairman. and I appreciate that.",

I would like to recognize the gentleman from Virginia and certainly the gentleman from California . the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Illinois for their fine work on this bill. The gentleman from New York has worked tirelessly on postal issues for several years. S. 380 contains the same language as H.R. 735. As such. I am pleased to support S. 380. a bill that goes a long way to ensure the viability of the postal service. This bill provides financial relief to the postal service by reducing the amount that the postal service has to pay into the Civil Service Retirement System. The postal service will save $9.1 billion over the next 3 years and $35.6 billion over the next 10 years. I am also pleased that S. 380 contains language that calls on the postal service and other Federal agencies to study the military pensions and report back to the Congress. Currently. the postal service is paying billions of dollars more into CSRS each year than is needed to fully fund its pension obligations. The Office of Personnel and Management determined that by changing the funding formula the postal service could reduce the amount of money needed to pay into the fund. The funding formula would be more like the one used in the Federal Employees Retirement System. This bill requires the postal service to work with the Treasury Department. applying the saved funding to pay down its debt in the first 2 years. In fiscal year 2005. the bill allows for the money saved to be used to keep postal rates stable through 2006. Mr. Speaker. this bill enjoys broad support from the postal service. postal labor unions. mailing industry representatives. and postal consumers. Passage of this legislation will ensure that the postal service pays down its debts and will forestall the need for another postage rate increase until 2006. This legislation strengthens the postal service. lowers the postal services debts. and protects postal consumers. I urge all of my friends in the Congress to vote in favor of S. 380.",

I held up a beefsteak by consent here on the floor of the Senate about 2 weeks ago. and I asked the question: Can anyone here tell me where this piece of beefsteak came from? Everyone can say where his necktie comes from. That is labeled. Just turn it over. But can anyone tell where a beefsteak comes from? Could it have come from the plant in Mexico where one USDA inspector showed up. and found diseased carcasses hanging. covered with feces. getting ready to be put in the meat supply for human consumption in the United States? Could it be from that plant? After that USDA inspection. that plant changed its name. changed owner. the inspector has never been back. and that plant is certified now to ship into this country. The question was. did that beefsteak come from that plant. a plant from Guatemala. Canada. the United States? Where? No one knows. I ask the Senator from South Dakota. can he tell me which special interest has fought so aggressively. so long. and so hard to try to prevent countryoforigin labeling and prevent consumers and farmers and ranchers from being able to understand where this meat comes from?

Guess who has sided with whom? The administration is saying. we have to listen to those packers. The point made by the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely right. We have had a change of heart with regard to downer cattle in this country and it goes to the point the Senator from North Dakota is making. We had the picture of a British downer cow. crippled. sick. unhealthy. and that picture was portrayed over and over and over again. Rarely was it noted that downer cow was not from the United States. that was a British downer cow. But it left the perception there are downer cows in this country that were entering the meat system. sick cattle. diseased cattle entering the meat system. So that steak could have come from a downer cow. a diseased cow. What happened? The administration rightfully said. we are going to ban downer cattle from the market. I applauded it when they did. Now they say. by and large. other countries are beginning to comply. as well. But we do not have any assurance that downer cattle are going to be prevented from entering our meat processing system even now. While we have the safest system in the world. we ought to be able to buy and eat and be confident about our beef products because we have such a safe system. wouldnt it be nice to know whether or not an imported product which potentially could be a product from a downer cow came from Canada or Mexico or some other country? Wouldnt it be nice to know we have that additional confidence that we are eating beef where downer cattle have been expressly prohibited? That is what we are talking about. improving upon an already good meat safety system. That. too. is a good reason why countryoforigin labeling ought to be law today.",

The AllAmerica City program recognizes civic excellence in communities in which citizens. government. businesses and nonprofit organizations work together to address critical local issues. This award is yet another recognition of what Tempe has achieved through innovative publicprivate partnerships that have made it one of the nations finest cities. Dynamic collaboration on the three projects presentedTempe Town Lake. Riverside Sunset Neighborhood and the Tumbleweed Youth Serviceshas enabled the city to successfully address important issues like crime. education and poverty. In this respect. Tempe is certainly a model for other cities. Tempe Town Lake was a dry riverbed and crime magnet that has been cleaned up and is now the location of community festivals. athletic and cultural events. and development. Additionally. partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will restore 170 acres into a natural habitat preserve. To address the decline of the Sunset/Riverside Neighborhood. the city developed a series of partnerships with organizations and groups such as the Boys and Girls Club. the Riverside/Sunset Neighborhood Association. Scales Elementary School. and the Arizona State University College of Nursing. This collaboration successfully revitalized the neighborhood by building the Westside Multigenerational Center and offering numerous services including crime prevention services and new housing. The final project recognized for its outstanding contribution to the community of Tempe is one that is close to my heart because we had to defend it when its mission came under attack. The Thomas J. Pappas School for the Homeless is not only an outstanding success as an educational institution. it is currently expanding its facilities to teach. feed and clothe even more homeless children. Moreover. the Pappas School. Tumbleweed Youth Services. the Tempe Community Council. and the First Congregational Church partnered to create Tempes first homeless resource center for teens. Mr. Speaker. through commitment to collaboration between the private and public sector. the City of Tempe has once again proven itself to be a model community.

We will stay in session this afternoon and early evening to dispose of as many amendments as possible. As I indicated last week. we hope to complete this important Homeland Security bill during Wednesdays session of the Senate. That would enable us to proceed to other appropriations bills that are available this week. The end of the fiscal year is fast approaching. and the Senate should continue to work through the constitutionally required appropriations process as expeditiously as possible. Next week is the final week of legislative work prior to the August recess. and that will be devoted to finishing the Energy bill. I would therefore ask for all Senators consideration as we continue through this last week and a half. I should add that it would be helpful to both Senator COCHRAN and Senator BYRD if Members would come forward today with their amendments so that we could schedule the debate and votes in an orderly way. I thank all Members for their attention.",

I would ask. through the Chair: We are this morning going to be in morning business until 11. Senator BYRD is preoccupied on other matters until 11:30. The leader has indicated there will be no votes this morning. The party caucuses usually run until 2:15. and we are always jammed for time in ours.

Here is the catch: There is no reciprocal benefit for American carriers and their employees. nor is there any provision for the United States to collect one dime in taxes on the millions of dollars of revenue that these foreign airlines will earn by operating in our domestic markets. and that is a fact.

As a member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. I know firsthand that our committee developed strong. bipartisan legislation that this House almost unanimously passed 4188 last June. Yet today. we debate a controversial FAA reauthorization conference report that has sparked heated opposition. Why? The answer is simple. By bowing to industry pressure and Bush administration demands and by shutting Democrats out of conference deliberations. Republican leaders have crafted a report that compromises the safety and security of the flying public. In fact. this conference report is proof that the lessons of September 11 have been forgotten. Republican leaders have forgotten that on September 11. air traffic controllers safely landed 4.482 planes within 2 hours without one operation error. This is a system to protect. not endanger. Yet this conference report does just the opposite. By allowing for further privatization of the air traffic control system. which is really silent on it and the wording previously was \"prohibit.\" Republican leaders wish to put air safety in the hands of the lowest bidder. That model did not work for airport security. and it will not work for our air traffic control system. In writing this conference report. Republican leaders have also forgotten the September 11 lesson that flight crews are a critical line of defense in aviation security. This report drops a Housepassed provision that would require TSA to issue security and antiterrorism training guidelines for our Nations flight attendants. By making these guidelines optional. the Congress is effectively rejecting calls by flight attendants for greater security training to protect themselves. airline passengers. and the American public.

The FAA through the Airport Improvement Program helps to fund noise abatement programs from schools and religious institutions to community centers to private homes. It has let the local airport operating authority set the noise level parameters for communities to qualify. In section 189 of this bill. the former Senate majority leader thought allowing local airport operating authorities to set their own levels was not good enough. Section 189 says that only people who live in the areas with higher than 65 decibels of aviation noise. the noise of a power lawn mower. will receive funding for noise abatement programs. leaving millions of people without the funding needed to abate their homes.

This is not about making the system safer. it is not about making it more efficient. The Europeans. the Canadians and others admit that our traffic controllers are 75 percent more productive than theirs. So it is not about making it more productive. It is not about making it safer. The only reason that we are opening the door here. and we are blasting the door open here by removing any restriction on privatization. as was in the original bill. this White House has shown it will fight to privatize. They have already threatened to veto the bill unless we inserted the specificity of 71 towers. So they are clearly going to go ahead with privatization. Now. they are going to go ahead. not because they think it will be safer. not because it will be more efficient. I do not even believe it will be less expensive. The other failed air traffic privatizations around the world have actually cost the taxpayers more. and they have had to be bailed out in England and in Australia.

This bill contains significant changes from the committee passed bill--changes that have not previously been approved by the House or the Senate. I believe it is telling that not a single Democrat in the House or the Senate signed onto the conference report either time because of these egregious changes. The version of the bill that we are considering today removes the language that would allow the FAA to contract out the operation of air traffic control towers at 69 towers nationwide. However. this is not an improvement over the previous version of the bill. Simply striking the provision does nothing to ensure that our nations air traffic control system will not be contracted out to the lowest bidder. In fact. this bill would make it easier to privatize the air traffic control system by not prohibiting future privatization. We know that the administration supports privatization. as demonstrated by their many outsourcing initiatives and the reclassification of air traffic control as a \"commercial activity.\" Every tower in this Nation is now at risk for privatization. In addition. this bill fails to address concerns that were in the previous version of the bill. which include allowing China essentially open access to our cargo markets. modifications to the Essential Air Service program requiring small communities to pay a substantial sum for their air service. and changes to the flight attendant training programs that basically gut the requirements.

I have had the opportunity to meet many of the controllers who live in my district and who work at the nearby New York TRACON and New York Air Route Traffic Control Center. These dedicated public servants monitor nearly 2 million flights each year. with only two concerns in mind: the safety of passengers and the efficiency of air travel in the region. We already know from the list of intended privatization sites misleadingly pulled from this bill that the Administration hopes to privatize one major airport on Long Island. We simply cannot begin down a road that would put profit above safety and costcutting above hiring the most qualified employees. We also must not abandon flight attendants. many of whom lost their lives on September 11. bravely fighting the terrorists who took over their planes. We must do everything we can to act on the lessons learned that terrible day. and provide all flight attendants with the crucial training they need to deal with any future terrorist threats aboard their planes.

Thaddeus Robert Stebbins celebrated his 17th birthday. Although still in the formative period of his lifes journey. Mr. Stebbins has already demonstrated remarkable abilities across a broad range of endeavor. from academics and music to sports and debate. These preternatural accomplishments must command our attention and admiration. But even more noteworthy are the maturity of thought and manner already manifest and the generosity of spirit evidenced by the unhesitating respect granted others. The birthday was celebrated quietly at the Phillips Exeter Academy where Mr. Stebbins is currently enrolled in his Upper year and where he is manfully displaying talents and capacities notable even at that prestigious institution. Although they were not physically in attendance on that day. Mr. Stebbins was very much in the thoughts of his proud parents and sisters. of his godfather. and of his many admiring friends. I cannot speak to Mr. Stebbins religious beliefs. but I have no doubt that the Almighty has prepared great things for him and ever watches over him. And that he has entertained angels. unaware.

When the kids became active in 4H. she started a cooking club. in addition to sewing. gardening. and squaredancing clubs. She herself was a 4H leader for ten years. Margrets cooking is legendary and her openhouse lunch after the Cattlemens Days parade has drawn more than one hundred people in the past. Today Margret is still active in the rural community. donating cash gifts to the local 4H and annually sponsoring the Mergelman Family Award to competitors of the Round Robin Showmanship. She has also been a member of the Eastern Star for sixtytwo years. Mr. Speaker.

The thrust of our amendment is for the teachers in America. The amendment is very simple. It compensates them through a tax deduction for each time they reach into their own pocketbooks or pockets to buy school supplies for their students. We need to increase that amount from $250 which is current law. We need to broaden it so they can use some of the deduction for purposes of continuing education. This is an amendment not for the rich. it is simply for those who serve America and ask very little by way of salary. We cannot move it at this time. but the managers very generously have acceded to this colloquy.

Our amendment allows companies that have made money overseas to bring it back right now. They are taxed at 35 percent. When faced with a choice of whether they keep it overseas or bring it back. they keep it overseas. We are going to allow a 1year exemption. The tax will be lowered from 35 percent to 5.25 percent. They have 1 year to invest the money to create jobs in this country. As with Senator BOXERS very fine amendment in our bill. it cannot go for executive pay.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. I rise today to pay tribute to Judge Guy H. McMichael III. who is retiring after a lifetime of public service. including more than 25 years at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Judge McMichaels career includes stints in the Army. as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney. on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. and at the VA under five Administrators. four Secretaries and five different Presidents. Judge McMichael graduated from Harvard University and received a law degree from the University of Michigan. He served in the Army for two years and later was in private practice for four years. while also serving as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the State of Indiana. In 1971. he became General Counsel for the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. where he remained for six years until joining the VA following the election of President Carter. When Judge McMichael first came to the VA with Administrator Max Cleland in 1977. he brought a healthy distrust of what people said and what they did. His discernment and skepticism was resented by some. but over the years. his ability to persuade others of the importance of being honest brought integrity to almost all parts of the VA that he touched. That a man who was the Administrators right hand during the Carter years would stay on and perform such exemplary service for an additional 23 years is quite remarkable. In 1981. Administrator Robert P. Nimmo appointed Guy McMichael to the VA Board of Appeals as an Administrative Judge. He was appointed Chairman and Chief Administrative Judge in 1990. and has remained in that position until his retirement this year. Over the past several years. Judge McMichael has also filled several important positions on a temporary basis. including Acting Chief of Staff. Chief Information Officer. and Acting Under Secretary for Benefits. Mr. Speaker. Judge McMichaels legacy is that of a man who served his nation with compassion and distinction. and advanced the interests of veterans. Truly. he saw his work for veterans as a mission. one that he could devote the full talents God blessed him with. Veterans are better off because he served them as long as he did.",

I am also very pleased that my colleagues Mr. JERRY MORAN of Kansas. Mr. FRANK LUCAS of Oklahoma. Mr. MAC THOMBERRY and Mr. SILVESTRE REYES both of Texas. and Mr. STEVE PEARCE. one of my colleagues in the New Mexico delegation. have joined me in introducing this legislation. This important bill seeks to designate U.S. Highway 54 as a high priority corridor on the National Highway System. The corridor would be known as the Southwest Passage Initiative for Regional and Interstate Transportation Corridor. or the SPIRIT Corridor. U.S. 54 runs from the border with Mexico at El Paso. Texas. through New Mexico. Texas. and Oklahoma. to Wichita. Kansas. I am very hopeful that this legislation will help improve transportation infrastructure and stimulate economic development in the communities and states through which U.S. Highway 54 passes. Mr. Speaker. those who live in the eastern United States know that communities are more compact and the commutes much shorter. For the intermountain west. on the other hand. it is not unheard of for people to have to commute 80 miles to work and 80 miles back home. That is just one of the reasons designating U.S. 54 as a high priority corridor is so important to improving the transportation infrastructure and promoting economic development. Safe and efficient highways are critical to all types of traffic. whether it be tourists visiting or goods being shipped from point to point. Designating U.S. 54 as a High Priority Corridor will make it eligible for additional federal grants and transportation funds. which will. in turn. help upgrade the highway and improve its safety and efficiency. As Congress prepares to reauthorize TEA21. I strongly urge the House and Senate to support this bill and add the SPIRIT Corridor to the list of high priority corridors in our National Highway System.",

The President. who has represented himself to the American people as conservative. has the most radical budget plan ever put before this country. That is because he is absolutely exploding the debt right before the baby boomers retire. When he says he is going to cut the deficit in half. what he has done is he has left out things that we all know are going to be expenses. For example. he has left out funding for the war in Iraq. the war in Afghanistan. the war on terror. He says there is no cost past September 30 of this yearnone. The Congressional Budget Office says the cost is $280 billion over this next period of time. The House and the Senate have put in these much smaller amounts. $50 billion in the House. $30 billion in the Senate. But the Congressional Budget Office says that is not what this is going to cost. It is going to cost $280 billion. We see that same pattern with other elements in the Presidents plan. Here is the cost in the 10 years of the Presidents tax cuts. Do you notice a pattern? This dotted line is the end of the 5year budget proposal of the President. In previous years he did 10year budgets. Now he is down to 5 years because I am afraid he wants to hide from the American people the full effect of his budget plan. Just looking at the tax side of it. you can see the cost of his proposed tax cuts absolutely explode outside the 5year budget window.

The result is we are seeing the effect on the value of our own dollar. The dollar has declined in value almost 30 percent against the euro in just the last 2 years. Let me conclude with this: Economists are worried about the longterm effects of this weakening dollar and this heavy U.S. borrowing because not only are we borrowing to finance the budget deficit. we are also borrowing because we are running massive trade deficits. This was in the Washington Post on January 26 of this year: Currency traders fretting over that dependency have been selling dollars fast and buying euros furiously. The fear is that foreigners will tire of financing Americas appetites. Foreign investors will be dumping U.S. assets. especially stocks and bonds. sending financial markets plummeting. Interest rates will shoot up to entice them back. Heavily indebted Americans will not be able to keep up with rising interest payments. Inflation. bankruptcies. and economic malaise will follow.

I submit for printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD revisions to the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution to reflect the enactment of H.R. 2. the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (P.L. 10827). Section 201 of the budget resolution directed the Committee on Ways and Means to report a bill that would increase outlays and reduce revenue by specified amounts. The conference report accompanying H.R. 2 exceeded the target for outlays. but reduced revenue by less than the amount allowed under the revenue target. Since the overage in outlays was within 20 percent of the total cost of the bill and was offset on the revenue side. as permitted under section 310 of the Budget Act. the conference report was deemed to be in compliance with its reconciliation instructions. I am. therefore. adjusting the 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Ways and Means to reflect the enacted levels of budget authority. outlays and revenue in the tax bill. This will hold other measures assumed in the budget resolution harmless for the permissible variance in budget authority and revenue between the budget resolution and enacted tax bill. Accordingly. the adjusted 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Ways and Means is as follows: Fiscal year 2003: $14.576.000.000 in new budget authority and $14.512.000.000 in outlays. Fiscal year 2004: $20.626.000.000 in new budget authority and $20.054.000.000 in outlays. The period of fiscal years 20042008: $24.079.000.000 in new budget authority and $23.876.000.000 in outlays. The period of fiscal years 20042013: $39.261.000.000 in new budget authority and $39.128.000.000 in outlays. The changes in the Ways and Means allocation cause changes in the budgetary aggregates. Accordingly. I also modify the budgetary aggregates to the following levels: Fiscal year 2003: $1.877.204.000 in new budget authority and $1.829.299.000 in outlays. $1.310.347.000 in revenues. Fiscal year 2004: $1.880.555.000 in new budget authority and $1.903.502.000 in outlays. The period of fiscal years 20042013: $19.632.020.000.000 in revenues.

Richard Glenn Lupe worked his way up the BIA forestry organization through hard work. dependability. and by earning the respect of his coworkers and bosses alike.

This fire was the largest wildfire ever in the history of the Southwest. However. even more homes and property would have been lost had it not been for the tenacity and courage of Rick Lupe and his firefighting team.

The Park and NCA were established on those ideals. and I am pleased that the bill I bring before you today continues on that path. The legislation was originally scheduled for a hearing in the Resources Committee last June. after Senator CAMPBELL successfully saw it through the Senate.

This legislation provides for a land exchange between the Newtok Native Corporation and the United States. Newtok is a village in western Alaska located on a river that is rapidly eroding. Within several years. experts believe the river will eventually wash away key areas of the village. Newtok is inhabited by the Yupik Eskimo people who still live a natural subsistence lifestyle and they exist below the poverty line. In order to avoid the problems the eroding river is going to cause. local leaders have chosen to relocate Newtok to another site. This is by no means an easy process. and there are many steps to get this done. The first step is in the hands of the Congress. Because the 19 millionacre Yukon National Wildlife Refuge surrounds the existing village and the site identified for the relocation. a land exchange is necessary. After much work and negotiations between the villagers. the corporation. the Fish and Wildlife Service. and the environmental community an agreement was worked out. The land exchange described in S. 924 is the product of that compromise. It will enable Newtok to relocate once it has secured the funds necessary to do so. and the United States will acquire lands of high value for waterfowl habitat. More importantly. this legislation helps people who wish to continue living in the environment their ancestors have inhabited for thousands of years. All sides involved should be commended for fashioning a good agreement that is noncontroversial. I urge passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The negotiation and resulting land exchange agreement was motivated by the current state of the Newtok village site. The village is rapidly eroding and is threatened by flooding. The 300 residents of the Yupik Eskimo village of Newtok live a largely subsistence lifestyle. which is heavily dependent upon fish and wildlife resources of the Yukon delta area of western Alaska. Under S. 924. the Fish and Wildlife Service would convey about 11.000 acres to the Newtok Native Corporation. which would allow the village to relocate to safer ground. It is my understanding that the Newtok Native Corporation intends to donate the lands received under the exchange to the community. In return. the Fish and Wildlife Service will receive over 12.000 acres of corporation lands which will be managed in the future as part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. In addition to the clear public interest in allowing the village to move to a safer location. the Fish and Wildlife Service will acquire highpriority lands for the refuge and. overall. considers this to be a fair exchange.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the House has the opportunity today to consider this important legislation. H.R. 506 is a companion bill to S. 210 introduced by Senator JEFF BINGAMAN. S. 210 passed in March of this year and a similar version passed in the Senate in the 107th Congress. Although I also introduced a similar version of this bill in the 106th and 107th Congresses. it has never been discharged by the House Committee on Resources or been taken up by the full House. The Galisteo Basin. located in northern New Mexico. possesses a rich cultural heritage and is considered one of the Nations most beautiful natural settings. The area is comprised of 24 archaeological sites containing artifacts and ruins of 17th century Spanish missions and impressive examples of Native American rock art and pueblo architecture. H.R. 506 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with willing private and State landowners who are interested in protecting. preserving. and maintaining these important archaeological sites. It also authorizes the Secretary to purchase such lands from willing sellers. Each cooperative agreement or land acquisition would be strictly voluntary and would be negotiated by each landowner to contain only the terms and conditions that are agreed to by both parties. H.R. 506 has been carefully crafted to protect private landowners. Numerous safeguards prevent the Secretary from forcing cooperative agreements on the private property owner or forcing a landowner to sell the rights to the land to the Federal Government. Under H.R. 506. any action affecting the disposition of a private landowners rights is purely in the discretion of that private party. H.R. 506 strikes an exacting balance between protecting and preserving these delicate archaeological sites in the Galisteo Basin and protecting the rights of the State and private landowners with property interests in these sites. Considering this. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support the preservation of the natural beauty and cultural significance of the Galisteo Basin. Mr. Speaker.

It certainly is not going to be fixed by radical proposals like this. I say radical because this would cut spending in domestic discretionary programs. including defense. In fact. defense would be cut by $1.1 trillion. it is estimated. over the next decade. We could go down a long list of programs that would be deeply cut. but really what is at stake here is a fundamental philosophy. The proposal as most of the other proposals. in fact. I think all of the amendments and substitutes tonight. would exempt tax cuts. We exempt tax cuts because we do not want to hurt the most affluent people in this country. The richer you are. the more benefit you get from tax cuts. But the poorer you are. the more dependent you are upon entitlement programs. Medicare. Medicaid. food stamps. child nutrition. foster care. disability payments. veterans benefits. Those go to people who need help. to enable us to have a civil society in this country. not a survival of the fittest. Some people are not born into wealth. Some people have disabilities. Some people suffer all their lives through the accident of birth. Yet what we would do with these proposals to try to balance the budget is to afford the tax cuts by taking the money away from the people who need it the most. We will take it from Medicaid. we will take it from student loans. we will take it from child nutrition. from food stamps. To heck with them. Veterans.

I lean toward spending restraint and believe that Americans are taxed enough. This Congress was run by the other party in the 1980s and we raised taxes back then. But spending went up even faster than we raised taxes. We remember in the 1980s that for every $1 in taxes raised. the Congress lifted spending by $1.24. Therefore. taxes went up and so did the deficit. Ask your seniors this question. Should we cut other programs to make sure that we have $445 billion to help protect Social Security? The gentleman asks. what commitment is there by the United States Government to make sure that these savings go to Social Security and Medicare? As I referred to in my opening. we have an unfunded liability in Medicare of $21 trillion. and we have an unfunded liability in Social Security of $10 trillion. There is a sacred bond and a piece of paper from the Treasury Department to the Social Security Administration that says that the American taxpayer will honor these debts. fl 2300 But with what money? Ask seniors this question: Should we cut entitlement spending to make sure that the money is there for Social Security and Medicare? Should we make sure that their basic retirement security and their basic health care program has the money it needs to cover those sacred promises? As I said before. we made two sacred promises to the people of the United States: one. that we would provide for the common defense. We made that promise in 1776. And. two. that we would protect at a minimum level their retirement security. But as I said. we are $21 trillion in the hole on Medicare and $10 trillion in the hole on Social Security. To honor those commitments. we have got to restrain spending. We have got to make sure that we have the money available to protect Americas seniors. and with that I urge adoption of the substitute.

While the total amount for the block grant would be the same as the sum of the individual programs. the administrative changes will actually result in a net loss for beneficiaries. Our national unemployment rate is 6 percent. but these numbers dont account for the millions that have been forced off the labor force or are not considered \"active\" enough in their job search.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to H.R. 1261. the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act. Today. in the middle of a recession. we should be voting for an economic plan to create jobs. My colleagues and I have proposed the Democratic Jobs and Economic Growth Plan. which would create more than one million jobs this year. Instead. tomorrow the Republican leadership will bring up a bill that gives tax cuts to the wealthy and does not create jobs. Today. with the unemployment rate at 6 percent. we should be voting to extend unemployment benefits. Unemployment compensation immediately puts dollars in the pockets unemployed workers and helps boost the economy. Instead. today we are voting on a bill that will weaken our job training programs. H.R. 1261 has many serious flaws. First. it would consolidate funding for services for adults. disclosed workers. and employment services into a single block grant. forcing these groups to compete against each other for assistance and likely leading to reduced funding. It would eliminate the U.S. Employment Service. which maintains a free. nationwide labor exchange that matches job seekers and employers. This bill would allow governors to take funds from programs such as Adult Education. Veterans Reemployment. and job training for disabled individuals to spend on infrastructure expenses at onestop centers. The result would be reduced funding for jobs and training programs at a time when more Americans are seeking employment assistance and job training. H.R. 1261 would also reduce accountability of training providers by eliminating federal performance standards. Furthermore. the bill would cut back services to youth. who have been among the hardest hit by the current economic downturn. Finally. H.R. 1261 would overturn a federal antidiscrimination policy established more than 60 years ago. At that time. President Franklin D. Roosevelt decided to forbid federal contracts from discrimination based on religion. as well as race with national origin. Following in the same tradition. the current job training law prohibits religious discrimination. Breaking with this long commitment to civil liberties. H.R. 1261 would allow religious groups to discriminate on the basis of religion when hiring or firing staff for federallyfunded social programs. It is profoundly unwise to allow the federal government to fund religious discrimination. It is bad for our churches. bad for our workforce. and bad for our society.

These adjustments will remove definitions from the bill that would have created ambiguity with regards to providing workforce investment funding to Puerto Rico for high school dropouts and joblessoutofschool youth. and would likely have resulted in reduced funding. As reported from Committee. H.R. 1261 required certain data points to be included in the allocation formula to be taken from the Current Population Surveya survey that DOL does not conduct in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The effect of this requirement would be that funding for important. youthfocused workforce training and education programs in Puerto Rico would likely be cut to these programs in Puerto Rico. While a hold harmless provision in H.R. 1261 would limit the size of any cut to these programs in Puerto Rico. the high unemployment rate of the Commonwealth emphasizes the need to obtain all intended. formulated and available funds for workforce investment. The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) is an important program for unemployed and underemployed people in Puerto Rico and all the United States. Many people. youth and adult alike. find greater opportunity through the training. education and other benefits provided through WIA. and our economy will improve only by making such investments in our workforce. Again. I greatly appreciate the consideration of Chairmen BOEHNER and McKEON in making this correction to the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act. I know that their intent in passing this bill through the House is to improve the delivery of workforce investment. training and education. and to affect positive impacts on our economic situation. Certainly. the managers amendment will improve the reauthorized Workforce Investment Acts application in Puerto Rico. and will enable more funding and workforce services to benefit high school dropouts and joblessoutofschool youth.",

First. denial. then waging war while ignoring the declining economy. now they offer us a onetwo combination jobs loss program: first this so called Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act today. followed by the irresponsible tax cut bill scheduled for consideration tomorrow. Mr. Chairman. we need a jobs creation program. we need to extend unemployment benefits. This bill does nothing to create American jobs. does nothing to help in the shortterm. In fact. it does exactly the opposite: it ensures that workers will continue to struggle to find jobs in the long term because this bill sacrifices so many of our tiredandtrue training resources. It collapses adult and dislocated training programs into one funding stream and cuts then by over $600 million from FY 02 levels. It eliminates substantial amounts for youth training programs. which is something desperately needed in my 9th Congressional District of California. And it does not go far enough to help veterans find jobs. An unemployment crisis requires a real solutionthe Republicans have offered us a jobs loss program instead. On those grounds alone I oppose this bill. But. Mr. Chairman. there is yet another reason to oppose this billyet another fatal flaw: it removes civilrights protections that ban employment discrimination based on religious affiliation. It is wrong and unconstitutional for taxpayer funding to go to organizations that can hire and fire based solely on someones religious beliefs and for this reason too. that I urge my colleagues to vote no on the underlying bill.",

Of particular concern to me is the devastating effect this bill would have on funding for dislocated worker programs. which are so important to workers in my district of El Paso. Texas. El Paso has the unfortunate distinction of having the greatest number of NAFTArelated job losses in the nation. with over 20.000 workers losing their jobs since the implementation of NAFTA almost a decade ago. Once. El Pasoans could find employment at the textile. plastics. and electronics assembly plants in their community. For many of my constituents who have limited English proficiency and education. these jobs provided a good. living wage for workers and their families. But in the wake of NAFTA. a great number of the factories have closed. and the jobs have disappeared. In their place. there are new employment opportunities in the service. healthcare. and hightech industries. However. most dislocated workers are not prepared to fill these jobs without the education and training that federal dislocated worker programs provide. Incredibly. at a time when the economy has stagnated and unemployment is on the rise. at a time when we should be doing everything we possibly can to help Americas workers. the bill before us today eliminates continued dedicated federal funding for dislocated worker programs.

This legislation fails to recognize what we all know: that there are over 8.3 million Americans who are out of work in this country. This is the longest stretch of job loss since the Great Depression. With the unemployment rate now at 6 percent. it is reprehensible that this legislation. which some have said is a \"reinvestment in our nations workforce.\" does not include an extension of federal employment benefits. especially as they are set to expire at the end of this month. When we extended the program last January. the rate of unemployment was even lower than the rate today. and now we have reached near crisis point. It has been estimated that more than 43 percent of unemployed workers are exhausting their state benefits without finding work. and this number will continue to climb if Congress does not address this issue soon. This bill also does a disservice to our veterans. Many of our troops that are currently serving in the war in Iraq. will soon be returning home to an economy where jobs are disappearing at a fast rate. Under the current bill. funds targeted toward veteran employment services would be pooled with other Workforce Investment funds and those services previously targeted to serve our troops become discretionary depending on how the individual state workforce investment board decides. As we all know. these programs are already critically underfunded. They strive to meet the increasing demands placed upon them in an environment of increasingly inadequate resources. To be effective. these programs cannot sustain these devastating cuts. Finally. the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act would eliminate the civil rights protections of Americans. by exempting religious organizations from antidiscrimination requirements. The message that we are sending to the millions of Americans who are unemployed. who are veterans and those who are in need of economic assistance is that we do not care about keeping them from falling further into an economic crisis. This bill is not a reinvestment in our workforce and fails to aid the millions of jobless Americans who need it the most. I urge all my colleagues to vote against H.R.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today to oppose H.R. 1261. the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act. Let us not be fooled by the title of the bill. A more accurate title would be the Workforce Divestment Act. because the legislation guts the program and removes critical civil rights protections. In a time of skyrocketing unemployment. it is shameful that the House Republicans would prefer to ignore workers who are in need of retraining and unemployment compensation and instead champion tax cuts for the most welltodo segments of our society. At its core. this legislation is flawed. The bill. for example. would block grant the current dislocated worker programs with adult training programs and the state employment service. As a result. the states would no longer be required to assure that adequate resources are earmarked to assist laidoff workers. Instead. unemployed workers would be pitted against lowincome workers and welfare recipients in a competition for limited resources. Equally troubling. H.R. 1261 explicitly authorizes religious organizations receiving federal funds from WIAs job training programs to discriminate against employees and job applicants based on religion. Current law prohibits participants in federal job training programs from discriminating based on race. color. religion. sex. national origin. age. disability. or political affiliation or belief. Allowing this kind of discrimination is not only wrong it is unconstitutional. Rather than making these detrimental and indefensible changes to WIA. we should be taking up legislation that actually helps those workers impacted most in this recessiona recession the Bush administration has failed to reverse. We should be working on legislation to extend the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program. which is currently scheduled to expire at the end of this month. We should not only extend TEUC. we should expand the program to provide a total of 26 weeks of federal extended unemployment insurance benefits to all laidoff workers. including those who have already exhausted their federal extended benefits. as well as newly laidoff individuals. If we do this. we would actually be investing in our workforce.",

The services provided by faithbased institutions will be a vital component to help our nations workforce. increasing the ability of job seekers to get needed training. counseling. and prevocational services. Unfortunately. liberal special interest groups have joined forces behind an effort to bar religious and faithbased organizations from being involved with efforts to help workers find jobs and job training. This is disgraceful. Congress should actively encourage any effort to provide unemployed men and women with new jobs. and not look for excuses as to why qualified and proven job counseling advisors should be excluded from helping our nation. During the 1990s. President Bill Clinton supported four laws that explicitly allow religious organizations to retain their right to staff on a religious basis when they receive federal fundsjust as Republicans are proposing today. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. why are you standing now? When you sat silently in support of your past president. This bill simply reiterates the existing exemption religious organizations have had for more than three decades under civil rights law. applying it to the Workforce Investment Act so that every available resource is being tapped to help Americans find jobs. Faithbased organizations need to be part of the Federal job training and worker relief system under the Workforce Investment Act. and if they are excluded. that would qualify as discrimination of a criminal level.",

The Committee did not allow us to vote on and discuss key amendments which would have greatly improved this measure. I offered an amendment that was rejected by the Rules Committee yesterday that would have specified that local WIA boards may use funds to carry out training programs for displaced homemakers and nontraditional training for women. These are two existing programs that have been crucial to lowincome womens economic independence and selfsufficiency. Since more than 60 percent of WIA recipients are women. the use of WIA funds for these programs would have provided necessary training opportunities. counseling. and services for WIA recipients to learn the necessary skills in obtaining and keeping jobs. Mr. Chairman. this bill fails workers. attacks our Veterans and erodes our civil rights laws. An amendment offered to extend Federal unemployment benefits for newly unemployed workers and for those workers who have previously exhausted their unemployment benefits was not allowed. Also defeated was an amendment which would have restored current law prohibiting the use of Federal funds to discriminate in hiring based on religion. as well as an amendment to strike the language in the bill that allows governors to take money from Veterans and dislocated worker programs to pay for infrastructure costs for onestop centers. The Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act is supposed to provide job opportunities for our Nations youth and extend educational opportunities for adults. The bill we have before us does not hold this commitment. H.R. 1261 cuts job opportunities for youth. shifts critical resources away from career preparation and summer jobs. eliminates the successful Youth Opportunity Grants and reduces targeting of resources to poor communities. In a time of economic downturn and a rising unemployment rate. it is our duty to provide for the necessary funds to boost our economy and safeguard our future. We can increase the effectiveness and outreach of boards by increasing funding to local boards. We must give local leaders the opportunity to shape best use of resources to their communities.

It is a credit to the diligence and dedication of the Australian government that this complex Free Trade Agreement was completed in under a year. That is why Im hopeful that the Australian government will employ that same diligence and dedication in resolving a dispute over maritime boundaries with its neighbor. East Timor. Fiftythree of my colleagues have already joined in supporting East Timors call for a fair and expeditious resolution to this dispute. These disputed boundaries are a reminder of the invalid agreements made between Indonesia and Australia during the Indonesian military occupation of East Timor. The East Timorese struggle for independence will not be complete until East Timor. a fully sovereign country. no longer has to bear that lingering reminder of subjugation. To be sure. there is tremendous enormous financial benefit dependent upon how these maritime boundaries are drawn. Rich with oil and natural gas reserves. these critical areas are an economic resource for a struggling country of very little economic activity. A country struggling with high matemal mortality. widespread malaria and tuberculosis. rampant poverty. and desperately needed education. The Australian government was a leader in assisting East Timors transition to democracy. It provided peacekeepers and foreign aid. But since 1999. Australia has acquired an average of $1 million a day in petroleum from the disputed areas. exceeding the amount of assistance it provided to East Timor. The Free Trade Agreement today between our two countries are a mark of respect we have for each other. A fair and equitable resolution of this boundary dispute with East Timor honors Australias leadership and commitment to fostering a strong and enduring democracy. As a friend of Australia. I respectfully urge its government to rejoin the international dispute resolution mechanisms and expeditiously negotiate a permanent maritime boundary in the Timor Sea in good faith. according to the established principles of international law.",

Over the last year. many of my colleagues here in the House have sought to address the plight of domestic manufacturers who have trimmed payrolls as they adapt to a new economy driven by the productivity gains of new technology. In the quest for political points trade has been wrongfully vilified and talk has centered on erecting new barriers to trade. Today members have an opportunity to set aside this counterproductive rhetoric and put into action a manufacturing trade agreementan agreement that will benefit all sectors of our economy. Twoway trade between the two countries exceeds $25 billion and the U.S. enjoys a $6 billion dollar trade surplus.

Manufactured goods now account for nearly 93 percent of U.S. exports to Australia. For automakers. a cornerstone industry for Ohio. this agreement will sweeten an export market that is already dominated by U.S. cars and light trucks and presents an opportunity for even more growth. Lower tariffs on American goods will mean job creation. job security. and money in the pockets of Americas workforce. Last year Ohio joined Washington. California. Illinois. Texas. Michigan. Pennsylvania. Kentucky. New York and Florida in the top 10 of exporting states to Australia. For my colleagues looking for even more reasons to vote in support of this agreement. you will discover some 19.000 companies that export to Australia waiting for the opportunity to grow their business through lower tariffs and the removal of nontariff trade barriers. Those who search for any reason to be antitrade are at a loss with this agreement because Australia maintains some of the highest labor standards and wage rates in the world. Sensitive agriculture products such as dairy and beef are protected with permanent safeguards and microscopic increases in tariff rate quotas. One commodity. sugar. is entirely exempted from the agreement. In short. those looking for reasons to oppose wont be able to find any.

I am not opposed to free trade. but support it only when I believe the gains outweigh the losses. Each year. Australia imports only 338 million dollars of American agriculture. Meanwhile. the United States imports about 2 billion dollars of agriculture from Australia. Most of these imports. especially wine. milk. and wool. will hurt Californias agriculture economy. Competition is good for business. but only when all teams are playing by the same rules. Over the past decade. exports of U.S. specialty crops have remained flat because of trade barriers and subsidized competition in many foreign countries. Unfortunately. the Uruguay Round and other trade agreements have not provided the access to foreign markets that U.S. specialty crops were promised. We need to remove these barriers before we sign new FTAs. and even then we should only sign those agreements that will result in beneficial trade for the United Statesmore exports than import. I am especially concemed about FTAs with countries that export milk protein concentrates. which are used for the illegal substitution of milk in cheese. This robs our children of nutrition in the name of profit. Warning Mr. and Mrs. America. one cup of milk in every slice is actually one cup of MPC in every slice. As a representative of California. our Nations beacon of agriculture. I have to think about jobs and the rural economy as much as lower prices at the consumer end. We need to choose between buying moderately priced. highquality products grown in the United States. or saving at the checkout counter on lowerquality foreign goods at the cost of sending our jobs abroad. Will the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs to trade feel that it was worth it when they save a few dollars at the grocery store? I dont think they will. Mr. Speaker.

Australia has consistently been a partner with the United States in pushing for more open and freer trade throughout the world. So it is only fitting to have a free trade agreement with nation that shares our beliefs in freedom and free markets. Under this FTA. more than 99 percent of U.S. manufactured goods will be dutyfree from the first day of implementation. North Carolina exports to Australia in 2003. my states 17th biggest export market. were valued at almost $262 million. From computer equipment to textiles to paper products to agriculture. North Carolina stands to gain much from increased access to this new market. I am particularly pleased about the benefits this agreement provides with respect to agriculture. All Australian agricultural tariffs will go to zero immediately. reducing costs for agricultural exporters by $400 million. Due to the hard work of the folks at USDA and USTR. Australia has agreed to limit some of its unscientific restrictions against U.S. pork exports. Consequently. the U.S. could ship $50 million worth of pork annually to Australia. Despite this progress. Australia must do a better job of eliminating its unscientific sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions on agricultural imports. I urge the Administration to keep the pressure on Australia to meet with USDA and USTR to resolve many of the outstanding sanitary issues affecting pork and poultry. This is an acceptable agreement for a nation as economically advanced and sophisticated as Australia. Its labor and environmental standards match if not exceed those in the United States. However. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Administration that the Australia Free Trade Agreement is not a sufficient model for future trade agreements. I support fair trade.

In fact. my state of Oklahoma sold more than $3 billion worth of exports to more than 100 foreign markets last year. With these statistics in mind. it pains me to vote against this agreement.

In particular. the provisions of this agreement will unfairly disadvantage the beef and wheat industries. which comprise twothirds of Oklahomas agricultural exports. This agreement would allow increased quantities of Australian beef to flood the U.S. market. which will result in unacceptably low market prices for American cattlemen. In Oklahoma alone. more than 105.000 jobs associated with the cattle industry will be put in jeopardy by the adverse effects of this agreement. In addition to the beef industry. the continued existence of the Australian Wheat Board under this agreement will force Americas wheat farmers to continue their export competition in the international markets against a state run monopoly. A government backed monopoly. like the Australian Wheat Board. which dictates the price of wheat rather than allowing the free market to take its course. thereby allows Australian wheat to consistently undercut the price of American wheat in international markets.

For example. among many of its outstanding provisions. the Agreement would establish strong anticircumvention provisions to prohibit tampering with copyright protection technologies. It includes strong IP enforcement language. which includes enhanced criminal standards for copyright infringement and stronger remedies and penalties. It would also eliminate tariffs on all U.S. movies. music. consumer products. books and magazines exported into Australia. and broaden market access for U.S. films and television programs over a variety of media. such as cable. satellite. and the internet.

Even if they were to give the money to this institute to do it. it would have to reinvent the wheel when our existing research laboratories can do this. Last year. we had sort of a consensus that we had to do something. but in conference we lost the dollars. We are taking a step backward here. This is what everyone worried about after 9/ 11that we would become complacent. From all of the moneys in the budget. we cant find $70 million to do research to deal with perhaps the greatest danger that faces us. That is wrong. That is something we. hopefully. will never regret. But we may. I say to my colleague from Mississippi that this Atlantic City research center. as my friend Senator LAUTENBERG from New Jersey said. is part of the FAA. That has nothing to do with the research we are talking about. It does a good job. I ask my colleague. where is this research going to be done? I say to all of my colleagues. if we dont do this amendment. and we say it is because of the Budget Act. my goodness. we just passed $350 billion in tax cuts without even talking about the Budget Act. And we cant spend $70 million to make our homeland secure from the greatest danger that would face usgreater than biological weapons. greater than chemical weapons? What is the matter with us?",

The Transportation Security Administration funding is affected by the amendment at the desk. There is a lot of other research that is being done relating to radiological and nuclear countermeasures. I am convinced that much of what is being done in terms of developing new ways of dealing with the problem the Senator describes is being done under the auspices of the Science and Technology Directorate. Here are some examples of the work that has been funded over the last 3 years and is being funded again this year in this bill: sensor research and development. This is for radiological and nuclear countermeasures. In 2003. there was $10 million appropriated and enacted. $40 million reprogrammed for this account in fiscal year 2003. Mr. President. $71 million is contained in the Senate bill. for sensor R&D. So over that 3year period10 million. $40 million. $71 millionyou have $121 million that has been appropriated for sensor R&D. Also. there are other accounts. such as detection systems product improvement. demonstrations. remediation and consequence managementa wide range of other activities. The total for radiological and nuclear countermeasures for this year alone. in the bill we have presented. is $131 million. In 2003. the total was $75 million.

It is a program that is managed by the firefighters themselves in determining which grants should be made in their regions. which items of equipment ought to be included in the arsenal of protection for communities. The only problem is. we dont have enough money in the allocation to this committee to make as much of an appropriation for many of these programs as we would like. We have to make choices. We had to allocate the total allocation among a large number of very worthwhile. very popular programs. I hate to put the Senate in the position of having to make choices here on the floor that we labored with for weeks and months. through hearings with administration witnesses. through discussions among our staffs and Members of the Senate. to try to identify the priorities and then come to some final decision about the exact amounts to include in the bill for all of these programs and activities. We have just so much money to appropriate. We kept the grant program for firefighter assistance at the same level as last fiscal year. In fact. we have included $200 million more than the President had requested in his budget which was submitted to the Congress.

Widows and widowers. who use quota rents as their 401(k)s. have likewise seen their income fall. I ask Members. could they survive if their salary had been permanently cut by 50 percent or more? I think we know the answer to that: It would be very difficult. The time for action is running out. We need to jumpstart the process of reforming the current program. and we need to do it now. H.R. 4520 accomplishes this by including provisions for a tobacco buyout. and this is not a buyout for the companies. it is for the small farmers and the allotment holders across the tobaccogrowing regions. They have finally decided It is time for a change. They have had a hard time getting there. but the consequences they see is if they do not this year. they could face as much as a 30 percent cut this fall because of foreign tobacco flooding into America.

This unit. headquartered in Rapid City. was among more than 20 Guard and Reserve units from my State called to active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Noble Eagle and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today. these soldiers and their service become a part of South Dakotas military heritage. Like those who served in the two World Wars. in Korea. in Vietnam and numerous other places. this new generation has answered the call. They have offered to make every sacrifice. including life itself. to protect our freedom and security. We must never forget them or the honor with which they served. This unit participated in a mobilization with few precedents in South Dakota history. Nearly 2.000 Guard and Reserve troops were called to active duty in our State. by far the largest mobilization since World War II. At the time the fighting began. units from more than 20 communities had been called up. from Elk Point in the South to Lemmon in the North. from Watertown in the East to Custer in the West. Indeed. our States mobilization rate ranked among the highest of all the States on a percapita basis. These soldiers were proud to serve. and their communities are proud of them. Across the State. thousands of citizens pitched in to participate in sendoff parades. to lend a hand for families who suddenly had to get by without a mom or dad. and even to assist with financial hardships caused by the mobilization. This mobilization was a statewide effort. in many ways. In addition to the service of this particular unit. I want to acknowledge the sacrifices and dedication of the families who stayed home. They are the unsung heroes of any mobilization. They motivate and inspire those who are far from home. and they. too. deserve our gratitude. Today. I join these families and the State of South Dakota in celebrating the courage. commitment. and success of the members of the 129th Mobile Public Affairs Detachment. and I honor their participation in this historic event in our Nations history. Welcome home. Thanks to all of you for your courage. your sacrifice. and your noble commitment to this country and its ideals.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join Senator GRASSLEY. the chairman of the Finance Committee. and several of our colleagues in introducing legislation that will allow rural letter carriers to deduct their actual expenses when they use their own vehicle to deliver the mail. This Tax Code correction will reduce the outofpocket costs currently incurred by our Nations rural letter carriers. giving them comparable tax treatment enjoyed by others using their vehicles in their line of business. For many years. rural letter carriers were allowed to calculate their deductible expenses by using either a special formula or keeping track of their costs. In 1997. Congress simplified the tax treatment for letter carriers. but disallowed them the ability to use the actual expense methodbusiness portion of actual operation and maintenance of the vehicle. plus depreciationfor calculating their costs. Unfortunately. this has resulted in many letter carriers being unable to account for their real expenses when using their own vehicle to deliver the mail. This problem is worse in more rugged parts of our country where road conditions and severe weather can require letter carriers to use an SUV or fourwheeldrive vehicle that are more expensive to maintain. This legislation will ensure that these mail carriers are fully reimbursed for the costs associated with the operation of their vehicles. Although the Internet has made the world seem smaller. purchased goods must still be delivered. The benefits of Internet purchases in remote locations is limited if the purchased item cannot be delivered. For this reason. in rural States. such as New Mexico. these letter carriers play an important role in delivering the majority of the States mail and parcels. On a daily basis across the Nation. rural letter carriers drive over 3 million miles delivering mail and parcels to over 30 million families. We need to be sure that we have not created a tax impediment for these dedicated individuals. I look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues to get this legislation passed this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD immediately following the statement of Senator GRASSLEY on the introduction of this legislation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Safe. Efficient. Automobile Travel to Better Ensure Lives in Transit. SEAT BELT. Act of 2003. This bill will establish an incentive grant program that rewards States that have enacted or will enact primary seat belt laws. The bill also gives a premium to those States that increase seat belt usage. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA. motor vehicle crashes are responsible for 95 percent of all transportationrelated deaths and 99 percent of all transportationrelated injuries. It is estimated that in 2002. 42.850 people were killed in vehicle crashes and roughly 3 million more were injured. Motor vehicle crashes are ranked as the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 to In addition to the thousands of transportationrelated deaths and injuries. the economic costs associated with vehicle crashes constitute a serious public health problem and significant fiscal burden to the Nation. The total annual economic cost to the U.S. economy of all motor vehicle crashes is an astonishing $230.6 billion. or 2.3 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. This translates into an average of $820 for every person living in the United States. Increasing seat belt usage is a guaranteed and proven way to lower the number of transportationrelated deaths and costs associated with vehicle crashes. In 2002. 59 percent of vehicle occupants killed were not restrained by seat belts or child safety seats. Safety experts agree that the best shortterm and most immediate way to reduce traffic crash fatalities and serious injuries is to increase seat belt use. Experience in the United States and other countries has shown that sound laws coupled with highvisibility enforcement are the keys to high seat belt use. Currently. the effectiveness of most State seat belt laws is reduced by secondary enforcement provisions that preclude law enforcement from stopping an unbelted motorist unless another traffic law violation is also observed. Primary enforcement seat belt laws are significantly correlated with higher seat belt usage levels. States with primary enforcement laws have an average of 80 percent belt usage. compared to just 69 percent in States having secondary enforcement laws. Currently. only 19 jurisdictions have primary seat belt laws. Nearly 4000 lives would be saved each year if seat belt use were to increase from the national average of 75 percent to 90 percent.",

The 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons as well as a number of other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics such as pistol grips. folding stocks. bayonet mounts. and flash suppressors. The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the manufacture of semiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two of these military features and accept a detachable magazine. Preexisting militarystyle semiautomatic weapons were not banned. This law is scheduled to sunset on September 13. Earlier this year. Senator FEINSTEIN introduced the Assault Weapons Ban Reauthorization Act. which would reauthorize this important piece of gun safety legislation. I am a cosponsor of this bill because I believe it is critical that we keep these weapons off the streets and out of our communities. Senator FEINSTEINs bill also includes a provision that would ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding devices. This provision passed the Senate 59 to 39. as an amendment to the 1999 Juvenile Justice bill. and passed the House by unanimous consent. However. the 106th Congress never passed the Juvenile Justice bill because it got stuck in conference. and thus the import ban never became law. Studies have shown that the assault weapons ban legislation works. According to National Institute of Justice statistics reported by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. gun trace requests for assault weapons declined 20 percent in the first calendar year after the ban took effect. dropping from 4.077 in 1994 to 3.268 in 1995. This indicates that fewer of these weapons were making it onto the streets. If the law is not reauthorized. the production of assault weapons can legally resume. Restarting production of these weapons will increase their number and availability and inevitably lead to a rise in gun crimes committed with assault weapons. The Congress should act this year to reauthorize the ban.",

Figures released by the Census Bureau last Wednesday placed the Latino population at 38.8 million in July 2002. an increase of nearly 10% from the 2000 census. Unfortunately. over half of all Hispanics in the U.S. do not have health insurance. This is about 20 percent higher than the national average of approximately 30 percent. I am especially concerned about the health of many of our nations Hispanic seniors. Over 2.2 million Hispanics currently receive Social Security benefits. Each time that a new tax cut is passed. we put our Social Security trust fund in further danger. thus eliminating future benefits for all Social Security recipients. Moreover. without Social Security. over 55 percent of Hispanic seniors would be forced to live under the poverty rate. I hope that my colleagues who supported tax cuts for the wealthy can sleep well at night knowing that their misguided policies may force millions of seniors to live in poverty.",

Mrs. Perryne Thompson began teaching in the Detroit Public School system over 30 years ago. For the last 20 years. she worked at Miller Middle School as the physical education and dance teacher. Additionally. for over five years. she served as a choreographer. administrator. and eventually director of the All City Middle School Dance Company. As a Detroit Public School Teacher and while working with the All City Dance Company. she trained over 5.000 students in the art of tap. modern. and African dance. Mrs. Thompson exposed them to the roots of African and AfricanAmerican culture through the art of dance by utilizing techniques such as those developed by Katherine Dunham. She often spent long days and nights in preparation for both Miller Middle School and All City Dance concerts. which involved not only choreographing the events and teaching students how to become performers. but also selling candy to purchase fabric for costumes she made for her students. Her tireless dedication to transmitting her knowledge of the art of dance and emphasis on hard work. diligence. and excellence lead a number of her students to pursue majors in dance in college and to join professional dance companies. Mrs. Thompson is also the mother of Mischa Thompson. who is currently a congressional fellow in Representative CHARLES RANGELS office and recently completed her Doctorate degree at the University of Michigan. Detroit is privileged to have had such a dedicated member of the teaching profession for so many years. I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Mrs. Perryne Thompson for her selfless dedication and service to the youth of Detroit through her role as a Detroit Public School Teacher.",

Mrs. Crowley is a longtime activist who unselfishly worked in support of worthy causes that helped advance womens rights. expand family programs. and increase housing opportunities. Born on July 24. 1913. Mrs. Crowley continues to be a strong voice in our community today. She embodies the true spirit of human kindness. In 1948. Mrs. Crowley and her husband Patrick cofounded the Christian Family Movement after a conference at the Vatican and served as copresidents until 1970. Patty collaborated with Robert McClory to create the book Turning Point. which records the story of these events. Later. Mrs. Crowley turned her attention to other causes. In the 1980s. she became active in public housing causes. She served as director of Housing Opportunities and Maintenance for the Elderly until 1998. and worked closely with the Chicago Housing Board of Commissioners and the Jane Addams Advisory Council. In 1985. Patty cofounded Deborahs Place. a shelter that provides housing and supportive services to homeless women. She remains on the advisory council today. To commemorate her services. Deborahs Place will shortly be dedicating the Patty Crowley Apartments in her honor. Pattys commitment to serving others extended beyond her impressive record of activism in advocacy groups and service organizations. In addition to her public work. Mrs. Crowley and her husband served as foster parents to over a dozen children. as well as hosting international exchange students. On her 90th birthday. Patty Crowleys continued dedication to public service is an inspiration to each one of us and her lifetime achievements and commitment to activism are without match.",

Last month. the national. nonprofit New Leaders for New Schools chose the city of Memphis to participate in its education program. Memphis joins other cities--Chicago and New York and Washingtonas a participant in this new and innovative reform effort in education. The program is called New Leaders for New Schools. It is the brainchild of John Schnur. a young social entrepreneur and education expert. He came up with the idea while at Harvard Business School. His idea was to take concepts of business leadership and apply it to education K through 12. As we all know. every successful company is led by a successful CEO. Successful schools. in turn. are really no different. Great principals make for great schools. Really. it makes sense. New Leaders for New Schools trains outstanding individuals to become outstanding school principals. The program draws applicants from all walks of life. from former bankers and dot commers. to teachers and. indeed. retired principals. What they share is a deep belief in the potential of every child to succeed. These committed individuals are sent into urban school districts to turn around poor performing schools. As they prove their effectiveness. they can earn flexibility in hiring and carrying out reforms. In Memphis. New Leaders for New Schools will recruit and develop 60 new principals over 3 years to serve in the public school system. City leaders are rightly excited about this great opportunity. The No Child Left Behind Act does set high standards. and a strong and effective school principal is key to meeting these goals. I should note that 45 percent of Memphis school principals are eligible for retirement in the next 3 years. Training the next generation of principals is critical. I am excited for the parents and the teachers of Memphis. I am especially excited for the schoolchildren of Memphis. With strong and motivated leadership at the top. they will have even more opportunities to realize their potential. Every child can learn. Every child can succeed. New Leaders for New Schools is one more step in moving our education system forward. I yield the floor.",

That is a bipartisan group to which anybody ought to be drawn. This subpart of our JOBS bill. which is sponsored by Senators SMITH. ENSIGN. and BOXER. is intended to encourage companies to bring their foreign earnings back to the United States by temporarily providing the reduced rate of tax. This bill will tax foreign earnings at 51/4 percentage points instead of the 35 percent that would normally apply. Advocates of this Homeland Investment Act claim that those moneys will be invested overseas instead of the United States. if we dont tax them at a lower rate than the 35 percent. These colleagues view this measure as I do. very much stimulative to the economy and helping with our unemployment problem. One last point I will make is that our bipartisan manufacturing tax bill is revenue neutral. I dont think it does harm to emphasize. sometimes we pass a tax bill and less money comes into the Federal Treasury and we might have a bigger deficit. This bill does not do that. Not one dime is added to the current deficit. Thank God. the President has been in the forefront of this. asking for a bill that would be revenue neutral. We have delivered for our colleagues who believe in revenue neutrality of tax bills. We have delivered for the President.",

Because of his background in business. he understands those issues better than most of us. This reads: When sales of their security software slowed in 2001. executives at ValiCert Inc. began laying off engineers in Silicon Valley to hire replacements in India for $7.000 a year. It says: The reality was different. The Indian engineers. who knew little about ValiCerts software or how it was used. omitted features Americans considered intuitive. U.S. programmers. accustomed to quick chats over cubicle walls. spent months writing detailed instructions for overseas assignments. delaying new products. Fear and distrust thrived as ValiCerts finances deteriorated. and coworkers. 14 time zones apart. traded curt emails. In the fall 2002. executives brought back to the U.S. a key project that had been assigned to India. irritating many Indian employees. \"At times. we are thinking. What have we done here?\" recalls John Vigouroux. who joined ValiCert in July 2002 and became chief executive three months later. Tell me a bit about this. I think the assumption is made automatically. and certainly in this economic report prepared for the President by his administration. it makes a categorical statement that outsourcing of jobs is always a good thing because it improves the bottom line. Here is an example of a company which had a very different example. Aside from the obvious reduction in payroll by hiring people in another country to do the job. and firing Americans. are there also examples where this kind of activity has actually been bad for business and not necessarily automatically good for business. as suggested by this report?",

It doesnt work nearly as well. As a matter of fact. a lot of businesses are consolidating so they can make a lot of their operations much more sympathetic with each other. These are business principles a lot of folks follow. I dont think it is as obvious as is commented in the economic report of the President. but I guarantee sometimes the shortterm benefits that somebody might see on a quarterly report. because they have lowered their loss. are grossly offset by longterm costs because they lose the technological innovation of having people work together. They lose the economies of scale. and the potential longterm costs. aside from the social costs the Senators from Connecticut. Minnesota. and New Jersey have been talking about. are huge.",

There has been a report in Time magazine that indicates we are looking at. some indicate over the coming years as many as 14 million. 15 million jobs to be outsourced if we do not begin to do something about it. In the near term. I think the number is between 3 and 4 million with a loss. by the way. just looking at revenue loss. of wages lostforget everything else. forget what happens when a person loses their job and the ripple effects that occurjust in lost wages it is about $140 billion. We know what kind of budget deficit we are in already. I dont think this figure has been projected onto those numbers at all. We look at revenues coming in. and we look at what expenditures for which we have to account. and a loss of $136 billion to $140 billion in wages. lost because of outsourcing over the next decade or less. ought to be a matter of deep concern. even if you are not affected or moved by what happens to families or heads of households who are trying to provide for the needs of their families. The fact that we lose that much salary and wages going out ought to be of great concern. I mention that as an additional implication of what is caused by outsourcing. Again. I said earlier. we can offer incentives for people to stay. we can offer disincentives in the Tax Code for them not to go. but I dont know. for the life of me. why we ought to be taking American taxpayers moneywe insult the taxpayer to say. I am going to use your money to fire someone in this company and hire someone someplace else to do the job at a fraction of the cost because it is going to improve your bottom line. I dont know how the Senator feels. but the societal implications are profound. Our job is not only to make sure there is wealth creation in the country. but also we bear a responsibility beyond quarterly reports to see to it. from a generational standpoint. that we are going to leave this country at least as in good a shape as we inherited from our parents.",

Lance Armstrong. national and world champion cyclist. twotime Olympian. humanitarian. cancer survivor. and now fivetime winner of the Tour de France. faced his first athletic challenge as a fifth grader in a second grade swim class. Through his now signature hard work and determination. Lance Armstrong was eventually put in a swim class with his own age group and later went on to place fourth in the 1.500 meter freestyle in his State. At age 13 Lance became a junior triathalon athlete. At age 15. just 5 years after being placed in that second grade swim class. Lance Armstrong won so many triathalons he made over $20.000 in just one year. The swimming and running components of the triathalon gave way to cycling. In his junior year of high school. the U.S. Cycling Federation invited him to join the 1990 Junior World Championship Team in Moscow. Born on September 18. 1971. Lances athleticism was nurtured by his mother. Linda. a single parent who has been a constant source of strength and inspiration for Lance. This shy. allAmerican kid from the great State of Texas would become only the fifth rider in history to win the Tour de France five times. In 1991. Lance Armstrong won the Amateur Cycling Championship. He turned professional in 1992 and captured 10 titles by 1993. By the mid1990s he had won the Tour DuPont twice and was being hailed as the finest U.S. cyclist. In 1996. however. he was diagnosed with a very serious form of cancer. Given only a 50 percent chance of survival. he underwent surgery and chemotherapy. In one of the more impressive comebacks in sports history. he returned to cycling in 1998 and reached the pinnacle of his sport with five consecutive victories in the Tour de France. the sports toughest and most prestigious race.

I made it my point. a longheld dream. to be on the Champs Elyssees for the final stage of the Tour de France. as an avid cyclist. to cheer and support Lance Armstrong. whom I have known for quite some time. I also got to ride the last leg of the tour. as this newspaper shows 11.000 other cyclists. wearing yellow jerseys with the logo \"La randonn~e du centenaire\" (The Centennial Ride). riding the Champs Elyssees over the last 40 kilometers of the Tour de France. and not only that. but I was interviewed on French national television just quite by accident. I will say to my friend and my colleague from Texas. in French. and represented the United States I think very appropriately. It is impossible to understand the accomplishment of Lance Armstrong unless one follows the events of cycling and understands the technical intricacies of the Tour de France. To say that it is like running a marathon every day for. 3 weeks is in itself an understatement of the athleticism and the strength and the mental toughness that it takes to lead the tour. to win it five times in a row. And only one other cyclist in the 100year history of the Tour de France has done that. Miguel Indurain of Spain. Three others have won it five times. though not consecutively. only two have won it consecutively. Lance Armstrong represented the very best of America. the very best of athleticism. the very greatest in accomplishment in athletic history in winning five consecutive Tours de France. and all of Americas proud of him. and I must say that all of France acknowledges his accomplishment.

I first met Mr. Horn longer ago than I would like to admit. back in my days at Stanford University. I was an undergraduate. He was a teachers aide. commonly called a TA. in one of my government classes while he pursued his Ph.D. Even back then. he had established a reputation for being hardworking and thorough. When I first came to Washington. I was privileged to serve with Mr. Horn on the Committee on Government Reform. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency. Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations. he was always searching for ways to make government run more smoothly and more efficiently. This was not always the most glamorous or most exciting work. but Mr. Horn gladly took it on. Nowhere was this more evident than his work on the Y2K bug. It was Steve Horn who initiated a system of grading Federal agencies on Y2K readiness and publicizing the results using report cards. These report cards let agencies know where their weaknesses were and allowed them to focus their efforts on efficiently improving their operating systems for the switchover to the year 2000. The same report card system was recently used to evaluate Federal agencies on their bioterrorism readiness. It is only fitting that we name this post office after Steve Horn. Another one of his many legislative achievements was securing a separate ZIP code for the neighborhood surrounding the post office. I am very proud today to support this legislation to make this the J. Stephen Horn Post Office. I congratulate Mr. Horn on all his hard work and .J wish him and his wife.

In addition. on July 24. 2003. the Committee on Government Reform unanimously passed and ordered the bill reported to the House floor for consideration. Former Representative Horn. a Republican. represented the 38th Congressional District for 10 years. from 1992 to 2002. As a longtime public servant and political scientist. Mr. Horn worked at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. the Brookings Institute. and in academia as a dean at American University here in Washington. and later as President of Cal State in Long Beach. California. As a member of the Committee on Government Reform. Stephen Horn served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Efficiency. Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations. He is credited with focusing on the Federal Governments ability to respond to the Y2K crisis that we heard so much about a few short years ago in grading Federal agencies for computer security. Mr. Horn retired after serving his community and the public for more than 50 years. Mr. Speaker. I urge swift adoption of this measure. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I had the pleasure of serving with Chairman Horn on this subcommittee since 1993. my first year in Congress. As a Congressman. Steve Horn championed the publics Right to Know. As the Chairman. he cosponsored a bill that expanded the Freedom of Information Act to include electronic information. He was outspoken against the abuse of secrecy by executive agencies and the willingness of many Congressional Committees to ignore their duties and allow such secrecy. He forces the CIA and the Department of Defense to release documents so that Congress could effectively perform oversight. I was particularly proud to work with him on the Debt Collection Bill that I sponsored. Congressman Steve Horn believed in good government. He understood that there is a public right to know and as the peoples representatives we must never forget this fundamental right. To capture some of his good karma. my staff and I moved into Mr. Horns Rayburn office in December! I miss working with Steve Horn. and I hope he is enjoying life after Congress.",

Steve Horn. retired from this body after 10 years of distinguished service to his community. One of the cities Steve represented throughout his tenure in Congress is the City of Signal Hill. California. What many people may not know about Signal Hill is that it is a small city geographically surrounded by the larger city of Long Beach. California. Unfortunately. they did not have their own postal designation which separated them from the rest of the region. This resulted in problems with higher insurance rates. misreported sales taxes which affected the citys revenues. and misapplied utility taxes by long distance companies. Steve took it upon himself to work with the U.S. Postal Service and the City of Signal Hill to give this community their own postal zip code. This small legislative accomplishment. critically important to one of the many cities he represented. was indicative of Steves career in Congress. He never turned his back on his districts needs. great or small. He brought those needs to Washington. and without partisan politicking. effectively solved problems for his constituents. We all still look with awe at Steves distinguished and vast public service career. He served in the Eisenhower Administration under Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell. and then worked for California Senator Thomas Kuchel on historic legislation including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In addition. Steve dedicated 18 years to the California State University. Long Beach. where he was recognized as one of the most effective college presidents in the country. With all the honors Steve and Nini Horn have received over the years. I know that they would never lobby to have his name placed on a public building. But this is a fitting tribute to a man of character. whose devotion to the City of Signal Hill and their cause gave them a stronger identity and a little more community pride.

My wife was one of those people who had a job that paid into Social Security for a long period of time. She is going to receive minimal. if anything. from the teacher retirement system. But upon her retirement is it right for her to have been discouraged. after being encouraged to come in. because she is not going to receive some of the benefits she thought she might be able to? That is not right. That is not what we are trying to do here. We want to be able to encourage good qualified people to go into our classrooms. This legislation is going to have broad implications for teachers in Texas and many other States. It is going to very likely force an exodus. a mass exodus of good experienced teachers from our public schools. What impetus does an experienced teacher have to stay in the classroom and continue teaching if the government is. in effect. going to significantly reduce his or her retirement payment potential after this year? Well. the bill also fails to address a larger issue for public servants in this country. The government pension offset unfairly penalizes teachers and government workers and the employees most likely to pay into a public pension plan. So how can we sit idly by while our public service employees are indeed being penalized for serving their communities? I think we really should show a different loyalty to our first responders. who we from this floor praise so very often. The government pension offset is a deterrent to public service across this Nation. There is a solution to this problem. We believe that we offered it and it has been turned down. If we are to attract the best and brightest in public service. such as our teachers. firefighters. and police officers. then we must repeal this unfair provision.

Why should teachers. firefighters. law enforcement people. be denied their survivor benefits under Social Security simply because they have a government retirement benefit? The truth of the matter is if the lady sitting across the desk from me had worked for any other private company and had received a retirement benefit from them. she would still be eligible for her husbands survivor benefit.

I am appalled that our friends on the other side of the aisle would take a stand against our teachers and claim that the teachers are receiving full spousal benefits and are engaged in a gimmick or a trick or a fraud. Obtaining spousal benefits is not a trick or a fraud. It is a payment for an entire lifetime of work by a spouse. It is a payment for an entire lifetime of a man and woman working together. Saying that teachers receive Social Security for working 1 day of work is simply not true. and our friends on the other side of the aisle know it and it is embarrassing for them to say that. The real fraud in this is that the Democrats on the Committee on Ways and Means offered to fix this section by using the language of the Republicans if they would address the GPO. The Republicans said no. Clearly the Green amendment points out the total absurdity of the GPO. It is quite simple. Here is the way. the Republican plan. If someone works for an insurance company. no offset. If someone works for a pharmaceutical company. no offset. If someone works for an HMO. no offset. But if that person is a teacher. there is an offset and their spouses lifetime of work is absolutely meaningless. At least our friends on the other side of the aisle are consistent. They believe that neither the veterans nor the teachers should receive the benefits that they have earned from a lifetime of work. We saw that yesterday and we are seeing that today. Teachers work hard. they follow the rules. They are being rewarded for a lifetime of work with their spouse. We should not be involved in changing the rules of the game in the middle of the game.

His mother. Velora. lives in Auburn. He leaves a brother and two sisters. an exwife. a grown son and Natalie. his girlfriend he wanted to marry. He became involved in fisheries management issues when he became concerned about the diminished stocks of rockfish (sebastes) and other nearshore groundfish that are so important to recreational fishermen in California.

That uniquely American conviction also inspired Ronald Reagan to reach his great place in our countrys history and in the hearts of his countrymen. I doubt Ronald Reagan was much surprised to become President. despite his humble origins. And I know for certain he never took for granted a single day he occupied the office. He believed such an honored privilege was within the reach of any American with principles. industry and talent. and that once attained. it was to be held with great care to preserve for succeeding generations the blessings of liberty that had so enriched his own life. His patriotism. which he expressed eloquently and often in his public remarks. was never affected. He believed every word. Nor was his unfailing good humor and optimism an actors performance. He lived in a shining city on a hill. and he never forgot it. I first met President Reagan and his lovely wife. Nancy. not long after I returned from Vietnam. But I knew of him in the years before I regained my liberty. when my fellow prisonersofwar and I would discuss in tap codes and whispered conversations the Governor of California who was giving such eloquent voice to the convictions we believed we had been sent to war to advance. In the more than 30 years that have passed since I first met him. I have never lived a day that I wasnt grateful for the privifge of the Reagans friendship. and the strength of his faith in America that inspired my own. and so many others.

During the Memorial Day holiday. we have honored many of our service men and women who risked their lives for their country. We have especially honored what Americans call \"our greatest generation\"-the men and women who fought in WWIIand Mr. Davies is an extraordinary addition to this generation. Mr. Harold Davies fought on the USS Yorktown at the Battle of Midway. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. the United States retaliation emerged in a grueling war of the Pacific. The Battle of Midway was the major turning point in the Pacific in which Japan lost all four aircraft carriers and all of the airmen and planes in the battle. On June 4. 1942. before the last Japanese aircraft carrier sunk. it struck the USS Yorktown. leaving the ship dead in the water. The crew worked diligently to repair the damage and returned the ship to fully operational. The USS Yorktown. also known as the \"Fighting Lady.\" launched fighters for three more days. gaining a major victory for the United States before sinking on June 7. Mr. Davies never left his post during this battle. He remained courageous and loyal to his crew and duties. As the ship was sinking. he refused to board the lifeboat until all the wounded were aboard. After the ship sank. he remained in the water for two and a half hours before being picked up by a whaleboat. Mr. Davies was not injured in the battle. He lives today as a prominent member of his community and church in Hebron. KY and is able to share the story of the legendary Battle of Midway. This type of valor should not go unrecognized. Therefore. I join my fellow Kentuckians to honor Mr. Harold 0. Davies and thank him for his service in the United States Navy.*",

I applaud Wisconsin Citizen Actions twenty year commitment to political activism for progressive change that benefits all of us in Wisconsin. They have helped pass twenty laws. trained and developed hundreds of citizen leaders. and organized tens of thousands of residents to work for social. economic and environmental justice. Just a few of their recent victories include SeniorCare. a vitally important program to provide seniors with prescription drug coverage. a mining moratorium protecting Wisconsins precious northwoods against unsafe mining. a tough ordinance for lead poisoning prevention in Milwaukee. and they also obtained a fivefold increase in the funding for the SAGE program. which reduces classroom size for our Wisconsin school children. As a former Wisconsin Citizen Action board member. I had the privilege of seeing firsthand the truly remarkable impact Wisconsin Citizen Action has had on our great state. Wisconsin Citizen Action has given Wisconsin residents the power to improve their communities. It is through people working together and sharing ideas that social change is achieved. and as these recent accomplishments demonstrate. Wisconsin Citizen Action does just this. I commend this group for their insight and their tireless action in joining the political power of a few with the voices and ideas of many. Mr. Speaker. I join my fellow Wisconsinites in congratulating Wisconsin Citizen Action on their 20th Anniversary and for their many great achievements. I wish them continued success for another 20 years and beyond.",

William Cramer. or Bill as he was known. lived a life of public service. He served 18 months as a Naval gunnery officer during World War II and was among the brave young men who invaded France and liberated Europe. He returned to the United States following the war. and after graduating from Harvard Law School. served as a city and county attorney in Pinellas County. Florida. He also actively involved himself with local volunteer and charitable organizations. Bill Cramer was a revolutionary in Florida politics. He was. when he won his seat in 1954. the first Republican from Florida elected to Congress since the Civil War. Congressman Cramer opened the door. so to speak. for Republicans seeking office in the Sunshine State. Before his election. many used to joke that Republicans could not get elected to anything in Florida. let alone a congressional seat. Congressman Cramer changed that and quickly became our partys standard bearer in the state. Congressman Cramer. in just his fifth term. became the ranking member on the House Public Works Committee. In 1964. he became Vice Chairman of the House Republican Conference. the second ranking House Republican behind Michigan Congressman and future President Gerald Ford. He vacated his House seat in 1970 for what ultimately was an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. One of Congressman Cramers congressional aides. Appropriations Committee Chairman BILL YOUNG. replaced him as the representative of Floridas Tenth Congressional District. Bill Cramers public service did not end with his departure from Congress. He practiced law. held various positions with the Republican National Committee. and accepted several jobs in the Nixon and Ford Administrations. He then. as he later said. \"decided he wanted to spend more time back home\" where he grew up. so he returned to Florida where he continued to use his talent and influence to help Tampa Bay area residents. Mr. Speaker. next year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Bill Cramers election to Congress. I hope that. as we approach that milestone. our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join the Florida delegation in remembering him and his dedicated work in this institution on behalf of his constituents and his country.",

I denounce and condemn this statement as dangerous. morally bankrupt and beyond the pale of civilized dialogue. His statement comes directly out of the Hitler playbook. and reflects centuries of antiSemitism that have led to pogroms and genocide. Jewish. Muslim. or agnostic. black. white. yellow. or pink. We are all appalled by words and actions that spread hatred. Prime Minister Mahathir has a long history of making unambiguous antiJewish utterances and actions and he has time and again identified himself as an implacable enemy of Jews. Prime Minister Mahathir was an antiSemite in 1970 when he wrote of the \"hooknosed\" Jews. He was an antiSemite in 1984. when he wouldnt let the New York Philharmonic play a composition by a Jewish musician. and in 1986. when he called Jews \"monsters.\" He was an antiSemite in 1994. when he banned \"Schindlers List\" and in 1997. when he attacked George Soros as a Jew robbing his country. And. indeed. he is an antiSemite today. In an interview with the Bangkok Post. Prime Minister Mahathir complained that his remarks had been taken out of context. \"They picked up one sentence where I said that the Jews control the world.\" he protested. declaring that the reaction proved \"they do control the world.\" On the contrary. the reaction of most of the international community reflects the obvious: Prime Minister Mahathir is a bigot. an irresponsible and incendiary. nauseating prejudist. Nevertheless. it got a standing ovation from the kings. presidents. sheiks and emirsincluding key U.S. allies. I am disillusioned that the moderate voices in the Arab world also remained silent. The Egyptian foreign minister. Ahmed Maher. called the speech \"a very. very wise assessment.\" Asked by the AP whether he thought the speech was antiSemitic. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said: \"I dont think so.\" In addition. I am especially outraged by the actions of French President Jacques Chirac and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis to block the inclusion of a condemnation of Mahathirs antiSemitic speech in the official statement of an EU summit.

I rise in support of the motion of Mr. FILNER to instruct the conferees on H.R. 6. the Energy Policy Act of 2003. and to reject the waiver of the Clean Water Act being considered currently in conference. Mr. Speaker. the conferees on the Energy Conference are preparing to approve a permanent exemption from the Clean Water Act for all construction activities associated with oil and gas exploration and production. This is unprecedented and needs further review. Polluted runoff from precipitation events is the greatest remaining impediment to the Nation meeting its stated goal of clean. fishable and swimmable waters. Yet. even as the Environmental Protection Agency and the states are implementing reasonable measures to reduce such pollution. the Energy Bill conferees are preparing to approve a permanent exemption for one particular industry. This exemption is also quite unnecessary. EPA. after much pressure from the oil and gas industry. decided to grant the oil and gas industry a twoyear moratorium from the new rule that became effective this past March. However. not content with having EPA take another look at the issue. the industry now seeks a permanent exemption. The exemption applies regardless of the size of the construction site. regardless of the water quality impacts. and regardless of the wishes of an affected state. Mr. Speaker. blanket exemptions from the Clean Water Act should bear the highest burden of proof before this House ever grants its approval. This never happened. This provision was a stealth addition to the energy bill when it was considered at the Commerce Committee. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee was never given the opportunity to consider the provision. When the bill was on the House Floor. I joined with RankingMember OBERSTAR and Mr. MARKEY to strike the provision through amendment. but we were denied the opportunity. The entire process has been disappointing.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Disable Workers Empowerment. Under current law. millions of disabled Americans are unable to claim a tax deduction for many of the expenses they incur as a result of their disabilities. This creates a significant barrier to their leading productive and rewarding lives through employment. For example. in order to work. an individual who uses a wheelchair might need to hire a personal attendant to provide transportation to and from the job site. At a time when we are doing everything in our power to assist individuals looking for employment. it is counterintuitive to retain legislation that prevents some from seeking employment. While current law allows a limited deduction for disabled workers expenses. this deduction is limited to expenses that are necessary for the individual to perform work satisfactorily. This means. for example. that a blind individual could only claim a deduction for the cost of using a reading service at the workplace and during normal work hours. In addition. if this individual does not itemize his or her tax returns. the individual would receive no deduction. This legislation would correct this inequity. Under this bill. whether or not the individual itemizes. he or she would be able to claim a deduction for the overtime services that they require. regardless of itemizing his or her return. This is just one example of the dozens of. often expensive. services that better enable people with disabilities to do their jobs. I believe we need to do more to encourage individuals with disabilities and the desire to seek out employment. Current law perpetuates an iniquity that discourages people from living the fullest possible life. I believe this legislation goes a long way in correcting a shortcoming in current law. and will remove a barrier for millions of disabled workers. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. and hope to see its passage this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

This bill would clarify several existing Federal statutes which inadvertently exclude home schoolers. I am pleased the Senator ALLEN is joining me in sponsoring this measure. All to often. Federal laws relating to education have left out the millions of children across the Nation who are benefitting from home schooling. For example. home schoolers generally cannot qualify for the education savings accounts. unless they live in one of 13 states where a home school is treated as a private school. Also. home schooled students have found themselves to be ineligible for student aid in some circumstances. Nearly 2 million American children were home schooled during the 20002001 school year. These are good students who frequently outperform their public school peers. For example. in 2002 home schoolers as a whole averaged over 70 points higher on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Also. although home schoolers only make up about 2 percent of the U.S. schoolage population. in 2003 they made up 12 percent of the 251 spelling finalists and 5 percent of 55 geography bee finalists. These students consistently score at the highest levels of achievement tests and get into some of the best colleges and universities in our Nation. They are hard working. intelligent. and active in their communities. However. these students may be denied services available to other students because of an oversight in Federal law.

    "speech": "Mr. President. Senator CLINTON and I are proposing legislation to protect the voices of language minorities in our country. Representative ROBERT MENENDEZ will be introducing a companion bill in the House after the August recess. Our bill is called the National Minority Media Opportunities Act. Its goal is to see that Americans who are members of any \"language minority\" groups under the Voting Rights Act--defined as American Indian. Asian Americans. Alaskan Natives. and Hispanic Americansare not injured by excessive media concentration of companies that broadcast primarily in their native languages. Neither the Federal Communications Commissions new broadcast ownership regulations adopted on June 2 nor the previous regulations deal with the effects of growing media concentration on citizens relying on minoritylanguage broadcasts for their news and information. The FCCs new rules are already controversial because they allow excessive concentration. in spite of its effect on competition. the diversity of views. and other major national. State. and local priorities. Unfortunately. the specific and often more harmful effects of such concentration on minority populations have gone largely unnoticed. For instance. surveys show that the majority of the nearly 40 million Hispanic Americans rely significantly on Spanishlanguage broadcast media for their news and information. Forty percentnearly 16 millionof them rely predominantly on Spanishlanguage broadcast media. and 25 percentnearly 10 millionrely exclusively on it. Additional measures are clearly needed to guarantee that Americans who are members of minority language groups will continue to have access to diverse sources of news. information and cultural programming. and to opportunities for ownership of their media. Our bill addresses these concerns by requiring the FCC to hold public hearings. with notice and opportunity to comment. before approving the transfer of a license for a station serving a minoritylanguage audience. It also requires the FCC to report to Congress on issues involving the concentration of ownership and control of minoritylanguage broadcast media and the effects of excessive concentration on competition and diversity in these minoritylanguage markets. The bill will continue the Nations strong commitment to competition in broadcast media and the fullest possible participation in the political process for all our citizens. including the growing number of those whose first language is English.

Matsunaga and Stevens to introduce the Joint Resolution on December 15. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act states that it is the policy of the United States to preserve and protect the traditional religions of the American Indians. Aleuts. Eskimos and Native Hawaiians. It was necessary to declare this policy to begin to counter the ill effects that stemmed from the policy of the 1880s to the 1930s that sought to ban the exercise of Native American traditional religions. With the American Indian Religious Freedom Act policy in place. Congress built on this foundation to develop more specific legislation in 1989 and 1990 to provide for the repatriation of Native American human remains. sacred objects and items of cultural patrimony that were taken from Native Americans during the time of that Federal policy attempted to eliminate the practice of their religions. From time to time. the Congress has also returned certain sacred lands to Native Americans for their traditional religious use. The Committee on Indian Affairs has been conducting a series of oversight hearings on Native American sacred places and has found that many of these areas are being systematically damaged and destroyed. and Native Americans have no specific statutory authority that would enable them to defend their traditional religious areas in court. I believe that this twentyfifth anniversary year of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act is a fitting time for Congress to amend the Act. to assure that Native Americans have the legal means to protect their places of worship.

This legislation would update the tax rules governing real estate investment trusts. commonly referred to as REITs. by making a number of minor but important changes to remove uncertainties in the law and improve their investment climate. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives. REITs are publicly traded real estate companies that pass through their earnings to individual shareholders. Congress originally created REITs in 1960 to enable small investors to make investments in largescale. income producing real estate. By doing so. Congress made commercial real estate more accessible. more liquid. more transparent. and more attuned to investor interests. REITs have evolved to own properties across the country. including office buildings. apartments. shopping centers. and warehouses. As a result. these entities play a key role in helping our economy move forward by promoting investment and creating jobs. The Internal Revenue Code includes detailed rules governing the operations of REITs. the types of income they can earn. and the assets they hold. Congress last amended these provisions in 1999. The REIT Improvement Act is the product of almost two years of discussions with the staffs of the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation on how to find solutions to several thorny problem areas where the rules are in need of clarification or modification.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to provide for an income tax credit relating to the purchase of a gun safe. Experts agree that firearms should be stored unloaded and locked up. with ammunition stored separately. This bill. if enacted. would help protect our children and others due to accidents. suicides. and other acts. all connected with unguarded guns. The nonrefundable credit would amount to 25 percent of the total costs of purchasing. shipping. and installing a gun safe in a taxpayers residence. The maximum credit would be limited to 25 percent of the total costs up to $1.000. or a total credit of $250. Over 22 million children in the U.S. live in homes with at least one firearm. A study by the prestigious Rand Corporation found that fewer than 50 percent of American families with firearms stored their firearms safelyunloaded. locked and away from the ammunition. Storing firearms unloaded in a well constructed gun safe with a keyed combination or electronic lock is the most secure method for preventing unauthorized access by children. adolescents and criminals to firearms in a home. The FBI estimates there are more than 341.000 incidents of firearm theft from private citizens annually. Nearly onethird of these firearms will be used in the commission of another crime. Increasing the use of gun safes with keyed. combination or electronic locks would decrease the number of firearms stolen from homes and used by criminals to intimidate. harm and kill their victims. There is nothing mandatory about this legislation. The decision to purchase a gun safe remains a personal decision as does a persons decision to take advantage of the tax credit. The legislation is designed to encourage a voluntary act and does not in any way intrude into the American home. I ask your support for this legislation. which would help protect families. especially the children. from untimely deaths due to unguarded guns.",

He started working in the 1930s during the Depression at his fathers greenhouse where he grew cut flowers and sold them to retail florists in the city. He liked the business but wanted to be on the retail side. so his father built a small shop. Elm Road Florist. in front of the greenhouse. From these beginnings. Mr. Adgates business grew until he owned and operated. with the help of his wife Betty. a chain of stores throughout the area. He retired in the early 1990s. Soon after he retired. increased competition and changes in the client base made it difficult for the floral shop to compete. Mr. Adgate came out of retirement and took over the business again. working to make it more efficient. He continues to look for new ways to stay competitive. Mr. Adgate is a veteran of the Coast Guard as well as a member of the Rotary Club. Old Erie Lodge No. 3F and Howland Community Church where he serves as trustee. He also volunteers for Mobile Meals. plays tennis every week. swims and square dances. Mr. Adgate was honored by the Prime Time Awards Program. a yearlong initiative to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of working seniors. The programs goal is to break down the barriers to hiring. training and retaining older workers. Nominations for Outstanding Older Worker are received from across the country and a panel of volunteers in each state selects the most distinguished honoree. Mr. Speaker. once again I wish to extend my congratulations to Mr. Adgate.

SMART is making a measurable difference for Oregon children who are falling behind. It has tremendous potential as a model for the Nation. SMARTs mission is to hook children on reading at an early age. By connecting children with community volunteers for weekly oneonone reading sessionsand giving each student free books to take home and keepSMART cultivates a supportive environment where reading skills build quickly and confidence grows just as fast. Perhaps most importantly. SMART delivers proven results. Independent research shows that children who participate in SMART develop key reading skills faster than their peers. and maintain these gains after leaving the program. In fact. fifth graders who have been in SMART are 60 percent more likely than their peers to reach the state benchmark in reading. SMART began 12 years ago in eight schools and has since grown to serve more than 11.000 children annually in 31 of Oregons 36 counties. About 9.000 adults each year volunteer with SMART in more than 260 public elementary schools. SMARTs unique track record of mobilizing whole communities to invest in their local schools has been pivotal to the programs ongoing success. By engaging so many people to make community literacy a priority. SMART is helping to create an educated workforce for the next generation. It is helping Oregon build a solid economic future.

He augmented his education with a Masters degree in Agriculture Education from North Carolina State University in 1971.

He began winning first place awards for Horticulture and Floriculture in 1975 and is still winning. I will submit his list of awards so that Congress can see his many. many awards! In addition. Mr. Smith has been recognized countywide by Chatham County public schools as their Teacher of the Year for the school years. 19801981. 19811982 and 19861987. He has been named Chatham County Central High School Teacher of the Year for the school years 19801981. 19811982. 19861987 and 19931994. In 1995 he was one of only 6 teachers to be recognized as a National Regional Teacher of the Year. His principal at Bear Creek Central High School had this high praise for him. \"Mr. Smith is one of the educators that will come along once in a lifetime. He is a mentor. and an innovator. He is humble. yet driven to succeed. His students will fondly remember the impact that he made for several years after they leave Chatham Central High School.

Over 100.000 of Americas military veterans or their dependents are not able to manage their own finances because of physical or mental disabilities. In these cases. the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) appoints a family member. a guardian. or another person to act as a \"fiduciary\" to protect and manage their monetary payments and VA benefits. Caring for a dependent veteran involves using the payments the VA sends each month to pay utility bills. buy food. and to meet the other needs on behalf of the veteran. It is a tremendous responsibility. Last year. during an oversight hearing into the VAs fiduciary program. I learned that some of these veterans are not always cared for by the appointed fiduciary. In fact. the Inspector General has found cases in which a fiduciary has withheld payments completely for several yearsdefrauding the veteran out of several thousand dollars. In my District Office in San Diego. my staff has tried to assist veterans who lost out on their payments only to learn that under current law. the VA does not have the authority to replace the benefits when misuse has occurred. Because it was our veterans suffering from the lack of oversight. I introduced the Veterans Fiduciary Act of 2004 or H.R. 4023 to provide veterans with protections similar to those recently enacted to protect Social Security beneficiaries.

Its an issue of personal safety and of constitutional rights embedded in the fabric of our Nation. I agree with those who want to restrict criminal access to guns. However. this must be done without compromising the constitutional rights of our lawabiding citizens. I strongly support the right of lawabiding adults to purchase and own firearms for the protection of their homes and families. collecting. target shooting. and hunting. Thats why I have and will continue to oppose any proposal that threatens this basic Second Amendment right. I realize the concerns of some Americans who. in the wake of school shootings and other heinous illegal acts. call for stricter gun control measures. I understand those concerns. Thats why I fully support measures that call for tougher sentences for the illegal use of firearms. to get offenders off the streets and out of our communities. I support stiff sentences of juveniles who use firearms illegally. and I support increasing the maximum penalty for adults who illegally provide those juveniles with firearms. Thats how we must keep our schools and communities safe. Mr. Speaker. tougher gun laws should not infringe on the rights of lawabiding citizens. and Congress has both the authority and the responsibility to ensure that they do not.

I think there is a real serious question about suggesting that Title VII said it is perfectly okay for a faithbased group to take Federal tax dollars and say. \"Mr. BoEHNER.

Why should any American citizen have to pass another American citizens personal religious test to qualify for a Federal education program or a job training program?

And I do not think we have to totally revisit the 1964 Civil Rights Act. I think we could just come here on the floor of the House and have an upfront debate. It is very simple. It is. Do you believe that it is okay for groups to discriminate in job hiring using tax dollars. based on no other reason than that persons personal religious faith?

They are appalled with religious bigotry. and while they understand. as I do. that Baptists and Methodists and Jews and Muslims should be able to hire people of their faith. using their own money. once they accept public tax dollars as a funding source. then they accept the obligation that in America. with tax dollars. you do not discriminate against your fellow citizens simply because of their deeply held religious faith.

Mr. Chairman. it should be clear to our colleagues today that the underlying bill. the reauthorization of the Community Services Block Grant program. has been done on a broad bipartisan basis. The only issue here of disagreement in the Chamber is the issue of whether faithbased providers would give up their title VII exemption in order to continue working in this program. As I mentioned before. for the last 6 years this language allowing faithbased providers to receive federal funds and to maintain their exemptions under title VII has in fact been the law. And to my knowledge. there has been no complaints. Now. it is pretty clear to me. and I think to most of my colleagues. that faithbased organizations. whether they are using their own money or they are using federal funds. I would venture to say that the vast majority of them probably would never take up their title VII exemption or need it. But the fact is that that is the law. The 1964 Civil Rights Act made it very clear that religious organizations did not have to give up their rights to hire the person of their choice under that act. And all we do here is maintain that and we have been doing this. as we said. in the welfare reform law. a number of other laws. over the past decade or so. And for those who have differences with this law. and I certainly respect their opinion. the fight should not be here on this bill. If they really feel strongly that the title VII exemption for religious organizations should be taken away. they should go to the Committee on the Judiciary and move a bill to change the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But let us not do it on this bill. Mr. Chairman. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware . who has worked diligently on this program. not only here as a Member of Congress. but in his prior life of Governor of the great State of Delaware.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of H.R. 3030 and in opposition to the amendments offered today. H.R. 3030 would reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant program and restore the protections granted to religious organizations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This exemption explicitly allows faithbased organizations the freedom to consider religion when hiring staff. and any federal legislation goveming federal training and social services funds should continue to protect these rights. Faithbased providers cannot be expected to sustain their religious mission if they cannot employ individuals who share the tenets and practices of their faith. In many cases. it is that faith that motivates them to serve their community. Such practices have been upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Bowen v. Kendrick. even when the organization is receiving federal funds. Let me clarify. Federal funds cannot be used for worship or for proselytizing. Nor can these organizations discriminate in who receives services. Any activity that used federal funds must not be discriminatory. We have a long history of making social service legislation more inclusive by extending the Title VII exemptions in various federal programs. H.R. 3030 contains the same \"faithbased\" provisions as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and the Community Services Block Grant Act of 1998. both of which were signed into law by former President Clinton. The bill we are considering today would simply make the Community Services Block Grant consistent with the legislation governing other major social service programs. Furthermore. in May. the House approved almost identical language in reauthorizing the Workforce Reinvestment and Adult Education Act of 2003. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and let faithbased organizations continue the good work they are currently doing.",

While I strongly support the social services and organizations that these grants help support. this bill does not correct current law. which explicitly allows religious organizations that receive federal funds from the Community Service Block Grant Act to discriminate in their hiring. Instead. I support the amendment offered by my colleagues. Representatives LYNN WOOLSEY. GEORGE MILLER. and others. which would prohibit discrimination in hiring based on religion. Americans share a fundamental value that we must never discriminate on the basis of religion. Unlike other ideologies. our Constitution specifically protects religion in the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. Yet. H.R. 3030 says federal funds can. in fact. be used to discriminate against someone who may not share the same religion as that practiced by the organization receiving funds. We must not allow our taxpayer dollars to support discrimination. The fact is that religious organizations have been providing secular social services. such as Meals on Wheels. adult literacy programs. homeless shelters and jobtraining programs. to people in this country for decades. And. in cases where federal funds are involved. these religious organizations have willingly done so without discriminating in their hiring. We must not go down a road where discrimination of any kind is allowed with federal money. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no\" on H.R. 3030 and \"yes\" on amendments that prohibit religious discrimination.",

Sometimes it is hard to remember how the intellectual fortunes of free enterprise have fallen under high taxes and government intrusion. Now that the Bush tax cuts have started to kick in and boost the economy. we see again that job growth has remained strong and in May we gained jobs. The American people are recognizing the positive leadership of George W. Bush and the Republican Congress. Let us look at the facts: job seekers in America are getting good news and. most importantly. jobs. There were 248.000 jobs created in May. That means more than 900.000 jobs created over the last 3 months alone. Today the unemployment rate is down to 5.6 percent. lower than the average unemployment rate of the last 3 decades. Americas families are seeing the change in their kitchentable finances. Homeownership has risen to the highest level ever and real disposable income is up to an annual average rate of 3.9 percent. Finally. our business owners are benefiting. Real business investment in equipment and software is up to an annual rate of 14 percent. This is an economics package that puts people first. The President and the Republicans in Congress will continue to knock down the barriers of high taxes and government red tape. By removing those barriers. we see the true entrepreneurial spirit of the American people and with that spirit so grows our economy.",

Republicans are awarding $10 billion. this is billion with a B. to tobacco growers. They call it a buyout. but it is really a sellout to the tobacco industry. If this measure is approved. tobacco will get cheaper. more of it can be grown. and all American taxpayers will be the losers. With the near goitalone occupation of Iraq continuously draining funds out the Treasury spigot faster than American taxpayers can pour their hardearned funds into it. there is nothing conservative about giving away $10 billion to the tobacco industry. Ten billion dollars would give tens of thousands of young Americans the college education they cannot afford. They could give tens of thousands of American mothers the peace of mind that comes when they know their children have health insurance. Ten billion dollars could also buy a lot of homeland security. but instead. Congress is spending that $10 billion to reward the producers of a lethal product that each year ruins the lives of families with death and disease. This is not a jobcreation bill. It is a diseasecreation bill. Eighty percent of registered voters this week across America expressed their opposition to this tobacco bailout by the Congress. Unfortunately. the wellheeled lobbyists of Big Tobacco not the people. are the ones dictating this. Little wonder that this outrageous giveaway never had a public hearing. was never debated in Committee. and is being considered today in a way that denies any amendment to strike it.

I am from Kentucky. and I can tell my colleagues that we are talking about small tobacco farms and family farms where men and women and their children get out in the fields every summer and try to eke out a living in the tobacco fields by the sweat of their brow. They have had to purchase a government program. they have had to buy a quota in order to grow tobacco or they could not grow it. They contributed through an assessment fee to pay for a price support program on their own. It was not from taxpayers. and since 1997 that quota program has been cut over half. and now it is pretty difficult for them to maintain that living on that family farm. It is the last thing that has allowed them to make a profit on their farm. if they made a profit. It was a program that allowed them to put their kids through college or to buy Christmas presents or to buy clothing for their kids. This is about small family farms in about seven to 10 States in this country. It is about an asset that they had to pay for that now is being taken away from them by the government. and we are eliminating something that. it is amazing to me. that for years I have heard we have got to get rid of this program. we have got to get rid of this program.

I supported H.R. 2417 when it came before the House in June. but after tertiary review. I find that there is a provision in the bill that potentially has longreaching effects on civil liberties. H.R. 2417 includes a provision that would expand the FBIs power to demand financial records. without a judges approval. to a large range of businesses. vastly wider than their current authority. Right now the FBI has the authority to serve subpoenas to traditional financial institutions when investigating terrorism and counterintelligence without having to seek a judges approval. The law understands the phrase \"financial Institutions\" as we do: banks. loan companies. savings associations and credit unions. Currently. these are the types of institutions subject to administrative subpoenas. The provision in this bill. however. uses a definition of financial institutions to decide what organizations are subject to administrative subpoenas. Under this bill. not only are the traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions affected but so are pawnbrokers. casinos. vehicle salesmen. real estate agents. telegraph companies. travel agencies. the U.S. Postal Service. just to name but a few. Winning the war against terrorism is indeed vital. Mr. Speaker. and we must make sure that our law enforcement officials have the tools necessary to engage this war and win these battles. The FBIs need for authority to subpoena these groups in order to track and find -and shut down terrorist operations is not in question. and I do not question that. However. under these provisions. the FBI no longer needs a court order to serve such a subpoena on a new and lengthy laundry list of financial institutions. With this legislation. we eliminate the judicial oversight that was built into our system for a reason. to make sure that our precious liberties are protected. In our fight for our Nation to make the world a safe place. we must not turn our backs on our own freedoms. Expanding the use of administrative subpoenas and threatening our system of checks and balance is a step in the wrong direction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to state my opposition to a provision in this conference report that intrudes on our civil liberties and will do little. if anything. to protect us from terrorism. I think it is important that law enforcement have the powers it needs to investigate acts of money laundering that are connected to terrorism and espionage. but we must ensure those powers are reasonable and appropriately crafted. Current law already gives the FBI the ability to obtain financial records from various financial institutions. which are defined as banks. savings and loans. thrifts. and credit unions. with little or no judicial oversight. In fact. the government can delay notification to a court that it has sought such records if it merely certifies in writing that it required emergency access to the documents. Now. the FBI is seeking investigative authorities beyond what are necessary for terrorism and intelligence investigations. Section 374 of the conference report would give the FBI even more unfettered authority by subjecting a broader group of \"financial institutions\" to the FBIs special investigative authorities. The FBI would be able to seek financial records not only from traditional financial institutions but also from pawnbrokers. travel agencies. car dealers. boat sellers. telegraph companies. and persons engaged in real estate transactions. among others. The record of the Bush administration demonstrates that this provision is a significant intrusion on our civil liberties that will not be used to protect us from terrorism. In the days after September 11. the administration demanded from Congress expanded powers to root out terrorist activity. Congress granted much of those powers in the form of the USA PATRIOT Act. but the administration has yet to justify how it has used those powers to find the planners of the 2001 attacks or to thwart other. planned attacks. Instead. the administration returns to Congress with requests for more authorities. such as this one. in a grab for power. For these reasons.

Although the House of Representatives recently voted in a bipartisan and overwhelming fashion to repeal Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act. a provision that threatens Americans rights by allowing for \"sneak and peak searches\". it appears the administration is poised to move ahead with further actions that endanger civil liberties by slipping an expanded PATRIOT Act power in the Intelligence Conference Report. The hidden measure would significantly expand the FBIs power to acquire financial records without judicial oversight from car dealers. pawnbrokers. travel agencies. and many other businesses. Traditional financial institutions like banks and credit unions are already subject to such demands. but this dramatic expansion of government authority will mean that records created by average citizens who purchase cars. plan vacations. or buy gifts will be subject to government seizure and analysis without the important requirements of probable cause or judicial review. This provision initially appeared in a leaked draft of socalled \"PATRIOT I\". a proposal the American public and Members on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate publicly rejected. It is now clear the administrations strategy is to pass PATRIOT II in separate pieces with little public debate and surreptitiously attached to other legislation. This is far from an appropriate or democratic way to handle issues that affect the fundamental liberties and freedoms of Americans. I urge the administration and the Attorney General to openly and honestly return to Congress to discuss options that curtail. not expand. the PATRIOT Act to make it consistent with the United States Constitution.

Soon. most computers and telecommunications hardware will be based on it. In the nottoodistant future. nanotechnology will begin to transform biology. medicine. military systems. energy systems. Nanotechnology is poised to become the next great vehicle of growth for the American economy. and like biotechnology was 10. 12. 15 years ago. nanotechnology has reached a critical growth stage. The 21st Century Research and Development Act intensifies Federal support for nanoresearch and experimentation and will prove. I think. critical to unlocking the tremendous potential that nanotechnology presents. In conclusion. let me just say that nanotechnology holds incredible promise in a wide range of scientific disciplines. and while there are some nanotechnology products on the market today. the industry is very close to achieving several important breakthroughs that include revolutionary new applications in materials science. in manufacturing. So if we are going to stay competitive in the world market. and that means having our standard of living above everybody else. then we are going to have to take advantage of this kind of technology that can improve the way we produce products. but also improve those products that we are selling and allow us to be competitive on a world market. In conclusion. I would hope everybody would unanimously not only support this bill but the kind of funding that is necessary to make sure that the United States stays on top in nanoresearch. I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.",

It is indeed a pleasure to be here this afternoon to support Senate bill 189. the 21st Century National Nanotechnology Research and Development Act. Nanotechnology is a very promising future technology. From materials to computers. medicine. defense. energy. the possibilities are limitless. We are moving from an age of miniaturization to an age of selfreplication. The House overwhelmingly approved this bills companion. H.R. 766. and I am hopeful that the House will once again make a bipartisan commitment to increasing resources for nanotechnology research and development. The development of nanotechnology is not only important to my corner of the country but for every human on the planet. The National Science Foundation estimates that in a little over a decade nanotechnology will positively impact the global market by approximately $1 trillion. This bill will ensure that the United States continues to be a leader in nanotechnology research. This bill is especially important to my academic institutions in my district. especially the University of North Texas. Mr. Speaker. as the ranking member knows. everything is bigger in Texas unless it is better to be smaller. in which case everything is smaller in Texas. Beginning last fall. the University of North Texas began laboratory renovation and equipment purchases for the Department of Material Science. including research space for their Laboratory for Electronic Materials and Devices and the establishment of a nanometrology laboratory. the first in the Nation. This center. the Center for Advanced Research and Technology. Is a unique collaboration between academic and corporate partners in the north Texas area. designed to develop new nanotechnology applications. The development of the nanometrology laboratory will provide remote access by researchers throughout the United States through stateoftheart materials characterization. These facility and research capabilities are important to the future competitiveness and the value of American materials worldwide. and this bill will help further those developments. This comprehensive approach taken by Senate bill 189 to raise the profile of nanometrology and nanotechnology among the general public and increased resources for academic institutions will ensure that our country. America. is the leader in this field for years to come.",

Rape and sexual assault affects women. children. and men of all racial. cultural. and economic backgrounds. I commend the work of local organizations to end this type of violence. The importance of these issues is illustrated by statistics that indicate that there were 10.176 forcible rapes reported in 2002. and that the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that over 70 percent of rapes are never reported to police. and that one in three women. one in four girls. one in six boys and one in eleven men will be victims of sexual violence at least once in their lifetimes. While one person. organization. agency or community cannot eliminate sexual assault on their own. we must work together to educate our entire society about what can be done to prevent sexual assault. as well as to support survivors and their significant others. and increase support for agencies providing these services. Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center has led the way in Santa Barbara in addressing sexual assault by providing 24hour hotline services to survivors and their significant others. responding to emergency calls. offering support and comfort to those impacted by sexual assault during medical exams. criminal proceedings. and empowering those impacted by sexual assault to chart their own course for healing. Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center has set an important example of how forging collaborative relationships between service agencies and organizations improves the quality of service for those most profoundly and directly impacted by sexual violence. Ending sexual assault in Santa Barbara must include active public and private efforts in collaboration with Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center. including dialogue about what sexual violence is. how to prevent it and how to help survivors connect with crucial counseling and support services. As a nurse. I understand firsthand the importance of education as it pertains to healthcare and to the prevention and elimination of sexual assault.

MI. Throughout his tenure. Mr. Doyle was instrumental in guiding the city of Royal Oak through many exciting changes. I have been privileged to work with him and have seen first hand his professionalism and his dedication to the city and its residents. His service began during the initial stages of the citys revival. first as Deputy City Attorney in 1983. then as city attomey in 1990. With the completion of Interstate 696 on the southem border. Royal Oak began reaping the benefits of its central position in southeast Michigan. With his active involvement businesses quickly utilized the location and the opening of diverse restaurants and unique shops brought visitors as frequently as local residents. After a nationwide search. the city leadership rightly asked Larry to take the management helm of the city in 1994. Over the following years. he set policies that aided in bringing the city a new ice arena. a new district court. improvements in city parks. as well as tremendous growth in property values. These efforts lead to the recent \"Cool City\" designation by Governor Jennifer Granholm. not only for a vibrant downtown. but for a desirable hometown community for residents. Larrys commitment to the city did not end with the workday. As an advocate and a resident. he can be found supporting any number of local events such as the Woodward Dream Cruise or the St. Patricks Day Parade. The people of Royal Oak have indeed been wellserved by all of his efforts. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a dedicated public servant.

I would like to thank the artists who have come to Capitol Hill to visit with members of Congress regarding support for arts education as essential to the creative ingenuity of the cultural fabric of our society. We appreciate their extraordinary talent and we welcome them to Washington. The Congress must provide sufficient funding for arts education in our schools and the National Endowment for the Arts. These programs are vital to supporting the creation. preservation and presentation of the arts and humanities in America. In my district. numerous schools have taken essential steps toward integrating arts education in their students daily routines. Unfortunately. budget cuts threaten the longevity of these programs. Studies have demonstrated that reading and math scores improve with participation in arts education classes. A U.S. Department of Justice study found that arts education reduced student delinquency in San Antonio by 13% and increased the communications skills of students in Atlanta by 57%. Test Results from the College Board have shown that college bound students involved in the arts and humanities have higher overall SAT scores that other students. Im proud to have been part of the legislative effort to empower the Secretary of Education to fund arts education programs in our schools through the No Child Left Behind Education Act of 2003. Beyond our borders. the WTO must stand firm against the piracy of our artists intellectual property. We in Congress must strengthen our commitment and effort with our trading partners to end piracy. Theft of intellectual property has a significant economic affect on the United States. The recording industry. for example. reports a loss of $286 million in sales with our trading partner. China. In addition. market access and investment barriers prevent the entertainment industry from serving markets overseas thus and increases demand for pirated U.S. entertainment products. The Congress and the United States Trade Representative need to work together to apply pressure to the governments of countries where piracy is rampant.

Here. again. we have reasoned together about the significant changes that will come about as a result of the underlying proposal in the creation of an NID. I think it will come out with a result that is fair and will be effective. As I have said before. our intelligence forces today are like an army without a general. The whole idea of creating an NID is to put somebody in charge. Part of being in charge has to mean the ability to transfer the forces to places where the director thinks they are needed. Senator LEVIN was understandably concerned about the impact that might have on the military chain of command. In an initial proposal he said these transfers could not occur without the approval of the Secretary of Defense. We thought that would frustrate the authority that we are trying to give to the national intelligence director. So we have come to a very reasonable compromise. which is. as Senator COLLINS and Senator LEVIN said. with regard to uniform military personnel working within the intelligence community. If the NID believes he needs three. four. or five positions from military intelligence. the slots can be moved. But the NID. with regard to uniformed military personnel. cannot go in and say. I wantas Senator COLLINS said-\"Colonel Murkowski\" to be transferred to the national intelligence center. or some other subdivision of the intelligence community. That is quite reasonable. But it would allow the position. the slot. to be transferred. And then. presumably. for a process of negotiation. it would allow a process of negotiation to go on for the Secretary of Defense or the NID. or their designees. as to who actually filled that slot. With regard to nonuniformed personnel. including military personnel. those within the Department of Defense. they can be transferred by the national intelligence director. acting on his own. I think this is a very good. balanced compromise. I thank Senator LEVIN for his characteristic thoughtfulness. I even thank him for his persistence. which I think has brought about a good result.

I have been working to reform the copyright royalty arbitration procedures for several years. As early as 2002. I noted in a Judiciary Committee hearing that there was widespread dissatisfaction with the current law. In particular. we heard the testimony of Frank Schliemann of Onion River Radio of Montpelier. VT. Mr. Schliemann noted that many small webcasters could not afford to take part in CARP proceedings. even though their livelihoods would depend on the outcome. We also heard from Billy Strauss. president of Websound. another small webcaster in Brattleboro. VT. Mr. Strauss noted many of the structural problems that plagued the old CARP procedures. In addition. I have been concerned that the current procedures are often hindered by unreasonable delays. and the outcomes subject to manipulation. The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act responds to these concerns. It replaces arbitrators. who serve for only one CARP procedure and are paid by the parties. with fulltime administrative judges. As a result. the financial burden of taking part in a CARP procedure is alleviated. In addition. all parties can rest assured that there will be continuity and stability in the resolution of these proceedings. At the same time. this bill preserves the traditional role of the Register of Copyrights. This bill also resolves longstanding disputes over the availability of discovery. Because discovery is available where it is needed. the copyright royalty judges will have the information necessary to render a correct determination but the costs of discovery will be kept to a minimum. I am pleased to have cosponsored with Senator HATCH the amendment in the nature of a substitute to the House bill. I thank Chairman SENSENBRENNER.

    "speech": "and me on this very important issue to set forth a process for determining what intelligence assets belong in the NIP. the national intelligence program. versus the joint military intelligence program and the tactical program. The CollinsLieberman bill gives the national intelligence director strong budgetary authority over the national intelligence program. Senator LIEBERMAN and I envision that his program will be composed of the intelligence assets that serve national purposes. meaning those that pertain to the interests of more than one department. In the long run. I strongly believe the budgets for the National Security Agency. the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency. and the National Reconnaissance Office should be wholly within the national intelligence program. Currently. these agencies have split budgets. and the heads of these agencies tell us that leads to a great deal of administrative inefficiency. Now. it is possible that some intelligence assets from the Department of Defenses Joint Military Intelligence Program may ultimately be moved to the national intelligence program. but. of course. military intelligence assets that principally serve joint or tactical military needs should stay within the Department of Defense. and I think the language is very clear on this point. Through this amendment. we have tried to address concerns that both Senators have raised. I think the compromise language does address and alleviate those concerns. The reviews that are underway will help us better define the parts of the intelligence budget that will be completed within 1 year after the effective date. in one case 60 days. in the case that Senator LEViN is concerned with the three activities in the Defense Intelligence Agency. The reviews mandated in this compromise amendment will provide a rational process for determining which assets belong in the national intelligence program and which do not.

The Levin amendment would forbid expenditure of funds that would be used to negotiate free trade agreements that do not contain certain listed provisions. The listed provisions impose duties that are not now required by law and they make the appropriations contingent upon the performance of the new duty and on successful trade negotiations with other countries. For example. in the area of labor law. the Levin amendment seeks provisions in a trade agreement that would mandate. mandate. adoption in domestic law and enforcement of the basic recognized rights of workers. This sharply contrasts with the Trade Act. which only goes so far as to seek to promote respect for workers rights. to promote universal ratification and full compliance with the ILO Convention 182. The differences between the approach of the gentleman from Michigan and the current law are manifold. The Trade Act does not call for adoption and enforcement of the labor rights listed in the Jordan Free Trade Agreement. Indeed. the Trade Act seems to uphold the right of other countries to establish domestic labor standards. Similarly. in investment. Mr. Chairman. the Levin amendment seeks provisions in a trade agreement that would ensure the free trade agreement does not provide for an investors greater rights than Americans. This also contrasts sharply with the Trade Act. which carefully states that foreign investors are not to be afforded greater substantive rights. The Levin amendment would deny foreign investors greater procedural rights as well as substantive rights. and certainly this would be a duty not present in the U.S. law. So for that reason. and for others that I could go on. I would urge the Chair to make a ruling that this amendment is not in order.",

One of the arguments that has been made has to do with the issue of exporting automobiles. automobiles manufactured right here in the United States of America. Under this agreement with Chile. we actually see Chile agree to an elimination of the luxury auto tax. and by eliminating that tax under this agreement in Chile. it will enhance the chance for us to see the exportation of more U.S.-manufactured automobiles into Chiles market which admittedly is a small one but is growing.

Mr. Speaker. is that there are many people who like to blame every single ailment of society on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

And I am not here in this job. and I do not believe we as policymakers should have the protection of one industry over another as a priority. And so I believe that quite frankly it may not have been the mere existence of the North American Free Trade Agreement that created the challenges that have existed in that area.

Mr. Corman was diagnosed with cancer and given 3 years to live. A man not used to sitting idly by. he successfully completed a stemcell bone marrow transplant in November 2001 and today his cancer is in complete remission. In fact. Mr. Corman is doing so well that at the age of 48 he ran in the 108th annual Boston Marathon. Mr. Corman came from humble beginnings. the son of a state highway worker and homemaker. But he hasnt forgotten where he came from or the lessons his grandfather taught him about hard work and honesty. His never give up attitude has led to business success and overcoming serious illness. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Kentuckys railroad entrepreneur. Mr. R.J. Corman.",

Owsley recently fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams by opening a museum to showcase his collection of historic weaponrythe Frazier Historical Arms Museum. I was honored to join him at the grand opening to get a sneak peak at his impressive collection. The Frazier Historical Arms Museum is more than guns in cases and maps on walls. Inside this $32 million. 100.000squarefoot museum weapons are displayed based on the stories they tell. The museum is home to Teddy Roosevelts \"Big Stick.\" a rifle owned by George Washington. a bow and arrow used by Geronimo. and General George Armstrong Custers Colt Navy revolvers. Not only does the museum house Owsleys collection of American artifacts but also holds collections on loan from the British Royal Armories in the Tower of London. These artifacts are combined with guides dressed in period attire. short films. and interactive computer stations. It is definitely a \"must see\" while in Louisville. Owsley wanted to give back to his hometown and the museum was his gift. The museum is a testament to his work ethic and his values. It reflects his philanthropic nature that he has contributed $500 million to charities during his lifetime. including tens of millions for his biggest passioneducation. He has used his own money. but also millions of dollars of contributions from his familys company to preserve historic buildings. build housing for lowincome families and of course. support our local colleges and schools. His friends describe him as a simple man who loves fishing at his Shelby County farm. breakfast at the Waddy Truck Stop. and would rather watch sports on television than attend cocktail parties. Owsley and I also share a special passion: University of Louisville Athletics. In fact. he once even skipped a family members wedding because the Cardinals had a game that day. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this incredible man. Owsley has a genuine and sincere love for the city of Louisville. the Commonwealth of Kentucky. and most importantly his fellow man. I can only hope he will inspire us all to share that same benevolent passion and commitment in our lives.",

It pleases me to be able to speak today of Rev. Bennetts tremendous contributions to Nevadas spiritual. civic. and political life. Reverend Bennetts dedicated service and inspired leadership of the Zion United Methodist Church in Las Vegas has spanned over four decades. During his tenure. he oversaw the relocation of the Church to its current West Las Vegas site. and spearheaded the development of a muchneeded day care center in the community. Reverend Bennetts commitment to public service. however. has extended well beyond his West Las Vegas congregation. As president of the Las Vegas Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 19631967 and 19711973. Rev. Bennett was among the foremost leaders in the struggle for civil rights in Nevada. He has continued to remain active in the Las Vegas NAACP as an executive board member for the past 30 years. Reverend Bennett also served as a member of the Nevada State Assembly for 10 years. As chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee. he worked hard to ensure that the States health care and social welfare services kept pace with Nevadas dramatic growth and development. In doing so. Reverend Bennett helped expand the opportunities available to Nevadans and improve the quality of life in the Silver State. His lifetime of service to his church and community has been recognized by many organizations including the University of Nevada. which conferred upon him its Distinguished Nevadan Award. I also want all within the sound of my voice to understand the quality of friend Reverend Bennett has been to me. The quality has been the best. for which I will always be grateful. In short. Reverend Bennett has led a distinguished career and life.

This followed on the heels of Senate approval of the U.S.-Australia agreement by a vote of 80 to 16. The Australia bill itself was preceded by renewal and extension of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on June 24 of this year. Prior to that. the Senate was able to work out its differences and pass the JOBS Act by a vote of 92 to 5. I will note that each of these bills passed in an election year. a year in which many pundits argued that nothing on trade would get done. Well we proved them wrong. In fact. this has been one of the most active years on trade in the Senate in recent memory. I say. why stop now? We should continue our efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. exports. That is why I am calling on President Bush to send up the Central American Free Trade Agreement at the earliest opportunity. The CAFTA is an important part of our continuing efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. goods and services. This market access is critical if we are going to continue to grow our exports to the world. For my home State of Iowa. the CAFTA brings important new market access opportunities for our soybean. corn. pork and beef as well as Iowas manufacturers and service providers. Under the current framework. many products from the CAFTA nations get access to our market but we do not get the same access to theirs. The CAFTA will change that. It will level the playing field for U.S. producers so they can compete in this growing market.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this week is the last week that Congress is in session before the August recess and there is only one additional week to act before the Assault Weapons Ban expires on September 13th. This past Monday. one of our former colleagues. Senator Howard Metzenbaum. wrote an oped for the Washington Post. In his article. Senator Metzenbaum highlights the broad support this law has among Americans. as well as the inconsistencies between the stated positions and the actions of President Bush on the reauthorization of this critical law. As my colleagues know. in addition to banning 19 specific weapons. the existing ban makes it illegal to \"manufacture. transfer. or possess a semiautomatic\" firearm that can accept a detachable magazine and has more than one of several specific military features. such as folding/telescoping stocks. protruding pistol grips. bayonet mounts. threaded muzzles or flash suppressors. barrel shrouds or grenade launchers. These weapons are dangerous and they should not be on Americas streets. In April of this year. the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence joined hundreds of local elected officials and senior law enforcement officials to urge President Bush to push for reauthorization of this critical piece of gun safety legislation. Since then. the support for this important law has grown exponentially. In addition to former Presidents Ford. Carter. and Clinton. nearly every major law enforcement organization in the country. gun safety organizations. a bipartisan majority of the Senate. and countless local leaders have added their names to the list of supporters. I commend them for their efforts in support of this commonsense gun safety legislation. In 1994. I voted for the assault weapons ban and in March of this year I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend the assault weapons ban for 10 years. Unfortunately. despite Senate passage of the amendment. it appears that this important gun safety law will be allowed to expire. The House Republican leadership opposes reauthorizing the law and President Bush. though he has said he supports it. has done little to help keep the law alive. I ask unanimous consent that the oped from Senator Metzenbaum be printed in the RECORD at the end of my statement. I also ask that the list of organizations in support of this critical piece of gun safety legislation be printed in the RECORD following Senator Metzenbaums oped.",

Senator KENNEDY and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act. a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law. sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. On August 12. 2002. Stephanie (Wilbur) Thomas. age 19. was driving her friend Ukea (Deon) Davis. age 18. home in southeast Washington. DC. The two young transgendered women were members of Transgender Health Empowerment. an AfricanAmerican transgender support group. A car drove up beside them. and a gunman fired shots from an automatic weapon. The gunfire killed Ukea Davis and critically wounded Stephanie Thomas. The gunman then got out of the car and fired additional shots into Thomas car. Though police have not determined if they will file this as a hate crime. the additional shots fired at Thomas after the initial shooting seem to indicate an overkill factor common in many murders of transgendered people in the U.S. I believe that the Governments first duty is to defend its citizens. to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law. we can change hearts and minds as well.",

This bill. introduced yesterday by Senator GREGG. chairman of the Senate Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee. takes an important step forward in bringing our Nations medical system into the 21st century. In todays society. it seems that almost everything is computerized and online. You can pay your bills online. order your groceries online. and even file your taxes online. However. for the most part. medical records are still on paper and in files. This means these records are uneasily shared between doctors treating the same patient or are not readily available during an emergency. Earlier this year. the Bush administration made computerizing the Nations medical record and building a nationwide health network a priority. Yesterday. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson released a 10year plan for doing just that. S. 2710 is similar to the administrations plan and takes some immediate steps to start fulfilling this goal. including establishing an official office at the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate health information technology at the national level. The bill also provides assistance to local communities linking their health care systems. along with providing grants for purchasing health information technology. Creating a safe. secure and reliable system for medical records wont be easy. but if done properly. it could help health care providers reduce medical errors and provide better care to their patients. We could also see a substantial savings in administrative costs which will help lower health care costs for everyone. S. 2710 is a good first step. and I am proud to be a cosponsor. I am hopeful that the members of the Senate Committee on Health. Education. Labor and Pensions can work together to pass this bill soon. and that we can get it to the Presidents desk by the end of the year.",

Included in that bill is a provision that would divert $500.000 in funding from the Office of the General Counsel at the Food and Drug AdministrationFDA. As chairman of the committee with oversight over the FDA. I believe that such a provision is not only misguided. but based upon a flawed understanding of both the Agency and the facts. According to the sponsors of this provision. such a punitive measure is warranted because the current Chief Counsel. Dan Troy. is taking the Agency \"in a radical new direction\" by filing amicus curiae briefs in product liability cases. Sponsors of this provision also claim that Mr. Troys involvement in one such case is suspect because it involved Pfizer. a client of Mr. Troys when he was with the law firm of Wiley. Rein & Fielding. Such charges are patently without merit. and I would like to take this opportunity to set the record straight. First. Mr. Troy has not broken any new ground by having the FDA interject in product liability cases on the side of a defendants without the court requesting the Agencys position. I have here a letter addressed to me from five former FDA chief counselstwo of which are Democratsaffirming that Mr. Troys actions are neither \"radical\" nor \"novel.\" I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the RECORD.",

Mr. Troy is responsible for safeguarding the FDAs ability to carry out the responsibilities Congress has given the Agency. and his interest in those cases has been to preserve the FDAs authority and to safeguard the Agencys primary jurisdiction. Finally. if Mr. Troys previous work for a clientin this case Pfizerautomatically precluded him from representing a federal agency in any matter affecting that client. such a policy would not only discourage. but make it extremely difficult for any private sector attorney from taking a job in government. Additionally. I know from personal experience that Mr. Troy has the character and the integrity to recuse himself from a matter when appropriate. On at least one occasion in which my office was required to interact with the FDA. Mr. Troy recused himself from involvement in the matter. citing his interest in complying strictly with FDA rules. Mr. Troys actions are neither inappropriate nor unprecedented. Rather. these are examples of Mr. Troy doing his job and enforcing the law. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider these facts before supporting any provision. such as this one. that would undermine the FDAs ability to protect the public health and patient access to safe and effective lifesaving therapies.",

I rise in support of H.R. 1036. the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. As my esteemed colleagues have discussed. H.R. 1036 would prohibit civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers by parties that have been injured by the unlawful use of firearms. Mr. Chairman. I am a great believer in personal responsibility. It is one of the key principles upon which America was founded. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act would strengthen this great notion. Imposing liability on an entire industry for harm caused solely by the unlawful actions of others is an abuse of the United States legal systemit undermines public confidence in our judicial system and threatens the viability of lawabiding companies. Frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry are nothing more than an attack on the Second Amendment. It seems a logical antigun tactic to me. if you cant lawfully prevent the sale of guns. then you go after the people who sell guns and make them afraid to sell their lawful products for fear of incurring substantial financial liability. Thus far. these frivolous and meritless lawsuits have had little success in court. Their only success is in placing an enormous financial burden on gun manufacturers. However. these litigation costs are then passed onto consumers and makes it more difficult for lawabiding citizens to own guns. In the end. the ones who suffer the most are lawabiding consumers. H.R. 1036 would help protect our second amendment rights by protecting legitimate businesses that comply with Federal. State and local gun laws. It is time to stop these frivolous lawsuits that threaten to bankrupt a responsible American industry by blaming the firearm industry for the actions of criminals.

The federal government has made significant commitments. but unfortunately these have been more show than substance. The most recent example is the budget for the homeland security appropriations. I know from my own experience that there are vast unmet needs in every community around the country. and Oregon is no exception. The federal government should be helping communities to pay for the costly precautions that local governments must take to respond to high level security alerts. the effects of which ripple through crippled local budgets. We have yet to make local governments whole from the federal government imposed shut down of airports following September 11th. There are vast and clear needs for the Coast Guard which this budget virtually ignores. We are lavishing hundreds of billions in tax relief for those who need it the least when we are investing billions of dollars in questionable military expenditures. like theater missile defense or Star Wars. It inexcusable that we do not do a better job of listening to and meeting the needs of our local communities around the country. I. in good conscience. find it very hard to vote for this appropriation and hope that we will send the message that Congress should step up and make its action match its rhetoric and the need.",

The fact. however. is that to date the federal government has spent $20.8 billion for our nations first responders. and we will continue to fund what is necessary to ensure they have the training. equipment and resources necessary to do their job. We in this House know full well that money spent does not simply translate into increased preparedness. This in only a start. and we must continue to be vigilant in not only appropriating adequate funds. but ensuring that these funds are administered strategically as part of a comprehensive plan to address our nations vulnerabilities and needs. We must remember that while the Department of Homeland Security develops our national homeland security strategy. the implementation and the ultimate success of that strategy rests with our state and local governments. In closing. Mr. Chairman. the protection of the American citizens is the first and foremost duty of the federal government. and this Congress will continue to work with the Administration. and our states and localities to this end.

Originally. this program permitted those certified as lowrisk travelers to cross the Mexican border on an expedited basis for 1 year. However. in order to accommodate the unexpected increases in enrollment in that program following 911. Customs and Border Protection in February 2003 extended the enrollment period to 2 years. That had the effect of benefiting both participants in the program and the government by reducing paperwork and made the annual enrollment fee a biennial fee. But current enrollees had their eligibility automatically extended for 2 years from the date of their last enrollment and the applications backlog that was being blamed for increased waits at the border has been greatly reduced. So I do not think the problem is as bad as it perhaps was at the outset. Number two. we took $333 million in the 2003 wartime supplemental and gave that to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. We have not received their spend plans on how they intend to use those funds. The Department. however. could. I would remind the gentleman. could use a portion of the supplemental to support the SENTRI expansion. They do have some discretion. Number three. and the gentleman alluded to this. We have already cut the funds for the Departments administration by 25 percent. The moneys he would take with this amendment would come out of administration. We have already cut them past the bone almost. Additional reductions could reduce the basic departmental administration programs and impair their ability to fulfill management of the entire agency.

But in the bill before us we already reduce the number of screeners by another 4.600 in fiscal 2004. and that is on top of the 6.000 screeners that will be laid off between now and September of this year. That would be a reduction from current levels. roughly. of some 10.600 less than we have now. In the 2002 bill. when it was in Transportation. we capped the number of screeners at 45.000. This cut the gentleman would make would take us well below that cap. This further reduction of $20 million from the screener fund would require them to lay off another 500 to 1.000 screeners on top of what I just mentioned. That would take us well below the 45.000 level that we had set now for the 2 or 3 years in the Congress as the maximum level at TSA. The monies the gentleman would take from TSA he would give to the first responders. and heavens knows we want to give them all we can. but in this bill. as the gentleman mentioned. we are already $1 billion for first responders above what the President requested. and some $200 million plus above what the current level of spending for first responders is.

Its democratic structure has been strongly established as evidence by three national elections since 1990. Croatia has a wide range of political parties and a critical and independent press.

I still believe that this is an appropriate matter to be considered in the Senate. and was looking forward to a constructive debate on the legislation this week. In meetings with both supporters and opponents of the legislation I have continually stressed that there needs to be a fair and open debate on the matter. To me. this means that Senators must be allowed to offer amendments to the bill. Unfortunately. even before the debate had even really begun. the majority leader came to the floor and created a procedural situation where no Senator would be allowed to offer an amendment. on class action reform or any other issue. It is regrettable that this path was chosen for consideration of this legislation. I find this to be especially true when the minority leader has offered to limit the number of amendments to the legislation. even though he opposes the bill. If the Republican leadership had accepted this offer we could have been working on substance rather than discussing procedure for the last few days. As this debate has not been free or fair. in fact no amendments have been considered. debated and voted upon. I cannot at this time support limiting debate on the Class Action Fairness Act.

Mr. Couzens graduated as a pilot and was commissioned as a second lieutenant to fly P47 fighter planes. In early 1944. Mr. Couzens arrived in England to fight on the front lines in the European Theatre alongside the 8th Infantry and 356th Fighter Group. His units assignment was to control an area along the English Channel. Their purpose was to escort and protect B17s and B24s on bombing missions to Germany and other occupied countries. r On April 23. 1944. Mr. Couzens was assigned to destroy German airplanes on the ground. His target that day was the airfield at Haguenau. France. On his third pass over the airfield. he was hit by German antiaircraft fire. The hit was so substantial it stopped the engine of his plane. forcing him to \"Belly in.\" While he was fortunate enough to land alive. the group commander and another pilot were shot down. For a little over a year. Mr. Couzens was a prisoner of the Germans at the famous Stalag Luft III Camp. He endured one of the coldest winters in decades and finally saw freedom when they were liberated on April 29. 1945. and became part of General Pattons Third Army. Thank you. Mr. Couzens for defending freedom and democracy. The heroics you and your comrades displayed will forever be remembered. you truly are the Greatest Generation.",

I want to commend the work of the cosponsors of this legislation. the Representative of Florida. and Representative of New York. Your leadership on this issue has been remarkable and I commend your efforts. It is a tragedy for Americans in need of bone marrow or stem cell donation to remain unconnected with willing donors. The National Bone Marrow Donor Registry has helped connect thousands of Americans in need of assistance with donors across the country. The additional resources this bill authorizes will help us expand this network and save even more lives. I want to particularly commend the Registrys effort to recruit minority donors for their database. Blood diseases extract an especially heavy toll on minority populations. and improving the diversity of the donor pool should be an important part of our response to this problem. Mr. Speaker. I want to commend the efforts of St. Lukes Hospital in Kansas City. Their Kansas City Blood and Marrow transplant program recruits new donors. finds matches. and coordinates the donation process. Since its inception in 1996. the Transplant Center at St. Lukes has performed over 450 transplants and connected thousands in our region with needed care. As a result of their hard work. the Center has been named a member of the United Resource Network centers of excellence program. These courageous efforts save thousands of lives each year. I congratulate them for being a model to our Nation. Mr. Speaker. this bipartisan legislation is vital. I urge my colleagues to join me today in support of H.R. 3034.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3034. the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry Reauthorization Act. Today we are able to prolong hope for so many individuals waiting for a match to their bone marrow by reauthorizing the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry for another five years. For many people waiting for a transplant due to various illnesses. the task of finding a donor is a long and costly process. Each year twothirds of patients awaiting bone marrow transplants are unsuccessful in finding a match within their family. This is why the establishment of a national registry was crucial. About seventy percent of leukemia and other blood disorder patients do not find a match within their family. A match would be someone with certain white blood cells. called antigens. which are similar or identical to the patients. These transplants enable patients the opportunity to live a full life. whereas without the transplant they would have little or no chance of survival. From the organization of a donor registry through the United States Navy in 1986 to this current extension of the National Registry. it is clear that Congress takes this issue to heart. Each member of this House has someone in their district who has been touched by one of the debilitating diseases that need a bone marrow transplant. often as a last option. Mr. Speaker. in closing. I would like to thank Chairman YOUNG for his leadership on the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry Reauthorization Act. Because of his familys own experience with the seriousness of bone marrow transplants. he has emerged as a leader in the issue and is committed to the cause. I urge all my colleagues to support this important reauthorization.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 3034 which reauthorizes the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. I commend Chairman YOUNG for his leadership in this critical program. Through his efforts in establishing the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry he has given countless people another chance at life. Through the recruitment of the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). which manages the Registry. patients there are over 5 million potential donors. Through NMDP outreach efforts in 19 countries. patients have access to an additional 2.5 million potential donors. In fact. approximately 40 percent of transplants facilitated by NMDP involves a U.S. patient receiving stem cells from an international donor or an international donor receiving stems cells from a U.S. donor. The importance of the Registry cannot be overstated and I commend and fully support the efforts of the National Marrow Donor Program for their recruitment efforts. especially for their efforts to recruit potential donors from diverse racial or ethnic groups. The critical need for donors of AfricanAmerican. Asian/Pacific Islander. Hispanic. American Indian/Alaska Native descent was made clear to me by the story of a fiveyearold little girl from Guam whose life was cut short by leukemia. Her name was Justice Taitague. Her best chance for life was a marrow transplant from a member of her ethnic group. The donor list at the time could not provide a match. but everyone involved in her care would not give up. Through the efforts of Dr. Thomas Shieh. the Guam Medical Society. and the National and Hawaiian Marrow Donor Programs. the first ever marrow drive on Guam was held on her behalf. This \"Drive for Justice\" registered thirtyfour hundred volunteers in just three days. Tragically. she passed away less than a week after the drive. But her life has given hope to others of Asian/Pacific Island descent needing a stemcell transplant and helped us to understand the importance of the National Marrow Donor Program. Mr. Speaker. I fully support H.R. 3034 to reauthorize the National Marrow Donor Registry. There is still a critical need for donors from the Asian. Pacific Islander and other minority communities to give the gift of life. Join the Registry.",

They are also used to keep pets healthy. which contributes to the quality of life for millions of companion animal owners. The Food and Drug Administrations Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is currently experiencing unprecedented delays in its review of new product submissions. The delays are severe and problematic for the submission sponsors. for CVM. and for veterinarians. livestock and poultry producers. and pet owners in need of new and innovative products to combat animal diseaseat a time when animal disease around the world is capturing headlines. The deadlock at the Center also has a chilling effect on the animal health industrys investment in important research and development. threatening the pipeline of products that will be important to livestock and poultry producers in managing their production in the future. The lack of these tools imperils not only animal health but also has implications for the food supply and food safety. In 1966 Congress. with industry support. enacted the Animal Drug Availability Act to streamline drug review and approval procedures. Contrary to Congressional intent and despite additional resources. it is now more difficult than ever to get new products approved. Unfortunately. this situation is detrimental to veterinarians. to livestock and poultry producers. to food producers and to the public. As a result. it is important for Congress and the Administration to take action to ensure that the CVM can better manage its resources and personnel and make institutional changes to fulfill its mandated mission and responsibilities. Modeled after the successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act. the Animal Drug User Fee Act will increase efficiencies in review times for new animal pharmaceuticals by providing CVM with additional resources to allow for improved communication between FDA and product sponsors and more expeditious FDA actions on applications. Mr. Speaker.

Fort Detrick is one of the most important lines of defense should we ever be attacked with a chemical or biological weapon. Since 1969. it has been our Nations lead laboratory for the medical aspects of biological warfare defense. The September 11 attacks used civilian airplanes as weapons of mass destruction. but it raises the specter of a terrorist attack that would use a chemical. biological. or nuclear weapon against us. I hope such an attack never occurs. but if it does. the men and women of Fort Detrick are devoted to improving the ways to quickly detect the use of chemical or biological weapons. halt the spread of chemical and biological agents as quickly as possible. and treat the victims of the attack. But the mission of Fort Detrick goes beyond just protecting against chemical or biological attack. Fort Detrick has played a leading role in protecting our Nation and other nations against all types of infectious diseases. They helped identify the West Nile Virus several summers ago. and they created a vaccine in the 1980s that probably saved the lives of thousands of Argentinians from an agricultural virus. Fort Detrick has been a world leader in research of microbiology. biochemistry. botany. and other scientific disciplines that are necessary to understanding how to detect and treat lethal viruses. Fort Detrick also serves as home to one of the two campuses of the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. This NIH campus is internationally recognized for its contribution to cancer and AIDS research. The mission of Fort Detrick goes beyond research as well. Since 1974. all medical logistical support of global military operations is planned and managed by Fort Detrick.

I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) for his patience with trying to get this bankruptcy legislation through in a form that can be supported across the board and in fact in a form where it deals with the issue of bankruptcy. The Congress has been working on this legislation for a number of years. actually since before I got here. and this passage of this bill is long overdue. Since Congress began working on this legislation. bankruptcy filings continue to rise. In fact. data recently released by the Administrative Office of United States Courts showed personal bankruptcies continued to rise at a recordsetting pace of 7.4 percent last year. Some of this is necessary. Some of this is abuse of the bankruptcy system. It has had a negative impact on our economy. amounting to a loss of $110 million a day. The abuse of the bankruptcy code continues with opportunistic filings and abusive loopholes in the code. One most notable. as I serve on the Committee on Financial Services. dealing with corporate crooks. this bill closes the mansion loophole for greedy corporate culprits. Under current bankruptcy law. debtors living in certain States can shield from their creditors virtually all of the equity in their homes. That includes a $3 million estate. Congress spent a considerable amount of time discussing the issue of corporate responsibility. and this bill closes that loophole to continue the work we began last year. Some debtors have moved to particular States in order to take advantage of this loophole. This bill closes the loophole. It requires those debtors to reside in the State for at least 2 years before they can claim a homestead exemption. they have to have owned that home for at least 40 months: and most importantly. it caps the amount at $125.000. a reasonable amount for a family to keep a roof over their heads. but certainly not $3 million that they can just save from their prosecution. This legislation also helps women and children in bankruptcy. It prioritizes the collection and payment of spousal and child support. giving them the highest payment priority under the bankruptcy law. The legislation also allows child and domestic violence proceedings to continue. notwithstanding the debtors filing for bankruptcy protection.

The administration has endorsed this legislation. The House has voted affirmatively on five separate occasions to pass this bill. Today we are reconsidering this bill in an attempt to reignite a stalled process. We must take action. Americas bankruptcy system is. in fact. broken. It gets worse every day with more filings that break record after record. putting an enormous strain on the judiciarys resources. I have seen numbers that indicate the exponential growth to the number of bankruptcy filings.

This loss translates into a $400 annual tax on every household in our Nation in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates.

Let me just correct a couple of things that have been put out here that seem to me to need correction. First of all. child support and alimony are already nondischargeable and all of the womens and childrens advocacy groups oppose this bill. So do not be misled by this claim that somehow or another this bill is going to do something to help womens and childrens advocacy groups with child support. Second. the implication has been made that there is somehow a cap on the homestead exemption in this bill. and that is not the case. We tried to get one on several occasions. It has never worked. It has always failed. And so anybody who is proceeding on the assumption that there is some kind of cap in this bill should dissuade themselves of that notion. Having made those corrections and comments. Mr. Chairman. I presume the gentleman from Wisconsin will have the last word. I encourage my colleagues to vote against the bill on the grounds that it will play Russian roulette with family farmers.

Unless we take action. consumers will continue to be negatively impacted by the current system and fraudulent filings will continue to be rewarded rather than discouraged. In 1980. 300.000 bankruptcy petitions were filed. This past year. over 1.2 million were reported during just the first nine months. Many of these filings are legitimate attempts by debtors to pay their debts and obtain a fresh start. However. bankruptcy is too often used as a way to avoid responsibilities. Unnecessary Bankruptcy filings continue to increase at dramatic rates. This is bad for consumers and bad for our economy. The costs of these filings are passed on to Americas businesses and consumers. who should not have to absorb these debts. We must ensure that debtors actually belong in bankruptcy and are not using the system to avoid their obligations.

Rosie the Riveters slogan of \"we can do it\" helped mobilize millions of American women who sowed the seeds for the womens rights movement. During World War II. as more and more American men were sent off to battle. over 6 million women did their part to ease the hardship for America by taking over jobs that had been previously exclusively male. Rosies filled the void in Americas workforce by working under very poor conditions for very little pay in factories doing welding. machining. building aircrafts. fixing tanks and armament factories. Although the average Rosie the Riveters salary was $31.21 a week for her labor. as compared to $54.56 a week for the men that still remained. these women fought social discrimination. gender harassment. and physical abuse. Rosie the Riveters image of a strong. competent woman was a symbol of patriotic womanhood. Rosies all over the country showed their strength and their power and their pride.

Among other provisions. H.R. 1086 amends the NCRA to limit the recovery of antitrust damages against SDOs if the organizations predisclose the nature and scope of their standards development activity to the proper antitrust authorities. H.R. 1086 also amends the NCRA to include SDOs in the framework of NCRA that awards reasonable attorneys fees to the substantially prevailing party. The provisions of H.R. 1086 protect SDOs. and in turn. SDOs help protect consumers and the public. SDOs are nonprofit organizations that establish voluntary industry standards. These standards ensure competition within various industries. promote manufacturing compatibility. and reduce the risk that consumers will be stranded with a product that is incompatible with products from other manufacturers. The nature of the standards development process requires competing companies to bring their competitive ideas to the voluntary standards development process. When one of the companies believes its market position has been compromised by the standards development process that company will likely resort to litigation. It is not uncommon for the SDO to be named as a Defendant. For nonprofit organizations like SDOs. litigation can be very costly and disruptive to their operations. and treble antitrust damages can be financially crippling. Under H.R. 1086. the recovery of damages against SDOs is limited if the organizations predisclose the nature and scope of their standards development activity to the proper antitrust authorities. Furthermore. SDOs are only liable for treble damages under antitrust laws if they fail to disclose the nature and scope of their voluntary standards setting activity. H.R. 1086 strikes a good balance. It does not grant SDOs full antitrust immunity. but it provides SDOs with protection from treble damages when they provide proper disclosure. H.R. 1086 also benefits the consumer. It enables the SDOs to develop industry standards that promote price competition. intensify corporate rivalry. and encourage the development of new products.

This legislation updates the ban on steroids to include the several steroid precursors which have been developed since the 1990 ban on steroids went into effect. These precursors have been shown to cause the same reaction in the body as other steroids. and they are just as dangerous in terms of side effects and longterm damage potential. Yet. currently. they are not illegal. and they are widely used by athletes and others seeking to enhance muscle and body development. In addition to being directly ingested. these dangerous drugs are also being consumed as parts of presently legal. overthecounter nutrition and dietary supplements. Of course. the most important concern driving the bill is the impact these drugs and precursors have on children. Some young athletes are using the drugs with the belief that they can become great in their sport and gain money and fame. However. in addition to risking disqualification from playing sports. they also risk stunted growth. infertility and other longterm health problems and even death. While we must ensure that these dangerous new drugs and precursors do not get in the hands of children or others who would use them improperly. we must also be aware that these same drugs have legitimate uses. If made available for legitimate prescriptions by physicians. they could treat conditions such as body wasting with patients with AIDS and other diseases that result in loss of muscle mass. So.

This legislation. which the Committee on Energy and Commerce had sequential jurisdiction on and was marked up in April in the Committee on Energy and Commerce. would add several of these new products to the list of banned substances and provide increased penalty for any individual who traffics in steroids within 1.000 feet of an athletic facility.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I strongly support the legislative proposal under consideration today. Without a doubt. H.R. 3866. the \"Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004.\" represents a major step in the right direction. First. the bill highlights the serious nature of trafficking in steroid precursors by increasing the criminal penalties associated with their distribution. particularly near a sports facility. Its worth noting that this outcome was achieved without the use of mandatory minimums. Instead. the bill was drafted in such a way so as to leave sentencing determinations solely to the discretion of the judge--with the more egregious offenders being exposed to harsher sentences. Second. the bill amends the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 by adding steroid precursors such as androstenedione. \"andro\" and its chemical cousins to the list of anabolic steroids controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. It also makes it easier for the DEA to add similar substances to that list in the future. Scientific evidence shows that these performanceenhancing drugs create real and significant health risks. Potential longterm consequences of these products in men include impotence and the development of breast enlargement. While some women who use these products experience male pattern baldness. increased facial hair. and abnormal menstrual bleeding. And. most troubling of all. innocent children who are exposed to these products risk early onset of puberty and stunted growth. Finally. the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review the Federal sentencing guidelines for crimes involving anabolic steroids and consider increasing them. Currently. the maximum sentence for offenses involving anabolic steroids is only 3341 months for first time offenders. And to receive the maximum sentence an offender would have to have between 40.000 and 60.000 units. which is defined as a 10 cc vial or 50 tablets. Saving children is the ultimate goal of this legislation. About 1 out of 40 highschool seniors reported that they had used andro in the past year. according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 2002 Monitoring the Future survey. which tracks drug use among students.

These procedural protections which ensure the revenue generated by aviation taxes will be dedicated solely to aviation improvements have had a substantial and positive effect on Federal investment levels in aviation. In the first year of AIR 21 alone. funding for the Airport Improvement Program increased by $1.3 billion. Funding for the Facilities and Equipment Program increased by $700 million in the first year. This bill maintains a strong focus on safety. It sets us on a path that will allow us to accommodate the continued growth of the system that we expect and we desire. So I thank the gentleman from Alaska and the gentleman from Florida for their efforts in getting this bill to the floor. And I would like to take note of my appreciation for their inclusion of a provision affecting our air traffic controllers and flight attendants. Once again. I urge a positive vote on this measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 2115. A vibrant and strong aviation industry is critical to our Nations longterm economic growth. Over 10 million people are employed directly in the aviation industry. For every job in the aviation industry. 15 related jobs are produced. The aviation industry accounts for over $800 billion of the countrys gross domestic product. Just as the aviation industry is a catalyst for growth in the national economy. airports are a catalyst of growth for their local communities. Airports create over $500 billion in economic activity and directly employ 1.9 million people. Almost 2 million people a day and 38.000 tons of cargo pass through our Nations airports each day. The aviation industry is important to me and my constituents in the 26th district of Texas. The DallasFort Worth Airport and American Airlines are headquartered in my congressional district. In my district alone. the aviation industry directly and indirectly employs over 50.000 people. Aviation also links our Nations citizens and communities to the national and world marketplace. Without access to integrated air transportation networks. communities cannot attract the investment necessary to grow or allow homegrown businesses to expand. A modern and fully funded aviation network is fundamental to making sure that all Americans can participate fully in the economy. Airports are economic development engines. Airport development is a real economic stimulus that creates both immediate jobs and longterm economic development. Once this bill is enacted. my constituents will have the tools and resources necessary to attract even more air servicerelated economic development. and most importantly. further expand their connections to the national and global economy. Mr. Chairman. the FAA reauthorization bill meets the challenges facing our Nations aviation system: increasing security. expanding airport safety and capacity. and making sure all of our Nations communities have access to the network. I strongly support H.R. 2115 and look forward to its passage today. F1 1415",

I rise today in strong support of the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. and I want to commend the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Oregon because they have stressed so specifically the need for security in our airports. and they have worked diligently on that subject in terms of their leadership. Working in a bipartisan manner. the committee has done an admirable job forging reasonable compromises on many issues. In the past 18 months. the Congress and the American people have made airport security and airline stabilization the primary focuses of aviation policy. and it is fitting to focus on our aviation capacity and safety needs again. The Airport Improvement Program funding authorized in this bill will have the added benefit of putting people to work in a time of 6.1 percent unemployment. One issue that remains a top priority for me is funding for the national airspace redesign in the operations and maintenance account. With a national airspace that looks as if it was designed in the time of the Wright brothers. AIR 21 did a good job of providing funds to stop the comprehensive design. H.R. 2115 allows that work to continue. In 1998. FAA administrator Jane Garvey came to Newark airport and announced that the National Airspace Redesign would begin in the New York/ New Jersey/Philadelphia region. I know that the FAA is still working on that segment of the design. and they hope to have a draft environmental impact statement next year. The completion of the redesign will benefit Newark Liberty International Airport immensely by reducing delays. and it could potentially benefit New Jersey residents with air noise reduction. Let me reiterate a point included in the committee report. if I may. that reminds the FAA that environmental streamlining provisions in the legislation have not been drafted to undermine the National Environmental Policy Act and we also worked that out. I urge the House to improve this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. I also want to commend the distinguished chairman for his good work on this bill. Mr. Chairman. I rise today in support of this bill. In December of 1903. on the sands of Kitty Hawk. North Carolina. the Wright brothers achieved the milestone of manned. controlled. powered flight. and with that historic first flight. the aviation age was born. Since that time. the Federal Aviation Administration has developed alongside the aviation industry. We are here today obviously working on a 4year reauthorization of that government agency. The FAA does a lot of good things. but like every government agency. the FAA needs to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. While the Subcommittee on Aviation was considering this bill. we heard from the General Accounting Office about $5.4 million in government credit card. also known as purchase cards. abuses by the employees of the FAA. Some examples of that abuse include purchase of Palm Pilots and accessories such as keyboards and leather cases from Coach costing almost $67.000. They also uncovered individual subscriptions to Internet service providers totaling $17.000. store gift cards to places like Home Depot. WalMart. and there are several other examples. In their report. the GAO made a number of recommendations to strengthen FAAs internal controls of this purchase card program and decrease wasteful spending and improve accountability. I offered an amendment during consideration of this bill to direct the FAA administrator to implement the GAOs recommendations and then report back to Congress in 1 year and tell us how they are doing. and I am happy to report that the amendment was adopted. Mr. Chairman. I believe we need to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars. and this small step will lead us in the right direction. The FAA is committed to a sound purchase card program and is taking action to strengthen controls. but we have an obligation to ensure that the FAA takes the necessary steps to manage their purchase card program responsibly. Mr. Chairman. I think this is a good bill. and I urge my colleagues to support it today.",

Over the last several weeks. I have heard from aviation repair stations in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that have told horror stories about the manufacturers refusing to make critical maintenance data available. I was contacted by one repair facility located in the Fort Worth area that has had firsthand experience with the probivin that section 420 seeks to remedy. In 1999. one of the manufacturers whose products the facility is authorized to maintain was charging just under $5.000 to keep three maintenance manuals current for 3 years. Now that same manufacturer is charging more than $20.000 to keep those manuals current for just 1 year. That price increase is outrageous and unwarranted. and this is just one example of aviation manufacturers taking advantage of the small businesses. and small businesses hire more people in Texas than any other type of business. Mr. Chairman. we cannot sit by and allow manufacturers to deny access to critical maintenance information. so that we can keep our planes safe for the skies. We cannot sit by as the FAA fails to enforce its own regulations. Section 420 will remedy this situation if it is allowed. and. in turn. we will improve aviation safety and security.",

Air transportation is essential to cities being competitive in a global economy and being integrated into the national transportation framework. It is time for us to start making plans for what the role of airports should be in the future so that they do not pose a threat to livability and are truly integrated with other modes of transportation. The managers amendment contains two items I think can help point the way towards better. longterm integration among aviation. rail. and surface modes. First. there is an effort to clarify and publicize how passenger facility charges can be used to assist in the development of ground access projects. For too many people. the worst part of the trip is trying to get to and from the airport. Second. there is a provision that requires plans for airport and runway construction and expansion to be shared between the airports and the metropolitan planning organizations. Currently. there is no guarantee that the aviation and surface transportation agencies are even talking to each other. let alone actually planning together. A sound transportation process includes all the players and respects their obligations and responsibilities. and it will work to the benefit of all. Twelve years ago. with the ISTEA legislation. Congress started a revolution in how our communities transportation services are provided. It gave local communities more flexibility and provided strong signals that it made sense to plan comprehensively and to work intermodally. It is time for us to think about the next step of the transportation revolution as it relates to aviation. and extend these concepts to the other interrelated modes of rail. aviation and surface transportation. I appreciate the courtesy of the subcommittee in including these provisions in the bill to at least start some cooperation between the modes. and hopefully in the future we can break down those barriers further and make more progress to truly having an integrated. seamless transportation system with airplanes. the critical role that we know that it needs for tomorrows future.",

I thank the gentleman from Florida and the committee staff for the opportunity to be here today and for the quality piece of legislation that addresses many important concerns back home to the State of Kansas. I am grateful for the opportunity that we have had to work together. particularly in regard to Essential Air Service reform. This is maybe the most significant reform we have had since this program was created 25 years ago. The EAS provisions included in this bill give small and rural communities a greater role in the EAS process. Besides preserving its funding. it will also allow small communities to better tailor their local air service to their unique individual needs. It is vital small communities across the country remain connected to the national air network. This legislation also provides increased funding for the AIP. Airport Improvement Program. that is essential in maintaining our Nations airports. both large and small. and continues funding for our Nations contract tower program. a vital program that improves the safety for small community airports. Mr. Chairman. one section of the bill that remains a concern to me is section 420 that addresses the availability of maintenance information. This provision has some economic ramifications for aviation manufacturers. We discussed this issue in the full committee markup. and I appreciate my colleagues continued involvement and his responsiveness to the issue I have raised. The managers amendment that the gentleman has offered will address some of the concerns. However. a couple of key safety and liability issues remain to be resolved. Mr. Chairman. as my colleagues know.

My purpose in rising today as this bill goes forward is simply to highlight the absolute dependence on some parts of our country on air service. and thus the absolute importance of the essential air services portion of the law and of this bill. and also the necessity as we go forward of avoiding onesizefitsall thinking when we deal with the problems of our rural communities in addressing EAS. In fact. imagine a district in which air service is truly indispensable to providing the basic necessities. to transporting residents. to providing emergency medical service. and to the survival and prosperity of our number one industry. tourism. and several other important industries based on. for example. agricultural exports. That is Hawaii today. and that is my second district. a district that has all of Hawaii other than urban Honolulu and is composed of seven inhabited islands. It is absolutely unique. Let me give an example of how this fits into onesizefitsall thinking. A great deal of discussion is given in essential air services to how far airports are apart from each other. and both the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Pennsylvania are offering amendments which I fully support which deal with how far is an airport. Well. the airport on Molokai is somewhere around 40 miles from Honolulu International Airport. Not too far. but there is no road. No road. It is on another island. so we have to think about unique circumstances. The options are nonexistent. no driving. no highways. no rail. no trains. no Amtrak subsidies. no ferries. cannot do that. It is airplane. period. We are also in a very difficult period of adjustment in our interisland air travel. One airline is now in bankruptcy so we face the possibility of a monopoly with fees increasing and capacity reducing. We do have EAS designation for three extremely rural airports in Hawaii. and that is very appropriate. but I could easily make the argument that all Hawaii airports. big or small. rural or urban. are essentially EAS airports. In conclusion. I simply want to highlight the absolute necessity of EAS to States like Hawaii.",

He represents 75 square miles with LaGuardia in the middle. My district spans the distance from Washington. D.C. to Chicago. Washington. D.C. to Chicago. We have eight communities. When I travel back to my district. it takes me 7 hours to get to my district by air. I jump in a car. and just to get to one of the communities to have a listening session on an Indian reservation. it takes me another 6 hours to drive. We need essential air. This country made a commitment in rail many years ago. It made a commitment in our interstate system many years ago. and it made a commitment to essential air service. I cannot think of a more appropriate name than essential air service. When I came to Congress. I said I want to know about other peoples districts so I know what kinds of things they are confronted with. I can see the problem between islands that the gentleman from Hawaii spoke about. People cannot swim necessarily between islands. Do you want grandmother and grandpa driving 324 miles to get to the hospital? They have no alternatives. They cannot get on Amtrak. they cannot call a cab and ride 324 miles to see their doctor. We need essential air service.

Let me quote again some excerpts that I think are very revealing about the attitude of this White House and this administration towards this institution and towards a shroud of secrecy that has been unparalleled in our history. \"Republican Senators gathering last Wednesday for their first session retreat should have been happy. blessed with a regained majority and a popular President. They were not. Instead. they complained bitterly of arrogance by the Bush administration. especially the Pentagon. in treatment of Congress all along the road to war. It informed the White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card that there were grievances from President Bushs Senate base. that it is ignored and insulted by the administration. particularly by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in preparing for the war against Iraq. Recitals of complaints began with Senator JOHN WARNER. a pillar of the Senate GOP establishment. WARNER had his colleagues attention when he addressed Card. I will not tolerate. he boomed. a continuation of what has been going on over the last 2 years. He cited cavalier treatment that denies information even to the venerable top Senate Republican on Armed Services. \"Next up was Senator PAT ROBERTS. a former Marine officer who has spent the last 40 years on Capitol Hill. ROBERTS. a plainspoken midwesterner from Kansas. is the new Senate Intelligence Committee Chair. He told Andrew Card to mark him down agreeing with everything WARNER just said. Senator KIT BOND of Missouri got up next and repeated similar concerns.\" So this is not a partisan attack on the President.

One fourth of all Medicare beneficiaries live in rural areas. and they are getting the short end of the stick. Rural hospitals are closing. and there are not enough rural hospitals to begin with. Twentyfive percent. as I said. 25 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries live in rural areas. 90 percent of all physician specialists practice in urban areas. Senior and disabled Americans who need care simply are not getting it in time. That is more than a problem. It is a tragedy. Because of the high proportion of elderly in rural areas. Medicare plays a particularly important role in those areas. Inadequate Medicare reimbursement means inadequate access. There is no cushion. Our responsibility to rural Medicare enrollees is the same as our responsibility to urban Medicare enrollees. They paid in Medicare throughout their working years in exchange for health care security during their retirement. It is the covenant between the Government and its people. Now that those people are retired. their health care should be reliable. It should be affordable. It should be easily accessible. To meet that responsibility. we need to pay rural providers enough to stay in business. It is that simple. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker the House bill tries to have it both ways. It invests in rural hospitals. That is good. Then it squeezes blood from them by cutting reimbursement across the board. One cannot do it both ways. It makes no sense. no sense. to undermine our own efforts to help rural providers and by extension rural beneficiaries. the whole point. by simultaneously increasing and then cutting hospital reimbursement. not to mention the negative impact on urban and suburban hospitals. This motion. the Stenholm motion. simply instruct conferees to eliminate the hospital cut. This motion instructs conferees to ensure that no senior ends up without access to prescription drug benefits. That is what this whole exercise is all about.

I am not. but we know these HMOs and these private plans are not working. for the most part. and if someone tries to get their prescription drugs through an HMO or managed care private plan. in many cases it is not going to be available. and they are not going to have access to it. It is the Republicans that basically are trying to impose an ideology and saying we must privatize. we must go this route. this is no alternative. All the gentleman from Texas is saying is in a situation where the HMOs or the private plans are not available. we still have to guarantee drug coverage for those seniors in those rural areas that cannot get it through these private HMOs or other private plans. So let us have the Senate fallback that says you can get your prescription drugs through traditional Medicare. Now. I just do not understand why the Republicans keep insisting from an ideological point of view. well. we cannot do that. you have to privatize. They went so far as to suggest we have private contractors that provide Medicare services now. but that is the Federal Government as the ultimate insurer contract with some private company to provide the service. What you have done in this House bill is say that if you as an individual cannot find a private plan. you are out of luck. All the gentleman from Texas",

You can argue about it. but there is no denying that it will happen. Somebody will die in rural America. because if this House bill goes through. you are going to see acute care hospitals in rural areas close. not to mention the fact that there are people involved.

I rise today to join my colleagues in expressing my support for the brave men and women who are risking their lives to defend our Nation. I rise to urge my colleagues to express that support by voting in favor of my motion to instruct conferees. When hostilities broke out in Iraq. the first military member to die in combat was Marine Lance Corporal Jose Gutierrez. an immigrant from Guatemala who volunteered to serve his adopted country. He died an American hero. but he did not die an American citizen. Lance Corporal Gutierrez was only the first of 13 noncitizen soldiers killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Thousands of noncitizen soldiers are currently serving in Iraq. and only 37.000 are noncitizen soldiers who serve in the Nations Armed Forces. The motion I am offering today expresses the continued support of the House for the Armed Forces Naturalization Act which passed. by the way. on June 4 by a vote of 414 to 5. The House has already gone on record in support of the bill to give immigrants serving in our Armed Forces more rapid naturalization and to establish protections for their families if they are killed in action. The 37.000 immigrant soldiers have already met the same rigorous evaluation as U.S. citizens before their enlistment. In fact. the militarys criteria are more challenging than the naturalization requirements demanded by the Department of Homeland Security. Besides meeting the qualifications for military service. noncitizen soldiers have passed an even more important test: they have proven their loyalty to the United States by pledging to defend our Nation and our values with their bodies. their minds. and their lives. Their service in defense of our Nation and our country and their willingness to put their lives on the line speaks to their devotion to the United States. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this small token of gratitude as a demonstration to these 37.000 Americans who are brave soldiers. to show that we appreciate their patriotism. Mr. Speaker.

I am here today to join my colleagues in asking the House conferees of the Defense Authorization bill to accept the Citizenship for Americas troops provision that Senator KENNEDY included in the Senates bill. Ever since the war against Saddam Hussein began. politicians and commentators have noted that many brave soldiers were risking their lives for America despite the fact that they are not citizens. As many have pointed out. some of these noncitizen soldiers were among the first brave men and women to fall. Some were born in Mexico before joining the U.S. militarylike Pfc. Francisco Martinez Flores. Cpl. Jose Angel Garibay and Lance Cpl. Jesus Suarez del Solar. Others were born in Guatemalalike Lance Cpl. Jose Gutierrez. But all died fighting for a country where they couldnt even cast a vote. Of course. this is not a new problem. In the last Congressin May of 2002. to be preciseI first introduced legislation to help remove the obstacles these brave soldiers face on their path to citizenship. And I reintroduced my bill in this Congress one week before our country went to war in Iraq. But months and months have passed. and still this Congress has not acted. So while the citizenship provision in the Senate bill is not identical to my original legislation. I fully support it. It is the quickest way to honor the brave soldiers who have shown the willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for the country they dearly wish to be citizens of. Members of the military who risk their lives to defend this Nation deserve better than the bureaucratic and financial burdens that now stand between them and citizenship. And they deserve better than the waiting game theyve had to endure since I first proposed legislation like this more than a year ago. So. Mr. Speaker. I again urge the House managers to not play politics with this issue. Accept the Kennedy language and do the right thing for our troops. It is the only way to get this done in a timely fashion.

Mr. Speaker. this morning I rise in strong support of H.R. 2799. the bill providing appropriations for the Departments of Commerce. Justice. State. and the Judiciary. Mr. Speaker. I represent a district that lies along the U.S.-Mexican border. For many years. the region along the 2.000 mile stretch with Mexico has been ignored. The bill before us today will make tremendous strides to recognize the importance of increased resources to our southwest border. This bill before us includes 168 additional positions for the United States Marshal Service for areas of highpriority need. It also recognizes that the areas along the southwest border are in the greatest need for these positions. My district in El Paso lies within the western district of Texas. This judicial district has been one of the greatest impacted by a criminal caseload over the last decade. The majority of these cases are being heard in the El Paso Division of the Western District. The number of Federal cases filed in El Paso County alone has increased from 443 to over 2.100 cases since 1994. Last year. the El Paso Division received our second Federal judgeship. Currently pending before the Senate is a confirmation of an additional two Federal judges. Mr. Speaker. needless to say. our caseload is being addressed and more of our cases are being heard. This also increases the work of our judges which. in turn. means more work for our Marshal Service. Currently. our marshals are reporting inoperable workload levels in the southwest border districts. This bill would provide muchneeded relief for our United States Marshal Service along the southwest border districts. I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and to support passage of this bill.

This illadvised provision was never the subject of a hearing and has no support from law enforcement. Our gun laws are already riddled with loopholes that make it difficult for the ATF to do their job. And now we are going to make it even more difficult by preventing the bureau from requiring firearm dealers to conduct a physical inventory. from denying licenses to dealers whose sales fall below certain levels. and from demanding that certain dealers provide documentation for all used guns sold in a specific period. Why would we vote to make it easier for badapple dealers to sell guns illegally? Just a few months ago. this body provided them protection against lawsuits. and now we are going to make it even more difficult to ensure that gun dealers are not transferring guns illegally. We keep hearing from the gun lobby that we need to enforce the laws on the books instead of passing new laws. Well. at this pace. we are not going to be able to enforce any laws on the books. There will not be any laws to enforce. It is clear to me that the gun lobby will not be happy until our gun laws are rolled back to the era of Jesse James and the Wild West. I wonder if they realize that for every gun that illegally falls into the wrong hands. lives are at risk. especially our law enforcement officers. I urge the defeat of this rule so that we can strike the irresponsible language from the bill and. for once. look at the impact of rolling back our gun safety laws instead of bowing to the gun lobby.

The fact of the matter is. terrorism exists all over this country for those who live in the inner cities and are subjected to the random gun violence that plagues many of our neighborhoods. When people talk about homeland security in America. they are not talking about al Qaeda. they are talking about the gun dealers who knowingly sell guns in untold numbers. knowing full well that those guns can easily be resold in the back of a trunk of a car in downtown Washington. D.C. And what does this provision in this rule allow? This provision in this rule allows us to roll back those few safeguards that we already give law enforcement. to ensure that those guns that are sold are sold in a legal and proper manner. We often hear from the NRA. well. we are for lawabiding people being able to purchase lawabiding permits and guns. Well. apparently not. under this language. because what essentially they will do is make this language a criminals delight. because they will not have to cover their tracks. because there will not be any tracks for them to cover under this legislation. which eliminates any inventory provision for gun dealers to be able to ensure that the guns that they sell are guns that are sold legally and lawfully. The fact of the matter is that this legislation is protected under a rule that is supposed to be about appropriation bills. but. in this case. is about protecting an authorization for a loophole that puts our public at risk. puts our law enforcement at risk. and contradicts everything that we are standing for on this floor when it comes to protecting the American public.",

The bills language is a major step backwards when we should be doing more to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of criminals. A 1998 ATF study showed that over 50 percent of firearms used in crimes were traced back to just 1.2 percent of the Nations 104.000 gun dealers. One delinquent dealer in Tacoma. Washington. was missing 78 firearms listed on the stores inventory. including the rifle used by the D.C. area snipers last year. To address this problem. I have introduced H.R. 1540. the Crackdown on Deadbeat Gun Dealers Act. to increase ATF inspections of gun dealers. not eliminate them.

I commend Chairman YOUNG and Subcommittee Chairman WOLF for their hard work and can appreciate the tough decisions that accompanied the crafting of this bill.. especially given the current fiscal climate. It is my hope that Chairman YOUNG and Subcommittee Chairman WOLF will continue to weigh both the state of our economy and the safety of our Nation when they represent the House in conference with the Senate.",

It goes to the same issue. although this is not a sense of Congress. this is an amendment to the bill. It is designed specifically for the purpose of trying to identify those children who are truly in need of the services that we appropriate money for here. and distinguish them from those children who are not. but who are placed into these programs in evergreater numbers. thereby diluting the pool of resources available to serve children who are truly in need. This is a problem which has been with us since the beginning of this program. It was hoped it would be addressed in the reauthorization. That did not happen. The reauthorization does. in fact. what the gentleman from Rhode Island was asking for a minute ago. and that is emphasize early identification. and I am all for that. I do not believe that will change the problem. If children are being misidentified today. they will be misidentified earlier. That is the real problem. misidentification. not the time at which it happens. The problem is with it intrinsically. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Current definition includes disorders with psychological processes which have severe impact on learning and behavior. The Tancredo amendment creates a new and very narrow medical condition definition that would actually keep children from getting the special education services that they need. and they need those services so they can learn and be successful in school.

The TancredoGraves amendment seeks to address this problem which is driving up the cost of IDEA and putting misdiagnosed kids into special needs programs. The majority of kids with disabilities are medically diagnosed and. therefore. receive special education services. Children with learning and behavioral disorders should be no different. The bottom line is if a child has a medical disability. whether it be physical. mental. learning or behavioral. it should be diagnosed and have a medical opinion from a medical professional in order to receive the same special education services as those children that are medically diagnosed. The TancredoGraves amendment would protect parents. and most importantly. it would protect children from being labeled with a disability that they may not have.",

While DHS has successfully integrated 22 government agencies into the homeland security mission. it still does not have a centralized headquarters location. The longer that DHS operates without such a centralized location. the longer it will be handicapped by the challenges of running an organization whose parts are scattered throughout the region.

The Red Ball Express. a predominantly AfricanAmerican outfit. was a massive 82day convoy effort that supplied the Allied armies moving through Europe. The convoy system expressed from St. Lo in Normandy to Paris and eventually to the front along Frances northeastern borderland. Persevering through arduous driving conditions and ambushes. members of the Red Ball Express performed their duties with utmost precision and efficiency. Their dedication sustained thousands of Allied troops during some of the most difficult periods of World War II. When the program ended in midNovember 1944. Red Ball truckers had delivered nearly 500.000 tons of fuel. lubricants. ammunition. food and other vital essentials needed for Allied success within the European theater. In spite of the indignities. putdowns and double standards that they endured. members of the Red Ball Express contributed unselfishly to winning this centurys greatest fight for freedom. I met several of them during the World War II celebration here this past Memorial Day holiday who are very proud of being a part of this group. Historically. no group of Americans endured what African Americans endured in uniform during World War II. They proudly defended America with no guarantee that their own freedom would be defended on their return home. This Nations debt to AfricanAmerican servicemen and women who served under those conditions can never be fully repaid but at a minimum we should certainly honor their service.

As we remember the courageous veterans whose foresight and sacrifice brought about a landmark in the struggle for Democracy. I rise today to honor the Motor Transport Service. code named the \"Red Ball Express.\" The heroism of the lesserknown group of veterans has been undercelebrated. but their impact is eternally felt. For 82 long days. fighting adverse driving conditions and sleep depravation. the men of the Red Ball Express transported 500.000 tons of fuel and ordinance to forward depots throughout France. Though this immense effort lasted only three months. from August 25 to November 16. 1944. the mission of the Motor Transport Service was perhaps the most crucial to the capture of occupied France. This massive convoy effort afforded the Allied troops the means and mobility to successfully complete the campaign in the European Theater. Composed of 80 percent African Americans. the men of the Red Ball Express met the most uncertain of risks to defend the freedom we cherish today. The altruism of these men in service is astounding. Their vision and hope for all humanity. during those 82 days. broke through barricades of tyranny and ignorance to bring liberty to new heights. Colonel John S.D. Eisenhower wrote of their noble behavior. \"the Spectacular nature of the advance was due in as great a measure to the men who drove the Red Ball trucks as to those who drove the tanks.\" It is when extraordinary conflict has plagued our Nation. that we have witnessed the most astonishing acts towards peacewhen the ideals of country have been tirelessly challenged. that the firmest of principles have forged a clear path.

Despite hardship and slight. the men of the \"Red Ball Express\" acted bravely in a time of fear and unselfishly in this unique moment in history when they were needed the most.",

Tampa Bay fans respect that the team plays hockey the way it is supposed to be played. with hard work. discipline. and teamwork. Special mention must be made of team captain Dave Andreychuk. After playing in one of the roughest professional leagues in the world for 21 years. retiring must have seemed the logical step to take. Instead. this true team leader rejoined his teammates for an outstanding 22nd season. It is not always the case in sports that the most deserving team wins. Fortunately. the Lightning of Tampa Bay have been awarded the Stanley Cup for their valiant play.

A 1year extension will allow business visitors and tourists from the 27 nations in the visa waiver program to continue to make plans for the near future with currently valid passports and travel to the United States while technology is improved. Using biometric passports will make us safer. but only if the technology is effective. durable. and part of a globally interoperable system that is compatible between nations. A 1year extension will give Congress and the State Department more time to assess the very important questions of protecting privacy and ensuring efficient processing. while continuing to make serious steps toward a system that will secure our ports and national security.

The Federal Reserve has been pressing forward. keeping interest rates low. We have been pressing forward in cutting taxes to try to stimulate. The early medicine seems to be working. We are starting to get some economic growth. We are starting to get some job creation taking place. Another clear area of importance and need is this area of litigation reform. This is sapping a great deal of strength out of the economy and sapping strength from job creation. This is one of the areas we need to reform. I think there are ways that we can do this and still protect the rights of the individual. rights of those who are harmed in the system. but we are going to have to start to address this problem if we are going to be serious about job creation in the country and serious about what all we can do as a legislative body in creating an atmosphere and situation in the United States that can be the most growth oriented. and in a way that still protects all the rights of individuals in this country.

That said. it is important for my constituentsfarmers and consumers aliketo have welloperated and wellmaintained waterway systems on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. As part of our efforts to keep our waterways in good working order. we have funded the Upper Mississippi River Navigation Study. This study is a comprehensive review of the needs of the Mississippi transportation system and will provide us reliable data about the efficiencies of this critical waterway. We have also funded the Mississippi River Comprehensive Plan. an initiative aimed at improving flood protection. mitigating flood damage. and enhancing habitat management and erosion control. Other Corps funding with respect to navigation that is important to Iowas farmers and grain shippers pertains to the operation and maintenance of the dams and locks along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. These activities are important because without proper operation of these locks and dams. much of our food production system suffers economically because of costly delays in the movement of grains and other agricultural products.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I do not rise to offer this amendment because I believe that the General Investigations Account is overfunded. In fact. I believe the entire Corps budget is way underfunded when we look at the real infrastructure needs of the United States. I appreciate the fact that the committee and the House have found $288 million more than the President proposed. but it is still $156 million less than last year. and all across the country we have locks and dams and jetties failing. In particular. in my own district we have a dam at Fern Ridge which is more than 50 years old which is on the verge of catastrophic failure. The Corps has lowered the level of water behind the dam. They say that at any moment they may have to dewater the reservoir. And when the reservoir is dewatered. we lose both the extraordinary recreation benefits of one of the most heavily recreated lakes in Oregon. the revenues that flow from that recreation. but we also lose the flood control. And just a few years ago this dam was vital when we had a wet winter. and they are now predicting that we again are going to have a wet winter. So if the dam just fails a little bit more. we are going to lose all the flood control capability and all of the recreational attributes. and the Corps of my region says they just will not have the money until the year 2006 to fix this dam. That is not acceptable. We cannot have dams that are failing and say. come back in 3 years and. by the way. if they have a 100year flood in the interim. they are out of luck. We will have hundreds of millions of downstream damage. and I guess then Federal flood insurance will pay for it out of a different pocket than the pocket out of which we are appropriating this bill. So my intention in offering this amendment is not to criticize the committee or the Corps or any of these budgets. but to raise the point that the O&M Account. which goes to issues like the failing Fern Ridge Dam. goes to the dredging of the small ports along the southern Oregon coast. is woefully underfunded. I also understand that a point of order may lie against this amendment.",

The Delaware River Main Channel Deepening project is designed to keep the Delaware River Ports competitive with other east coast ports. all of which have dredged or are planning to dredge their channels deeper than 40 feet. Major shipping lines have informed the ports that their next generation ships will require deeper channels. Unless these ports can go to 45 feet they will be at a competitive disadvantage with their sister ports for the expected growth of international trade. In addition to the competitive advantage this project will provide the region. it provides much needed jobs. Over 75.000 jobs are attributable to the port industry in the Delaware Valley. Moreover. the Delaware River Port has been designated as a military strategic port. The Port of Philadelphia has been selected as a Strategic Seaport for the Northeast Corridor of the United States. Philadelphias selection means the Department of Defense will incorporate the use of the citys port facilities in its planning for the movement of military cargoes in the event of major contingency operations. Selection of the Pennsylvania port was made jointly by the U.S. Maritime Administration. U.S. Army Forces Command. and the Military Traffic Management Command after an assessment of many Northeast Corridor ports. Philadelphia becomes the countrys 14th commercial Strategic Seaport.

I am disappointed that in this resolution Congress is simply voicing thanks. We had an opportunity to do something truly meaningful when we considered the Defense authorization legislation 2 weeks ago. Rather than doing something to help our Reservists and National Guardsmen and -women. this resolution simply expresses empty thanks. According to a survey conducted by the Pentagon. four in ten members of the Reserves or National Guard suffer a loss of salary when they are activated. For instance. Russell Wright. a father of two and a sergeant in the Marine Reserves. was activated for a year and. as a result. will lose about 50 percent of his civilian salary. Mr. Speaker. I am sure my colleagues will agree that this is a deplorable comment on how our country treats its Reserves and National Guardsmen. Instead of merely praising the Nations businesses for their support of our troops. we should be helping our activated men and women. An amendment offered by my good friend. the gentleman from Texas . and myself to require the Federal Government to pay its employees the difference between their civilian and military salaries passed unanimously by voice vote in a recent Committee on Government Reform meeting. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. that amendment was excluded from consideration of the Defense authorization bill that we passed 2 weeks ago. It is a grave disappointment to me that instead of making up the salary loss suffered by numerous Federal employees who are also Reservists. we are only offering a meaningless tribute to our Nations businesses for doing what we in Congress are not willing to do. Mr. Speaker. because I support House Resolution 201. I wanted to take a moment to commend the nearly 200 conscientious businesses that have taken the initiative to pay their employees the difference between their military and civilian salaries. These companies include the Oracle Corporation. located in my own congressional district. Mr. Speaker. when my colleagues come down to vote on this resolution. I want them to think about the families which are suffering as a result of the pay gap. and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in rectifying this outrageous problem. [From USA Today.

In addition to expressing sympathy and condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in service to our country. for example. this legislation endorses the kind of openended occupation and nationbuilding that causes me great concern. It \"recommits\" the United States to \"helping the people of Iraq and Afghanistan build free and vibrant democratic societies.\" What this means is hundreds of thousands of American troops remaining in Iraq and Afghanistan for years to come. engaged in nationbuilding activities that the military is neither trained nor suited for. It also means tens and perhaps hundreds of billions of American tax dollars being shipped abroad at a time when our national debt is reaching unprecedented levels. The legislation inaccurately links our military action against Afghanistan. whose government was in partnership with AIQaeda. with our recent attack on Iraq. claiming that these were two similar campaigns in the war on terror. In fact. some of us are more concerned that the policy of preemptive military action. such as was the case in Iraq. will actually increase the likelihood of terrorist attacks against the United Statesa phenomenon already predicted by the CIA.

I have the headquarters for the National Guard at Camp Blanding in North Central Florida. so I am well aware of the sacrifices these folks make when they go off to war. Interestingly enough. a lot of Americans do not realize this. so I think it is altogether appropriate today that we recognize the businesses and National Guard. because prior to this we had the resolution honoring the military who participated over in the war in Iraq. and we mentioned the National Guard. But. of course. this resolution is concentrating on the businesses. There are 216.931 members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces. When you think about each one of these people leaving their families and jobs in service to their country to go off to the war in Iraq. of course they leave behind employment. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of employers that had these people employed. It might be a small business of five people. and it might be a business of 5.000 or 6.000 employees. But if you take a small business and you have one individual that leaves it. he represents 20 percent of the employees of the business. That is a major sacrifice. So I think it is altogether fitting this afternoon that we take this time to recognize these businesses for their exceptional accommodation for these men and women and to honor them for what they are trying to do. Of course. under the Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. they have many responsibilities. Again. these responsibilities are mandated by Congress. but in many ways most of these businesses. almost all of them. are obligated through patriotism and a sense of resolve to the war in Iraq to take these people back. to care for them and. in many cases. give them their back pay.

Specifically. this amendment would prohibit the use of funds provided by the act for processing the importation of any articles from Iran. Processing imports is part of administering a tariff.

The gentleman from Michigan raises a point of order against the amendment offered by the gentleman from California on the grounds that it violates clause 5(a) of rule XXI. In prior Congresses. clause 5(a) of rule XXI provided a point of order against carrying a tax or tariff measure on a bill not reported by a committee having such jurisdiction. At the beginning of the 108th Congress. clause 5(a) was amended to particularize its application to an amendment in the form of a limitation on funds in a general appropriation bill for the administration of a tax or tariff. The Chair is of the opinion that the change in clause 5(a) affects todays proceedings in one significant way: The new version of clause 5(a) enables a point of order against limitation amendments addressing the administration of a tariff whether or not the maker of the point of order can demonstrate a necessary and inevitable change in tariff statuses or liabilities or in revenue collection. More on that matter can be found in section 1066 of the House Rules and Manual. In the present case. the chief impetus for the processing of imports from Iran is tariff law. The Chair therefore holds that the limitation on funds to process imports from Iran is necessarily a limitation on funds for the administration of a tax or tariff within the meaning of clause 5(a) of rule XXI. The point of order is sustained. and the amendment is not in order.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. small businesses need opportunities. Repeatedly. small businesses have demonstrated that they can provide the government a superior product at an affordable cost to taxpayers. Unfortunately. small businesses are seeing their opportunities dwindle as agencies place expediency over job creation in our local communities and what is best for the American taxpayers. The cost of this is the creation of mega contracts that are so big that only big businesses in corporate America can compete. What they are telling American small businesses is that the $285 billion Federal marketplace is not open to them. When President Bush took office. he promised to change this and to open the Federal marketplace to small businesses. Even 2 years ago. during Small Business Week. he issued a small business agenda and made contract bundling his top priority. Since taking office. not only has he done nothing to change this. but this administration has failed to meet any of the small business goals set up by Congress. This is outrageous. Todays legislation is a perfect example of that. This Department was created by the President and was supposedly to do things in a new way. What we are seeing here is business as usual. The most recent example is this regional security contract that currently is being done by small business securities firms across the country. Homeland Security is currently in the process of bundling this contract so large that probably three firms. one of them not even an American firm. so now. we are going to turn security over to foreign companies. and none of the small businesses will be able to provide the service. This will result in the loss of thousands of jobs in communities across the country at a time when job creation is still struggling. My amendment will stop the Homeland Security from bundling contracts that will steal opportunities from small businesses and ensure that small businesses will continue to provide the services that they have done so well. I urge the adoption of this amendment.",

Congress continues to provide significant homeland security dollars for State and local governments. which is essential in our ongoing global war on terror. Since September 11. 2001. Congress has provided $26.7 billion to first responders. thus far including training and equipment. While this is undeniably the greatest support our Nations police. firefighters and other responders have seen. we continue to face challenges in distributing this funding in a fair and appropriate manner. Chairman HAL ROGERS has accomplished a great deal by taking the helm of this new appropriations subcommittee and all its responsibilities. with the most recent success of streamlining the process of applying and receiving Federal funds for local governments with a \"onestop shop.\" eliminating choke points and bureaucracy. But we still have a fundamental challenge to tackleand that is the disparity between States in receiving the first responder block grant. The bulk of first responder funds is distributed on a per capita basis. leaving the largest. most vulnerable States with the least amount of Federal resources. While we have achieved some balance with the concentration of the highthreat urban area grants. I believe we can and will continue to work toward even greater equity within the formula. I look forward to working with Chairman ROGERS and all of my colleagues from urban and rural areas to ensure that as Congress continues to provide significant resources to our responder communities. that we do it in an effective and efficient manner.",

I particularly want to discuss how certain provisions in this legislation would affect my district of El Paso. Texas. and the entire southwest border region. While the bill provides an overall funding increase of about 9 percent over last year for all homeland security activities. there are certain areas in the bill where we must do better. For example. H.R. 4567 provides only a little more funding for customs and border protection activities than is necessary to keep pace with inflation. and actually provides less funding than last year for citizenship and immigration services. A Democratic proposal to add $3 billion to the bill for urgently needed improvements to our homeland security was blocked in the Appropriations Committee. This contingency fund would have given us additional resources to strengthen our border security. provide our first responders additional resources. and better protect against the threat of bioterrorist attacks. I am very pleased. however. that the amendment offered by my colleague from Texas. Mr. TURNER. was accepted. The amendment would require an independent study to assess staffing needs at the border. giving us reliable data to help determine the required level and allocation of personnel at the border. It is a great step forward in ensuring that our border security needs are adequately addressed and funded.

It has helped to preserve manufacturing. textile and other American jobs. allowed domestic companies to flourish. and provided our Armed Forces with highquality products that keep our military prepared and equipped to be the best in the world. Having served America so well for defense procurement. it makes perfect sense that the Berry amendment should now be extended to homeland security. U.S. companies have been instrumental in ongoing efforts to protect airports. equip first responders. deploy cuttingedge technology to hospitals. and so much more. Rewarding their patriotism and hard work with procurement protections is the right thing to do. I also want to note that the Manzullo amendment would allow waivers of the Berry amendment when needed items cannot be procured domestically and would not place any of our current or future homeland security operations at risk. What it would do is say to American companies and American workers that we appreciate their efforts and welcome their partnership as we work to protect our citizens. The Berry amendment is a tested means of supporting domestic businesses while they support us.

I support the appropriations bill before us today. but I remain concerned with the inadequate levels of funding for first responders. interoperability and port security. The American people depend on homeland security. and we must find the means to provide the resources needed to protect our communities. As the Ranking Member of the Intelligence and Counterterrorism Subcommittee of the Select Committee on Homeland Security. I support the funding needed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide accurate and timely intelligence assessments. Unfortunately. this bill reduces funding for first responder programs at DHS from the current $4.4 billion funding level to $4.1 billion. a cut of $327 million below the 2004 enacted level. First responders must have the resources they need to do their jobs. My firefighters. police and emergency workers tell me that they have difficulty communicating with each other because of incompatible equipment. This problem affects first responders throughout the country and it is unacceptable. Adequate funds must be available to adequately equip our Nations first responders. Missouri has the seventh largest highway system in the Nation and the second and third largest railroad terminals in the Nation. Port and transportation security is crucial to our Nations economy. Six million cargo containers enter U.S. ports every year. but only about 5 percent of these containers are ever screened.

I have several perspectives. In addition to being a Member of Congress. I am a veteran myself. I served 31 years in the Army National Guard. But I greatly appreciate the service of the Air Force. It has been extraordinary. the military professionalism that truly has been generated by the Air Force Academy. I had the extraordinary opportunity firsthand to accompany the gentleman from Missouri . as the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services. to visit Iraq last September. and I saw firsthand the success of the precision bombing which protected the civilian population and protected the schools and the mosques while the military targets were utterly destroyed in one of the most successful military operations in the history of the United States. protecting the American people from the terrorists by going after them in Afghanistan. going after them in Iraq. And American families are safer. Additionally. I am grateful to be a service academy parent. I know firsthand how academies promote the high standards of academics. Actually. my son went to an academy which is in the State of Maryland. not in the State of Colorado. but I do have great appreciation for the Academy. There are facts that should be known. that 32 cadets have been selected as Rhodes Scholars. including our colleague. the gentlewoman from New Mexico . who also has. I think. the great distinction of being the first female graduate of the Air Force Academy serving in Congress. Additionally. six cadets have accepted Marshall scholarships. nine cadets have received the Harry S. Truman scholarship. 92 cadets have been accepted as Guggenheim Fellows. There is so much to be appreciative of of the military service. the academic success of the Air Force Academy. Mr. Speaker. I urge support of the resolution.",

I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 386 introduced by the gentlewoman from New Mexico and my colleague on the Committee on Armed Services. and I commend her on your efforts to recognize the 50th anniversary of the United States Air Force Academy. On April 1. 1954. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into the law a bill that established the United States Air Force Academy. and this Thursday. April 1. 2004. the Nation will recognize the 50th anniversary of this Academy and its efforts to inspire and develop outstanding young men and women as Air Force officers. However. the history of the Academy began long before the bill was signed by President Eisenhower. One of the first to recognize the need and to advocate for an air service academy was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. often considered to be the father. of the United States Air Force. He was an outspoken advocate of strategic air power. and he had attempted to establish an air school for many years. Progress on the Air Force Academy began in 1949 when Secretary of Defense James Forrestal established a board of military and civilian educators to recommend a general system of education for the services. The board. which was headed by Dwight D. Eisenhower. then president of Colombia University. and Robert L. Stearns. then president of the University of Colorado. recommended that an Air Force Academy be established. and this was done in 1954 under President Eisenhowers signature. The Academys commitment to excellence began with its first class in July of 1955. which was comprised of 306 men who lived in temporary facilities at Lowry Air Force Base in Denver. Colorado. Lieutenant General Hubert R. Harmon. recalled from retirement. became the first superintendent. The Cadet Wing moved to its current location 3 years later in 1958. and the first class graduated in 1959. In 1964. the academies were allowed to nearly double their enrollment to over 4.400 cadets. In 1976. the first class of women was allowed to attend the service academies. including the Air Force Academy. Since then. more than 35.000 cadets have graduated from the Air Force Academy. including 196 international cadets. The gentleman from South Carolina",

While the vast majority of cadets at this institution have gone on to distinguished careers of service that have made us all proud. it is unfortunate that the Academys ineffective approach to the problem of sexual assault has tarnished the reputation of the Air Force Academy in the past decade. An Investigation commissioned by Congresschaired by former Congresswoman Tillie Fowlermade recommendations less than a year ago on how to improve the culture at the Air Force Academy to support victims of sexual assault. Mr. Speaker. the report makes clear that the recommendations made in the report are only a beginning to solving the problem of sexual assault at the U.S. Air Force Academy. It states that the common failure in each of the many efforts made to address this problem over the past decade was the \"absence of sustained attention to the problem and followup on the effectiveness of the solution.\" It is essential that we. as Members of Congress. follow up on the recommendations made to ensure that the culture of the Air Force Academy does not tolerate sexual assault. perpetrators are punished. and victims are supported. The reputation of such a distinguished institution should not continue to be frayed by its failure to effectively address this one important issue. Mr. Speaker.

During consideration of this resolution. all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. On Thursday. March 25. 2004. the Committee on Rules announced that it may meet the week of March 29 to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consideration of H.R. 3966. The announcement further stated that any Member wishing to offer an amendment submit the amendment to the Committee on Rules by 1 p.m. on Monday. March 29. 2004. No amendments were submitted to the Committee on Rules for their consideration. H.R. 3966 is based on a simple principle. Colleges and universities that accept Federal funding should also be willing to provide military recruiters the same access as other prospective employers to students in ROTC scholarship programs. This legislation would improve the ability of the Department of Defenseto establish and maintain ROTC detachments and ensure that military recruiters have access to college campuses and students. Successful recruitment for our military relies heavily on the ability of these recruiters to have access to the students and the students to be able to have access to the recruiter easily. This bill also requires an annual verification of colleges and universities who already support ROTC that they will continue to do so in the upcoming academic year. The Department of Defense seeks nothing more than the opportunity to compete for students on an equal footing with other prospective employers. At no time since World War II has our Nations freedom and security relied more upon our military than now as we engage in the global war on terrorism. Our Nations allvolunteer armed services have been called upon to serve. and they are performing their mission with the highest standards. The militarys ability to perform at this standard can only be maintained with effective and uninhibited recruitment programs. As many of my colleagues know. the Armed Forces face a constant challenge in recruiting topquality personnel. and I believe that ROTC programs are ideally suited to meet those needs. To that end. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Congress should be taking action to ensure that no child has to skip needed health care checkups and is not left behind.

Through Association Health Plans. small businesses will have the ability to secure affordable health care contracts. Uninsured employees will receive the security of affordable health insurance. Here is something that I think is significant: Out of the 44 million uninsured Americans. so called. about 25 million of them are people in small businesses. either the dependents or the employees themselves. The price of health care benefits has risen by 12 percent this year alone. Escalating health care premiums makes it nearly impossible for small business owners to afford to offer health care benefits to their employees.

Conversely. as the percentage of domestic production decreases the incentives would also decrease. This mechanism will provide a strong incentive for manufacturers to maintain U.S. production and to return runaway production to the United States. Our communities. our industries and our workers are being harmed by the erosion of our manufacturing base. Todays legislation is one additional way that we can provide assistance to these vital groups. This legislation is the companion to H.R. 1769 introduced earlier this session in the House by Representatives RANGEL and CRANE. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation to provide that restaurant buildings are depreciated over 15 years instead of the currentlaw 39 years. My legislation will ensure that the tax laws more accurately reflect the true economic life of restaurant buildings. Under current law. real estate property and any improvements thereto generally must be depreciated over 39 years. However. restaurant buildings undergo excessive wear and tear. and are renovated on average every 6 to 8 years. Requiring restaurant owners to depreciate these renovations over 39 years leads to a mismatch of income and expenses. thereby increasing the tax consequence of making such improvements. The long depreciation period simply makes no economic sense. In recent years. Congress has changed the depreciation schedules for competitors of owneroccupied restaurants. For example. convenience stores are depreciated over 15 years. In addition. leased properties. including leased restaurant space. can take advantage of the temporary bonus depreciation incentives contained in the 2001 economic stimulus bill. I believe that our tax laws should be updated to treat restaurant property in a more rational manner. That is why I am introducing legislation to reduce the depreciable life of restaurant property from 39 years to 15 years. My legislation would ensure that all restaurants. either leased or owneroccupied. are treated equally. It would also ensure a level playing field between restaurants and their competitors. By reducing the time period over which all restaurants are depreciated. my bill will more accurately align a restaurants income and expenses. According to the National Restaurant Association. enacting this legislation would generate an additional $3.7 billion in cash flow for restaurants over the next 10 years. This is money that could be reinvested and. in turn. generate new jobs. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact my legislation that will provide more rational taxtreatment of restaurants on a permanent basis. by doing so. we will take an incremental step toward modernizing the tax codes outdated depreciation rules.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is a privilege to join Senator FITIZGERALD and Senator SNOWE in introducing the Treatment of Childrens Deformities Act. The purpose of our bill is to see that health insurers and health plans cover the treatment of childrens congenital and developmental deformities and disorders. About 7 percent of all children are born with significant problems. including cleft lips or cleft palates. serious skin lesions such as port wine stains. malformations of the ear. or facial deformities. Plastic surgery can correct many of these conditions. but too often parents face significant barriers in obtaining care for their children. More than half of all plastic surgeons report that these patients are denied insurance coverage or had the struggle to receive it. Too often. insurers deny coverage by calling the treatment cosmetic or not medically necessary. The medical. developmental. and psychological problems associated with denied or delayed treatment of these deformities are enormous. Treatment often requires a series of treatments as the child grow. No child should be forced to live with an untreated cleft lip or a facial deformity while parents appeal an insurers unfair denial. Delayed or denied treatment puts a childs physical and mental health at risk. Our bill requires health insurers and health plans to provide coverage to treat a childs congenial or developmental deformity. or disorders caused by disease. trauma. infection. or tumor. It is supported by many medical organizations. including the American Academy of Pediatrics. the American Medical Association. and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. I urge the Senate to support this important bill. and give children and families the support they deserve. By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself. Mrs.",

It is well known that terrorist organizations like Hizballah. Hamas. and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine maintain offices. training camps. and other facilities on Syrian territory and in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces. We must address this issue not with saber rattling but by confronting the Government of Syria in a diplomatic way that shows the seriousness of our concerns. The Syria Accountability Act works to achieve our foreign policy goals by expanding economic and diplomatic sanctions against Syria until the President certifies that Syria has ended its support of terrorism. withdrawn from Lebanon. ceased its chemical and biological weapons program. and no longer illegally imports Iraqi oil. The bill provides flexibility to the President by allowing him to choose from a variety of sanctions. as well as the authority to waive sanctions if it is in the interest of United States national security. I hope this legislation will receive the support of the Administration and Congress because it provides the President with the flexibility to target specific sanctions against Syria. but in no way threatens or condones the use of military force against Syria.

I traveled to Ethiopia and Eritrea earlier this year to see the famine conditions. and never imagined that Id see conditions as bad as I saw in In 1984. 8 million were in need of food aid. In January. more than 11 million people struggled for their next meal. I saw women and children that were too weak to feed themselves. This is absolutely tragic in a world with food as plentiful as ours. Today. the situation is even more distressing. I recently read a cable from the American ambassador in Ethiopia describing a grimmer outlook for the coming months than had previously been expected. I will be submitting into the RECORD the cable and the latest NOAA weather forecast. which revises expectations for crop viability downward. This paints a bleak outlook for millions more Ethiopians for months to come. In March. I wrote U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urging him to appoint a special envoy for hunger. Many European news outlets have run stories in recent days on the growing number of Africans. whose lives are now in jeopardy. The Ethiopian Government is planning another \"LiveAid\" concert to reenergize the donor community and draw international attention to the situation. The momentum of this concert. coupled with the appointment of a U.N. special envoy. may help draw enough attention and resources to the continent and save the lives of millions of women and children. In Matthew 25. Jesus talks about the obligation to feed the hungry. The United States has responded to this crisis with an enormous amount of compassion. Many countries have the ability to give more. and may just be waiting to be asked. Time. resources and attention must be devoted to mobilizing and coordinating the resources required. This is a crisis that will require enormous coordination between international aid agencies. religious leaders and governments from every corner of the globe. The war in Iraq has demanded our attention. but we can not allow this silent emergency to grow worse. The lives of millions of women and children depend on this story being shared loudly and boldly.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the beginning of the 108th Congress marks a pivotal moment in the management of one of the most complex water systems in the world. Complex both hydrologically and legally. the river is managed through a series of agreements that are collectively known as the \"law of the river.\" and it is the \"law of the river\" that brings me to the floor today. For years. the State of California has consumed far more than its annual allocation of 4.4 million acrefeet of water from the Colorado River. Instead. the State has pursued a path of overuseoften drawing more than 1 million acrefeet of water a year over its allocation. With the turn of the new year. and just as Colorado enters the fourth year of the most severe drought in 300 years. I am pleased that Secretary Norton and the Department of the Interior have taken strong action to force California into compliance with the decadesold agreements that dictate the amount of water that the State is entitled to consume. thereby ending its abuse of the river. This watershed decision to enforce the 4.4 million acrefeet allocation reveals a welcome determination to ensure confidence in the law through decisive action. demonstrating to all parties that abuse of the \"law of the river\" will not be tolerated. \"The law of the river\" has evolved over 80 hard fought years. every precious drop of the river means life or death to the people of the basin States. Secretary Norton has now made it clear that every party to the compact will be held accountable. and that these agreements will stand as precious as the water itself. No longer will States be able to ignore the \"law of the river.\" In Colorado. our citizens must abide by the doctrine of prior appropriations. Other States govern water under a hybrid or riparian rights system. These timetested theories have one constant principlea user cannot take more water than its legal share. This strong sentiment is reflected in a recent Denver Post editorial that I would like to share with you today. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

    "speech": "California has had ample opportunity to meet its legal obligation. agreements outlining baby steps toward compliance with the 4.4 limit have been in existence since the 1990s. Even though the State has consumed far more than its fair share for years. it has had plenty of opportunity to live within its allocation. Yet in the end. with the water shutoff. I hope California will recognize its legal obligations. To Secretary Norton and my colleagues from the basin States. I urge you to continue to force all members to abide by their allocation and to protect the law. Secretary Nortons fair action has demonstrated that this administration will uphold the \"law of the river.\" and when the law is not adhered to. those in violation will be held accountable. I have remained in close contact with Colorado Governor Bill Owens throughout the ordeal. and would like to share with you an insightful comment made by the Governor in a conversation we had shortly after the decision to shut off the water was announced Governor Owens said. \"In the West. our word is our bond. As Colorado suffers from the worst drought in its history. we cannot and will not support socalled surplus water deliveries to California. unless California keeps its word to us.\" I certainly agree. I commend the Secretary for her action. and hope this will serve as a clarion call that the law of the river is indeed a law that must be obeyed.",

Throughout the season. the Buckeyes showed a remarkable spirit of determination. cooperation. and the best teamwork that I have seen in a football team. frankly. during my lifetime. The Buckeyes have good people and a great leader who inspired his team to do their bestas athletes and young men with character. determination. pride. and loyalty to each other and to their alumni. On the night of the game. some of the sports pundits said that the other team had more talent than the Ohio State Buckeyes. But throughout this season. we utilized our talent more fully than any other opponent. The Buckeyes have that special ingredientsticking together and working togethera true symbiotic relationship. They understood that the more they cooperated on behalf of the team as a whole the better off all of them would be. That is the spirit that shone through during the whole seasonunselfish determination and genuine teamwork. That is what it was about. Their lesson is a good one for us in the Senate. It is the same kind of spirit that we are going to need on the floor of the Senate and in our country if we expect to win the war on terrorism and to become national champions for our hardworking citizens who put their trust in us. We would all do well to emulate the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes.

I appreciate the efforts of the two Senators from Pennsylvania to help these underfunded airline pension plans. particularly as it relates to a company that is very important to the economy of their State. We are also in a situation where. as far as I know. the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on this issue and. consequently. even if the Senate were to pass it the measure would be subject to a blue slip. meaning. under the Constitution. a revenue measure needs to start in the House of Representatives. So if we took action. what would that do? It could not become law. The legislation the Senator has introduced would create. as a matter of substance. perverse disincentives for all plans that paid premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The bill would permit a single airline to avoid the pension funding rules in the Internal Revenue Code. while every responsible plan sponsor funds its own plans. We will need to deal with this particular problem when we deal with the rest of the funding rules and the pension interest rate problem because that is a very real problem and several times we have tried to address it. just not successfully through the whole process. So we get to a point that one set of rules for one company harms the nations pension laws applicable to the remaining plans. I respectfully suggest that something this important wouldsurely ought to be referred to the Finance Committee and that we should deal with it under the regular rules of the committee. but particularly we need a solution that would be nationwide. not dealing with just one company.

But the fact that it has to be passed. the fact that the gentleman from Florida has to take the lead as the appropriations chair to right this wrong is indicative of the fact that the administration has failed to understand what is at stake here. Surely something like this could be rescinded by an Executive Order. We are apparently able to go to war without the slightest recourse to the Congress for approval. one would think that the administration could rescind this tax on food for wounded veterans in our Nations military hospitals. So I think the Congress has the obligation to get involved in this oversight in a way beyond that which is the ordinary passage of bills and the ordinary scope of legislation that we go through in the quotidian details of legislative life here in Washington. This is a perfect example of it. In some respects. it is almost shameful that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has to resort to a legislative bill to right this wrong. which is obvious to anyone who would objectively look at the situation. There is no doubt in my mind that the good offices of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is utterly and totally sincere and straightforward. The question is not the motivation of a Republican Member or a Democratic Member. it is that the Congress has to bring any administration. Democrat or Republican. to account with respect to how we fund things. where we fund things. why we fund things. and what the rationale is behind it.

There is a secret little bitter financial pill in here that so far I do not think we have talked a lot about. and that is because the administration wants to borrow. every single dollar for this Iraq operation. the President wants to take it right out of the Social Security Trust Fund. every single dollar. He will be borrowing every single dollar he expends in Iraq from the Social Security Trust Fund. And to do that. of course. we will have to pay interest on that. The interest alone. for which Americans will get absolutely nothing. conservatively. under an optimistic scenario. will be $83.9 billion in interest charges that the President of the United States wants to impose on our children. because that is the generation that will actually be paying this. If it is not so rosy and we are there through 2008. it will be $104 billion in interest charges. One of the reasons Congress needs to engage in a debate about how to handle this situation is we do not believe we should put those interest charges on our children. It is unconscionable to put $80 billion of debt on our kids of interest for which they get no teachers. no cops. no sailors. no soldiers. This is the biggest item of waste. fraud. and abuse probably in the Federal budget. this interest charge that they want to sneak by the American public so they do not know about it. And they do want to sneak it by. And do my colleagues know why they want to sneak it by? Because the President did not tell us about this when they started this war.

Ms. Burch is the owner and operator of Capital Business Services in the City of Napa and often works well in excess of 60 hours a week. Ms. Burch learned her work habits early. She grew up on a farm in Pendleton. IN. and her first job. at age 6. was to pull a wagon of water to the workers in the field. When her family moved into town when she was 18. she found a job at the local bank. She worked at the bank until she married her husband. George. a World War II veteran of the South Pacific campaigns. Together they purchased a jewelry store. which they ran successfully until family tragedy forced them to sell the business and move in with her husbands parents in Napa. Her fatherinlaw taught Ms. Burch and her husband accounting and they opened Capital Business Services in 1957 in her inlaws spare bedroom. Ms. Burch has managed the business continuously since then. Ms. Burch and her husband had to adapt to the rapid advances in the accounting field with the advent of personal computers. Since many small businesses began using personal computers to do their own bookkeeping. Ms. Burch moved her company into tax preparation. and estate. nonprofit and corporate returns and IRS audits. She passed the Enrolled Agent Exam at age 57. which allowed her to practice before the IRS. To keep her license current. she has to have 80 hours of continuing education every 3 years. but to stay current with the changing tax laws. she earns many more continuing education credits than the minimum requirement. In addition to her long hours of work. Ms. Burch also finds time to volunteer with her church and its preschool. Soroptomist International. Meals on Wheels. battered womens programs. special needs scholarships and single moms. She and her husband. who passed away 5 years ago. helped start the first Boys and Girls Club in Napa.

Elvin Jones is the youngest brother of a remarkable musical family. which also includes Hank Jones (a pianist) and the late Thad Jones (a coronetist and big band leader).

After serving in the Army from 19461949. he returned to the Detroit area. establishing himself as the house drummer at the renowned Bluebird Club. In the mid50s. Elvin Jones relocated to New York City. where he rapidly established himself as a leading exponent of bop drumming. During this period. he worked with several notable musicians including J.J. Johnson. Donald Byrd. Harry \"Sweets\" Edison. Bud Powell and Sonny Rollins. In 1960. Elvin Jones became a member of John Coltranes most celebrated quartet. working alongside pianist McCoy Tyner and bassist Jimmy Garrison. Jones played with \"Trane\" for five years. gaining the renown that has led him to be regarded as one of the outstanding drummers in jazz history. After leaving Coltrane. Elvin Jones worked mainly as a leader of his own small groups. where he was able to exercise full control over the musical policy. In 1966. however. Jones toured Europe with Duke Ellingtons Orchestra. Back on his own in the late 60s. and on through the 70s and 80s. Jones toured ceaselessly. playing clubs. concerts and festivals around the world.

In 1913. the vision of St. Josephs Carmelite Home for Girls became a reality when Mother Mary Theresa of St. Joseph was granted permission from Bishop Herman Alerding to actively work with the poor children of Lake County. It was the generous donation of two small frame houses by Mr. Walter Riley. chairman of the First National Bank in East Chicago that brought the home to life. The two small houses became homes to some seventy children and at the time both boys and girls lived in the homes. St. Josephs Carmelite Home for Girls began as an orphanage. grew to a group home. and today provides residential treatment to many Northwest Indiana girls.

I thank the chairman of the Committee on Education and the Workforce for yielding me time. and I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from Maine. but the basic underlying concept of this amendment is very dangerous. No Child Left Behind was a very difficult act to pass. Each of our States has worked extraordinarily hard in the last year and a half in order to comply with No Child Left Behind. The Secretary of Education has certified that each of the States is now ready to deal with this. In each of our States. tests have been prepared. For the most part. they are starting to be given. Assessments are being made. standards are being set. we are beginning to move up education. I can tell you my State. which is the State of Delaware. which has been doing this for quite a long time. even before this. our test scores are starting to move up rapidly. we believe. as a result of setting standards and assessments and having testing in place. and I think to suspend it would be a sad error. But there is another component to all of this. If you look back over the funding of education. and I give a tremendous amount of credit to the Chair of this appropriations subcommittee as well as the ranking member. who certainly played a major role in what we are doing in helping education funding. you will see that nothing has increased in spending the way education has in the last 6 years or so. From fiscal year 1996. we have doubled funding for education at the Federal Government level. Just this year. we are going to put into IDEA an extra $1 billion. This is important. because that basically frees up State and local dollars. That is money in which the amount is not necessarily the increase that is needed. but the Federal share of it is increasing dramatically because we have stepped forward to do that. We are putting $769 million more into Title I dealing with the same children who are so very important for No Child Left Behind. So we have funded education in a way it has never been funded before. For all these reasons. because No Child Left Behind should be left in place. it is an amendment that should be defeated.",

That is a much needed adjustment which we support. but if the administration gets its way. an estimated 8 million workers will become ineligible for overtime because of changes in the rules. These include many of our first responders. firefighters. law enforcement officers. emergency medical technicians who will no longer be eligible for overtime pay because the Bush administration is changing the definition of who is being covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. This amendment would stop the administrations from making those unprecedented change to the Fair Labor Standards Act by revising the regulations.

And for this reason we think that the Secretarys rules that have been promulgated are fair because it does elevate the million people into an opportunity to make some extra money and get paid for time and a half if they have put it in. Whereas. the whitecollar workers understand that that is part of the condition of the job. that they may understand they have to work some extra time and not necessarily get time and a half. I think the rules would make management of the enterprise more effective and more efficient and would certainly be fair to everybody. Therefore.

The rule is designed to give flexibility to companies. not to families. but flexibility to withhold rightfully earned pay from their employees by weakening the 1938 Fair Standards Labor Act. protections that safeguard our workers rights today and make mandatory overtime a less attractive option for the employer. For 70 years. overtime pay has been time and a half. It has kept the workweek for millions of Americans from becoming unmanageably long. It allowed the employee some flexibility to make some extra cash. and for anyone who relies on cash overtime pay. it is the only way to put a roof over their familys heads. to buy groceries and pay their medical bills. Without overtime. countless Americans would be forced to take a second job to make up for the lost earnings. It would mean more time away from their families and higher child care costs. Supporters will tell my colleagues that in lieu of overtime pay. workers will be given compensatory time. but employers have the right to decide when or even if the worker gets the time to take his time. It paves the way for mandatory overtime. Working women will lose control of their schedule. Any mother with a child knows. in child care. if you work late. you need to make arrangements in advance or you pay higher fees for child care. Without proper protections for these women. they can be forced by their employer to work late for longer and for less on top of having to pay more for child care and for transportation. The administration has threatened to veto this bill should the ObeyMiller amendment be adopted. That is a fight that they cannot win. and they cannot win it because this rule reduces the quality of life for millions of American families by making them work harder and longer for less money. and the American people are not going to stand for that.

There is a lot of confusion in the employer community right now on how to deal with employee overtime. in large part because these regulations were last revised in I would like to share with my colleagues some very important survey data that makes the point that employers are confused with overtime regulations. Last month the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation released fresh data from their National Economic Poll in which they asked 750 small businesses: \"How do you determine if a specific employee who works more than 40 hours per week should receive overtime pay? Do you Follow common industry practice19.3 percent. Classify each job by occupation and earnings (the legally correct way)-5.9 percent. Make only hourlywage employees eligible18.9 percent.

New Jersey her home. Over a five decade career as an entertainer. Celia Cruz became known as the \"Queen of Salsa.\" and claimed the calling card cry of \"Azuuuucar!\" Celias passion. boundless energy. and charisma transfixed generations of salsa fans and musicians. She recorded more than 70 albums and her collaborative efforts with other performers including the legendary salsa artist Tito Puente. pop star David Byrne. and hiphop producer Wyclef Jean helped break down ethnic and cultural barriers. She was one of the few bridges that crossed cultural and racial divides. Celias musical talent earned her hundreds of awards worldwide. including five Grammys. two Latin Grammys. and the National Medal of Arts. the highest honor bestowed on an artist in the United States. She was a Hispanic Heritage Awards Lifetime Achievement recipient. and has a star on Hollywoods Walk of Fame. Her music was a unifying force. and her passion for a free Cuba was evidenced in both her music and her words. Celia touched the lives of millions. More than 100.000 individuals mourned her loss at her wake in Miami. Florida and 75.000 people lined the streets of Manhattan to pay their respects as her funeral procession made its way through the streets of New York City. Celia Cruz made countless contributions to American society and the world as an entertainer. and she was an ambassador of Latino culture and a voice of freedom. Her music. her words. and her love of freedom live on. This legislation would make Celia the first Latina to receive the Congressional Gold Medal.

Since early on in his life. he has strongly advocated for nonviolent resistance to achieve political change. a philosophy he developed by studying Ghandian ethics and Methodist theology. A leader in the fight against racism. Rev. Lawson was instrumental in desegregating many of our Nations societies. especially those in the southern States during the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1957. Rev. Lawson worked with Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. and helped shape the Southern Christian Leadership Council. a national organization that dismantled barriers for black citizens in the segregated south. Rev. Lawson helped organize students in southern universities to perform nonviolent demonstrations to desegregate restaurants and drug stores in Nashville. Tennessee. His actions influenced others in Historically Black Colleges and Universities to protest. eventually helping to end segregation throughout the South. Admirably. Rev. Lawsons leadership not only helped black citizens achieve political change. but he also aided labor unions. women. gays and lesbians. and recently incarcerated individuals. With all these monumental accomplishments. Rev. Lawson continues to fight for social justice even in his mid70s. His accomplishments as a dignitary of civil rights have inspired other civil leaders. like me. to achieve political change. Therefore. I am privileged to recognize him as the perfect example of todays exceptional leader.",

Colorado honorably served in the Army during World War II. leaving his motorcycle sales business to answer his countrys call to duty. Walters service to our country in its time of need is indicative of his commitment to our nation. which I would like to recognize here today. Putting his passion for motorcycles on hold. Walt kissed his wife goodbye and shipped off to New Caledonia and Biak in the South Pacific. It was not long after they learned of his mechanical abilities that the Army put Walt to work as an aircraft engine repair technician. Walts knowledge of engines. acquired from his fondness of motorcycles. provided him with an unparalleled skill for fixing planes. Our country owes Walt a debt of gratitude for his service during WWII. Walt returned safely from the war and revisited his passion for motorcycles. Aside from his time spent serving the country during WWII. Walt has been selling motorcycles since 1938. Walts entrepreneurial spirit and business savvy have provided his community with jobs and services for over six decades. Mr. Speaker. it is a privilege to stand before this body of Congress today and recognize the loyal service of Walt Timme to our nation. Walts wealth of knowledge regarding mechanics served as a tremendous resource to the Army in a time of need. Thank you Walt. and best of luck with your future endeavors.",

The Obey substitute was rejected then and will likely be ruled out of order tomorrow. That is unfortunate. because the Obey substitute offers a plan for fixing the chaos in postwar Iraq. Mr. Chairman. the war on Iraq was a war of choice. not of necessity. The administrations two primary reasons for this war. Saddam Husseins alleged weapons of mass destruction and his alleged links to al Qaeda. were both deliberately exaggerated to build support for that war. No weapons of mass destruction will be found. and the President himself has now downplayed the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. If the aftermath of the war were going well. Americans would probably overlook the deliberately misrepresented intelligence on Iraqs weapons and its ties to al Qaeda. Now. as Americans are killed almost every day. it is clear that winning the peace will be a long. difficult. and expensive process. and people are questioning how we got where we are today. E 2015 The American people are learning that the Presidents insistence on a unilateral war means that we will pay for a unilateral peace. There is popular opposition to the Presidents request for so much money for Iraq. This year America will run the largest deficit in our history. over $475 billion. without even including this $87 billion request for Iraq. The $87 billion that we are debating today is money that would have been better used to create jobs and improve health care and education for Americans here at home. The Obey substitute is an excellent proposal that provides the body armor. the equipment and adequate pure drinking water that our troops need to finish their jobs and return home quickly and safely. The Obey substitute makes our troops safer. The Obey substitute insists on accountability and transparency for the expenditure of reconstruction dollars. and it encourages support from other nations. thereby reducing the burden on American taxpayers.

Mr. Chairman. tomorrow we will vote on spending $86.9 billion of Americas taxpayers hardearned money on our ongoing military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. This massive request for supplemental funds brings home. to the pocketbooks of every American taxpayer. the cost of this administrations foreign policy. This administration has gotten us .into a situation in Iraq that is both dangerous to our troops and critically important to our worldwide leadership. This situation is now so serious that it is less important that we arrived at this point by serious miscalculations. perhaps manipulations and half truths. than to understand that for us in this country \"failure is not an option.\" As Commander in Chief. the President committed our soldiers to this war. and now we must provide them with all the resources and support that they need. Our soldiers represent the best that this country has to offer. and their sacrifices should never be taken lightly or taken for granted. But the administration is also asking us to support reconstructing Iraq to the tune of $18.6 billion. and this is only the beginning of what could be as much as $70 billion in investments. Mr. Chairman. if it is our responsibility to provide these services to rebuild Iraq. why are we along the southwestern border constantly told that there is not enough money to develop these services here at home? What about the responsibility to our own citizens? This bill includes $4.3 billion to expand access to safe drinking water and improve sanitation while hundreds of thousands of our own people along our Nations border do not have these services themselves. This bill also includes $793 million for health care programs and upgrades to hospitals and clinics while cities like El Paso are in desperate need of these same services. And this bill includes $5.7 billion to rebuild Iraqs electrical power infrastructure while hundreds of thousands of our own citizens here at home do not have electricity. If we can find the funds to support these projects in Iraq. the American people demand that we find the funds for their needs here at home. Mr. Chairman.

I come to the well with mixed emotions. simply because we are asked to do two things here: We are asked to stand up and support our troops. and. at the same time. we are asked to stand up and support our taxpayers. I want to answer the first question quite frankly and straightforward. that I will vote for this supplemental based on the needs of our soldiers who are not into this political debate. but simply need equipment and support to do the job that our country sent them to do. This bill provides $65 billion out of the $87 billion and provides needed funding for our troops. Part of this money is designed to go and purchase body armor to protect our soldiers. Part of this money is going to support continued payment of per diem for travel for family members. I have just come from my district. and I realize the hardships being placed upon family members. There is an increase in the monthly rate of imminent danger pay in this budget from $150 to $225. and also for family separation. Now. with that out of the way. it still remains a fundamental question that we must stand up for the taxpayer as well. and that is the convoluted position we are in. How do we stand up for our troops and support them in their needs for battle. to do the job that we sent them there to do? How can we not vote for these precious items that will protect their lives. including equipment to defuse ordinances away from land mines to save their lives? At the same time. we must speak up properly and effectively as good stewards of the taxpayers money for the $20 billion going for the reconstruction? Many of us pleaded and worked hard to get this debate broken down along two lines. because. yes. we must stand up for our troops. But we are Congressmen and women. We are elected to do one essential thing. more than any other. and that is make the decisions to determine how the taxpayers money is spent. I am here to tell you that this $20 billion added on for the infrastructure rebuilding of Iraq is not good stewardship of the taxpayers money.",

In fact. many families have resorted to sending protective bulletproof vests and Camelbak hydration systems to their sons and daughters stationed in Iraq. No family should be paying extra to keep their loved ones safe. The Federal Government has this responsibility. After all. who sent these young people to war in the first place? Certainly not their families. In August of this year. Mr. Chairman. I stayed in Bethesda Naval Hospital where I visited with wounded men and women and their families who have never in their lives expected to be harmed the way they were and who will never again experience the world in the same way as a result of this war. We do not talk about the impact of this war. In fact. we do not talk about the impact of any war on the wounded and their loved ones. I met with individuals who had lost limbs. their sight. their hearing. parts of their beautiful faces. and we are not providing the best equipment available. It is pretty simple: If we are willing to spend another $65 billion to keep our troops in danger. then we must care enough to bring them home. bring them home safely. bring them home soon. and support them after the war.

Millie was a leader. She began her work in the 1930s as an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. traveling throughout the South and the East organizing textile workers. In the 1940s she joined the United Auto Workers. where she served as the Director of the Womens Bureau. Millie organized the first UAW womens conference to respond to the massive post World War II layoffs of women. Millie then ran the unions radio station. served as the Director of the Community Relations Department. and until her retirement in 1976. as the Director of the Consumer Affairs Department. Never one to stand around when there were injustices. Millie marched with Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. in the South in the 1960s. Born before women even had the right to vote. Millie spent her life fighting for womens equality.

In addition. it supports individuals who make living donations by reimbursing expenses incurred when making their donation. The United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) is based in Richmond. Virginia and serves as the clearinghouse for organ donations. On a daily basis. those who work at UNOS perform crucial work that helps save lives. They help give the gift of life.

In my view. there is no reason to vote against this substitute unless the intention is to establish legally that human life. for the purposes of Federal criminal law. begins at the moment of conception because. ladies and gentlemen. that is exactly what this bill does. To emphasize the point. let me again turn to the comments of Samuel Casey. executive director and CEO of the Christian Legal Society. who clearly states the intention behind the bill in this quote: In as many areas as we can. we want to put on the books that the embryo is a person. ... That sets the stage for a jurist to acknowledge that human beings at any stage of development deserve protectioneven protection that would trump a womans interest in terminating a pregnancy. Let there be no doubt about the intent. Anyone who is prochoice cannot vote for this bill without the expectation that they are creating the first legal bridge to destroy Roe v. Wade. Now. there is a time and a place to discuss the morality and philosophy of when life begins. This is not that time. Now is the time to change our Federal law to punish criminals who would inflict grievous injuries or death upon pregnant women on Federal lands.

On June 29. 1993. Lindas son Paul took his own life. He was 25 years old. In addition to having to accept the loss of her son. Linda had to accept the way she lost him. First. Linda attended suicide survivors meetings. She transformed herself from being a victim to a survivor. She could have stopped there but she did not. Even when she was able to accept her sons suicide. Linda realized it affected other people. All she had to do was look at her own family. Paul had left behind many relatives and friends. Unfortunately. for every family like Lindas. there are many more in Nevada and nationwide. Linda educated herself about the problem of suicide. Eventually she linked up with the Suicide Prevention Action Network and came to Washington for a National Awareness Event. This marked the beginning of Linda Flatts transformation from suicide survivor to community activist. Since 1998. Linda Flatt has made it her business. as a private citizen. to educate people in Nevada about suicide. She has not just told them it is a problem. she has told them there is a solution. Prevention is the solution. On the national front. we have developed a strategy for suicide prevention. But Nevada. which had the highest rate of suicide in the country until this year. did not. Linda Flatt did not think that was right. Linda took the national model. and started presenting it to the Nevada Legislature. She learned about State government and the legislative process. She contacted the press and the media. She lined up witnesses for hearings. She proposed resolutions and budgets. And finally. this year. the Nevada Legislature passed SB 49. which creates a State Office of Suicide Prevention in Nevada. On behalf of the citizens of the State of Nevada. I wish to thank Linda Flatt for her tireless efforts and unwavering faith. To say that Linda Flatt is a model citizen does not really do her justice. She has already made a difference in the lives of countless people and will. no doubt. continue to do so. I feel great pride in knowing and recognizing the accomplishments of Linda Flatt.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it has become clear that welfare programs created in the 1960s to be safety nets became spider webs by the 1990s. The old welfare system provided monetary assistance but did not do enough to provide job training. education. and other paths towards selfsufficiency. The welfare reforms of 1996 changed the old system and gave States more freedom to attempt new and innovative approaches to move people from welfare to work. This legislation expired last year. and Congress must look to enhance the successes of the 1996 law. I am pleased today to join Senator CARPER in cosponsoring the Building on Welfare Reform Act--a bill that will continue to help people move from welfare to work. During my time as Governor. Nebraska began programs like Employment First and Families First that provided muchneeded assistance to lowincome families and helped them find a way to leave the cycle of welfare dependency. The average time a family spent on assistance fell nearly twothirds and Nebraska taxpayers saved $14 million. The best path to selfsufficiency is work. This bill increases the percentage of welfare recipients who must work from 50 to 70 over the next 5 years. The bill also requires a 32hour workweek from able welfare recipients. States will receive credit for moving people from welfare to work. not just off welfare. This will encourage States to solve problems that present an obstacle to meaningful work and lasting independence from public assistance programs. Since 1996. welfare reform has been successful. not just because it requires work but also because it provides the resources to families to meet the work requirements. Our welfare reform proposal provides funding for childcare. transitional jobs. and publicprivate educational partnerships that will allow welfare recipients to gain the skills they need to advance in the workplace and become independent. Because a strong family is essential to breaking the cycle of poverty. our welfare reform proposal encourages families to stay together and provides assistance to families who do. Another provision provides additional funds to prevent teen pregnancy with a bonus to States that meet this goal. Given flexibility and resources. States have worked their own magic since the welfare program was revamped. and I will continue to support this approach as we embark on the next generation of welfare reform.",

The sham trial verdict that sentenced Mr. Gonzalez to 20 years in the Cuban gulag read: \" . . he managed to get his articles. which were subversive and misleading in nature with regard to the Cuban system. published in various newspapers and magazines such as Reporters Without Borders.\" Mr. Speaker. Mr. Gonzalez was 53 years old when he was condemned to 20 years in Castros gulag. The conditions in the Cuban totalitarian gulag are so atrocious as to almost guarantee that Mr. Gonzalez will not walk out if he were to have to serve the entirety of his sham sentence. Let me be very clear. Mr. Gonzalez has been sentenced to die in the gulag by the Cuban tyrant for writing the truth about Castros brutal. repressive regime. It is imperative that Cuba be free as soon as possible. so that Mr. Gonzalez and all the political prisoners can also live in the freedom and dignity that they deserve. My colleagues. we must cry out for the release of all those who languish in dungeons because they believe in human rights and freedom. We must demand the immediate release of Ricardo Gonzalez Alfonso and every political prisoner.",

Working tirelessly to overcome the obstacles of having to learn and master continually changing technology. Ms. Etchison flourished under her final boss. Sean McLanahan.

I have had the honor of working with breast cancer survivors and advocates in my community to help understand the causes of this epidemic and support those who are battling cancer. Watching their struggle has underscored the importance of federal efforts just like the creation and extension of the breast cancer stamp.

My amendment permits States and encourages States to develop new. innovative systems that promote customization of special education.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I strongly oppose this amendment. Federal funds should not be used for private school vouchers for any children. but it is particularly dangerous to do this for children with disabilities. Vouchers undermine the very foundation of IDEA. IDEA guarantees children with disabilities a free and appropriate public education and provides important safeguards to the child and the parents to ensure that education is received. When a special education child takes a voucher to a private school. all guarantees of rights under IDEA are lost. The McKay voucher program in Florida. which allows children with disabilities to use vouchers to go to private schools. is a perfect example of the pitfalls of an IDEA voucher program. In the Florida special education voucher program. there are no State reviews of the education and services being provided. and there are no civil rights protections if the parents are not happy with the education and services their child is receiving. Under the Florida IDEA voucher program. private schools can and do charge parents additional tuition and fees above the voucher. making it difficult or impossible for lowincome parents to benefit from a voucher program. Contrary to what people claim. vouchers do not increase parents choice. Private schools can and do discriminate for a variety of reasons. They can refuse to take a student for any reason. including the students disability. So when it comes to vouchers. it is not the parents who have the choice. it is the private school. Whatever choices a private school makes. it does not have to let parents or the public know why. Vouchers give private schools public taxpayer dollars. but the private schools are not held to any of the same standards of accountability that public schools are held to. Public schools must hold open meetings and make their test scores. dropout rates. and other basic information public. Private schools are subject to no public oversight. Accountability to the child. to the parents. and to the public is the touchstone of IDEA. and also. supposedly. No Child Left Behind. We must not allow vouchers to jeopardize that accountability.

These children require the utmost in flexibility in their education. and the amendment before us encourages innovative options and provides States with muchneeded flexibility. The amendment would accomplish three goals. First. it encourages States to establish innovative solutions by providing seed money to develop new programs. Second. it answers the call of parents of children with disabilities to ensure that educational opportunities are not withheld and that States may choose to implement as much or as little flexibility as the State deems appropriate. Third. it allows States to use Federal dollars in flexible programs already utilizing State resources to provide services for children with special needs. The amendment does not. as has been claimed by some critics. provide vouchers. It simply affords States the flexibility they are seeking to provide individualized options for students with disabilities. This amendment is not a mandate in any way. shape. or form. but it makes new options available for States who choose. these are only for States who choose. to want to look at new options and new technology and more flexibility in terms of meeting the needs of special needs children. of all of their children in their State. Each participating State must determine which approach and what type of program will best serve the children with disabilities in their State. including options such as public schools. charter schools. or private schools. whatever is in the best interests of the child.

Mr. Chairman. it may have been about choice the other day. it may have been about options the other day. it is about children today. No lesser authority than the United States Supreme Court has authorized the portability of Federal funds for students with special education needs. There is not a Member of this body that does not represent a State that does not have students whose tuition to private schools is paid in full under their eligibility because of IDEA and because the State determines that it cannot meet the needs of those children. This is not about mandating choice to a parent. This is about giving the option of portability to a public school system that determines that might be necessary in a special ed case. for example. a student with severe hearing disability who goes on to an audio trainer in a rural system who might be able to serve a semester or a year in another institution to learn how to use that audio trainer. or a cerebral palsy student profoundly disabled and handicapped who. through assistive technology. may have the ability to learn how to function in the public school classroom. Should we say no if a State makes that determination. and a parent chooses. to send most of the money which is theirs. the States. to follow that student? I think not. I understand the legitimate debate. and I understand the smokescreens. but I married a special education teacher. I worked all my life with handicapped children. I am not for blind programs that seem to fix things that do not. but I am 100 percent for the flexibility to address the uniquely specified needs. sometimes only temporarily. on behalf of a child who deserves the opportunity to enjoy the richness of life that every one of us without those disabilities enjoys right now in this House.

Fifty percent of those students qualify for free and reduced lunch. a higher percentage of lowincome students than in the general education population in Florida. Thanks to these scholarships. we are helping low income students receive services they deserve. This amendment will allow States to participate if they wish. a chance to benefit from the program like the McKay Scholarship Program. a program. by the way. which has an 89 percent reenrollment rate by those parents who are satisfied with the choice that the McKay scholarship affords them. Mr. Speaker. Florida has received very positive feedback from these parents and from the educational system. and the McKay scholarship continues to grow. Let us not turn our backs on these children who deserve these educational services and let us continue to help them achieve their goals.",

I appreciate the concerns of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. but unfortunately they have apparently read the propaganda from the Teachers Union rather than reading the legislation itself. This legislation does not establish a voucher program. It establishes no program at all. It simply encourages the States to innovate in a way that will empower parents with more voluntary choices so that they can meet the needs of their kids. It allows States to expand the rights of parents with more choices. to expand the accountability by giving parents more voluntary options.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the DeMint and Musgrave amendments. These are thinly veiled efforts to privatize special education in our public schools by means of vouchers. Not only would vouchers divert muchneeded funds from our public schools. but children with disabilities who attend private schools with these vouchers will be enrolled selectively and that is discriminatory. The DeMint and Musgrave voucher amendments drain resources for special education costs. Under these amendments. federal funding for special education services for all disabled children would instead be siphoned off to pay for private school tuition. These amendments would take away Federal dollars from public schools. and place additional burdens on schools and communities to serve more children with less funds. These voucher amendments would allow discrimination by private schools and fail to provide real parental choice. Worried mothers of disabled children from across the country have called my office concerned that this bill and these amendments will make it harder for them to educate their very dear and special children. These children ought not to be ignored because of their special needs. How can we justify to a mother of one of these beautiful children that their kid is not deserving of an adequate education? No child with a disability would be entitled to go to a private school of their choice under the DeMint or Musgrave amendments. These voucher amendments give veto power to private schools. The schools choose which students they will accept. not the parents. Children with multiple disabilities and those that require high cost services would likely be excluded from the program. Further. the DeMint voucher program will not pay the entire cost of tuition at a private school. meaning that some families could not afford for their disabled child to go to private school. For these reasons and the fundamental unfairness of these amendments. I urge my colleagues to oppose these amendments that deprive our Nations disabled from the education they deserve.",

It is all about meeting the needs of a group of children that is in private schools. special ed students that are there: and each one of us would certainly agree that we need to meet the needs of these students. Quite frankly. they are not being met today. Although these children generate funds and are in the count that the public school uses. the Federal dollars flow to the public school. and then these dollars very often do not reach the child in regard to purchasing the special services that they need. This amendment would rectify that by giving the local school districts an option of issuing a certificate to the parents of these special ed students on an average amount of $1.400 so that the parents could purchase the services that these children need. This makes great sense since we want to educate all children well. The children in public school have due process right with their parents. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Chuck Poochigian is an outstanding public servant but more importantly. he is a wonderful husband. father and member of his community. Anywhere you go in Chucks hometown. you will find adoring friends. supporters and. of course. the many members of his extended family. He and his wife. Debbie. have worked to achieve a balanced life of faith. family and community service and are blessed with three outstanding children. Mark. Kirk and Laura. Chuck has been a member of the California State Senate for four years and had previously served in the California State Assembly. In addition. he spent time in the Administrations of two California Governors. However. the more important measure of his outstanding service can be found in his commitment to the people he represents and to his proud heritage as an Armenian American. Chuck has managed to achieve the meritorious recognition of many prominent organizations. ranging from the California State Sheriffs Association to the California State Students Association. Throughout his career in public service. Chuck Poochigian has tempered his political ambition with a strong belief in family. faith and an understanding of the founding principles of our democracy. Demonstrating the high esteem to which he is held. The California Journal commended Chuck for his integrity. intelligence and problem solving abilities rating him as \"Rookie of the Year\" during his freshman term in office. Mr. Speaker. these accolades could not have been bestowed on a more worthy public servant. It is also fitting at this time to express how important Chuck has been to the cause of advocating the special concerns of the Armenian Community in the California Legislature and I wish to publicly commend him on his pending receipt of the Armenian National Committee of Central Californias Man of the Year Award. which is to be presented on April 12th in Fresno.

Last year. in passing the Help America Vote Act. Congress made the historic statement that the federal government does in fact play a role in establishing minimum standards in federal elections. Today. as the fight to fund the Help America Vote Act continues in the 108th Congress. it is also appropriate for Congress to consider legislation that expands voting opportunities for all Americans far beyond those of current law. Many states across the country have already taken steps to expand accessibility to the polls and encourage its citizens to vote. Now. riding the coattails of the Help America Vote Act. Congress must do the same. To accomplish this important task. Mr. Speaker. the VOTE Act takes aim at combating voter apathy through same day voter registration. early voting. no excuse absentee voting. improved registration by mail procedures. the establishment of an Election Day holiday. and guaranteed leave on election day to allow employees to vote.

Title I of the bill is linked to the enforcement provisions of the Help America Vote Act to ensure states compliance. Further. the VOTE Act requires local elections supervisors to establish early voting polling locations within the jurisdiction where registered voters will be able to vote prior to election day. Early voting must commence no less than 22 days. or three weeks. prior to election day and shall be made available to voters during normal business hours each weekday. Additionally. elections supervisors must make early voting available to voters on no less than two weekend days during the three weeks. The bill also prohibits states and local supervisors from requiring voters to provide a reason for voting absentee. All too often. voters become discouraged from voting absentee. or just voting at all. because they are required to provide a reason. This is just plain wrong.

Employees who live more than 25 miles away from their workplace are allowed to take up to three hours of leave. Enforcement of these provisions is tied into the Family Medical Leave Act.

A sixthgeneration Californian born in Sacramento. Don Novey earned an Associate of Arts degree from American River College. After concluding counterintelligence service with the U.S. Army in 1971. Don followed in his fathers footsteps by becoming a correctional officer at Folsom State Prison. This decision was one that not only shaped his own future. but eventually resulted in dramatic changes for the entire profession in California. Although he was promoted to sergeant in 1977 and became a lieutenant in 1984. Dons most significant professional advancement took place within the leadership ranks of CCPOA. Because of his discouragement over the generally negative perception and portrayal of \"prison guards\" at the time. Don ran to become the unions statewide vice president in 1979. Although unsuccessful in that bid. he was elected to the state presidency in 1980. thus beginning a 22year tenure at the organizations helm. During that time. he transformed the CCPOA from a union with little political clout to one that today is arguably the most powerful and influential organization involved in state government policymaking. Under his leadership. the level of public respect for correctional officers increased substantially. At the same time. he succeeded in winning broad support from state leaders to improve training. safety. compensation. and working conditions for his colleagues. While helping his associations membership. Don was equally responsible for helping to shape a wide array of policies dealing with public safety that have greatly benefited the people of California. Due in part to his efforts. the state strengthened its penalties for criminal behavior. especially violent crime. Don and his colleagues encouraged the California State",

While defending our freedoms half a world away. this administration is just as focused on the security needs right here in our homeland. These dual priorities are expressed in the Presidents supplemental budget request. This war budget will meet Americas needs directly arising from Operation Iraqi Freedom and our ongoing war against terror. including $63 billion for military operations. $5 billion in assistance to help our brave coalition partners and $4 billion for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to address the immediate and emerging threats to American soil. Predictably. detractors are surfacing to criticize the Presidents request. It should come as no surprise that many of the people criticizing this war budget are the same ones who have criticized all along the bold policies it would pay for. The war in Iraq and the war on terror are vital to the national security of the United States. The Secretaries of Defense. State and Homeland Security and the Attorney General have assessed their needs and asked the President for the funds necessary to meet those needs. This supplemental then reflects the informed opinions of the experts on President Bushs national security and homeland security teams. Yet the pseudoexperts say it is not enough. The ballooning of spending bills seems to be an annual ritual here in Washington. D.C.. but before we are tempted to spend money for projects unrelated to our pressing security needs. we should all remember what it is we are doing here. This is not a normal appropriations bill. Its purpose is to fight and win the war in Iraq. to liberate an oppressed people from a brutal dictator. Its purpose is to fight and win the war on terror and defend our Nation from those who would revisit on us the horrors of 9/11. Let us keep in mind the seriousness of the times and the cool deliberation required of our homeland security experts to determine our needs. We must give our national and homeland security agencies the money that they need to protect us. and we must make sure every dime we spend in the supplemental goes to that purpose. and that purpose alone.",

He has called for full disclosure of the massive unbid $7 billion contract. that is 7.000 millions of dollars. that Halliburton Corporation has just received from the Department of Defense for the reconstruction of the demolished nation of Iraq. The emergency nobid contract for Halliburton. again not competitively bid. is supposed to fight oil fires. Vice President DICK CHENEY just happened to head up Halliburton Corporation after he left the first Bush administration and before rejoining this Bush administration. Reports indicate he currently receives $180.000 per year in payments from Halliburton Corporation in the form of deferred compensation. The company apparently will be able to expand this nobid $7 billion contract. first. to operate the oil fields themselves and. second. to distribute the oil to which our Nation is so hopelessly addicted. In a letter to Lieutenant General Robert Flowers. commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. the gentleman from California said he did not mean to suggest that the Corps has intentionally misled anyone about Halliburtons contract.

This is the first comprehensive free trade agreement between the United States and a major South American country. Passing this trade agreement will help American businesses and farmers gain better access to foreign markets. Currently. Chile already has a trade agreement with the European Union. with Mexico and Canada. but not with the United States. As a result. American businesses and farmers do not enjoy the same preferential benefits and advantages that their counterparts in these countries do. Of course. that results consistently in our losing contracts to Canada. the EU and Mexico because we must pay the 6 percent tariff in Chile since we do not have an agreement and they. of course. pay nothing which makes the cost of their goods and services much less. By leveling the playing field. this trade agreement will ensure that 85 percent of United States consumer and industrial products will receive tarifffree treatment in Chile immediately. For our farmers. over 75 percent of agricultural goods exported to Chile will be dutyfree within 4 years. Furthermore. both nations renewed their commitment to continuing to work on resolving sanitary and phytosanitary issues so that artificial barriers will no longer be used to inhibit legitimate trade. . For the people I represent in the Pacific Northwest. this trade agreement will require Chile to comply with intellectual property rights protections beyond the current international standards and will improve enforcement against piracy and counterfeits. It is my hope that the IPR provisions in this agreement will be a model for our efforts with the Central American FTA and the impending Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. This agreement is not only about expanding market access. it also reflects our commitment to strengthen our relationship with our friends and our neighbors in South America. It will also underscore our commitment to move forward with a hemispheric free trade agreement through the FTAA. While twoway trade between our nations was only $6.4 billion last year. this agreement will help to expand foreign investment that will strengthen both our economies. I urge passage of this bill.",

Free trade not only creates opportunities for the unemployed and underemployed. it helps increase wages and improves the standard of living of our workers and consumers at home and abroad. It is that simple. and we have 200 years of experience to prove it. For example. free trade benefits small business. the job engine of America. Ninetyseven percent of U.S. exporters are small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Free trade benefits farmers. U.S. agricultural exports support hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nearly 25 percent of farmers gross cash sales are generated by exports. Perhaps most importantly. trade benefits families through a greater choice of goods through lower prices so more families can get better products using less of their paychecks. But. Mr. Speaker. besides the obvious economic benefits. fundamentally we must recognize that it is not nations that trade with nations. it is people that trade with people. Every American should have the right to determine the origin of the products they want to purchase. be these products from next door. down the street or even Chile and Singapore.

There is a principle involved in every piece of legislation we deal with. The principle in trade is this: If. as Americans. we build a better mouse trap. we ought to be able to sell it anywhere in the world without discrimination. If someone else builds a better mouse trap. we ought to be able to buy it for our families and for our businesses. This type of free trade is important to America if we look at the most important thing. jobs. It is important to us because now. one of every three new jobs we are creating in America comes from international trade. No one sells more than our country outside. No one buys more than our country inside. And one out of every three acres that our farmers plant are for sale overseas. so it is important that these markets are open to companies and our farmers. This is important in our State as well. It is important to Texas already. Just Chiles trade is responsible for almost 180.000 new jobs in Texas. That is enough new Texas workers to fill the Astrodome three times over. We have not even yet begun to scratch the surface of what new jobs we can create through free trade. and as the State which is the largest exporter. in other words. no one sells more. ships more overseas than our State. this is real jobs for our communities. These are real jobs for our families. But let me state that. though we have not scratched the surface. other countries are not waiting for us to get our act together.

Since the first contraction of the United States gross domestic product in March. 2001. our trade deficit has risen by 31 percent. During the same period we have lost over 2.4 manufacturing jobs. Congress should be considering measures to grow the economy and create jobs instead of agreements before us today that are just one more step down the road of growing trade deficits and lost employment. These bills represent a significant step backwards from the progress made on the Jordan Free Trade Agreement and even a step backwards from the bill authorizing fast track. Passage of these agreements will set a horrible precedent for future trade negotiations and will be an omen for even more U.S. job losses. The devil is in the details: The Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements contain only one workers rights provision protected by a dispute settlement procedure. and this is that a country enforce its own labor laws. However. the bills do not commit Chile or Singapore to even have any labor laws or to ensure that their labor laws meet any international standards. These agreements also create a totally new visa category for the temporary entry of professionals into this country. even if there is no shortage of workers in the United States. These visas are temporary in name only because the bill provides that they are renewable indefinitely. It is absurd to allow new sources of lowwage labor into this country when we are not facing a labor shortage. quite the contrary. but are facing the highest unemployment rate in 9 years. The Singapore Free Trade Agreement also is a large loophole that allows goods made in other countries to be treated as made in Singapore and imported into our country duty free if they simply pass through Singapores ports.

But that is also the failed strategy of our shortsighted trade policies: Our business community is addicted to a quick fix at the expense of its longterm healthand Americas longterm health by extension. Perhaps there will be some shortterm gains in U.S. exports because of these trade accords. Some in this body seem proud to argue that tariffs on U.S. luxury cars will be eliminated under the Chile accord. My colleagues. I am eager to see how many luxury cars we will sell to Chile. In the last three years. 2.6 million American manufacturing jobs were lost. mostly because of bad foreign trade agreements. Today. our unemployment rate is at a 9year high and American wages are stagnant. If these trade agreements were part of a grand foreign aid program to develop poor countries. I would feel somewhat better about them. After all. we would presumably be transferring Americas standard of living to the developing world. and nurturing new consumers. But that is not the case either. as the business communities in Central America and East Asia are just as myopic as the American corporate lobby. The countries this administration proposes to expand trade with have little to no environmental or labor protections. and their workers wages reflect this reality. Under this Singapore and Chile framework. these countries will not be required to abide by International Labor Organization standards. Accordingly. worker wages and standards of living will continue to be abhorrent. and American jobs will continue to be transshipped abroad. These agreements will further the gulf of extreme poverty in this world. and drag down progressive societies along with them. Mr. Speaker.

The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that the lack of an agreement between America and Chile causes our companies to lose more than $1 billion in sales each year to other countries. For example. when Chile reached free trade agreements with Europe. sales to Europe automatically increased. In fact. it expanded by 30 percent in the year just ending in February. while our increased sales to Chile were negligible at best. We did not have an agreement. Our sales faltered. Germany had an agreement. and their sales grew by almost 50 percent. France had an agreement with Chile. They grew by 41 percent. We have to ask ourselves. if these free trade agreements are so bad. why do other countries pursue them so much. and why do immediately they begin selling more of their products to Chile. and why do they start creating more jobs in their countries? We are paying a price in America for not having a free trade agreement. and. frankly. in this economy we cannot stand to lose even one American job or lose the prospect of creating more American jobs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for the past 40 years the President has issued a proclamation calling for the celebration of Small Business Week. This year National Small Business Week runs from September 15th through the 20th. Since the founding of our country. small businesses have contributed immeasurably to our progress and economic strength. Let us celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit in America during National Small Business Week. The approximately 23 million small businesses in the United States employ more than half of the countrys private work force. create three of every four new jobs. and generate most of Americas innovations. Small businesses are the backbone of this country and they are an enduring symbol of the American Dream. For example. five years ago a young couple in my district had a dream to open a grocery store in the City of Whittier. California. Their vision for the store was to specialize in fresh. ready to prepare Hispanic foods in the historic district of Whittier. Country Fresh Market has found a niche in the grocery retail market that has posted doubledigit gains from last year. Subsequently. on March 27th Country Fresh Market was featured on the Food Network in a nationally broadcast segment of Food Finds.\" hosted by Sandra Pinkney. Country Fresh Market is a business success story. and they make many contributions to their local community. including the local Boys and Girls Club and YMCAs Annual Pancake Breakfast. Since its inception. Country Fresh Market has also had four employees graduate from college and helped many of its employees purchase homes. Country Fresh Market prides itself in its employees success. because its employees are its \"familia\" (family). Country Fresh Market is a true business success in my district. As a member of the small business community. Im working to increase the SBAs microloan program from $35.000 to $50.000. By helping small businesses gain access to capital. I hope to bolster the number of small businesses that succeed each year. Today. let us honor small businesses. like Country Fresh Market. By celebrating Americas small businesses. we are keeping the American Dream alive and well for today. and for future generations.",

This compromise bill will provide libraries. throughout our nation with an additional $232 million in funding. Libraries are at the forefront of promoting our reading and family literacy efforts. This additional funding will allow libraries to maintain their traditional commitment to educating all Americans. young and old. while also furthering their work to keep pace with the development of technology by adding electronic media and new computers. This bill will also greatly benefit our museums. which showcase our heritage. art. and accomplishments. This year. more than 865 million people will visit a museum in America. Similarly. millions of students will check out their first book from their local library. and millions of families will gather for community literacy and learning programs. The role of libraries and museums in American society is critical. I personally remember my hometown library and my hometown librarian. Marther Gould. who now serves on the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. She stands as a stalwart supporter of our library system and works diligently to ensure that they keep up with 21st century technology. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 13. so it can be signed into law to ensure that our libraries and museums can continue to serve our nation and future generations of Americans.",

I rise in support of H.R. 13. the Museum and Library Services Act. which will reauthorize the library and museums program under the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The role our libraries and museums play in educating our students. adults and families is incomparable. The lifetime learning encouraged by libraries and museums across the country is something we should all support. I am particularly pleased that H.R. 13 raises the minimum State allotment. For smaller States like Delaware. this makes a huge impact. For example. with assistance from The Institute of Museum and Library Services. Delaware was able to set the model for evolving with growing technologies. Since 1996. DelAWARE. the Digital Library of the First State. has provided online information and services to all citizens with a library card. Delaware was also the first state to provide access for all its citizens to thousands of newspapers and periodicals in public libraries and remote access. The support for libraries in Delaware is seen across the country. There are more than 117.000 libraries in the United States. including public libraries and libraries in schools. colleges and universities. hospitals. law firms. businesses. the armed forces and more. In fact. a recent study found that the majority of Americans felt libraries play a unique role because they provide access to everything on the Web or in print. as well as personal service and assistance in finding it. The Institute for Museum and Library Services offers unique and vital educational services to all Americans. By funding libraries and museums. we improve access to information. improve care of collections and enhance community service. With the growing momentum and implementation of No Child Left Behind. I encourage my colleagues to recognize museums and libraries as supporting players in helping our young students and engaging their families.",

Those assumptions are part of this $87 billion today and the $87 billion is too low. and the $87 billion is not in these figures that we are talking about. We are assuming more for the $87 billion. We are not even factoring in what might come in the future. This is all part of one ball of wax. When you run a family budget. you do not take the lowest estimate. When I project my expenses in my family. yeah. there is a temptation. sure. there is a tremendous temptation to take the lowest possible estimate. We all know that that is not responsible. You take a responsible estimate. you add yourselves a little safety factor. and then you go on into the future feeling that you have at least covered reasonable exigencies.

As a 10year member of the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairsand over half of those years have been as either the ranking minority member or the chairmanI have seen the terrible unfolding of the pandemic. I have read and repeated the numbing statistics that grow more horrifying every year. In 2002 alone. 3.1 million people died of AIDS. Five million were infected with HIV over the course of the year. and 42 million people were living with the virus by the end of the year. Ten million children have been orphaned by AIDS. and that number is expected to quadruple in the next 10 years. And I have seen the reality of these statistics in individual faces. I have met with orphans. with the sick. with the dying. and with the mourning. And while most of my own experience with this disaster has been in the African context. this is not only an African problem. In India. China. Russia. and the countries of the Caribbean. the terrible statistics have begun their own march steadily upward as the pandemic is taking hold. The devastation is all the more appalling each year not just because the numbers grow. but because each year we have more tools at our disposal to fight this catastrophe. We know more about what works in terms of prevention and public awareness. we have improved treatment protocols and developed more effective methods for stopping the transmission of HIV from mother to child. But we still have not developed the will to scale up our activities and to use these tools on a grand scale. The world simply must do more.

Deuel was killed in Iraq on June 18 while on guard duty at a propane distribution center. Michael was a good soldier and served proudly in the 325th Infantry Regiments 82nd Airborne Division. He comes from a family of military tradition that he carried with him. It was the Air Force that brought the Deuel family to Wyoming where both parents served on Wyomings own F.E.

It is particularly important that at a time like this. as we address legislation and we prepare to adjourn for the month of August and return to our homes to meet with constituents that we take time to remember soldiers such as Specialist Deuel. These are the brave souls who give everything to secure the peace. Michael joined the Army so he could learn to parachute. Eventually he wanted to become a smoke jumper and fight forest fires. This too is a particularly dangerous job. and as we see through this years fire season it is critical to the survival of our towns and rural communities in the West. Michaels decision to be in the army and his goals for life after the Army paint a picture of a young man committed to his country and his fellow Americans. As operations continue in Iraq and the noose tightens around the last remnants of the regime. I offer Americas thanks to Michael Deuel and to his family. It takes a special person to answer the call to public service. It is challenging and dangerous. America remains strong and steadfast because of the courage that they have shown in the face of danger. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.

Many of these men and women go unnoticed or unappreciated in spite of their many selfless deeds. I rise to honor a native Oklahoman who not only rose to the challenge of Gods calling in his life. but was one of the greatest visionaries and faithful servants of our time. Dr. Bill Bright. a native of Coweta. Oklahoma. experienced something that. to many of us seems surreal: he was educated in a oneroom schoolhouse for over 9 years! He graduated from Oklahomas Northeastern State University in 1944. where he was known for his keen academic rigor and ability. Bill married his high school sweetheart. the former Vonetta Zachary. and moved to southern California to begin a successful confections company. Although he could have made a fortune with his small but promising empire. Bill knew that he was called to a higher purpose. Bill Bright answered that call when he found Campus Crusade for Christ. Known to many for his vigorous passion for spreading the Gospel. it is not difficult to understand why he achieved such international popularity. Today. Campus Crusades for Christ has over 26.000 employees and over 225.000 volunteers spanning 191 countries. His movie. JESUS. a documentary on the life of Jesus Christ. has been viewed by 5.1 billion people. which is roughly 5/6 of the present world population. Although these are undeniable great accomplishments. a true leader demonstrates by example. And that is Bill Bright. In 1996. Bill was presented with the prestigious Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. for his work with fasting and prayer. Worth more than 1 million dollars. Bill gave every penny of it to organizations that helped him to win that awardthose promoting spiritual benefits of fasting and prayer. My friend Bill Bright demonstrated the qualities of a true spiritual American leader. Considering his roots and his achievements. I venture to say Dr. Bill Bright is the evangelical Horatio Alger story of the last halfcentury. Those of us who have been touched by this wonderful man will certainly miss him. but one thing is for sureBill Brights vision and legacy will live on.

Where established. they have proven to be vital in controlling noxious weeds. Senate 144 aims to deal with the growing threat of noxious weeds in an inclusive manner. across government agencies. and on private lands. It is important to note that due to cost concerns. the authorization of appropriations has been reduced to $15 million per year rather than $100 million per year. Additionally. administrative costs of Federal agencies are limited to 5 percent. ensuring the money gets to the ground where it is needed. The bill. as amended. is supported by the majority and minority of the Committee on Resources as well as the Committee on Agriculture. I would like to thank Chairman GOODLATTE and the Agriculture Committee staff for their willingness to work on and approve this important piece of legislation. I urge the adoption of the bill.

This bill was overwhelmingly adopted by the other body. and it is identical to H.R. 3433 as proposed by our distinguished colleague from Missouri . This center is located within the boundaries of the Mingo National Wildlife Refuge and it provides basic training and educational skills to hundreds of atrisk students between the ages of 16 and 24. These students can learn a variety of trades Including automotive repair. bricklaying. carpentry. welding and culinary arts. In addition. they obtain critical experience. socialization skills and the confidence they will need to be successful in the workplace. The U.S. Forest Service operates 18 Job Corps Centers throughout the United States. and they have signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which transfers to them responsibility for the operation of this center. This legislation is necessary because the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act stipulates that the transfer cannot occur administratively. Both agencies strongly support this realignment.

Illinois was greatly impacted by the West Nile virus.

Illinois saw 873 cases of the virus in humans along with 60 deaths. the highest in the Nation according to the CDC. The Associated Press recently released that the harsh winters that most of the nation has felt does not preclude that the mosquitoes. particularly the ones infected with the virus. have ceased in numbers. The mosquitoes will continue to live and reproduce in sewers and other dark. warmer places were the harsh climates have not affected them.

Living donors represent a growing segment of the total organ donation pool. In fact. living donors represented over half of all donors in the first 9 months of 2002.

While the decision to become a living organ donor is an intensely personal one. I feel that it is our responsibility to remove any financial barriers that might prevent someone from making the gift of life. H.R. 399 also provides the Secretary with $10 million in new grant authority to assist State governments and public and nonprofit private entities in developing innovative initiatives designed to increase organ donation rates. including living donation. I am hopeful we will learn some valuable lessons from these demonstration projects that we will be able to apply on a national scale. H.R. 399 is widely supported.

Fewer than onethird of the 78.000. however. will receive a transplant this year. An average of 15 people die every day. one every 96 minutes. waiting for an organ that could have saved their life. Sadly. while most Americans indicate that they support organ donation. only 50 percent of the families that are asked to donate an organ do so. This is an important piece of legislation that will work towards reducing the shortage of transplantable organs. tissues. eyes. Grants will be used to assist States in carrying out organ donation awareness. public education. outreach activities. and programs designed to increase the number of organ donors within a State. This is a very important. very good piece of legislation. and I enthusiastically support H.R. 399. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Kyle is a normal second grader in New Mexico. But. when he was just nine days old. he and his family traveled to Loma Linda California for a much needed heart transplant. Every year. they make that same pilgrimage to Loma Linda for evaluations. It is 747 miles from Albuquerque to Loma Linda. The current regional transplant model with a national. governmentrun program results in fewer organs available to New Mexicans. While organs are shared over wide geographical areas. donated organs are sent out of state. I think this system has caused fewer New Mexicans to donate organs. and it has certainly impeded the decision of families to pursue a transplant. I applaud provisions of this bill which seek to educate the public on organ donation. It is by reaching folks one by one that awareness is raised. In New Mexico much of the public has misconceptions about this important issue. Since we have lost our transplant programs. many individuals decide that the travel distance. time. separation from family. and logistics are just too hampering. It is just too complicated and too much of a burden. We have some of the highest rates of Diabetes. Kidney disease. and Hepatitis B and C of any state. and yet our rates of transplants are among the lowest. We need hearts. we need livers. we need pancreases. and we need the ones we procure to stay close to home. I also reiterate support for the sense of Congress contained in his bill that refers to family discussions of donation. Encouraging such dialogues to take place will help make decisions early. There are 32 states in which being designated an organ donor on a drivers license carries no legal weight at all. It is by communicating an individuals desires with family members that counts. Oftentimes. it is a point of crisis in which a family must make a decision whether or not to donate a loved ones organs. If this is talked about beforehand. the desires of each family member can be made known. It is families that are affected by organ donation. and families that should make the decisions.",

The commendable purpose of this bill is to increase public awareness of the need for organ donation and institute procedures to increase the frequency of this brave and noble act. There is a serious shortage of available organs for donation. There are currently over 80.000 people waiting for an organ transplant and a new name is added to the waiting list every 13 minutes. As a result of the low rate of organ donation in this country. more than 6.000 people died in 2001 for lack of an available suitable organ. The passage of this bill and the implementation of its provisions will help to markedly reduce the number of such deaths in the future.

But technology alone is not enough. In many cases. survival depends on some form of transplant. Sadly. the need far exceeds the number of donors. H.R. 399 is a big step in addressing this serious demand. Educating the public about the need for donors and the ways one can become a donor is crucial. Many believe that donation only comes at the end of a life. But each year thousands get a new change at life through the generosity and courage of living donors. For the families facing the loss of a loved one. donation is a legacy of life and an example of the best of humanity in the face of tragedy. In promoting awareness of the need for do-",

This bill is a product of bipartisan negotiations between not only the Committee on Energy and Commerce but also includes key members from both sides of the aisle on the Committee on Ways and Means. and I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their very hard work on this important piece of legislation. It has been more than 3 years since the Institute of Medicine released the landmark study. \"To Err Is Human.\" The Institute of Medicine stated that our health care system is plagued with an epidemic of medical errors. However. many of these mistakes could be prevented in the health care delivery system and the way that it is delivered. With this bill. Congress is taking an important step towards reducing medical errors. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act creates a voluntary reporting system that will enable providers to learn from past mistakes. Providers could report information about medical errors to patient safety organizations who would analyze the data in confidence and recommend strategies to prevent future errors. These organizations could share knowledge with each other and with the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality so that all actors in the health care system could benefit. Congress intends for providers to take these lessons learned and modify their operations to keep their patients safer. This bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recommend which strategies for reducing medical errors would be appropriate standards for providers in Federal health care programs. No bill can prevent all medical errors. but it is our hope that this legislation will result in real differences that patients can see. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The idea of a 31.000mile trail stretching across 5 western States from our northern border with Canada. southward to Mexico. came into being in 1978 through congressional designation. For many of the same reasons national parks are established. national scenic trails are created to conserve the nationally significant scenic. historic. natural and cultural qualities of critical areas. In 1995. a group of dedicated citizens founded the Continental Divide Trail Alliance to coordinate and gain support for the completion and protection of this king of all trails. Within 2 years. the first bordertoborder inventory of the trail conditions was completed. Alliances were forged with the U.S. Forest Service. the Bureau of Land Management. the National Park Service and the equivalent State and local agencies to plan and schedule trail development projects. To date. through efforts of the CDTA. over 300 miles of new trail was built and opened to the public. Over 1.200 miles of existing trail has been improved or rerouted and hundreds of acres of land acquired or donated for the trails route. Through enormous effort by the CDTA. the trail is on track for completion and dedication in 2008. the 20th anniversary of its congressional designation. Mr. Speaker. the vision of our predecessors in this body to create the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail in 1978. combined with the dedication and passionate commitment of the CDTA represents the very best of publicprivate partnerships. Through governmental enabling legislation and regulation combined with private sector financial support and considerable sweat equity. an enormously grand conservation initiative is within a stones throw of completion. Strategies incorporated by the CDTA over the last 7 years include local constituent involvement in public lands decisionmaking process. private sector financial support for Federal government initiatives. volunteerism and youths corps and conservation stewardship all found in the USA Freedom Corps and the Presidents Health and Fitness Initiative. Mr. Speaker. I ask that the record of this House of Representatives include this acknowledgment and compliments to the members of Continental Divide Trail Alliance.

Every time a candle of hope and light is put out by one of these criminals. we as leaders must stand up and say. no more. you will not succeed in terrorizing us. We. as a moral people. will not tolerate the victimization of innocent lives. Less than 2 years ago. our veil of protection from terrorism was lifted when we experienced the worst attack ever in U.S. history. Since then we have been further linked not only to Israel but with every other nation that has ever been subject to this crime against humanity. Despite the intention of these terrorists. we have not cowered in the corner or run from the fight. Instead. it has strengthened our global resolve to stop these acts once and for all. no matter where the criminals lie. including Iraq. The Presidents position on Iraq is clear and direct. with the moral and legal authority behind him. For years Iraq has sponsored terrorism both directly and indirectly. and it is time the spotlight must shine on this issue. and it must come to an end. With our efforts to remove Saddam Hussein from power. the Middle East may have a chance to achieve something that they have not had for centuries. stability and peace. Whether our fight is alone or with others from around the world. the United States will ensure the safety of its people both here and abroad. Again. Mr. Speaker. my heart goes out to the victims and their families of todays attack in Israel. The only consolation that I can give them is that they are not alone in their time of grief or in their fight for survival. We. the people of the United States. have stood and will continue to stand with our friend Israel. God bless the United States of America.",

Chris was in the front lines on a battlefield we pay far too little attention to. He gave his life in service to the country. and certainly deserves the designation as homeland hero.

Miguel Juarez led the police department in the largest city in my congressional district. he was the highest ranking Latino official in our city. and he was my friend. Miguel Juarez at age 50 passed away and completed a distinguished career. Miguel was born in Chihuahua. Mexico. and came to the United States at the age of 1. He joined the U.S. Marines and served our country with distinction in Japan. Norway and Denmark and finished as a decorated veteran at Fort Sheridan in my congressional district. In 1979. he joined the Waukegan Police Force as a police officer. rising through the ranks continuously. until he became our chief of police in May 2001. But that only understates Miguels contribution to our community. Miguel was a member of 22 different community organizations in our town. I extend the Houses profound condolences to Miguels wife. Rosa. and his four children. Miguel was a unique man who spoke not just English and Spanish. but also Japanese. He was fully qualified as a SWAT team member. he taught gang awareness. and he accompanied me recently on a drug raid at a house in South Waukegan where I saw the professionalism and bravery of the team that he built under him. I want to extend my profound sorrow to the entire Waukegan municipal team. In the language of his original country. I would like to say. Espero que tienes un buen viaje. Miguel. mi Amigo. Tenemos muchas lagrimas en Waukegan esta noche. It says. I hope you have a good trip. Miguel. my friend. and we are extending many tears in Waukegan this night.

We ask for documentation in some cases. I do not write letters for anyone unless I know the person personally. because I know full well as an elected official. one of the first things I was told. Mr. Speaker. and I know you probably have experienced this is you do not want to write a letter for someone that later on commits a crime. There is nothing worse than doing that. We want to make sure we do the right thing. In so doing. also. the Senate has a responsibility. and. that is. to look at the candidates that come before them and to be able to ask the questions of them. and to be able to look and then make a decision based on that. Here we have a nominee that has failed to respond to questions. Maybe people would say. why not give him a chance? As elected officials. we get elected to 2 years. You might say. well. Im going to vote for Mr. RODRIGUEZ this time. Im not sure. but Im going to give him a chance. With the nominees for the Federal court. we do not have a second chance. They are there for life. I would ask you that if you are going to be hiring someone in your office. if you are going to be hiring someone in a firm. if you are going to be hiring someone and he is going to be staying with you for life. you want to make sure that you feel comfortable about making that decision.

While Mr. Hirsh was a highly successful businessman. he will be remembered. to quote the Jewish Journal. as a \"maverick philanthropist.\" Such a title was earned by Mr. Hirshs plethora of donations to various charity organizations. his service during World War II in the United States Navy. and his formation of twelve kosher kitchens for Jewish seniors in the Los Angeles area. In addition to his dedication to philanthropy. Mr. Hirsh sought to positively affect ArabIsraeli relations. In the early nineties. Mr. Hirsh and his family formed the Hirsh Family Early Childhood Development Center in Tel Aviv. While no single accomplishment defined Mr. Hirsh. his friends remember him as an altruistic man who was steadfast in his leadership. Friend and Congressman HOWARD L. BERMAN recalled Hirsh as \"a real generalist. interested in matters of the greater community.\" Mr. Hirshs dedication to community service is evidenced by his stint as president at the Jewish Federation. and in the mid 1980s. he chaired the United Jewish Fund General Campaign. Interestingly. Mr. Hirsh was the greatest contributor to the campaign. Mr. Hirsh owned the Cooper Building in downtown Los Angeles and was a former chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency in the city of Los Angeles. Employees of Mr. Hirsh at the Jewish Journal remember him as being obsessed with fair and balanced reporting. EditorinChief of the periodical.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act . This legislation reauthorizes several programs that attempt to both prevent and respond to cases of child abuse. In addition to authorizing spending for these child abuse prevention programs. H.R. 14 also expands their focus to address some of the growing problems within our child protective services system. For example. the legislation highlights the need to improve the retention and training of child welfare caseworkers. The averagetenure of these workers who deal with very difficult cases of dysfunctional families and abused children is less than two years. Such a rapid turnover rate negatively affects the systems ability to make informed decisions about the placement of atrisk children. The bill also acknowledges the importance of providing mental health and substance abuse services to some of the troubled families in the child welfare system. We know that appropriate access to these critical services is often very limitedwhich either delays the reunification of children with their families. or potentially leads to their placement in unsafe environments. As we laud this bill. we must remember that it authorizes only a few hundred million dollars a year for a whole spectrum of activities related to providing protection and permanency for children. In the context of a foster care system that spends about $5 billion a year on the placement of children outside of their homes. this is a very modest investment. We also need to keep in mind that this bill is merely an authorizationmeaning the funding must still be approved every year by the Appropriations Committee. The CAPTA grants. which the bill authorizes $200 million for next year. were funded at less than half that amount this year ($89 million). So this bill is a good step in the right direction. but we still have a long road to travel to adequately protect atrisk children. As the year continues. I hope we can emulate the bipartisan spirit of this bill and make some additional progress toward ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our most vulnerable children.",

H.R. 14 represents our efforts and commitment to once again ensure that programs aimed at the prevention of child abuse and neglect are strengthened and continue to serve vulnerable children. Its fitting that we are considering this bill today. as next week marks the beginning of National Child Abuse Prevention Month. This bill reflects our strong belief that every child in America deserves the security of being a part of a safe. permanent. caring family. H.R. 14 aims to improve program implementation. It makes improvements to current law to ensure that states have the necessary resources and flexibility to properly address the prevention of child abuse and neglect. It ensures that children are protected from abuse and neglect through best practice prevention and treatment services. It also reflects our belief that we can help achieve this goal by maintaining resources for adoption opportunities. identifying and addressing the needs of abandoned infants. and ensuring that resources continue to be available to promote family violence prevention activities. This bill also addresses the problem of child abandonment and abuse with effective solutions that can make a real difference in the lives of children. H.R. 14 appropriately addresses issues regarding child protective services across the United States by enhancing training for personnel. requiring more effective partnerships between child protective services and private and communitybased organizations. and improving public education on the child protection system. This bill enjoys bipartisan support and is widely supported throughout the child abuse prevention and family violence prevention communities. Finally Mr. Speaker.

All too often. veterans must seek treatment elsewhere simply because the VA does not have the resources to meet the need. With so many veterans living in San Diego. I see firsthand the difficulties they encounter. Just today. Petty Officer Al Kovach. a paralyzed veteran from Coronado. called my office to share his story. He was bedridden for more than a year due to a servicerelated injury. Once doctors realized he required surgery. it took 6 months for an operating room to become available. I have heard from hundreds of others who have experienced similar delays in the VA health care system. I do not see how. after the great sacrifices they have made. we can support a budget that cuts more than $25 billion in VA funding over the next several years. This astonishing amount will greatly reduce services and undoubtedly cause these waiting lists for health care to become even longer. Madam Speaker. we are in a time of war. Last week we stood before the Nation and passed a resolution in support of our military personnel fighting in Iraq. On the same day. this body approved a budget outline that communicated a very different message to the men and women in the battlefield. that when the fighting is done and you return home. do not expect us to care for your needs. I call on my colleagues to correct this contradiction. to prove that we support the men and women in harms way and to prove to our veterans that we appreciate their sacrifices. We must restore appropriate levels of funding to the health care system and other VA services. Like the young men and women fighting today in Iraq. our veterans were there when we called upon them.

The rest of the money. much of it. is allocated to other nations: $1 billion for Turkey. monies for Egypt. for Jordan. And for what reason I cannot understand.

Yet. it still fails to address our most critical need of \"hometown\" security. The lack of adequate funding to protect our hometowns exposes the United States to greater risks than those posed by Saddam Hussein. This bill provides less than half of an estimated $9 billion need for the safety of our ports. transportation systems. water supplies. and first responders. It even falls short of what the administration requested for homeland security. Nationwide. cities are spending $70 million a week to protect and prepare themselves from potential attacks at a time when state and local governments are already crippled by economic conditions. In the last two weeks since the war in Iraq began. my hometown of Portland. Oregon has spent nearly a million dollars to respond to the heightened security alert. As the State of Oregon struggles to keep schools open and to provide medical care for the neediest people. it is incomprehensible that we are not fulfilling our responsibility at the federal level to help fund critical homeland security needs. A Democratic amendment that would have added $5.5 billion for homeland security and $300 million specifically for metropolitan security needs. would have provided Oregon an additional $4 million to secure. protect. and prepare our ports. our hospitals. and our first responders against potential terrorist attacks. Appallingly. the Republican leadership blocked this and other Democratic amendments from even being voted on. There is no reason to rush this resolution through to fund the war on Iraq.

While there are many dangers in the world. the threat from this Iraqi regime stands alonebecause. as President Bush has said. it gathers the most serious dangers of our age in one place under the leadership of a merciless dictator. What if we had refused to take the necessary action to stop this Iraqi dictator from building his weapons of mass destructionchemical. biological. and nuclear? What if we had allowed him to supply these weapons to international terrorists? My friends. not long ago we came to the Floor and voted to allow President Bush to use every tool at his disposal to stop this threat to the American people and the world. We must make sure that our military has everything it needs to do the job that they have been asked to do. Under difficult circumstances. our troops continue to make good progress toward our objectives of ending the Iraqi regime. freeing the Iraqi people. and disarming the country of weapons of mass destruction. Our forces are fighting well. with overwhelming force. and have defeated every threat they have encountered. It is our obligation to make sure that they are fully supported in this endeavor. I urge my colleagues to vote for this supplemental.",

I have been anxiously awaiting this supplemental since current war operations are being funded out of this years third and fourth quarter accounts. I thank the committee for your rapid action on this bill. Our young men and women are performing magnificently right now in Iraq. as well as in Afghanistan. It doesnt matter if you agreed with the first strike policy. our troops are on the ground and operating with great professionalism. It falls to the Congress to make sure our troops have what they need to prosecute this war on all fronts. I thank the appropriators for largely keeping the control over the spending in this bill with Congress. not giving away our Constitutional authority to the executive branch. While Im glad we are addressing some homeland security needs. what concerns me is a lack of proper funding for our nations first responders. the first line of defense for us here in the United States. I was surprised the committee is recommending even less for homeland security than the president requested. September 11and the anthrax attack the following monthtaught us that we are vulnerable here in the United States. We must employ the lessons we learned from those attacks and ensure these men and women are adequately funded. We still have every reason to believe there will be a retaliatory attack here in the U.S.. and we are still woefully unprepared. That does not need to be the case. but to date we have vastly underfunded our first responders. I am disappointed the committee did not adopt",

Coast Guard funding. port and container security. plus other priorities. The constant refrain is: we cannot afford it. Heres the reality: we cant afford not to fund these urgent needs. I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to find the money new agencies of the Department of Homeland Security need to conduct the tracking of foreign nationals from countries suspected of supporting terrorist activities. something we need to be doing better. Our border stations need more money for the infrastructure to accurately and completely use biometrics in the entryexit system of our tracking programs . . . to follow both those who arent citizens and cargo originating outside the country. All the money in the bill appears to be for the Canadian border. While it was the Canadian border that the Sept. 11 hijackers crossed. the cost of increased security level along the Mexican border is being ignored. Im pleased to see money for Coast Guard operations. But our Coast Guard needs more funding for both infrastructure and operations. They are living up to their missions heroically. but their mission to protect every single mile of shoreline in the nation. We must provide complete containment security at every port in the nation. South Texas is home to 2 deep seaports--making us a vulnerable place for those who want to get weapons or people into the country. I appreciate our directing the authority for rebuilding Iraq to the Secretary of State. not the Pentagon. The Pentagon runs wars diplomats run peace. This war will touch many more of us before it is over. Already. South Texans are bearing the painful price for the war in Iraq. including young Edward Anguiano from Los Fresnos.

Of the $74.7 billion. $62.6 billion goes to DoD. Of the $62.6 billion allocated to DoD. $30.3 billion goes to cover \"sunk cost.\" which the supplemental calls \"coercive diplomacy.\" Of the remaining $32.3 billion: $13.1 billion is allocated for a \"short. extremely intense period of combat operations\". $12 billion is allocated for postwar \"mopping up\" and phasing the combat force into an occupation force. $7.2 billion is allocated for redeployment. replenishment of munitions. and repair of weapon systems. Of the $7.2 billion. about $1.1 billion goes to Iraqs reconstruction. In addition. $7.8 billion is allocated out of the $74.7 billion for aid and humanitarian assistance to Israel and Jordan and other nations as well as postwar Iraq. Out of this $7.8 billion. some $2.4 billion is identified for reconstruction and humanitarian aid to Iraq. Added to the $1.1 billion. this makes aid to postwar Iraq equal to about $3.5 billion. One must conclude. therefore. that this supplemental is probably a first installment on the cost of this war. The supplemental will not cover (1) the cost of combat lasting more than 23 months. (2) the cost of prolonged occupation by a sizeable force. or (3) our likely share of the postwar reconstruction and humanitarian aid.",

Regardless of the speed of our success in Iraq. regardless of how we personally feel about our role in Iraq. we must recognize that our Homeland needs to be our first priority for defense. We must provide appropriate funding to our first responders and our preventative Homeland defense. The Democratic substitute recognizes our pressing needs. The Democratic substitute provides additional funding for the protection of our ports and infrastructure. state/local first responders. and extremely vulnerable nuclear facilities. For example. in the Republican supplemental Puerto Rico would receive most needed resources for Homeland defense. however. the Democratic substitute provides additional resources to the Commonwealth. In fact. the Democratic substitute provides all 50 states. the District of Columbia. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. and the territories additional resources. The city of San Juan in Puerto Rico has one of the most important ports of any U.S. Jurisdictionit is one of the most popular stops for Caribbean cruise liners and one of the most active commercial ports.

This amendment would add another substantial amount of money to that figure. which at this moment in time is not necessary. This bill. this supplemental bill we are talking about is only for a 3month period of time. We will have plenty of time after that to look to the future. but for this 3month window of time. I say to the Members. this money is adequate. Could we spend more? Of course. we can shovel money out the door. but we have tried to be reasonable and somewhat restrained in what we throw out the window here at this point in time. This is a 3month expenditure we are talking about. Taking some of the gentleman from Wisconsins specifics. for the Office of Domestic Preparedness. this is money for our local responders. We provide $2.2 billion. His amendment would add another 300. but I would point out to the Members that there is already almost $1 billion of money presently allocated that is unspent. laying there waiting for our communities to ask for that money. And. number two. the 2004 budget request adds another $3.6 billion that likely will be appropriated and will be available beginning this October 1. Now. the Coast Guard: We provide $630 million. His amendment would add $100 million more to hire 2.000 more people. We cannot bring 2.000 people on board that fast. The 2004 budget request includes funds for hiring new people and. undoubtedly. we will approve that. But for this 3month period of time. this is unrealistic.

It cannot be spent until that application period is finished. Thirdly. the fire grants for 2002. They are virtually all out.

The stated goal of every Member of this body is to try to help smaller manufacturers compete. and H.R. 3598 is designed to do just that. But H.R. 3598 will only result in real assistance to manufacturers if it gets signed into law. We want something more than press releases. We want something more than the satisfaction derived from doing something worthy in the House only to have It die elsewhere. We want this signed into law. This is a good bill that can get signed into law. So what we asked the Committee on Rules to do was to craft a rule that would allow debate on all filed amendments directly related to the bill. and I emphasize that: filed amendments directly related to the bill. but only on those amendments. and that is what the Committee on Rules did. It rejected amendments from both Democrats and Republicans that were not directly related to authorizing manufacturing R&D programs run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Now. that seems like a reasonable approach. We can save for another day. and I am sure that day will come. general debates about outsourcing or specific debates about programs that do not focus exclusively on manufacturing. like the Advanced Technology Program. Indeed. any Member truly interested in funding ATP could have offered an amendment to the Commerce. Justice. and State. the Judiciary. and Related Agencies appropriations bill that we have been discussing on the floor this week. So this rule is not cutting off any House debate on broader issues that may impinge on manufacturing. There are other vehicles for that debate. The rule simply says that this important bill should not be encumbered by those debates. I should add that we had very extensive debate on H.R. 3598 in committee. We seriously considered numerous amendments from the other side of the aisle. and we accepted one amendment as offered and two others in modified form.

Following his participation in the 1989 Tiananmen Square prodemocracy student protests. Dr. Yang was added to an unofficial blacklist of expatriate Chinese dissidents. Upon his return to the country in 2002. Dr. Yang was detained and has been denied access to his family. legal counsel and due process. The resolution submitted today in the Senate coupled with H. Res. 199. strongly calls for the release of Dr. Yang Jianli and condemns the Peoples Republic of China for ongoing deplorable human rights abuses. Clearly. it is not in their interest to deny human rights to any United States citizen or U.S. permanent resident alien. Let this also be an additional chance to voice our regret and deep concern for the continual abuse of the people in China. Dr. Yang Jianli understands this better than most. He has devoted his life to the cause of democracy and freedom for the people for China and has been. once again. silenced. China must know and the world must know that denial of basic human rights will no longer be tolerated. Dr. Yang is just one of the many. who suffer daily under the harsh rule of those who refuse to embrace democracy. We must let his story and his voice be heard for the millions of others who can not speak out. Let us continue to pressure the Peoples Republic of China and let us continue to stand for what is right and just around the world.",

This bill will require the United States to negotiate in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for these institutions to relieve the debt owed them by Iraq. This legislation also includes a sense of Congress that France and Russia and all other creditors should relieve the debts owed by Iraq. While estimates of Iraqs debt range from one hundred billion to several hundred billion. the combined debt owed the IMF and World Bank is just $150 million. These institutions have the resources to relieve this debt. setting an important precedent for the rest of the world. The case for debt relief in Iraq is especially compelling. given the fact that much of the debt can be characterized as odious. Odious debt is recognized as debt that is taken on by a country for the personal benefit of corrupt leaders or for the oppression of a people. By taking the lead on debt relief. the U.S. has an opportunity to boost the Iraqi economy and to prove to the world that a major reason for U.S. action in Iraq was to benefit the Iraqi people.

MCCARTHY of Missouri. MILLER of Florida. and SANDLIN to introduce the Juvenile Protection from Sex Slavery Trafficking Act of 2004. Today. we recognize the female struggle for equality. justice. peace. and development in the political and economic process. The legislation we introduce today represents a step toward achieving those goals. This bill takes an important step toward increasing penalties against individuals convicted of trafficking predominantly girls who are bought and sold as sex slaves. This bill treats kingpins of such trafficking networks just like drug kingpins responsible for the destruction of the futures and lives of our children. The bill allows for capital punishment of kingpins who organize and operate child sex trafficking networks in the United States. These kingpins who engage in the most contemptible behavior often lure underage victims through befriending their families. many of whom reside in the poorest developing countries. and prey on their hopes for a better life. In an effort to kidnap their victims. kingpins convince parents that their children will be taught a useful trade. or they falsely promise marriage to daughters who are ultimately forced into prostitution. These broken promises often result in ruined lives and considerable suffering for the victim and the families. Mr. Speaker. in response to this despicable behavior. the Juvenile Protection from Sex Slavery Trafficking Act of 2004 makes available the strongest possible punishment against perpetrators of these inhumane crimes against defenseless children. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this legislation as a powerful step to protect the worlds children from this despicable crime. I",

President Bush has overseen the disappearance of a record 2.9 million private sector jobs since 2001. The overall unemployment rate has stalled at 5.6 percent. It would be even higher if it included 1.7 million Americans who are no longer searching for employment. The Hispanic rate rose from 6.6 percent to 7.4 percent. The manufacturing sector shed 2.8 million jobs in 3 years. job losses that disproportionately hurt Hispanics. Last month. President Bush predicted 2.6 million jobs would be created in 2004. But how can we trust him? His own advisers did not stand by his predictions. The administration later stated that they overestimated the number of jobs the President would create. The Presidents predictions are continually wrong. In 2002. he predicted 3 million jobs would be created in 2003. As the residents of the Inland Empire know all too well. those 3 million jobs never materialized. The administration still does not get it. They claimed that letting manufacturing jobs move to China is good for the economy. They claimed that what is needed are cuts to Social Security and Medicare instead of rescinding the tax cuts to wealthy Americans. Because of inaction. Hispanics and other minorities are being hit hard. We are out of work at higher rates than ever before. Unemployment benefits are ending. Food banks and hunger organizations report that more people are asking for help. We are marching towards a jobless recovery. Corporate profits are expected to rise by 17 percent this year. but average wages for those who have jobs have fallen. Hispanics and other minorities are suffering. No one is hiring. Their benefits are gone. and people do not know what to do. We need to help the unemployed. We need to give them job training. unemployment benefits. and health care. We need to stop the outsourcing of jobs overseas. Unless Congress and the administration recognize the problems that face the American worker. the unemployment rate will rise and our economy will not recover.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was unhappyalthough not surprisedto see the Presidents most recent assault on programs that provide housing for people in great need. The administrations 2005 budget proposal calling for deep cuts in the section 8 program will have many harmful effects if it is enacted. and among those who will be most damaged by it are people with disabilities. Recently. the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force documented the great social harm that will result if we adopt the Presidents approach. This coalition. as Members can see by looking at the list of signatories of the document I am here inserting into the RECORD. broadly represents the major organizations in this country representing the needs of people with disabilities. To quote from this Consortiums conclusion. The CCD Housing Task Force strongly believes that the Administrations Flexible Voucher Program proposal would significantly erode housing assistance for the poorest people with disabilities. We believe this proposal actually undermines stated Administration disability policy goals designed to promote community integration under the New Freedom Initiative an end chronic homelessness. Mr. Speaker. the deeply flawed proposal the President has made to restrict section 8 housing vouchers will be one of the most important issues we will be debating in this Congress. No group has more to tell us about it than the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities and I ask that the very important position paper of the Consortiums Housing Task Force be printed here so that Members will have the benefit of it during this debate.",

On behalf of the 9th Congressional District. I would like to thank them for their tireless and devoted service. The Tuskegee Airmen are a noble and proud group. Their legacy as the first African Americans ever to qualify as fighter pilots is remarkable and worthy of preservation. These efforts helped pave the way for generations of AfricanAmerican soldiers. officers. pilots. sailors. and Marines. The Tuskegee airmen didnt lose a single bomber they escorted during the World War I1. Further. their story holds many valuable lessons to be shared with future generations. The principles of life. liberty. and democracy that they fought for and strengthened serve us all today. After liberating Europe. they returned to their homes and hearths to pursue the fight for equal rights. for which we are in their debt. The Bay Area Original Tuskegee Airmen are: Reuben B. Bilbo. Samuel Broadnax. Dr. Richard Caesar. William A. Campbell. Le Roy Gillead. James C. Goodwin. Arthur C. Harmon. Calvin C. Hobbs. Harold Hoskins. George J. lies. Alvin J. Johnson. Dr. Wendell Lipscomb.

The various Jewish communal organizations are active on a variety of fronts. including efforts to alleviate poverty and social distress. The participants in the organizations that make up the JCPA are themselves individuals who give freely to charity. and understand in part because of this that while private charity is extremely important. it is no substitute for wellfunded government programs that meet social needs. Drawing on their experiences in this regard across the country. the attendees at the Plenum of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs adopted a resolution. which called on the Congress \"to reject efforts to make permanent the 2003 tax cuts.\" As the resolution notes. \"to feed the hungry. clothe the poor. heal the sick. and educate our children. our Federal Government requires the resources that come from tax revenue.\" This does not mean that the council opposes all of the tax cuts previously enacted. but this strong statement against the proposal to make permanent all of the 2003 tax cuts deserves very serious attention. given the moral credentials of those who enacted it. Mr. Speaker. because this is one of the most important questions that will be facing us in this Congress.

It hurts the economy because It puts doubt in peoples minds about the underlying strength of the American economy. And any economy is in part based on confidence. So when the Vice President was talking about recession back in December. that set off a string of newspaper headlinesBy the way. the newspaper headlines: \"Support for Bush Falls on Economy . . . \" after a whole day of speeches on the part of Democrats belittling this economy.

This is a crisis that is preventing patients from accessing highquality health careor. in some cases. any care at allbecause doctors are being driven out of practice. It is a crisis that is needlessly increasing the cost of health care for every American. This is not the first time we have addressed this issue. As many of you will recall. we debated. and passed. medical litigation relief in the Commonsense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act back in 1995. Unfortunately. the language we passed was stripped from that bill in conference. I am sorely disappointed thatin the ensuing eight yearswe have not addressed this problem. As a result. the situation has become worse. not better. the problem has expanded. not shrunk. We must act now if we are to fix the crisis in health care delivery this has caused in many parts of our country. I was pleased last summer when President Bush announced his desire to address this issue. I am even more pleased that the President has continued to emphasize the importance of the problem and the need for reform in speeches around the country. and in his State of the Union Address. We in the Senate welcome the Presidents support in this effort. Make no mistake. We have a health care crisis in this country. one that is due in large part to litigation that is out of control. But not all Americans may be aware of just how serious are the ramifications of this crisis. This map. with data supplied by the American Medical Association. shows the states that currently are experiencing a medical liability crisis and those that are showing signs of developing a crisis. The 18 red states are in crisis. The 27 yellow states are showing problem signs. Only five states are currently \"ok\". On a map with last years data. only 12 states were in crisis. The problem is growing and it reaches from coast to coast. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a July 18. 2002.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. the gentleman from California . for his thorough commitment to the right causes. and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for being on the point. According to the latest U.S. Government estimates. some 800.000 to 900.000 people worldwide are trafficked across borders each year for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Although men are also victimized. the overwhelming majority of those trafficked are women and children. In addition. trafficking in people for prostitution. domestic servitude. and forced labor is an increasing area of international criminal activity. The reasons for the Increase in trafficking are many. In general. the criminal business feeds on poverty. despair. war. crisis. and ignorance. Trafficking is considered one of the largest sources of profits for organized crime. generating 7 to $10 billion annually. according to United Nations estimates. The largest number of victims are annually trafficked from Asia and the Pacific region. according to the U.S. Department of State. The growth of sexual tourism in this region is one of the main contributing factors. Mr. Speaker. as my colleagues know. Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. which strengthened many provisions of law dealing with trafficking in persons for sexual and other exploitation. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 is critical to maintaining the progress already achieved. H.R. 2620 authorizes new strategies for prevention. including using trafficking victims to identify traffickers at the borders and to deter sex tourism. It increases protection by making measured expansions of the visa category for trafficking victims. It also improves cooperation with respect to State and local trafficking prosecutions. which are increasingly the front line of law enforcement in this area. This legislation will also enhance the prosecution of traffickers by ensuring that trafficking is treated like the organized crime that it is. Mr. Speaker. we should also be very concerned about human trafficking and human rights that are violated right here in this country. H.R. 2620 coordinates Federal efforts by ensuring a comprehensive report on United States antitrafficking actions and by establishing an interagency group to ensure compliance. I urge my colleagues to support this mostneeded legislation. and I thank those who are sponsoring this piece of legislation.",

I want to thank my colleagues ANNA ESHOO and JOHN SHIMKUS on the House Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on this issue and moving this to the floor as quickly as possible. Improving public safety is a constant struggle. as I have learned working on improving 911 services for the Houston area and the entire state of Texas as a state legislator. Enhanced 911. which will allow folks in trouble to be located by rescue crews and police just by dialing three simple numbers. is a necessary next step. It is critical because many times when a wireless caller calls 911. they either cannot talk or they do not know where they are. The technology exists to help people in dangerI saw successful demonstration at the FCC just last week. And this legislation addresses the technical issues for industry. local government. and regional concerns. so no further delay is justified. While lives are being saved in my area of Harris County where we are Phase Two complete for E91 1. lives are still being needlessly lost in other areas where compliance is lagging. Unfortunately. many other jurisdictions. including many in large rural areas of Texas do not have the resources necessary to upgrade their 911 systems. We are not all safe when we travel on the roads until E911 is up and running nationwide. Public safety should be a top priority. States moving E91 1 funds to other purposes deceives wireless consumers who saw that E911 funding on their cell phone bills. Coming from Texas.

This legislation. modeled after the successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). is designed to decrease the review time of new animal drugs at the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This legislation is essential to the health of pets and livestock. as well as food safety. CVM is currently experiencing sizable delays in its review of drug applications. These delays are problematic for CVM. drug sponsors. pet owners. veterinarians. and livestock producers. Simply put. the CVM needs an infusion of funds to address review shortcomings. The slowdown of the approval process threatens to reduce the tools available to livestock and poultry producers to produce vibrant stock and to combat animal disease. The slowdown of the approval process also threatens the health and well being of family pets and zoo animals. Further. delays at CVM have a chilling effect on the animal health industrys investment in important research and development. threatening the pipeline of new products. In conclusion. this is a very modest program. but one that is desperately needed. The pace of animal drug reviews has slowed in recent years and the FDA needs the proper resources to hire more reviewers. Please join me in supporting S. 313. The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003.",

Mr. Speaker. we wouldnt stand for that kind of delay for people. and I dont think that Mans Best Friend. or the livestock that feeds all Americans. should have to either.

Kids are being used as guinea pigs because pharmaceutical companies havent done the testing necessary to ensure that their products are safe and effective for kids. Many of us have been fighting for several years to \"codify the rule.\" and I am anxious to work on legislation that would do that. As important as animals are. nothing is more important than the health and safety of our children. It is high time for us to put the interests of our children first.

Franklin was the printer of official currency for the colonies of my great state. Delaware. as well as Pennsylvania. New Jersey and Maryland. Furthermore. the official United States half dollar from 1948 to 1963 bore Franklins portrait. Until 1979.

H.R. 13 contains a provision that will amend the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act to increase maximum limits on liability amounts. It is important to pass this provision that would raise the cap so that museums are able to obtain valued exhibitions from overseas. The current cap is preventing museums from receiving the total amount of indemnity coverage that they need. forcing them to buy commercial insurance. Many museums simply cannot afford commercial insurance. This provision will allow museums to continue benefiting from the Arts and Indemnity Program. which has benefited millions of Americans by allowing valuable works of art to travel to U.S. Museums.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for the fourth consecutive session of Congress. I am introducing the Personal Information Privacy Act (PIPA). which would help restore individuals control over the use of their Social Security numbers and personal information. Over the years. the Social Security number (SSN) has unfortunately become a de facto national identifier. SSNs are required to receive a drivers license from every state. and many companies require consumers to provide their SSN as a condition of doing business. This means that should ones SSN fall into the wrong hands. it can be used to steal ones identity. run up thousands of dollars of false charges in your name. and wreak havoc on your credit history. The issue of identity theft has grown to be the largest single complaint received by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). and curbing the rampant use of the SSN-\"the key to identity theft\"-is paramount in reducing identity theft and restoring citizens ability to protect their personal information. Under this legislation. PIPA. businesses would be prohibited from refusing to sell goods or services to individuals that do not want to provide their SSN. Furthermore. without written consent. ones SSN could not be used for commercial purposes or used as an identifier. Neither could information on products or services bought by an individual and where they were purchasedknown as transaction historiesbe sold to third parties. Lastly. individuals would be permitted to seek redress for violations of this measure in civil courts. with the statute of limitations beginning to toll three years after the offense was discovered. PIPA would also establish penalties for the use of Social Security numbers without a consumers consent of up to $25.000 for a single offense. and up to $500.000 for repeated violations. Any victim of identity theft could tell you the difficulty of restoring ones credit and good name. Identity theft is on the rise. and topped the FTCs consumer fraud list for the third year in a row. Unless action is taken to curb the widespread use of SSNs as identifiers or as a condition of doing business. this crime will continue to harm increasing numbers of our citizens. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. and give Americans the ability to better safeguard themselves from identity theft.",

It is with great regret that I feel compelled to vote against the IDEA reauthorization bill. I had looked forward to voting on a bill that finally provides adequate resources for students with disabilities. their families. and teachers. I had looked forward to voting on a bill that would continue to protect the unique needs of children with disabilities. Unfortunately. the measure offered by the majority failed on both these counts and does a disservice to the teachers and the children that they serve. I am profoundly disappointed that once again our Congress has failed to live up to the funding promises of the original Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. passed in 1975. The original bill recognized our federal responsibility to help states provide a free and appropriate public education to students with disabilities. While the original law promised to fund 40% of states costs to educate these special needs children. Congress has never funded more than 18%. Without appropriate funds. schools are caught in a failing balancing act. trying to provide adequate resources to students with disabilities while also meeting the needs of typical students. I know the rural schools in the First District of Texas simply cannot wait any longer for the relief they so badly need. We should have finally committed ourselves to fulfilling the promise of IDEA with mandatory funding for these students. Anything less is unacceptable. I am also deeply concerned regarding the discipline provisions in H.R. 1350 for children with disabilities. No one believes that teachers and principals should not have the right to discipline students. However. this bill eliminates protections that children with disabilities deserve in consideration of their limitations. Current law requires schools to determine whether a students actions were the result of a disability before determining a punishment. This new bill does not do so and puts more students at risk for suspension or expulsion. It is",

I first met General DeKok when he assumed command in August 1996 of the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base in my district. SMC is the Air Forces preeminent procurement center for spacebased systems. including the nations sophisticated surveillance satellites and technology to track and intercept enemy missiles. Commander of SMC for only two years. General DeKok excelled in motivating people. His loyalty. warmth and kind personality are virtues for which he will be remembered. Under his leadership. SMC continued its tradition of excellence and continued to produce many of the high quality spacebased systems necessary for the war fighter of the 21st century. General DeKoks activities and passion centered on the frontiers of outer space. He served in numerous space plans and operations positions. from detachment level to space policy work in the White House. and commanded two space wings. While serving at the Pentagon in 1983. he coordinated the Air Force Space Plan. During his assignment to the White House National Security Council. he helped develop and coordinate the U.S. National Space Policy that was signed by President Reagan in January 1988. Prior to assuming his last position as vice commander of Air Force Space Command at Peterson AFB. he served as deputy chief of staff for plans and programs at Headquarters U.S. Air Force. where he was responsible to the secretary of the Air Force and the chief of staff for planning. programming and manpower activities within the corporate Air Force. General DeKok retired from the Air Force in April 2002 after 34 years of service and joined TRW Inc.. which was later acquired by Northrop Grumman Corp. At the time of his passing. he was vice president and deputy general manager of Northrop Grummans Command. Control & Intelligence Division. Roger DeKok deserves the thanks of a grateful nation.

Improving Education Results for Children with Disabilities Act of More than two decades ago. the federal government imposed special education mandates on states and local school districts. Ever since then. the federal government has struggled to fund those mandates. Our nations special needs children require a special commitment. And Im pleased that this Congress has met that commitment with this IDEA renewal and reauthorization bill. It is important to note that since 1996 when Republicans regained the majority of this body. overall federal IDEA funding to states and school districts has increased by 282.3%. From 1996 to 2003.

Throughout the broadband debate over the past two years. we have all heard from carriers of all shapes and sizes. They have very different business plans and different opinions on the way competition should proceed. The one common message from all of these disparate companies. however. is a strong and urgent call for regulatory certainty. Individual investors. Wall Street analysts and companies alike all demand it. I fear that the recent FCC action on the Triennial Review threatens to exponentially increase regulatory uncertainty for the telecommunications sector. I fear lawsuits all across the country that will drag out resolution of these important issues for many years to come.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to introduce the Voter Protection Act. Unlike most socalled \"campaign reform\" proposals. the Voter Protection Act enhances fundamental liberties and expands the exchange of political ideas. The Voter Fairness Act accomplishes this goal by lowering and standardizing the requirements for. and the time required to get. signatures to qualify a Federal candidate for the ballot. Many states have unfair rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for minor party and independent candidates to get on the ballot. I want to make 4 points about this bill. First. it is constitutional. Article I. section 4. explicitly authorizes the U.S. Congress to. \"At any time by law make or alter such regulations regarding the manner of holding elections.\" This is the authority that was used for the Voter Rights Act of 1965. The second point I would like to make is an issue of fairness. Because so many states require independent candidates to collect an excessive amount of signatures in a short period of time. many individuals are excluded from the ballot. For instance. there has not been one minor party candidate on the Georgia ballot since 1943. because of Georgias overly strict ballot access requirements. This is unfair. The Voter Protection Act corrects this. My third point addresses those who worry about overcrowding on the ballot. In fact. there have been statistical studies made of states that have minimal signature requirements and generous grants of time to collect the signatures. Instead of overcrowding. these states have an average of 3.3 candidates per ballot. The fourth point that I would like to make is that complying with ballot access rules drains resources from even those minor party candidates able to comply with these onerous rules. This obviously limits the ability of minor party candidates to communicate their message and ideas to the general public. Perhaps the ballot access laws are one reason why voter turnout has been declining over the past few decades. After all. almost 42 percent of eligible voters have either not registered to vote or registered as something other than Democrat or Republican. The Voter Protection Act is a constitutional way to reform campaign laws to increase voter participation by making the election process fairer and open to new candidates and ideas.

This legislation is needed to provide some regulatory relief to small PHAs who do not have the resources or time to do these HUD annual plans by themselves. Currently. small PHAs are having to hire expensive third parties to complete these annual plans. Furthermore. an indirect result of this bill would give executive directors of these small PHAs more time to focus on the important needs of their tenants. The exemption of these smaller PHAs will not have an adverse impact on the ability of tenant organizations to continue to have input with the managers of their developments. Language was incorporated into the legislation to ensure tenants participation. Additionally. I want to assure my colleagues that this legislation will still require smaller PHAs to provide the forwardtype thinking and advance planning as required under the 5year plans. The larger question. however. raised by this legislation is whether the planning requirements for smaller and larger PHAs alike can be a useful tool. It appears that the jury is still out on that question and the Committee will review the issue to determine how we can provide as much flexibility to the Public Housing Authorities. decrease unnecessary regulatory burdens as well as ensure that tenants have a stake in the communities where they live.

As a leading critic of the Laotian government in the U.S. House of Representatives. I am very pleased that this legislation has made it to the House floor today. and believe it speaks directly to the questionwhich has been hotly debated in recent years--of whether or not we ought to grant Laos Normal Trade Relations status. As most members of this House know. I am staunchly opposed to our nation providing the brutal regime in Laos with any improved relationship until it gets its act together on a whole host of issues. Granting Laos NTR before we see some real movement toward change is illadvised. inappropriate. and just plain wrong. In support of H. Res. 402. I am asking today for a number of important items to be read into the RECORD. First. an article that recently appeared in the Appleton PostCrescent on the case of Houa Ly. one of my HmongAmerican constituents who went missing at the ThailandLaos border in 1999. Second. a pair of letters 21 other Members of Congress and I sent to the administration last year. detailing many of the problems we see with the Laotian government. and reiterating our opposition to NTR for Laos.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a long time supporter of Hmong veterans and their families in Wisconsin and across the United States. I am pleased to be a cosponsor and express my support for House Resolution 402 which calls for democratic and human rights reforms in Laos. Many Americans dont realize the vital role Hmong soldiers played in the Vietnam War. School history books often ignore that before U.S. soldiers even landed in Vietnam or Laos. CIA agents arrived to train young Hmong men and women to fight against their oppressors. These brave Hmong fought valiantly for democracy and for freedom for their people. They rescued downed American pilots and took bullets that otherwise would have found their way to the bodies of American soldiers. In defense of their country and in service to U.S. troops. nearly 40.000 Hmong troops were killed. approximately 58.000 were injured in combat and more than 2.500 are still missing in action today. These numbers dont begin to represent the thousands of Hmong soldiers and civilians hunted down and massacred by communist forces after the U.S. armed forces began their withdrawal from the region in 1975. The survivors lost many loved ones and lost their homeland. The United States owes these veterans a great deal. Edgar Buell. a former senior U.S. official working with the Hmong during the war years. best summed up their dedication to the U.S. and western democratic principles when he said. \"Everyone of them that died. that was an American back home that didnt die. Somebody in nearly every Hmong family was either fighting or died from fighting . . . They became refugees because we . . . encouraged them to fight for us. I promised them myself: Have no fear. we will take care of you. Yet. we hear reports that the persecution of the Hmong in Laos continues to this day. with charges of starvation. families being separated. and other acts of violence. Over the last twenty years. thousands of Hmong have settled in Wisconsin and other places across the United States. sharing their tragic history and brave sacrifices with their fellow Americans. On their behalf. we must fulfill Edgar Buells promise and encourage the government of the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic to stop civil rights violations against the Hmong and others. and allow free and open political activities in Laos.",

That is why I strongly support this important bipartisan resolution brought to the floor today by the chairman and ranking democrat on the Committee on International Relations . This resolution condemns in the strongest possible terms Irans continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community about its nuclear programs and activities. For example. Iran failed to properly disclose the existence of a fuel enrichment plant and facility at Natanz. until both were revealed by an opposition group. It confirmed that it had conducted research on uranium conversion processes. but only after it denied doing so. According to a February report by the director general of the IAEA. Iran continues to engage in deception regarding its nuclear activities. This resolution also calls on the United States. as well as all state parties to the treaty on NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. to use (and I quote) \"All appropriate means to deter. dissuade. and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\" The fact is. our national security demands that we do everything in our power to prevent Iran from developing and acquiring nuclear weapons. The Iranian governmont is hostile to the interests of the United States. It is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a committed enemy of the state of Israel. our staunch ally and the tone democracy in this most volatile region. It is vital that we speak with one voice on this issue of utmost gravity.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Iran has repeatedly denied that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons. But it is increasingly difficult to conceive of any other plausible explanation for its efforts to enrich uranium and develop other nuclearrelated capabilities. And even harder to understand why else it would try so hard to conceal these activities from the international community. As reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has failed time and time again to comply with its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has also failed to provide a full disclosure of all nuclear activities to the IAEA. and engaged in a pattern of lies and deception. Since Irans covert nuclear program was exposed to the world in February 2003. IAEA inspectors have found traces of highly enriched uranium. discovered that Iran had reprocessed a small amount of plutonium. and forced Iranian officials to reveal critical information about advanced centrifuge designs and components. These and other revelations about Irans nuclear program are even more troubling in light of Irans extensive ties to international terrorist organizations. According to the justreleased State Department report on Patterns of Global Terrorism. \"Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2003.\" The report notes that some members of aIQaeda \"have found virtual safehaven\" in Iran. while Iranian authorities continue to provide Hezbollah. Hamas. Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other radical terrorist organizations with \"funding. safehaven. training. and weapons.\" Iran also continues an aggressive program to develop ballistic missiles. According to the Congressional Research Service. Iran has hundreds of shortrange missiles. and possibly 1020 longrange Shahab3 missiles. which may be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Mr. Speaker. Iran has absolutely no need for a nuclear deterrent. Over the last two and a half years. we have taken care of Irans only two enemiesthe Taliban and Saddam Hussein. Nor does Iranwith 7 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and the second largest natural gas reserves on the planet--have a demonstrated need for civilian nuclear power. We must continue to make it clearto our European allies. who have generally favored a more conciliatory approach to Iranand to the unelected rulers in Tehran. who continue to lead the Iranian people down this perilous paththat we will not sit idly by and allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons state.

Hams have formal agreements with federal agencies such as FEMA and private relief organizations like the Red Cross. Hams are federally licensed volunteers and provide a variety of important communications services that protect lives while using their own equipment without compensation.

Burdensome regulations are imposed on amateur radio operators making it difficult. and in some cases impossible. for them to erect antenna vital to their communications capabilities.

In some cases. when the homeowners associations have found these antennas. the Hams were forced to take it down. Amateur Radio operators. who work with local disaster communication groups. are finding it more difficult to erect antennas. Sometimes homeowner associations arbitrarily forbid installation of any kind of antenna.

Mr. Speaker. NPR News a couple of weeks ago had a report about why gas prices are now over $2 a gallon in some States and very high everywhere. The reporter explained that while demand has gone way up. as everyone has known it would for many years. capacity has gone way down. He said due to environmental restrictions. no new refineries have been built in this country for more than 20 years and the number of refineries in California has decreased from 37 to 13. The gentleman from Texas mentioned that 170 refineries have closed since 1981. A previous speaker said some refineries are making record profits. Well. if we decrease the number of refineries even more. they will make even higher profits. Also. radical environmentalists have successfully fought and stopped oil production in the frozen tundra of Alaska and most other places where it can be safely and environmentally and economically done in the U.S. Environmental extremists almost always come from wealthy or at least very upperincome families. but they are really hurting the poor and lowerincome and working people of this country and even our national security by shutting down so much oil production and refining here and making us overly dependent on foreign oil that is being sold at ripoff prices. Some environmental groups want gas prices to go to $3 or $4 a gallon so people will drive less. but that would be another nail in the coffin of small towns and rural areas where people often have to drive long distances to get to work. We need to support this and other proconsumer energy legislation so we can bring gas prices down or at least hold them stable. I urge support for this legislation.",

Indeed. since 1981 the number of refineries has been reduced by 52 percent. In that time. total refining capacity has declined by 9.8 percent. Recent increases in the refinery are due simply to some efficiencies as opposed to the adding of additional capacity. Mr. Speaker. while our production is declining. demand for refined products is projected to increase substantially between now and 2025. We will meet the demand for additional refined products either by producing that product here in the United States or importing it from abroad. This bill is needed to restore manufacturing jobs and capacity in this country. Counties where oil refineries have closed in the last 20 years have an average unemployment rate of 6.8 percent. significantly higher than the national average.

Our refining situation in the energy industry is dismal. We have not built a new refinery in 25 years. Experts will tell you that U.S. refineries are unlikely to spend capital on expansion because they have already earmarked $20 billion to comply with burdensome government regulations. There just is not enough money left over to expand. We are maxed out. Our refineries are operating at 95 percent. Even if we recover more oil. even if we spur domestic production and reduce our dependency on foreign oil. we cannot refine it. We actually. if we do refine some extra oil. we have to send it to a foreign country to add value to it. and we have to buy it back like a Third World country. Due to our shortage in refining capacity. simple disruption can lead to wild price swings. For example. as refineries switch from winter to summer gasoline blends. prices in California increased by 40 cents a gallon. In 2000. gas prices in Chicago shot up by 50 cents a gallon due to refining problems. We are neglecting the state of our refining ability. but today we can do something about it. The Refinery Revitalization Act will streamline the regulatory and approval process for the restarting of refineries and construction of new refineries. It is just unbelievable we have not modernized our refineries. Mr. Speaker. could you imagine if we did not build a microchip processing plant or an auto assembly line for the next 25 years? Where would those industries be? By passing this legislation. we will update our ability to add value to our oil. reduce the cost of gasoline. and stabilize our energy economy.

We hear all the problems of the crises of imported crude oil. What many people do not understand. or they believe. is that we import refined product. the gasoline that goes into peoples tanks. Seven percent is imported from foreign countries. We must and we can do better. These countries that are importing refined product. they get the valueadded benefit of refining the crude oil. They get the jobs of refining that product. They get the jobs of building those refineries. They also get the tax benefits from the national government and the local level. We can and we must do better. That is why I applaud my colleague for bringing this bill to the floor. In Illinois over the past year we have lost 220.000 barrels per day of refined capacity with the closure of three refineries. With the number of boutique fuels in Illinois. this has led to large price spikes when problems occur in other refineries. The most recent refinery closure resulted in the loss of 300 jobs. The number of refineries in the United States has gone from 324 in 1981 to 153 today. In Illinois alone. we have decreased from 11 refineries to four. This bill protects existing environmental regulations on clean air. and what better place than to address the siting issues than to put them on old. abandoned refinery sites. So people who know and have lived and now have these abandoned refineries. it is brilliant to say let us get these sites that are abandoned back into use. Mr. Speaker. this Is a critical issue at a time of not just high demand for crude oil but demand for product. It is unconscionable that we import refined product. In fact. the Governor of Illinois recognized that when he ordered the reopening of a closed refinery outside of my district to help ease the supply of refined product. This specifically will help Lawrenceville with a closed facility and Wood River. Illinois.

Existing U.S. refineries are already operating at or near full capacity because this country hasnt added new refineries in almost three decades. As Director of Energy at USDA during the 1970s Arab oil embargo. I find that not only hard to believe. but unacceptable. EPA implemented tougher Clean Air Act regulations. including a program that requires refiners to take expensive steps to cut factory emissions when they expand capacity or build new plants. Many refiners couldnt meet the requirements and have gone out of business. Now. we only have the capacity to meet about 90 percent of our gasoline needs. This is especially significant in Michigan where we have just one refinery leftthe Marathon Ashland plant in Detroit. In addition to federal law. the state of Michigan also needs to consider changes in state law and regulation that will encourage the building of more refineries in Michigan. U.S. laws requiring dozens of different regional gasoline formulations have created unusual fuel requirements that are not easily met by foreign refiners. Each formulation requires different pipelines and trucks for different parts of the country that increase the cost. A shortage of clean tankers available to ship gasoline from overseas is yet another bottleneck. This adds to the cost at the pump. and leads to regional price shocks when refineries experience interruptions in their production. Under this bill. many areas in Michigan would be eligible as a Refinery Revitalization Zone. including Wayne County. where Michigans last remaining refinery is located. I stand in favor of H.R. 4517 because this will help the Midwest region lower its 6 percent gasoline supply deficit and reduce some of the highest pump prices in the nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this rule. Last night the Committee on Rules issued a rule that even experts in this House on House rules could not initially decipher. On the one hand. they finally acted to close loopholes in the Homeland Security Act which allowed corporate expatriates to continue to receive government contracts. after the House voted 318 to 100 in July 2002 to prohibit those contracts. But. on the other hand. and it seems there is always another hand these days. they specifically left open a provision that would have prevented just such a contract from going through. Under this rule. it is almost certain that Accenture will be able to retain a massive $10 billion contract with the Homeland Security Department. This runs directly counter to the will of the Committee on Appropriations. Last week. on a strong bipartisan vote of 35 to 17. the Committee on Appropriations voted in favor of an amendment which I offered along with the gentleman from Arkansas to close loopholes in the Homeland Security Corporate Expatriate Contracting Ban and to stop the department from moving forward on this $10 billion contract to Accenture. E 1400 This is a company which reported that its American earnings increased by over $319 million in 2003 while. at the same time. its U.S. tax liability decreased by $239 million. Yet. today. the Republican leadership is hiding behind technicalities to reward a company which has shunned its American citizenship in order to reduce their tax liability. It is wrong. It is shameful. You ask any American worker or a responsible corporation that pays their taxes. and yet they go overseas so that they will not have to pay their taxes. and whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. they will tell you that going offshore. not to pay your taxes and coming back for a $10 billion contract from the Federal Government. it is an outrage. This company set up a shell corporation overseas and put two taxpaying American companies. companies which employ thousands of Americans in many of our districts. at a competitive disadvantage. This sends a terrible message to every good corporate citizen in America. We cannot afford to reward companies who shun American citizenship at the expense of loyal American businesses and contractors. It offends our values as Americans. Mr. Speaker.

If you look at the additions that we have made in spending in the area of national defense. particularly in light of the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq. we have spent in the neighborhood of an additional $150 billion or so in the defense of this effort. The truth of the matter is. our additional spending on homeland security dwarfs by way of comparison and yet in both instances we are at war. We are at war against an enemy who desires to destroy us. an enemy who will exploit our vulnerabilities. and what we should be doing is debating in an open way whether or not we believe we should be prepared to deal effectively with these threats.

The issue that the Capps motion raises is not something of a partisan nature. If a Member represents a coastal State. they should be concerned. whether Republican or Democrat. over what is taking place in this energy bill in conference. And Members should be especially concerned if their constituents support the Federal offshore oil and gas leasing moratoria that have long been applied to both the east and west coasts. For what we are dealing with here is the proverbial camels nose under the tent. When this body considered the energy bill last April. an amendment was offered by the gentlewoman from California . the gentleman from Florida . and the gentleman from Florida to strike a provision which would have required that an inventory be conducted of all oil and gas resources in the outer continental shelf. regardless of whether those resources fall within an area closed to oil and gas leasing by Presidential or congressional moratoria. That amendment passed by voice vote. and it passed by voice vote for a simple reason: if taken to a rollcall vote. it would have been approved overwhelmingly. Yet today we find that this very same language has been slipped into the draft energy bill conference report. The question then occurs. who is responsible for this language reappearing. I asked the majority side: Who is responsible for this language reappearing? When the CappsDavisMiller amendment was offered to the House version of the energy bill last April. the gentleman from Florida asked our colleague. the gentleman from Louisiana . the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. pointblank whether it was his intention to support the reinsertion of this provision being removed at that time in the conference committee. In response. the gentleman from Louisiana said. and I quote. \"It is not my intention to recommend the reinsertion of this language. no.\" Page H3312 of the April 11. 2003.

I call that our stickyourheadinthesand energy policy. Our Nation needs to be aware of the energy options. The energy bill has research funding and incentives for the development of fuel cells. solar power. and other renewable resources. So why can we not know much natural gas is offshore of our country? When natural gas prices are above $5 per thousand cubic. we need to know what can be done about it. That is more than twice what our economy is used to. Cleanburning natural gas is used to heat homes. generate power. and is feedstock for chemical and plastic manufacturing. and as fertilizer. There is not enough LIHEAP money out there to help all Northern consumers this winter. Power bills are going up and farmers cannot afford fertilizer. Members all talk about the loss of our manufacturing jobs. The manufacturing jobs that are in danger on the Gulf Coast are petrochemical manufacturing jobs that are in danger of moving offshore in search of cheaper natural gas. which means more manufacturing jobs in this country. period.

It appropriately ensures that the Secretary of Commerce will consider any appeal of a consistency determination in a timely manner so that all concerned will have the certainty of a decision. and this provision is not outcome determinative but merely sets forth a time for the processing of one appeal in a regulatory process that involves various Federal agencies. each dealing with its own area of expertise.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. this resolution asks that the House affirm that the United States and the world is a safer place today with the removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime from power in Iraq. Who can argue with that? Saddam Hussein. a tyrant that is responsible for so many thousands of deaths. a tyrant that has used weapons of mass destruction in the past. There was a famous frontiersman who said. Be sure you are right. then go ahead. That was reported to be Davy Crockett. I think that is what we are about a year later. after going to war against Saddam Hussein and Iraq. A colleague of ours mentioned earlier. this whole thing was about judgment. Well. I would submit that it is also about responsibility. it is also about accountability. and it is also about credibility. Why do I say that? Because when we talk about the world being a safer place today. I want us to remember that 55someodd families are without their loved ones today that have been killed in Iraq carrying out this war. I saw into the eyes of Sergeant Ricos widow who asked me why. And I told her that we were very proud of the sacrifice that had been made by her husband and by her family. But she continued to ask me why. And that is why I think it is about responsibility. Did we do the responsible thing by attacking Iraq and Saddam Hussein when we knew that he had nothing to do with 911? It is also about accountability. A year later. we are finding out that he did not have weapons of mass destruction. And. obviously. it is about credibility. because if we as the last superpower are going to benefit from credibility. we have to be patient. we have to understand what the threat is. and we have to act responsibly. That is what I think this is about. I am going to support this resolution. as I support the men and women in uniform. But this whole issue is about those three words: responsibility. accountability. and credibility.",

Mr. Speaker. we are just about a year to the day that America with our very brave forces invaded Iraq. So it is coming up to the moment where we commemorate those that serve. those that did serve and lost their lives. through a resolution that is on the floor. This resolution has good parts to it. Of course. we commend our troops who are second to none. They are the best led. the best equipped. and the best performing troops in the world. the best military. But this resolution is not necessarily a celebration. nor should it be. Because what it does not include are the sacrifices that have been made: 558 American troops. 101 allied troops. and some 10.000 Iraqi citizens have died since this war began. They are not mentioned in this resolution. Where is our commitment in this resolution? It should be stated and restated in more than one \"whereas\" about the 115.000 troops in Iraq with all the protective gear that they should have. Nowhere in this resolution do we affirm or reaffirm our commitment to our troops and veterans. Today the House Committee on the Budget cut over $1 billion. So there is a bit of double speak to this. Nowhere in this resolution are the people that serve in our intelligence community. some of the most dangerous jobs that anyone could ever have. are they set apart and thanked in this resolution relative to Iraq. Turn on the TV sets. Iraq is not safe. There are more people that have lost their lives today. There are more fires. there are more blowups. So this is a very sobering resolution. And I think the good parts of it should be underscored. But we have not been allowed to add to it the things that I just stated that I think should be very much a part of it.",

I will support this resolution as an expression of our Nations gratitude and pride of our men and women in uniform who were ordered to war in Iraq by their Commander in Chief. Whether you are for or against the war. the fact is we are there now and we need to support our troops. These military servicemembers are working around the clock to make Iraq a better place for the Iraqi people. Many of them have left their young families behind to serve their country. and they deserve our thanks here on the floor of Congress. I recently returned from Iraq as part of a bipartisan group of Members from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I truly believe that good intelligence is the best way to prevent terrorist attacks in our country. as well as Iraq. The members of our intelligence community who are also working on the dangerous front lines of this war deserve our gratitude. They serve in silence with little thanks. I was proud to join with my Republican colleagues and visit the Iraqi police training academy and honor 23 Iraqi police officers killed in a recent bombing. Even in the face of tragedy. the resolve of the Iraqi people to take back their country and start governing themselves was strong. Mr. Speaker. this resolution should have simply expressed our support for our Armed Forces working and living in harms way. Regrettably. however. the majority has handled this resolution in a manner intended to divide us. not unite us. Mr. Speaker. I share the view that the Middle East and the world are better off without Saddam Hussein and his brutal regime. but success must be our only exit strategy. When those goals are accomplished. we can say with certainty that the world is a safer place. We owe our military men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country in Iraq nothing less.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. exactly 1 year ago the first bombs blasted in Baghdad and the United States christened a shameful new military doctrine. the preemptive war. against a regime that for all its vicious cruelty had not provoked the United States or our allies. We were told by the President that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our national security with a link to al Qaeda. which is fiction. And our own weapons inspector concluded that weapons of mass destruction did not exist. Where was our intelligence? What were we working on? After September 11. countries throughout the world clamored to give the United States support in the global fight against terrorism. But after bombing Iraq without multinational support. the United States lost the moral authority we once enjoyed around the rest of the world. Today. 1 year later. Iraq remains mired in chaos. It is becoming a breeding ground for terrorists. nowhere near ready to assume the responsibility of a democracy. For this we have sacrificed nearly 600 American lives with thousands more wounded. 27 today have already been killed in Baghdad with hundreds injured. If this Congress wants to support the troops. we should work to equip every soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan with the best equipment and supplies available. including hydration water systems. We would ensure them the benefits they have been promised and they deserve when they return home. But we do not talk about that in this resolution. Tomorrow I will introduce a resolution called Smart Security. Smart Security is about prevention. not preemption. It sees war as a last resort to be considered only after every diplomatic solution has been exhausted. It calls for more robust multilateral institutions to prevent terrorism. manages international conflicts and promotes global stability. since smart security is tough. pragmatic. and patriotic. It is smart and it would keep America safe and it supports our troops.",

They have made huge sacrifices. their families have. In many cases. the soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice in their response to the call of their country. As a member of the committee that oversees the Intelligence Community. let me also add my gratitude to the incredibly hardworking men and women of the Intelligence Community whose role in Iraq is less public but no less vital and in many cases is every bit as dangerous. These dedicated public servants should have all the tools they need to accomplish their mission. So rather than simply commending the Iraqi people for their courage and their accomplishments. rather than simply thanking these brave men and women In the U.S. armed services and Intelligence Community with words. we should see that they have what they need to do their jobs. This resolution today. I believe. has different motivation than simply to honor our troops. It really is more about the House of Representatives patting themselves on the back than it is to honor our troops. It perpetuates a simplistic thinking that took us into the war with unexamined intelligence. and clearly there were deficiencies in the intelligence that took us up to and into that war. It perpetuates the simplistic thinking that left our troops unprepared for the postwar occupation. and it perpetuates a kind of divisive thinking. I mean. what can be more divisive than a closed rule that allows no amendments. no substitutes. really nothing to make this a better resolution? It is not enough to say thanks in words to 550 families who have lost someone in Iraq. They want more than thanks and words. Same for the more than 3.000 families of the wounded.

The criticism I and many others have is of the political leadership which I think misused the intelligence and made faulty decisions. The gentleman talked about people who work in dark places. I did not talk about the Vice President. I do not know how he got into this debate. The point about what we are saying is this. We now. without weapons of mass destruction. without a tie to al Qaeda. have been told that the rationale for this was essentially to extend democracy. I am in favor of extending democracy. although extending it by military invasion is a difficult policy. There are plenty of undemocratic. tyrannical governments in the world. and I want to oppose them. but I am not generally for invading them. But what troubles me is that in the name of advancing democracy internationally. the majority is debasing it at home. No one can think. who understands the tenets of democracy. that this procedure today comes close to it. There is no justification whatsoever for this legislation to have been drawn up and then brought to us without amendment. Will someone explain to me why this could not be amendmentable? Were we too busy? That would not pass the laugh test. The reason is that the majority is afraid that if amendments were available. it would bring into discussion things they do not want to talk about. Of course. we support the troops. Voting for or against this resolution is wholly uncorrelated to supporting the troops. A resolution that simply congratulated the troops would have been passed unanimously. What we have here. frankly. is an effort to use the troops for political purposes. It is an effort to say that because Americans are proud of our fighting people. we will put into a resolution some phrase for them which contains a number of other politically more controversial items. we will bring it forward in a way that does not allow the democratic process to go forward. I hope the Iraqis will not be watching this and think that this is the way a democracy should work. that it should be up or down. that the Constitution should not be amendable. resolutions should not be amendable.

Not long ago the United States. on the order of the Commander in Chief launched a cruise missile attack against a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. destroying the facility and taking human life. At the time. the action was justified by the President and his administration on the grounds that the alShifa plant was involved in the production of chemical weapons and had ties to Iraq and possibly al Qaeda which had just bombed two U.S. embassies in Africa. What was the administrations basis for making these claims? What was the entire intelligence record that backed up this military action? This represents the entire intelligence on the alShifa plant. Yes. the entirety of the intelligence record connecting the alShifa plant to chemical weapons production was this. a single soil sample collected by a friend of a friend of a source. That is it. The Intelligence Community did not know who actually owned the plant or have any other clear and convincing evidence to connect alShifa to weapons of mass destruction production. all it had was a bit of dirt and many unanswered question. Yes. the information gaps were emphatically stated in the intelligence record of the day. None of these caveats were expressed by the President or his administration. and I believe the President picked this target himself. Now.

After she committed suicide. he had her husband arrested and executed. Now. because of the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Forces. Saddam is behind bars.

Runaway and \"throwaway\" episodes among our Nations youth are a widespread problem. with one out of every seven children and youth in the United States running away or being turned out of their home before the age of 18. A recent study by the Department of Justices Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention estimates that nearly 1.7 million youth experienced a runaway or throwaway episode in a single year. The primary causal factors of running away or being turned out are severe family conflict. abuse and neglect. and parental abuse of alcohol and drugs. All of the conditions that lead young people to leave or be turned out of their homes are preventable. However. we need to make interventions available to strengthen families and support youth in highrisk situations. Successful interventions are grounded in partnerships among families. communitybased human service agencies. law enforcement agencies. schools. faithbased organizations. and businesses. Preventing young people from running away and supporting youth in highrisk situations are a family. community. and national responsibility.

This lack of action made it potentially easier for criminals and terrorists to acquire 19 previously banned assault weapons that could be used to harm innocent Americans. Adding insult to injury. the House of Representatives last week passed legislation that would make families in the Nations capital even more susceptible to gun crime. The misnamed District of Columbia Personal Protection Act. which passed the House last week. would repeal a local law in Washington. DC that bans the sale and possession of unregistered firearms. requires firearm registration. imposes commonsense safe storage requirements. and bans semiautomatic weapons in the District. Should this bill become law. tourists and especially those who live and work in our Nations capital will face a considerably greater threat of gun violence. According to the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence. this biHl would roll back gun laws in D.C. to a point that it would be legal to possess a loaded assault rifle on city streets without a permit. Over the strong objections of local leaders. the Republic~ancontrolled House made the unwise decision to take up and pass this legislation even as we face the increased threat of terrorism. Hopefully the Senate will not make the same mistake. Unfortunately. instead of making progress on the issue of gun safety. we seem to be retreating. Instead of strengthening laws that would help prevent future gun crimes and terrorist attacks. they are being weakened giving potential criminals and terrorists easier access to weapons that have no place on our streets.

The October 4. 2004 edition of the New York Times contains a piece furthering this argument by one who is uniquely qualified to do so: retired General Romeo Dallaire. who was the commander of the United Nations forces in Rwanda during the genocide. Ten years ago. General Dallaire pleaded for more troops to stem the rising tide of murders that were sweeping across Rwanda. Instead of sending reinforcements. the United Nations cut his peacekeeping force from 3.000 to 500. leaving Dallaire and his troops to witness the mass killings that they did not have a prayer of stopping. In the aftermath of this decision. 800.000 people died in 100 days. Ten years ago. the African Union promised battalions to stop the killing but lacked the equipment and logistical support to come to the assistance of Dallaire and the people of Rwanda. Those forces never arrived in any numbers. Today. genocide is again taking place. this time in Sudan. Secretary General Kofi Annan has recognized it. President Bush has recognized it. But again the world is essentially standing by. Last month. the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Operations appropriations bill which provided $75 million to support an expanded African Union mission in Darfur. Sudan. This bill is now in conference. It is vitally important that it pass with this measure and additional assistance for Sudan relief efforts intact. President Clinton has said that failure to act in Rwanda constitutes his greatest regret as president. That is not a failure that we can bear to repeat. It is not enough for the international community to recognize genocide. This time. we actually have to stop it.

The Lake Champlain ecosystem and regional economy have been seriously impacted already by invasive species. many of which dispersed to the lake from the Hudson River by way of the Champlain Canal. Eurasian Milfoil and Water chestnut have rendered much of southern Lake Champlain unusable for recreation and stripped value from waterfront properties. Hundreds of thousands of dollars each year are spent to control these plants. The sea lamprey has devastated our sport fishery. and large amounts of money are being spent on control. with only mixed results. These are just a few species. Once here it is nearly impossible to eliminate these invaders and even marginally controlling them is hugely expensive. Other invasive species have not yet reached Lake Champlain but have spread widely throughout the Hudson and/or Great lakes drainages. We know they are coming and must act now to keep them out. These include fish like the Asian carp. Eurasian ruff. round goby. alewife and tench. Any one of these could change the Lake Champlain ecosystem in catastrophic ways. and each is moving toward the basin. Invertebrate species such as the spiny waterflea and fish hook flea. as well as aquatic plants are also of concern. Because of the success of the dispersal barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. we are looking for a similar barrier for the Lake Champlain Canal to keep more invasive species out of Lake Champlain. A barrier will also protect the Hudson River drainage from invasive species that may arrive first from the north. like a particularly damaging fish. the tench. We must move quickly to complete design. and to construct a dispersal barrier in the Lake Champlain Canal. Time is of essence.",

It is time to put this debate to rest. and it is time to abolish this Nations antifamily tax policies. When we pass this legislation. this House is making a statement that we as lawmakers will not stand for a Tax Code that punishes married couples. To place an additional tax burden on married couples simply because they are married is crazy. The Federal Government cannot be passing tax laws which are designed to drive people apart rather than bringing families together. It is counterintuitive. Unfortunately. many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say. well. who cares. After all. they say. the government needs more money. and we should be the ones to decide who to redistribute the wealth to based on our concept of what is good. Mr. Speaker. I believe the Federal Government should have tax policy that has three fundamental caveats: it needs to be progrowth. it needs to be proopportunity. and. most importantly. it needs to be profamily. Social engineering has been practiced by the other party. and it has had very negative results on our society. Mr. Speaker. this House must pass H.R. 4181 to ensure that the marriage penalty relief is made permanent. The majority in this House has been an advocate for families by passing needed tax relief for hardworking families. expanding the child tax credit. Passage of this bill shows that this House is committed to this Nations families. A fallback to the old fashioned and antifamily tax policies that this Nation faced prior to President Bush taking office is unacceptable. Mr. Speaker. I call on my colleagues to support our Nations families and to support H.R. 4181. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. and I will be very proud to go back home and tell my constituents that this House is working for them and for their families. Vote \"yes\" on H.R. 4181.",

Are we saying single people deserve more of their money back than married people? We need to do all we can to make the Tax Code fairer. Passing H.R. 4181 to extend full marriage penalty relief through 2010 and beyond so that marriage tax equity becomes a permanent law is a great first step.

The trust is. we are debating whether Congress should continue to finance tax cuts out of Social Security and Medicare. The budget deficit this year is already more than half a trillion dollars.

By contrast. the Democratic plan would provide more than twice as much tax relief without threatening economic growth.

Yes . . . there is also a \"marriage penalty\" that occurs when Social Security benefits are taxed. As a result.

Thanks to the peculiarities of the tax code. when married couples earn roughly the same salaries. they tend to pay more in taxes than they would if both were single filers. Our previous action to extend this tax relief benefit has encouraged marriage and saved the average married couple $1.400 a year. allowing them to spend on items that support their families. This discrepancy financially penalizes couples for doing nothing more than choosing to get married. which creates a strong disincentive for people to build families. With a breakdown of the family and high divorce rates. we need to strengthen marriagenot weaken it. As every study shows. children fare best and have the most promising life prospects when they are raised in intact families. Promoting marriage has the potential to significantly decrease poverty and dependence. increase child wellbeing and adult happiness. and to provide the safest environment for women and children. Mr. Speaker. letting the tax penalty relief expire would cost families $1.400 a year. The federal government should not be picking pockets of people just because they are married. If we do not extend the marriage penalty tax relief today.

Marriage is the highest form of commitment between a man and a woman. and we should be encouraging this unionnot penalizing it. Since the 1960s. this archaic standard has been penalizing married couples for simply filing their tax returns as husband and wife.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of H.R. 4181. to making permanent the repeal of the Marriage Penalty Tax that has helped 30 million married Americans since 2001. Married couples rely upon this tax relief for purchasing a new home. saving for their childrens college education. and setting up retirement savings plans. Now. nor ever. do I see a reason why nearly 1.1 million married couples in New Jersey should be repenalized and forced to pay higher taxes simply because they decided to get married and start a family. Allowing this tax benefit to expire would also be counterproductive to the strength our economy continues to show. Americans scored a major victory in 2001 when Congress and President Bush addressed one of the most unjust provisions of the tax code by reducing the Marriage Penalty Tax. Congress furthered our commitment last year to reducing taxes under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. where Congress accelerated the seven year phasein of the marriage penalty relief. As a result. today. the standard deduction for married couples stands at $9.500twice the value that it is for a single individual. and the upper limit on the 15 percent tax bracket for married filers is twice the income limit for single filers. Under current law. each of these tax benefits for married couples will be reduced next year and fully expire in 2010. if we do not act to make the repeal permanent. If Congress does not act. beginning in 2011. the standard deduction for married couples will be reduced. forcing 30 million more couples to pay more taxes. The Marriage Penalty tax is inherently unfair. The Federal Govemment should not force working couples. through an archaic tax code. to pay higher taxes. The Marriage Penalty Tax weakens the foundation of one of societys most sacred institutions: marriage. We cannot turn back the clock after making such great strides in providing this sensible. meaningful tax relief. And quite frankly Mr. Speaker. families are counting on this relief. So today.

Improving the fairness of our tax code is a laudable goal. The Bush tax policies passed by Congress have added significantly to our national deficit. Congress need not continue to exacerbate the budget while providing reasonable tax relief. As this legislation is written. over $100 billion will be added to our national deficit.

In contrast. the Democratic substitute provides marriage penalty tax relief to more Americans than the Republicans bill. but pays for it in a fair manner by limiting tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

The Republican bill denies full marriage penalty tax relief to 13 million families next year. including more than 25 percent of the middleclass families making $75.000 to $100.000. by failing to fix the inequities caused by the current alternative minimum tax system. The Democratic substitute also provides immediate marriage tax penalty relief to more Americans by increasing the value of the Earned Income Tax Credit for more lowerincome working couples. The Republicans fail to give these families immediate relief in their bill. Again. the Republican bill demonstrates the misguided priorities of the Republican Party. Rather than ensuring that all hard working families get marriage tax penalty relief. the Republicans have decided to bankrupt this country to ensure that their fat cat rich elite donors continue to get away with paying absurdly low taxes.
