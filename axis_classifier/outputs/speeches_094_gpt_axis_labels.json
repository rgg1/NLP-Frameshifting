Budget. Labor and Public Welfare. District of Columbia. Armed Services. jointly. pursuant to the order of January 30. 1975. The message is as follows: To the Congress of the United States: I herewith report four new proposed rescissions and six new deferrals as required by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. In addition. I am transmitting two supplementary reports which revise deferral reports made to the Congress in previous special messages. Five of the reports contained herein CXXI- 682Part 9 are withholdings in the fourth quarter of funds authorized under the Continuing Resolution for the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. Resolution of two of these items might be better served by action upon the Administrations appropriation request for health planning and emergency school aid in the Second 1975 Supplemental Appropriation bill now pending before the Congress. The items I am submitting in this special message. along with other actions I have already proposed. provide a means of restraining budget outlays and thereby can help hold the fiscal year 1976 budget deficit within reasonable bounds. When I signed the tax reduction bill on March 29. 1975. I noted that the estimated 1976 deficit had reached about $60 billion and was threatening to go as high as $100 billion. Such an enormous deficit could generate another inflationary spiral and might well choke off any economic recovery. I will continue to resist every attempt to add to the deficit. The details of the rescission and deferral reports are attached.",

It found that the backers of the petition were merely using this device to gain their real aimrestrictions on the traditional rights of American citizens to own guns. However. a recent ruling by a Federal court in the District of Columbia forces the Commission to again consider this backdoor petition. My bill would prohibit the Commission from making any ruling or issuing any order that restricts the manufacture or sale of firearms. firearm ammunition or components of firearm ammunition. including black powder or gun powder. In my view. Mr. President. the Congress. in establishing the Consumer Product Safety Commission. made it clear that the Commission was to take no action respecting firearms. In Its decision of last year with respect to the petition. the members of the Commission recognized that congressional prohibition.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as every Member well knows. April 15 was the deadline for filing Federal income tax reports. It is at this time of year when American citizens are most acutely aware of our tax system and it is the most appropriate time for beginning consideration of legislation to correct existing inequities. Therefore. I am today introducing legislation which will permit American workers to deduct their social security taxes from their taxable gross income. In the midst of a recession. taxes are pinching the pocketbooks of American workers even harder than normal. The social security tax. one of the most regressive taxes ever enacted. has increased at a faster rate than any other tax in the years since World War II. It has gone up even more rapidly during this period of inflation and is now the highest tax many working Americans pay. This bill will reduce the burden of social security payments on citizens who find this tax most oppressivethe young wage earners of America. This bill will grant $8.4 billion in tax relief to the working members of our society by simply making social security taxes paid a deductible item when figuring Federal income taxes. As shown by the attached chart. a worker earning an annual income of $8.000 would receive $80 in tax relief by claiming a deduction from gross income for payment of social security taxes. At an income level of $15.000. the tax relief would be $181. and at an income level of $30.000. it would be $264. Mr. President. the heavy burden of social security taxes upon working Americans troubles many Members of the Senate. This bill is intended to make the tax unburdensome. Mr. President.

To date. 87 countries have ratified the United Nations Genocide Convention. which was adopted unanimously by the U.N. General Assembly almost 30 years ago. The United States. sadly. is not on the long list of nations which have ratified the convention.

We would not want to see something rushed through this body without adequate thought. without adequate debate. I heard the statement made by our colleague from Rhode Island. in which he referred to something akin to the dead hand of the past. the rules being promulgated many years ago. Yet if we just thumbed through the rules. on the first page we see some amendments. As we go through the rules of the Senate we see amendment after amendment. many of them made in the 19th century. but more of them made in the 20th century. This is a live set of rules that we have here. It is something that has been promulgated over the years in a very thoughtful way. It is not the Constitution. but it is somewhat akin. insofar as this body is concerned. to the Constitution of the United States.

Section 1321 of the Senate committe amendment prohibits the States or theii political subdivisions from imposing taxes on any vessel. barge. or craft engaged in the interstate transportation of commerce on the navigable waterways of the United States. My amendment excepts those waterways that lie entirely within the boundaries of a State. The committee amendment applies to waterways that form boundaries and to waterways that lie totally within the boundaries of a State. Admittedly confusion and conflict can result in the first category. I realize that a little paperwork may be involved for the barge lines. but the principle is far too important for us to set this precedent. Is the next step to limit taxes on railroads. airlines. buses. and trucks involved in interstate commerce? Federal funds have been expended and the same jurisdiction can be presented. I feel very strongly that we should not limit the taxing authority of States except in unusual and flagrant situations. I have seen no explanation in the report of the Finance Committee to indicate abuses or unusual hardships that have been created under the present law. Consequently. I believe that we should not place this prohibition on the States and their political subdivisions especially when the navigable waterways lie entirely within the boundaries. Let me quote the administration position: The Federal Government has. over the years. imposed relatively few constraints on the power of States to impose taxes. The fact that current State tax practices impose recordkeeping and financial burdens upon barge operators is not a sufficient reason for the Federal Government to prevent the States from imposing taxes on this form of transportation. Similar taxes are imposed on other forms of transportation. I agree with that conclusioft. However. realizing a potential problem for waterways that form the boundaries in midstream. my amendment is restricted. I urge acceptance of this amendment. I have checked with those who were interested in this amendment. It has. I think. been cleared with all those who would have an interest in it.

It amounts to this: If they are building a new highway and they have to relocate a utility. whether it is a water line. a natural gas line. or an electric line. the governmental subdivision makes a contribution to the utility for the relocating of the line. Under the rule that has prevailed for 50 years. that contribution is not taxable. but neither does the utility get to add it on for the basis of rate making. neither does the utility get to take depreciation on it. It merely lessens the cost of the construction. I cannot imagine that the Congress of the United States would permit it for long. But if this becomes taxable. and if the subdivision of Government. whether it is the District of Columbia or some other. pays a million dollars to relocate some lines and the Federal Government takes half of it in taxes. how are they going to relocate the lines? If they get the money from elsewhere. then the money goes into the ratemaking. and the customers ultimately pay the bill. This proposal has applications that .affect individuals. For example. in my area. we use natural gas as a means of energy to pump water to irrigate. Sometimes there will be a farmer a little distance from a natural gas line. The gas company says to him. \"If you will pay x dollars of the cost of running the line there. we will extend you that service.\" That is a contribution to capital. Under the rule that has prevailed for 50 years. that is not income to the utility. consequently. it cannot be included in the ratemaking which would result in higher costs. neither can it be depreciated.

I have long been concerned about the growing danger that inadequately controlled noise presents to the health and welfare of the Nations population. particularly in urban areas. An article by David Dempsey in the New York Times Magazine of November 23. 1975. cites estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency thatMort than 16 million people in the United States already suffer from hearing loss caused by noise. and another 40 million. not including workmen. are exposed to its potential hazards without knowing it. Several research reports have documented the delerious effects of the worldwide noise pollution of our environment. First. Psychologists Sheldon Cohen. David Glass. and Jerome Singer discovered that young children who were exposed to higher background noise levelssuch as busy highways. railroads. airports. and myriad other deterrants to the learning process--suffered decreased learning abilities. frustration. and loss of concentration. In learning to read. these children were less likely \"to distinguish between speech relevant and speech irrelevant sounds\" due to their noisy environment. Further. because of jet noise in school classrooms near hundreds of major airports. teachers. and pupils have to cope with \"jet pause\" teaching. Because of this noise emission factor. teachers and pupils suffer a loss of up to 20 percent of their instructional day. as well as a destruction of the spontaneity in the teachinglearning process. Second. several studies by Dr. Samuel Rosen. Helen Rosen. and P. Olin have documented a high positive correlation between dietary factors and deafness. Third. the socioeconomic consequences of excessive noise emission have been noted by the WorldHeatlh Organization in estimating that \"noise costs the United States $4 billion annually in accidents. absenteeism. and compensation claims.\" In his article. Mr. Dempsey notes these and other authoritative findings and points to recent effects to educate our population to the dangers of noise pollution and to encourge the American public to become conscious of decibel levels in their environment.

Thornton Wilder was one. I can pay no greater tribute to him than to say. I learned from him. And I believe I am not alone in this. We will all miss Thornton Wilder. his perceptive but compassionate insights and his extraordinary ability to speak to a great many of us with a single phrase. At a time when events increasingly seem to lack order and form in a world that grows more and more complex. we most need men like Thornton Wilder to help us shape our perspective on the world and on ourselves. This was an author who only wrote on one subject. but it was one he came to know a great deal about. His only subject was. very simply. human experience. Thornton Wilder was hungry for human experience. whether through his travel. his writing. or through his relationships with a great variety of individuals: some famous. some infamous. some rich. and some poor. Thornton Wilder thrived on the vitality of human experience perceived through the eyes of the individual. He managed to condense much of that vitality and experience into his seven novels and two major plays. Again and again. his work has been reread and revived by people who believe that Thornton Wilder knew something about themselves that they had not yet realized. Once. he said: I am interested in the drives that operate in society and in every man. Like his writing. this comment on himself was simple. direct. honest. and true. Connecticut will miss this author. teacher. and individualist. So will humanity.

Such a complaint seems justified in the case of the Genocide Convention. There is no doubt that Senate ratification of the Genocide Convention would be a step toward peace. It would outlaw genocide and establish procedures for the trial and punishment of genocidal acts. Ratification of the treaty will deter the crime and therefore promote peace. yet the Senate has failed to act. This failure. Mr. President. stems in large part from the Senates failure to perceive the convention as a moral statement. a statement of basic human concerns. I think it would be worthwhile to recall the preamble to the convention: The Contracting Parties. Having considered the declaration made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution 96(I) dated 11 December 1946 that genocide is a crime under international law. contrary to the spirit. and alms of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world. Recognizing that at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity. and Being convinced that. in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge. international cooperation is required.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the possibility that a default by New York City on its outstanding bonds and notes would have a large ripple effect upon the municipal bond market has been widely debated. Many experts say that the effects upon other cities and States would be severe. that many well managed government units would have difficulty marketing bonds. Others say that the market would adjust smoothly to a New York City default. that only those cities which are in poor financial shape would be penalized in the marketplace. One reason why the municipal bond market is not likely to adjust smoothly and efficiently to a major municipal default is that there has not been a major municipal default since the 1930s. The bond marketing agencies and the public. until the last few months. have considered municipal bonds to be thoroughly secure investments. Municipal securities will be viewed very differently in the future. more financial information will be sought and it will need to be analyzed more carefully. The market is not prepared today to perform its proper role. Neither the financial information nor the municipal analysts are presently available to perform the demanding task of distinguishing the quality of municipal bonds in a way that rewards soundly managed municipalities and penalizes poorly managed municipalities. Prof. Edward F. Renshaw of the State University of New York. an expert on the municipal bond market. has studied the question of the ripple effect and concluded that there would be a large. damaging ripple effect on municipalities which are well managed as well as those which are not. That ripple effect. he believes. would arise for the same reason that the market failed to detect New York Citys fiscal weakness sooner: there is a current. shortage of both municipal analysts and hard information on the financial condition of cities. Professor Renshaw has prepared a paper on this problem. and I ask unanimous consent that his paper entitled \"The Ripple Effect To Be Expected in Connection With a New York City Default\" be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the inherent hazards of plutonium are of growing concern to all Americans because of its dual role as a potential fuel for nuclear power reactors and as a basic material for atomic bombs. Current projections for the growth of the nuclear power industry indicate that by the year 2000. reactors in the United States may be producing as much as 1 million pounds of plutonium a year. the worldwide figure may be as high as 2 million pounds. Approximately 20 pounds of plutonium is sufficient to fabricate a crude nuclear device capable of killing up to 100.000 people in a densely populated area. according to Dr. Theodore Taylor and other nuclear weapons experts. Last year. I introduced and managed the Energy Reorganization Act. which abolished the Atomic Energy Commission and divided its regulatory and promotional functions between two new independent agencies. There is a highlevel safeguards office in the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission to deal with the difficult problem of safeguarding plutonium against theft by wouldbe terrorist bombmakers. At present. most of the plutonium generated by commercial reactors is still contained in highly radioactive and. therefore. inaccessible. spent reactor fuel. The plutonium hazard will be upon us at such time as reprocessing of plutonium from spent fuel begins. Plutonium reprocessing has been delayed by technical difficulties being encountered in the nuclear industry. as well as by environmental impact studies now being made by the Commission. If it is eventually approved. safeguards must be strict enough to prevent theft or diversion of even the smallest amounts. Development of the breeder reactor. which will generate more plutonium than it consumes. will complicate the safeguards problem even further. Mr. President. a recent series of three articles in the Washington Star by Jon Fialka provides an excellent summary of all aspects of the plutonium issue.

I have spoken out in favor of the Genocide Convention on many occasions. referring to it as an issue of international concern. one that transcends religious beliefs and crosses political lines. One of the best appeals for the Conventions ratification along these same lines is perhaps that of the late Gabriela Mistral. the famous Chilean poet who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1945. With amazing regularity genocide has repeated itself throughout history. Despite all advances in our civilization the twentieth century must unfortunately be considered as one of the most guilty of the crime of genocide. Losses of life and culture have been staggering. But deep in his heart man cherishes a fervent yearning for justice and love. among small nations and minorities the craving for security is particularly alive. The success of the Genocide Convention today and its greater success tomorrow can be traced to the fact that it responds to necessities and desires of a universal nature. The word Genocide carries in itself a moral judgment over an evil in which every feeling man and woman concurs. In light of this statement and many others in the same vein. although perhaps not quite so eloquent. how can we as a nation not lend our support to the treaty?

I have been long concerned with the effect of the Airline Mutual Aid Pact upon members of the public who rely upon the airlines for their travel needs. I listened to and studied at some length testimony taken by the Aviation Subcommittee to abolish the Airline Mutual Aid Pact. and I support passage of legislation which will do so. My review of the arguments on both sides has convinced me that the pact as presently implemented is deeply detrimental to the interests of the traveling public. The history demonstrates that the pact has been responsible for increasing the length of strikes in the airline industry. Before the pact came into existence. the average industry strike lasted 15 days. This compared favorably with a national average strike duration of 19.7 days in 1958. the year the pact was first established. During the first 3 years of the pact. the average duration of airline strikes rose to 23 days. When changes in the pact were made so as to substantially increase payments received by struck carriers. the average strike period in the industry rose to 102 days. The national average was only 25.3 days during the same period. Mr. President. it is poor transportation policy and worse labor relations policy to permit arrangements which upset the balance of bargaining power and generate long and costly strikes. The basic labor policy of this Nation has always been to promote rough equality of bargaining power and to require goodfaith bargaining by both sides. The pact undermines this policy by making strikes relatively costless for the airlines. Indeed. in some cases. the pact makes it possible for an airline to profit from a strike. Profits are fine. but not when they are gained at the expense of the general public. employees. and stockholders of other airlines. Action should be taken by Congress soon to eliminate what is in essence an unfair labor practice.",

As a result. we have become more energy conscious and are alert to the fact that we do not have limitless supplies of energy. If we are to learn from the past. it is imperative that we move forward on a strong national energy policy of our domestic fuel resources. My State of New Mexico has been a leading energy exporter of natural gas. uranium. and other fuel resources. and like other energy producing States faces great economic inequities for its product. A case in point. is the exportation of crude oil. Seventyeight percent of our crude oil is sent out of State. however. under the twotier price system. the price for that oil is half the amount of foreign oil. We can justly be called an energy colony. receiving smaller revenues for our precious energy resources. Mr. President.

We received testimony from the Department of State. the Agency for International Development. and the Department of Agriculture. It Is clear to me that progress has been made in implementing the resolutions of the World Food Conference. however. a great deal of work remains to be done. We. for example. have only begun the process of negotiating a world food reserve. and there is a great split within the administration as to how this program is to be arranged and managed. One of the conclusions which I have reached. as a result of this hearing. is that the United Nations agencies will be instrumental in any successful endeavors in following up the World Food Conference. It is somewhat unfortunate that the prospect of improved food supplies during the coming year has reduced the urgency with which nations. including our own. have looked on this problem in recent weeks. I hope that the urgency and the priority of this problem will not be lost upon the policymakers within our Government. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as chairman of the Commerce Committee. I maintain a continuing interest in programs being developed on behalf of the American consumer. Many of these programs are initiated by industry itself. of course. and many others are initiated by Government. I would like to point out one program which was recently initiated as a cooperative effort by both. It involves the Federal inspection of seafood packaged for sale in the United States. I believe that if American consumers were polled on the question. the majority would indicate an assumption that packaged seafood receives the same degree of Federal inspection as that provided for meat and poultry. That is not the case. Although packaged meat and poultry have long been controlled by compulsory continuous Federal inspectionthat involves the constant presence of Federal inspectorsseafood has not. Federal standards for seafood wholesomeness and packaging sanitation procedures. of course. do exist. For some time. there has been discussion over the merits of extending compulsory Federal inspection to Include the packaging of seafood. That discussion may ebb if the voluntary inspection program offered to the seafood industry by the National Marine Fisheries Service operating under a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Commerce and the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare continues to gain momentum. It provides for fulltime inplant Federal inspection of seafood being packaged for sale in the United States. The NMFS operates the voluntary program under standards even broader than those imposed by the FDA and participating companies pay for the service through special assessments. But. once the volunteering packer has met Federal standards and is operating under the inspection program. it is allowed to carry a seal on its product verifying that it was \"Packed Under Federal Inspection.\" This will provide assurance to consumers that the seafood is wholesome. of good quality. and properly labeled. Recently. the Van Camp Sea Food Co. of San Diego. Calif.. became the first tuna canner to join the program and its Chicken of the Sea brand tuna currently carries the Federal inspection seal. This is a very encouraging beginning. Eventually. it is to be hoped. all members of the seafood packing community will be participating in the voluntary inspection program. This program stands as an exemplary model of how industry and Government can work together in the public interest.",

    "speech": "I was just coming now to a brief explanation of my amendment. The version that I have introduced is in the RECORD of June 4. 1975. beginning at page 16927. We will call it the 1978 version. because the auto efficiency tax and the standards would not begin until model year 1978. which would give 2 long years plus before the cars that might be taxed under this amendment would be on the market. Let me proceed to a brief explanation of my amendment. It is necessary because the committee bill contains what I regard as an ineffective gas guzzler tax in its title II. The committees version would be imposed only in the unlikely event that the weighted average of a manufacturers total production fails to meet a stated miles per gallon standard. The tax would not become effective under the committee bill until model year 1978. the same as mine. and the same would be true of the Sharp amendment. This amendment I am arguing for is a real gas guzzler tax. It would provide two tax incentives for producing and purchasing more efficient cars. The first tax incentive is a per car excise tax on cars getting low gas mileage. intended primarily to encourage consumers to purchase more gasoline efficient autos. The second tax is a manufacturers excise tax imposed on any manufacturer or importer whose total domestic production fails to meet the stated minimum average miles per gallon standard. This second tax is intended. not to raise revenue. but to provide an incentive for manufacturers to increase the overall efficiency of their cars. and especially to produce more small cars in this country instead of abroad to stop the escape of production from this country and to bring it back home. Both taxes would apply through 1980. although before that time there would be a total review of the situation with an eye to determining whether we want to continue or to increase or decrease the taxes thereafter. The effect of this amendment is to make the automobile fuel efficiency tax really mean something as compared with the weak provision in title III of the committee bill and with another weak alternative to be offered by several members of the Commerce Committee. the socalled Sharp amendment. Neither the committee bill nor the Sharp amendment will achieve the desired goals regarding auto efficiency.",

For example. in this current year where General Motors Corp. is the only corporation in the automobile industry that is showing a profit. and the other ones are showing a loss. then General Motors would be able to write off half its penalty. whereas other manufacturers would have to pay the full penalty. That is really an inequity under the Fisher amendment. As I understand the Sharp amendment. It does not have that feature. The civil penalty would be paid equally by all the manufacturers.",

H.R. 8674. because of my commitment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the United Nations this fall. I would like to express my support for the measure. In past sessions of Congress in which I served. I have introduced metric conversion legislation and I remain convinced of its importance. Our Nation is rapidly moving toward utilization of the metric system even without the benefit of Federal legislation. It is essential that Congress assume a leadership role in this inevitable conversion. The Metric Conversion Act will give direction and a sense of purpose to the metric conversion programs now underway in education. trade. commerce. and other sectors of our economy. The legislation which the House passed Friday. declares a national policy of voluntary conversion to the metric system in the United States. A 25 member U.S. Metric Board will serve as the coordinating mechanism. consulting with industry. labor. educators. business. consumers. Federal. State. and local agencies and other groups that will be affected by metrication. The Board will gather and disseminate information on the extent of metric system usage and evaluate the costs and benefits of such usage. My home State of Minnesota has already taken an active role in metrication efforts. At this point I would like to insert into the RECORD Minnesotas plan for metric education which was passed by the Minnesota State Board of Education in February 1975 and a copy of a resolution supporting conversion passed in March 1975 by the University of Minnesota Senate.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in recent weeks and months. there has been growing public discussion about the role of the Federal regulatory agencies in American economic life. To my way of thinking. such discussion is healthy. if anything. it is way past time that the American people were informed about the cost of Federal regulation to the consumer and the inhibitions such regulation places upon the producer of goods and services in this country. Not the least of these inhibitions is the fact that defending oneself against a civil suit filed by a Federal regulatory agency is often the most costly course of action one can take. Even if a businessman wins his case in court. he must pay his attorneys fees and litigation costs. expenses that are often far in excess of the fine he would have paid if he had pleaded \"no contest.\" or the price of preventive compliance. or both. Moreover. if a businessman is successful in clearing himself of one charge. he still faces the possibility that an agency. or an inspector of an agency. will continue to search for violations in an effort to bring about eventual compliance and achieve vindication. In the face of such pressures. it is little wonder that some businessmen simply choose to close up shop. and lay off their employees. rather than \"fight city hall.\" so to speak. Others have been encouraged to practice such things as \"preventive overcorrection\" or \"reverse discrimination\" in order to ward off being dragged into court. And still others. those who choose to stand up for their rights. are resentful at a system which causes them to pay for both their prosecutionthrough the use of their tax dollarsand their defense. In essence. what Federal regulation has developed into. for those who choose to stay in business. is compliance by coercion rather than compliance based on the merits of the case. Putting the emphasis back on the merits of the case is essential if the abuses of governmental overregulation are ever to be curbed. Accordingly. I would like to recommend to my colleagues an editorial which appeared in the August 4. 1975. issue of the U.S. News & World Report and to insert it in the RECORD at this time. The comments contained therein are worthy of the consideration of eveny Member of this House. [From the U.S. News & World Report. Aug. 4. 1975]",

But the real news content of the story. it seems to me. is the effect on the President and the Presidencynot the personality of the wouldbe assassin. To dwell on the personality of the attacker. to make her the object of attention. is to reward the act with the very thing a wouldbe assassin may seekattention. notoriety. and celebrity status. The cover of Newsweek and Time this week may well provide unbalanced individuals with proof that they can become celebrities if only they can succeed in getting close enough to actual murder to draw attention to themselves. Assassination of a President is something most of us lived through. The events of 1963 are fresh in the memory of everyone who is over 21. The tragedy we shared in November of 1963 was not only a personal tragedy. it was a violation of the entire concept of our Republic. One bullet or bullets nullified the ballots of all of us. whether we voted for or against the President. With the series of traumatic events that have recently hit this countrya President assassinated. a President driven from office by an unpopular war. a President forced to resignthe thing most devoutly to be wished is that this President succeed without harm in leading us as one Nation to the 1976 election. where we can again select leadership at the polls in our traditional constitutional process. The coverage given to this attacker could spark the demented mind of another wouldbe assassin. I hope that the American people will write to those publications which covered the personality of the attacker with an emphasis far above the effect of the attack and the fact of the incident. to express some disapproval of such coverage.

I would say that there are a couple of reasons that the committee did not include the kind of amendment to which the gentlewoman from New York refers. I. for one. may say that I am very sympathetic with the purpose of the amendment. but there were really two or three reasons for not considering it. First of all. since the enactment of CETA. the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. in the summer of 1973. there have been over 2.500 artists and tions who have become employed in public service programs. I hope that kind of support will continue. and indeed. it seems to me that the kind of amendment to which the gentlewoman from New York refers. which would single out still more precisely unemployed artists for work. would more properly come as an amendment to the CETA bill. which is scheduled for consideration upon completion of this bill. Therefore. if the gentlewoman from New York would wish to offer it at that time. I would be glad to give It my support. This brings me to the second reason that the subcommittee and the committee did not include the very laudable amendment to which the gentlewoman refers. sympathy for which I have already indicated. and it is that since there are included two new initiatives in the bill under consideration. namely. the museum services and the challenge grant program. and given the fiscal restraints with which all of us in this committee are familiar. we felt that it would not be wise to include this provision in this particular bill and thereby whet the appetite of an already vetoprone President still more.

H.R. 12838 contains many important provisions that would be beneficial to the museum. film makers. artists and various cultural organizations of America. As we celebrate this countrys 200th birthday. we must not forget the important role the arts have played in making our culture rich and worthwhile. With this bill we have the opportunity to insure the continuation of our fine tradition in the arts. One provision of particular value is the establishment of the Institute of Museum Services. This Institute would be of great help in the establishment of new exhibits. preservation of existing exhibits. and arrangement of cultural exchange programs. I also believe the establishment of Federal challenge grants. which would provide matching Federal funds for privately raised funds. would be a great boon to local projects. These grants would be a great incentive for local organizations in their efforts to raise money. Mr. Chairman. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Congressman BRADEMAS for his work with the Arts. Humanities and Cultural Affairs Act. His eloquent support of the acts over the years has done much to insure the continuation of many fine artistic and cultural programs. Also to be commended is Congressman ALBERT QUIE for his strong support of arts and humanities programs.

I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Nancy Hanks. on the fine job she has done. Mr. Chairman. American leadership in many areas has helped to make this country vital and strong. I believe the arts and humanities should be no exception. With the innovative Arts. Humanities and Cultural Affairs Act of 1975. the Congress has a chance to insure the growth and development of many fine projects and organizations in fields related to the arts. I urge support for H.R.",

In commenting upon the emigration from his native Sweden of the world famous film director. Ingmar Bergman. the Journal states: The state has a way of expanding Its paternalism until it reaches the point of manacling great artists for minor sins. I agree with this. To inject the Federal Government still deeper into the cultural sphere Is. I believe. to blur necessary distinctions between the state and society. To create a whole class of artists dependent on the largesse of the state is to impose a very genuine form of censorship upon these artists. for the power to confer grants upon artists. writers. and innovators implies necessarily the power to deny grants to those whose work is not approved by the state. It is not the states business to subsidize the arts. that is the business of the individual and the private sector. Because it is a nonpriority use of taxpayer money. and because it represents a genuine longterm. potential threat to the independence of the genuine artist and creator.

Now. if we look at the National Endowment for the Arts program guide. we find that it provides grants to individuals and to organizations.

If Members would look further they will see fellowships for art. fellowships for artists. fellowships for craftsmen. fellowships for photographers. fellowships for print making and drawing. The Endowment is filled with programs to help artists to be employed in the work that they enjoy and are trained for. If we changed to a public service employment type job title. with all of the control and stringent requirements that accompany that program. I believe that it is going to throw the entire Endowment for the Arts into a situation that no longer has as its main purpose the aim of helping people and providing for individuals around the country to enjoy and benefit from what they are doing. This amendment would merely provide employment for employments sake. That is not the thrust of this legislation. It is totally unwise. If we change the law to provide public service employment similar to make work program as we knew in the past. it is going to change the entire essence of the Foundation.

He has. by the virtue of hard work and dedicated application to the problems of his constituents in Louisianas First Congressional District. risen to a place where very few men in the history of this Nation have beenat the very top. among the most experienced and dedicated leaders this Congress has ever known. There are currently only three Members of this body who have served a longer time in Congress. Yet EDDIE has determined that 18 consecutive terms is enough. and the people of Louisiana must try to replace the irreplaceable. As a legislator. he has been among the most effective and exceptionally gifted leaders to have served in Congress. Almost every one of us has had the benefit of the years of experience and insight that he has brought to the legislative process. He has earned the respect and admiration of two generations of Con gressmen who have served with him and learned from him. and his record of accomplishments should earn him the same respect for generations to come. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee. he solidified his position in favor of military preparedness. bringing a strength to this country that was unequalled. He had known the political side of war. having been in the Congress in the first days of World War II. and on through the Korean conflict. and the Vietnam war. He knew that military strength is one of the mainstays of our form of democracy. Yet he has not been a clich.6 politicianhis background as an investigative newspaper reporter brought an objectivity and fairness to his legislative pursuits that was recognized on both side of the aisle. and which will be sorely missed.

EDWARD HtBERTS plans to retire from the U.S. House of Representatives. His congressional career has been a long and -distinguished one. Congressman HtBERT is a patriotic American who loves this country and has fought to keep it strong. He stood solidly behind military preparedness but has proved to be no patsy for the Pentagon. Under his chairmanship. the Armed Services Committee tackled military procurement and construction authorization legislation with enthusiasm and scrupulous examination. Those of us who have served with him in the Congress recognize and appreciate his objectivity and fairness. He will be greatly missed.

No single leader in national security has served in the last quarter century who brought more ability. dedication. or results to this work for -a strong America than our retiring good friend from Louisiana. Honorable F. EDWARD HtBERT. My opportunity to have a close opportunity to know and observe his work on national securities matters partly stemmed from the fact that I represent a congressional district that contains three outstanding military installations. At no time did the needs of these activities arise that Mr. HtBERT failed to respond. And yet. despite his ardent efforts to build and preserve a strong defense arm. his devotion to the eradica. tion of waste and duplication never abated. One of the most controversial and difficult positions in the House is the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. HtBERT filled this office with great distinction. He earned the admiration and respect of all who had an opportunity to work with. or observe. his services. I also enjoyed a warm personal relationship with EDDIE.

One of the most rewarding experiences that I have had as a freshman Member of the Congress has been to serve on the Committee on Science and Technology under the able leadership of the chairman. the gentleman from Texas . the chairman. the gentleman from West Virginia . and the chairman. the gentleman from Washington . I appreciate the hard work that they have done. Mr. Speaker. as a member of the Committee on Science and Technology. and as freshman Member of this Congress. it was a great challenge to being my service in this distinguished body by participating in the consideration of the Energy Research and Development Administrations fiscal year 1976 authorization request. Under the experienced leadership of Chairman OLnT TEAGUE of Texas. subcommittee Chairmen MIKE MCCORMACK of Washington and KEN HECHLER of West Virginia. the Science and Technology Committee has brought before the Congress a piece of legislation which will positively and substantively improve the energy resources and technologies of our country. This is the only bill considered by the Congress to date which is aimed at increasing the sources of domestic energy. It is certainly an undeniable fact that America must take immediate steps to reduce energy consumption. to lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources. and to become more efficient in our use of all energy supplies. It is however. equally imperative that this Nation begin to develop all alternative energy sources if we are to remain a free and powerful country. I can think of no greater threat to the security and sovereignty of the United States. than the failure of the Congress. the elected representatives of the people. to set our country on the path of energy independence. I must also call to the attention of my colleagues a more parochial interest to the people of Tennessee. and particularly of the Third Congressional District. I am referring to the adoption by the Senate and the conference committe of my amendment to restore the traditional name of the historic Oak Ridge National Laboratory. For all of these reasons.

The unemployment figures for May were even worse than I had expected. I really did not believe he could mess up the economy as badly as he has. Not only did unemployment exceed 9 percent. but it went up to 9.2 percent. As a result. there are now 8 1/2 million Americans out of work. up 360.000 last monththe worst job picture since 1940. On top of that. 4 million students are out of school this month and looking for summer jobs. So President Ford has vetoed a bill that would have created 900.000 direct fulltime jobs and taken care of 20 percent of the summer jobs. We do not know how many extra jobs that would have meant in the private sector. He accused Congress of being fiscally irresponsible in creating these jobs. That is a lot better than being socially irresponsible and doing nothing about unemployment. All the business signs and statistics and Republican wishful thinking in the world will not put people back to work. It takes jobs to do that. President Ford told the press that there does not have to be any more confrontation with the Congress. providing that the Congress does what he says. Congress does not work for the President. The Congress works for the people. This Congress is not about to accept any Republican economic policy of full unemployment. We continue our work on the job bills for the people and for the economy. and we will send to the Members many more pieces of legislation. hoping that we can stimulate this economy.",

The fact is. as the Audubon Society points out in their letter. their comment quoted by Mr. Morton and Mr. Zarb refers to the bill before it went to conference between the Senate and the House. and the conference took out the provisions which the House put in and made it a weaker bill. A lot has been said about putting small strip miners out of business if this bill is passed. and yet the administration spokesmen have not mentioned one single strip mine that has been put out of business by the equally tough laws of Pennsylvania and Ohio. As a matter of fact. the same argument was made before the Ohio law was passed in 1972. and yet here are the facts as to applications for new strip mines in Ohio. In 1971 there were 190 applications. That was before the law was passed. In 1972 there were 251 applications. In 1973. 285 applications. and in 1974. 349 applications. If a tough strip mining law would put people out of business. then why is It that the Ohio applications for new strip mines have gone up every single year since the tough Ohio law was passed? As a matter of fact. calculations based on the Department of the Interiors. own figures indicate that this bill would generate in 1977 in Ohio 230 additional direct jobs and an additional 500 jobs in secondary employment. and nationwide. 2.100 to 3.100 direct jobs and 4.000 to 5.000 in indirect employment.

While the administration maintains its claims that its antiboycott measures have been effective. additional publications have joined in the effort to inform the public of the severe implications of this intolerable practice. Principally. the Wall Street Journal has devoted a recent editorial to this matter. In \"Bucking the Boycott\" the Journal declared: Arab governments should be told that American businessmen will not be allowed to do the work of enforcing the boycott. either by discriminating against Jewish personnel or by refusing to deal with other companies solely because of connections with Israel. The administration is content to assure Congress that this message will be conveyed in the proper ways. but while we are waiting for the lesson to be learned. thousands of American businesses continue to suffer. The Wall Street Journal today featured an article entitled \"How Arab Countries Are Trying To Punish Firms Helping Israel.\" which highlights the pervasive and truly damaging effects of this discriminatory practice. After reading this article. one must seriously question the administrations optimistic claims.

The city Is now up against the tightest crunch it has faced since the dark days of last fall. when it hovered continually on the brink of bankruptcy. Between now and June 30. New York City has to repay the remaining $500 million in Federal loans for fiscal year 1976. reach agreement on new labor contracts covering 161.000 city workerswithout allowing any overall raise in pay. and approve a credible financial plan to wipe out a projected fiscal year 1978 deficit of slightly over $1 billion. It has to do this in order to qualify to receive as much as $1.1 billion in Federal loans which the city says it needs on July 2. The repayment requirement is written into the basic law. the New York City Seasonal Financing Act. and Treasury Secretary Simon. who administers the law. has said the other conditions must be met in order for him to make the determination that there is a \"reasonable prospect of repayment\" of loans provided In fiscal year 1977.

I want to point out the report because of the great importance of the Soviet supply situation for our own producers and consumers. I can recall last year when the Soviet harvest forecasts were estimated at 200 million metric tons in June. 195 million metric tons in early July. 185 million metric tons in late July. 180 million metric tons In early August. 160 million metric tons by late October and finally in early December a final estimate of 137 million metric tons. I certainly am not predicting that the Soviet harvest will be declining along the same pattern this year. However. its importance to our Nation and world markets is of staggering importance. We clearly do not yet have In place a food and agricultural policy which adequately deals with the possibility of both surplus and shortage In grain stocks throughout the world. This Is an urgent need which I have been working on. and I certainly plan to follow the outlook for the Soviet harvest in the months ahead. Mr. President.

With respect to the Genocide Convention. there has been widespread support for ratification in this adminstration. in previous adminIstrations. from various legal groups and prominent members of the bar. among the press. and among many of my constituents. Indeed. much of the original opposition to the Genocide Convention has abated in the last 20 years.

It Is a tribute to our deliberations in the Senate that an exhaustive analysis has been made of the many questions and issues raised by the convention.

Therefore. I once again call upon my colleagues here in the Senate to act swiftly in their ratification of the Genocide Convention.",

I would like my colleagues to be aware of the consequences of their action: without this bill. day care costs are going to go up. Without Federal assistance. day care centers around the country are going to be faced with meeting Federal standards without the necessary resources. Not only will some centers be forced to close. States in some cases will be fined back penalties by the Federal Government for failure to meet existing standards. These penalties will be a severe burden to the States. and resultant cutbacks in social services will have the effect of increasing welfare burdens. In the end. the Federal Government will be paying the price. Day care has been proven to be a costeffective Federal assistance effort where others have failed. Whatever policy changes we envision in public assistance. day care is not something we should forsake. It works now. Unless we override this veto. we will be paying for this mistake for years to come. Our colleague.

Moreover. it allows those of us in the Congress the opportunity to place an overall sense of priorities on the directions such stepbystep decisions will lead us toward. One such priority which I believe we must firmly establish is that those receiving veterans benefits have a right to receive the full value of such benefits. Inflation caused decimation of veterans disability compensation. veterans pensions and education benefits under the GI bill is in fact a retraction of past commitments made by this Government. if left uncorrected. Unfortunately. the President neglected to include such necessary costofliving increases when he submitted his original fiscal year 1977 budget proposal to the Congress. Nor did he see fit to include such increases in the revised budget message which he also submitted. I propose that we do not join in that act of neglect by failing to provide the men and women who have already sacrificed to serve this Nation in times of greatest stress. the means for keeping pace with todays rising costs. House Concurrent Resolution 611 represents a most promising experiment by the Congress to impose upon itself the discipline of fiscal responsibility. A guarantee of the continuing quality of veterans benefits. undiminished by inflation. is essential if we are to be morally responsible as well.

Mr. Des Pres describes the feelings of those who have studied the Holocaust and concludes that: If we are to meet our present problems in humanely creative ways. we need most urgently to come to terms with our terrible past. I could not agree with these sentiments any stronger. That is why when the bill reauthorizing the National Institute of Education reaches the House floor. I will be offering an amendment authorizing the Institute to develop and disseminate to local elementary and secondary schools a curriculum on \"mans inhumanity to man\" which would examine the periods of history in which the forces of hatred have been allowed to dominate. As Mr. Des Pres points out. courses on the Holocaust have had a profoundly salutary effect on those who have participated in them. Unfortunately. these courses have only reached an exceedingly small percentage of our population. If we are to both honor the memory of the dead and insure the future of the living. we should make sure that as many people as possible are sensitized to the potential consequences of racial. religious. or ethnic hatreds. Mr. Speaker with your permission I would now like to insert in the RECORD Mr. Des Pres article: [From the New York Times. Apr. 27. 1976]",

I am delighted and proud to tell you about Faith. a city of some 600 souls on Highway 212 on the northern border of Meade County. Faith claims to be the \"Prairie Oasis.\" and with the nearest communities of a thousand or more at least 60 miles distant. it not only is an oasis. but does a fine job of living up to its claims. People around Faith also like to be called conservative. and they prove this by their actions. A few years ago when the school needed a new gymnasium. the taxpayers were not called on to foot another bond issue. the Faith High School Alumni Association got together and raised the funds. A big event every summer for the last half century has been the Faith Stock Show and Rodeo. For 3 days every summer Faith bustles with thousands. The grandstand at the rodeo grounds has been showing its age in recent years and the board of directors has been looking for ways and means of replacing it. Hearing recommendations to find out what could be gotten in the way of Federal grants. they found out and they did not like it. With reports that Faith was spurning the Feds. the Associated Press told a reporter to find out what was happening. I would like to share his report with my colleagues:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to make two brief but important points about the conference report on H.R. 13172. the second supplemental appropriations bill. passed yesterday by the Senate. Additional funds are being provided for this fiscal year and the transition quarter in order to assist State educational agencies in carrying out broader responsibilities resulting from amendments to the School Lunch and Child Nutrition Acts approved last fall. Because of the time lag involved in recruiting and hiring needed additional personnel. it is intended that these funds remain available for State agencies administrative costs until expended. State administrative funds must be carried over. if unspent. specifically for administrative purposes. If they are put into general nutrition funds. the States will be unable to carry out their new administrative responsibilities. Congress clearly intended these funds to remain specifically available to support the administration nutrition programs to the State and local levels. In addition. the committee has decided not to provide any funding out of regular appropriations for the WIC program during the transition quarter. However. substantial amounts of funds have been left unspent from the $250 millionplus carryover fundsmade available for fiscal year 1976. Moreover. Public Law 94105 mandates the expenditure of a separate $62.5 million in section 32 funds for WIC program operations during the transition quarter. I am sure the committee. therefore. felt that it was unnecessary to provide additional funding out of regular appropriations for the WIC program during the 3month transition period. The money is already available. in section 32. and both law and legislative history make it clear that a pro rata amount of $62.5 million must be spent on WIC during the transition quarter.",

This provision. which was offered by Senator DOMENICI. Senator EAGLETON. and myself. was accepted by the Senate on December 12. 1975. At that time it was hoped that the study could be completed early this year. However. because several circumstances delayed conference consideration of the bill. the conferees have chosen to put a December 1. 1976. deadline on the Presidents report and recommendations to Congress. This will give the President and Federal agencies 6 months to make the necessary studies of Federal disaster loan programs. I believe that the time is sufficient. and I look forward to having the opportunity to review the results of the Presidential inquiry later this year. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Disaster Relief of the Senate Public Works Committee. I have concern that loan programs designed to aid disaster victims may not be structured in the most efficient manner. Senator DOMENICI. the ranking Republican member of the subcommittee. I believe shares my concern. The study provision contained in S. 2498 will go a long way toward uncovering obstacles to the most effective delivery of disaster benefits and should provide a solid basis of information upon which Congress can act to improve the loan programs.",

In view of what this Congress has already done in the way of oil tax legislation. price rollbacks and continued price controls and regulations over both oil and gas. I hope each Senator will carefully consider the consequences of oil company divestiture and the effects on the already critical U.S. energy situation. Editorial comment around the country has been almost solidly against breaking up the oil companies and I cannot help but believe these editors know more about our energy problems than many Senators who have indicated a willingness to pass such a bill. I hope that some of these Senators will heed the advice and warnings of this very impressive array of newspapers around the country. One of them. the Louisville CourierJournal said: The idea. of breaking the big oil companies into smaller and theoretically more competitive. units has great appeal. political and otherwise. to many Americans. But. its merits need more examination than the advocates of this proposal so far have been willing to give it. The Hartford Times called the effort \"so laughable that the initial inclination is to ignore the rantings as petty demagoguery. Unfortunately.\" the Times continued. \"history has proven that petty demogoguery when ignored. all too often can succeed in achieving incredibly destructive ends.\" Mr. President. if anything needs breaking up because of bigness and monopoly it is the Federal Government and not the 18 largest oil companies. The very fact that there are 18 of them and twice that many smaller integrated oil companies is proof enough that competition does exist in the oil industry. Mr. President. I believe Senators who may be confronted with this issue could benefit from the editorial comment of newspapers both large and small in all sections of the country and.

That article provfdes: The Contracting Parties undertake to enact. in accordance with their respective Constitutions. the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and. in particular. to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or of any of the other acts enumerated in article III. Indeed. the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. which has within the last several weeks recommended Senate ratification of the treaty. views such Senate approval as the first in a twostep procedure. Of equal importance will be the second step. that is. the enactment of the implementing legislation. To emphasize this the committee has incorporated into the proposed resolution of ratification the following recommendation of the Department of State: That the United States Government declares that it will not deposit its instrument of ratification until after the implementing legislation referred to in Article V has been enacted. The ratification process is not complete until after the instrument is deposited with the United Nations. Therefore. this declaration will insure that the treatys effect will be in total accord with the congressional will. The alleged threat of the convention bypassing our constitutional legislative processes is nonexistent. The convention itself explicitly requires the implementing legislation to be enacted in accordance with our Nations Constitution.

It is my view that our national policy. especially in an arms control environment. should maintain the role of the SAC bombers in our strategic deterrent force. Among the important features of the manned strategic bomber are the following: It Is survivable. capable of airborne alert. recallable. flexible as a threat with standoff armaments for penetrating onto target. a vertifiable mobile launcher. and unambiguously a second strike force since it takes many hours to span the distance from launch to target and not a mere 30 minutes as do the ICBMs. I recognize the impending need to replace the aging B52 force starting sometime during the next decade. Unfortunately. however. I believe we are moving in the wrong direction with the current Bi program. In particular. we are developing an exorbitantly and unnecessarily expensive \"Cadillac of the sky\" with the current B1 design of a penetrating supersonic bomber. I believe there is time during the lifetime of the present B52 force to reorient the manned bomber program in search of a less expensive aircraft which will be suitable for launching standoff air to surface cruise missiles (ALCMs). Moreover. there Is no need to continue the current reliance on aerial refueling as presently required for the B52s and as being designed into the B1 force. Greater economy of operation. greater flexibility. and reduced vulnerabilities should be possible without the need for maintaining the aerial tanker craft. I hope that in the upcoming Senate vote it will be recognized that this country still has an opportunity to redirect the B1 bomber program toward a more effective and. economical design for maintaining the important manned bomber component of our deterrent forces.

I do not argue that point. But would not the Senator agree that in terms of a fiscal stimulant. we can do that either with a tax reduction or by public investment? For example. I think the former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Keyserling. has talked in terms of a $40 billion fiscal stimulant. but he recommends that we break it down the following ways: $16 billion in tax reduction. $16 billion in public investment. in such things as energy development. transportation. housing. and so on. $8 billion in emergency public service jobs. a program that can be cranked up very quickly with the cooperation of State and local governments. It will not only provide more employment. but also begin to provide some useful services that we need. I think the Senator from Louisiana and his committee have come out with a much better tax proposal than the one offered by the President earlier this year. but it still does not. really. target on the public needs of the Nation. I think it will be very difficult. if we approve a tax deduction of $30 billion. to come on this floor and say we need x billions of dollars for energy development. and we need x billions of dollars for housing and transportation. We are really foreclosing that possibility by putting so much of the fiscal stimulant in the tax reduction. That is really my thinking. There is nothing in this amendment that commits Congress to the range of public spending that I prefer. All it does is reduce the tax reduction from the amount recommended by the House so that we preserve our options and leave open the kind of public investment that I think the Senator from Louisiana and I both favor.

I know the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Louisiana both talked about the possibility of our coming back here later on and authorizing expenditures of a substantial nature to rebuild the transportation system of the country and to do these other things. My own judgment is. and it is just a matter of personal judgment. we all have to vote as we see it. that we are not going to have much practical chance of getting this Congress or the administration to approve substantial increases in public investment if we precede that by a $30 billion reduction in taxes. I think it is almost an either/or basis. If we make this tax reduction more in line with what the other body has suggested. that preserves our options. that is. ultimately a chance for public Investment. and I hope the Senate will take that into consideration.",

This report is most enlightening. It calls into question the effectiveness of Federal efforts to give the Hispanic community parity in the Federal employment system. Mr. Gil Chevez. national president of IMAGE. said: Since 1970. when the \"Sixteen Point Program\" was initiated. to the end of 1975. the total employment of fulltime Federal civilian Spanishspeaking employees has increased only onetenth of one percent (.001) of the total federal fulltime work force. Raul Yzaguirre. national director of the National Council of La Raza. stated. The Nations Hispanic community has lost $2.6 billion in income as a result of discrinlnation in Federal employment during the last three years. according to preliminary findings of an analysis of the Federal Spanish Speaking Programs. These two statements. coupled with the conclusions in the report. indicate that efforts in this area have produced few results.

Many industrial accidents are caused by the employers failure to maintain a safe workplace. that is. failure to guard properly or service complicated machinery or failure properly to instruct and monitor his employees in the safe operation of that machinery. What this means in human terms is a situation in which unsafe work practices in unsafe workplaces maintained by unsafe employers are causing American employees to suffer severe physical injuries and economic costs. But the employer invariably escapes liabilty. because in most States. employers who have met their workers compensation obligations are insulated from further legal attack by either the injured employee or the machinery manufacturer due to the restrictive exclusivity provisions of these same workers compensation statutes. Mr. President. the increase in product liability suits faced by many American businesses does not lend itself to neat and simple solutions. It is a multifaceted problem. and I recognize that the workers compensation relationship and related problem of contribution and subrogation is but one aspect of the overall crisis. Nevertheless. the Senate Subcommittee on Labor and Public Welfare has examined these matters with serious concern. and we intend to consider remedial legislation as early as possible in the next session of Congress.

I am optimistic that the Senates quick action on many of the provisions of this House bill will insure their acceptance before the end of this session. My particular interest has been in the provisions which I offered to the Finance Committee which implement the SSI program for lowincome. disabled children. Children have been eligible for SSI since the 1972 amendments. and have been eligible for the referral and services provided in section 1615 of the Social Security Act. Regrettably this eligibility for children has not been so meaningful as it should have been. Section 501 of H.R. 10210 implements present provisions of law in order to make them of value to disabled and poor children. Section 501 provides a program of referral. counseling. and individual service plans and monitoring which are appropriate for all poor and disabled SSI eligible children. Additionally. an entitlement program of services for children 6 and under. or children who have not yet been in school and in need of preschool preparation is established. One of the most important aspects of section 501. however. is the requirement that HEW promulgate criteria applicable to children under the age of 18. These criteria are to be appropriate for determining disability as it is defined in section 1614 (a) (3) of the Social Security Act for such persons under the age of 18. Although the program for children has been part of the Social Security Act since 1972. criteria for determining childrens disabilities have not yet been published. Section 501 insures that criteria will be developed so that all of the current definition of disability may be implemented. criteria are to be developed both for the determination of a medically determinable mental or physical impairment. and -for the determination of the comparable -severity of the childs disability in terms that are relevant to a child.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this mornings New York Times contained a very thoughtprovoking editorial on the administrations position on gasoline taxes. Later this week. the House will act to delay President Fords general oil import excise tax plan. As proposed. this excise tax on all imported crude oil products can only further exacerbate the problem of inflation. While energy conservation is a worthy goal. our zeal to respond to the economic threat posed by rapidly rising prices of foreign crude oil should not result in further damage to our already beleaguered economy. Gasoline consumption should be the main target of the administrations fuel conservation program. There are many options available to us that should be thoroughly explored. In the meantime. we should not embark upon a policy that will increase the cost of food production and distribution. the cost of manufacturing a wide range of consumer goods. and the cost of heating and lighting a home. There have been several proposals introduced in the House designed to cut gasoline consumption. and several include provisions to apply a specific tax on gasoline purchases alone. For the benefit of my colleagues who are studying these various energy conservation alternatives. I include in the REcORD at this point in my remarks the editorial from the February 3d edition of the New York Times concerning the equity and practicality of a gasoline tax as opposed to an acrosstheboard application of taxes on the entire range of petroleum products.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. involved In the high food cost problem is the fact that the American housewife is being ripped off on certain prepared products. With this in mind. I call attention to a oneman campaign being waged in my part of the country by a leading food retailer. Eugene Marraccini. Mr. Marraccini. whose family operates supermarkets in Elizabeth and White Oak. Pa.. has taken about 100 items from his shelves because. in his opinion. they are a waste of customers money. He told Woodene Merriman. womens editor of the McKeesport. Pa.. Daily News: By eliminating some items were trying to deescalate the frills and steer people toward buying the basics. to warn them to watch out for booby traps. And the booby traps? Mr. Marraccini has a list ranging from \"fancier types\" of cake mixes which are up to about $1 in price. to costly \"presweetened\" cereals. and on through certain types of pickles. \"dinners in a box.\" jellies. and so forth. He says some of these items have jumped 100 percent in recent months. Manufacturers have been hearing from Mr. Marraccini. too. on what he claims is their habit of coming up with nutritionally worthless and expensive products. Also. he has been using newspaper ads to urge the public to boycott products which we feel cost too much. He helped in this matter to turn around the sugar climb. He informed Editor Merriman that. realizing \"just one guy is not going to do any good\" on a national problem. he has talked to other grocers and found they are as \"frustrated about all this as I am.\" I want to commend Mr. Marraccini and express the hope that we might have more merchants of his mind on the front line of the war on high prices. Perhaps others will join him. Widespread removal of overly priced products for sale could strike directly at the gouging which has become too great a factor in the inflation situation. Modern living. as we now realize. opened the way for artful profiteers with cleverly packaged and promoted \"special\" products and this has added substantially to the cost burden on the unsuspecting housewife. She needs protection by concerned people in the retail business such as Mr. Marraccini. May his ranks increase.",

At no time has it been truer than today. We are faced today with burgeoning world population levels. coupled with price structures and acreage limits that prevent the United States from feeding the world by shipping food to countries that need it. We should increase our direct food aid. to be sure. but there are limits to the size of harvest. Increasingly we must turn our attention to providing developing countries with the technology they need to produce more of their own food. The area most in need of technological development is that of tropical and subtropical agriculture. Coincidentally. most of the worlds undernourished people live in these climatic conditions. I have authored legislation which is now part of the Food for Peace Act. authorizing tropical and subtropical agriculture research centers in the United States. which could focus on the problems of places like Pakistan. Bangladesh. India. and parts of Central America and Africa. There is a good indication of how well such centers already in existence at the University of Hawaiis College of Tropical Agriculture could fill this role.

The food bank resulted from a number of articles in the Hartford Courant on the problems of welfare families. but the concept of a Hartford Food Bank was promoted by a radio station.

It was largely through these efforts that the Hartford Food Bank has been successful. Brad has generously donated his time and talents to raise needed food and money for the poor. The food bank now has over 35.000 items of food in stock and over $9.000 to replenish needed food supplies. It is administered by the community renewal team and over 8.000 poor people in the greater Hartford area have benefited from the food bank. I want to share this article with my colleagues in the hope that other private groups will work to establish food banks to aid the less fortunate in their own cities:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Febiary 11. I commenced an inquiry on a matter that had been brought to my attention by a good friend. Mrs. Bobbi Margolis. Mrs. Margolis works as a volunteer at the adolescent prison facilities of Rikers Island. a New York City detention center. She told me that she had heard of a harrowing incident involving a sexual assault upon a young man while he was in a prison van being transported from the criminal courthouse in the Borough of Manhattan to Rikers Island in the Borough of the Bronx. He filed a complaint against his assaultersfellow prisonersand for reasons unknown to Mrs. Margolis the complaint had not been pursued by the law enforcement authorities. I have interested myself in prison reform beginning with my first term in Congress naving visited. in the latter part of 1969. the then West Side Federal House of Detention and later the Manhattan House of Detentionthe Tombsthe Brooklyn House of Detention. the Queens House of Detention. Rikers Island Prison. Lorton Prison. and the District of Columbia jail. As a result of my investigation into conditions in prisons. I introduced legislation which in modified form ultimately became law on December 28. 1973. which provided for prison furloughsto allow prisoners periodic furloughs. subject to reasonable conditions to visit their families. not in jail but at home. And during the course of my various inquiries into jail conditions. and readings on the subject. I became aware of what may be the most horrendous part of imprisonment and that is the frequency of sexual attacks by prisoners upon other prisoners. A report on the sexual assaults in the Philadelphia prison system and sheriffs vans issued in 1968 came to my attention in 1970. After hearing of the incident concerning the prisoner. who is the subject of this correspondence. brought to my attention by Mrs. Margolis. I remembered that earlier report and I went back to read it again. I was struck by a section of that report which I should like to quoteparticularly because it is so analogous to the current situation.",

It was called to my attention recently that the businessmen in my congressional district are distressed about the consequences of the Federal Fair Credit Billing Practices Act and the Federal Equal Opportunity Credit Act. Along with a justifiably sarcastic note to me from one of Idahos most prominent and respected agribusiness leaders was enclosed a copy of the letter he had received from the Boise Building Supply Co. I would like to insert the text of that letter at this point in the RECORD: DEAR CUSTOMER: This fall the Federal Fair Credit Billing Practices Act and the Federal Equal Opportunity Credit Act became law. Various regulations implementing these Acts become effective on different dates over the next two years. These Acts and regulations require most retail businesses to make extensive and expensive changes in their retail. consumer credit procedures. For most retail businesses. the cost of these changes is prohibitive. After considerable thought. Boise Building Supply has decided that it is not fair to pass along any additional cost to you. the consumer. nor change the effective and personal service we have always provided. Therefore. Boise Building Supply has decided to close all retail. consumer credit charge accounts. effective November 18. 1975. This closure is in no way a reflection upon your past credit performance. which has been entirely satisfactory. nor is it an indication of our unwillingness to continue to do business with you. All retail consumer sales will now be on a cash basis. that is. cash money. personal checks. and bank charge cards. It Is very discouraging to us at Boise Building Supply. that the Federal Government is making it increasingly difficult to provide retail consumer credit services to our customers and friends. If you have any questions about your account or this letter. please feel free to contact me by telephone or stop in and see me in person. Sincerely yours.",

May I say to the gentleman that I do believe the amendment. if it was germane and I do not believe it is. would strike out the section where we prohibit the growing of marihuana. but may I read the amendment again so we have it clearly before us: Page 28 after line 25. add the following: \"SEC. . No funds appropriated or made available by this Act shall be used to prohibit any person from planting any crop or growing any livestock in the United States. except by voluntary compliance by said grower or producer with any existing rule or regulation as promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture. or voluntary compliance with any existing law.\" Then we come back to the funds appropriated in this act. The funds that would be used in connection with the program. may I emphasize. are two in number. One is section 32. funds which are used in large surpluses and where there are funds available now. but the funds to which these programs would be directed is the Commodity Credit Corporation. As the Chair will recall. the Commodity Credit Corporation was created under the laws of Delaware. It was created as a Corporation so it could buy and sell and do these things other corporations could do. I helped write the Delaware Control Act and at that time we provided that Congress shall not keep the Tennessee Valley Authority. a similar corporation. from manufacturing fertilizer or others and the Commodity Credit Corporation being required by their charter to carry out these things and the Congress would be prohibited from keeping them to carry it out. but forgetting that. that corporation has $8 billion to carry out the provisions of this bill. As I say. the funds for this Corporation are in this bill. that is true. but the funds in this bill that go to that Corporation are for capital impairment and not for the programs in this bill. So for that reason I would insist that the amendment is not germane when it ties into this bill when no funds are in this bill for the purpose of carrying out this program. but only the funds that I referred to.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I would like to express my firm opposition to any effort which would terminate the price support program for tobacco. Although tobacco uses only threetenths of 1 percent of the Nations cropland. it is our fourth most valuable crop and accounts for about 4 percent of the cash receipts from all U.S. crops. Nearly 600.000 farm families depend upon the cultivation of tobacco for their livelihoods. In fiscal year 1974 the United States exported more than a billion dollars of tobacco. These exports make a sizable contribution to our balanceofpayments position. Our consumers spent nearly $14 billion on tobacco products in fiscal year 1974. of which nearly $5.8 billion were received by Federal. State. and local governments as excise tax revenue. We cannot afford to jeopardize tobacco production if we recognize the desperate need to generate Government revenues and to maintain a favorable balanceofpayments position. The benefits of the tobacco price support program clearly outweigh the programs cost. The realized costs of the tobacco price support program from 1933 to date have been thirteenhundredths of 1 percent of the costs for all farm commodity price support programs. The Federal Government must do everything possible to encourage maximum agricultural production. Maximum crop production not only requires maximum acreage cultivation. but. even more importantly. requires that the farmer can count on receiving an adequate return for his labors. The tobacco price support program provides this element of security for our tobacco growers. We need the tobacco price support program to provide economic stability to the more than 600.000 farm families who rely upon tobacco growing to live. We need the tobacco price support program to generate Government revenues and to maintain a favorable balanceofpayments position.

The problem my colleague has described also exists in my district. Many dairy farmers will lose their land if they cannot comply with the requirements of the Water Pollution Control Act. Their own Government will force them out of business unless that same Government can make these loans available to them. Many of the small dairy farms in my district are marginal family operations. They are in trouble due to the economic pinch and without our assistance they will go under. We have been working for months to find the proper avenue through which to assist these people. First. the Appropriations Subcommittee inserted language in their committee report which accompanied the State. Justice. Commerce. judiciary appropriations bill which directed the SBA to assist these farmers. Second. we have introduced legislation to directly amend the Small Business Act to include dairy farmers under the act and permit the SBA to make loans available to them. Hearings are now underway on this proposal. I have determined that another possible avenue by which to assist the dairymen is through the Farmers Home Administrations soil and water conservation program or agricultural credit insurance fund. In my opinion. this program is an excellent and fair program designed to help our farmers meet this kind of problem. It is a direct and expedient means of providing funds so that they can purchase and construct the necessary water pollution control facilities. and the eligibility requirements under this program will insure that those in the greatest need will receive this assistance. I have received a great many telegrams and letters from dairymen outlining for me their individual needs and the severity of the burden being placed on them. Domenic Carinalli from Santa Rosa said. Sources of loans to comply with government regulations are badly needed. Claude Martin from Petaluma wired me thatThis could save the dairy industry in Sonoma County. Others have sent similar pleas for help. We cannot sit by and Ignore these requests for our assistance.

One of those problems was that about the time we meet anybodys requirement. the Department of Health or somebody else would come out and condemn whatever we have and we would have to start all over again. That is particularly true in the dairy business. I know there is a problem. I can speak for myself and say this committee will be glad to have an investigation and see what the best answer is. In connection with the matter before us. may I point out in the bill that we now have provided on the first item $370 million. in the second item we have provided $92.5 million. The gentlemans amendment would add $225 million and then would add another $25 million. making a total of $250 million. I would like to point out that in the bill we also have. for business and industrial loans. $300 million. farm ownership loans. $350 milion. $4.000.000 for soil and water loans. and in addition over $2 billion is already available for emergency livestock loans. The point I am making is that the gentleman would add $250 million because he has been unable up to this time to get action on specific loans.

Therefore. the Committee will expect the Department to review this regulation to more properly define agriculture as it exists today. which is greatly different from when the definition was originally issued. The point I wish to make is that the problemand the gentleman from California knows more about it in his area than I dois the money is here. the law is there and we cannot change the law here.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the conference agreement on H.R. 5546. the Health Professions Assistance Act of 1976. contains a provision which appears to provide borrowing authority which is not subject to advance appropriations. Consequently. it would be subject to a point of order under section 401 (a) of the Congressional Budget Act. Section 401(a) provides: It shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or resolution which provides new spending authority described in subsection (c) (2) (A) or (B) (or any amendment which provides such new spending authority). unless that bill. resolution. or amendment also provides that such new spending authority is to be effective for any fiscal year only to .such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation acts. Section 401(c) (2) (B) of the Budget Act defines spending authority as authority \"to incur indebtednessother than indebtedness incurred under the second Liberty Bond Actfor the repayment of which the United States is liable. the budget authority for which is not provided in advance by appropriation acts.\" This form of spending authority is commonly known as borrowing authority. The conference report accompanying H.R. 5546 contains a provision creating a student loan insurance fund under section 734 of the Public Health Service Act. Clearly. the requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury purchase these obligations constitutes borrowing authority. And since the provision contains no requirement that the authority be limited to amounts provided in advance in appropriation acts. it appears to give rise to a section 401 (A) point of order. The fact that the provision relates to default payments which might arise pursuant to a loan guarantee program does not bring the provision within the \"loan guarantee\" exception to section 401 of the Budget Act. Although the loan guarantee itself may not be subject to advance appropriation. the default payment made pursuant to the provision in question does not constitute a loan guarantee and it is fully subject to the requirements of section 401.",

The original legislation to extend the 1971 act was introduced on May 1. 1974. The Subcommittee on Health and the Environment held more than 2 weeks of legislative hearings on the proposal. deliberated in executive session for several months. and. on Oc*tober 3. 1974. reported a vastly different piece of legislation to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce based on the issues which had arisen during hearings and markup. Although the 1974 legislation passed the House and was the subject of conference. the 93d Congress adjourned before conferees could agree. The 1974 legislation was reintroduced in February of 1975. slightly modified. and passed by the House in July of 1975 with one major amendment. The provision of the committee bill which would have established a commission to control the number and distribution of all medical residency programs in the United States was defeated. During subcommittee and committee deliberations over the past 21/2 years. six major issues have been identified as having a significant impact on access to quality health care delivery in this country: First. the geographic distribution of health manpower. second. the specialty distribution of physicians. third. the supply of health manpower. fourth. the impact of foreign medical graduates. fifth. the financial stability of health professions schools. and sixth. the emerging roles ofmidlevel health practitioners.

It is high time that the Congress resumed the authority to set the salaries of devoted and hardworking Federal judges. Since 1969. the year in which the Judicial Conference recognized no significant differences in the workload among fulltime bankruptcy judges around the country. the delegation of authority to the Judicial Conference has been unnecessary and contrary to the longestablished policies of this Congress in the administration of the Federal Government. It is the Congress that has traditionally set the salaries of all Federal employees. The only significant exception has been this delegation to the Judicial Conference to set the salaries of bankruptcy judges. The delegation of this authority to a nonpolitical body was premised on a specific need. the difference in caseload among the bankruptcy judges. That need ceased 6 years ago. and it is now long past time to correct this anamalous situation. The reason for removing this delegation of authority becomes even clearer when it is realized that the Judicial Conference has acted contrary to the intent of the Congress in the exercise of this power. The Judicial Conference blocked the pay raise that Congress granted the bankruptcy judges in 1969. although it has approved the 5percent pay raise that was granted this year. This limited delegation of authority is wholly unwarranted where the Judicial Conference has ignored the wishes and the directions of the Congress.

The Senate figure for CSA energy programing is $38.5 millionwoefully inadequate to meet the needs of the poor. but still 21/2 times the House figure. House and Senate are now in conference. There are 8 million dwellings in the United States occupied by the poor. Few are adequately insulated by standards based on thorough studies by the National Bureau of Standards. NBS findings indicate that these dwellings need a minimum of $500 work each to achieve the optimal level of weatherizationthe point at which weatherization work returns the greatest total savings per dollar spent. This represents a need for investment of $4 billion. in a jobcreating labor intensive activity that will return 20 percent annually on the investment. According to Dr. Jerry Plunkett of the Montana Energy Institute. these weatherization programs of CSA are at a minimum 10 times more cost effective than any other energy program yet offered by Government or private industry. And this does not even consider the problem faced by the poor in trying to pay their energy bills. A study by CSA staff indicates that by December 1975 the poor will fall short of their ability to pay their energy bills by an amount of $292 million per month. And all indications are that energy costs will continue to rise. CSA has 880odd Community action agencies now actively engaged in energy programing for the poor.

Although Secretary of Agriculture Butz and others may try to apply verbal cosmetics and claim that it assures market stability. the head of the major wheat market development organizations has called it \"too little. too late\" and declared that it \"will not be of any value to U.S. agriculture since the quantities involved are too insignificant to matter greatly. It places limits on rather than assures Soviet grain purchases from the United States. and actually makes no provisions for years when the Soviet Union needs exceptional quantities.\" The speaker is Joseph Halow. executive president of Great Plains Wheat. Inc.. who made his remarks at the 37th Annual Durum Show in Langdon. N. Dak. For the information of members of the House who have been brainwashed with praise for the big deal. and for that letter of intent which conceals the breakdown of negotiations for cheap oil. I am putting the text of a Great Plains Wheat Inc.. press release on Mr. Halows speech in the RECORD in full in the Extensions of Remarks. Also. a somewhat more outspoken appraisal of the big deal by President Oren Lee Staley of the National Farmers Organization who calls the deal an \"outrageous interference with American farmers free markets. not just for 1 year. but for 1975 and 5 succeeding years. extending 4 years beyond the tenure of the current occupant of the White House.\" a prophets statement. Staley also charged that the amounts that Russia will be allowed to buy this year were sharply restricted to depress domestic grain markets. He was right about that. As My RECORD insert yesterday reflects. the day after the big deal was announced wheat markets closed down 17 cents per bushel. corn was down 8 cents per bushel. and soybeans were off 18 cents. Mr. Staley observes that the deal is \"Government dictatorship with a vengeance\" and charges that farmers have been \"lied to. betrayed. and sold down the river.\"",

At that time. many Members. including myself. expressed concern about the size of this appropriation and about the way in which it is presented to the Congress. It seemed to us that. in order to stimulate a reasoned and constructive debate on the need for such funds. the nuclear weapons R. & D. request should be considered on its own merit and not under the guise of energy development. To combine peaceful and military uses of nuclear energy under an \"energy\" agency distorts the true picture of our overall energy and defense efforts. That position is no less valid today. Mr. Chairman. I do not believe that the ERDA budget is the appropriate vehicle for the authorization and appropriation of nuclear weapons development. The Energy Research and Development Administration was established to solve our Nations energy problems. Its funds should be used to meet our Nations energy needs. not to fuel the international arms race. In my view. the Congress should consider the issues of the peaceful and military uses of atomic energy and nuclear weapons separately.

Because of the rapidly changing political and military situation in South Vietnam. I certainly am keeping an open mind on the question until we have heard all the debate and until events become more settled. By approving this bill. I feel the committee gave up the only real opportunity it had to compel the administration to accelerate the evacuation of Americans and their dependents who remain in Vietnam. Unfortunately. the administration has not been removing the Americans and their dependents at a rate commensurate with the increasing threat to Saigon. And the continued presence of more than 4.000 U.S. citizens and their dependents in South Vietnam cannot be justified any longer. Within the next week. the number of Americans in Vietnam should be reduced to a hard core of 800 to 1.000 people. A residual complement of that size could be withdrawn quickly and without any significant commitment of U.S. Armed Forces. While I was willing to compromise on a number of points in the proposed legislation. I could not do so on the one which directly affects American citizensnamely. the evacuation. By approving this measure. the committeeand now perhaps the Congressin effect leaves the rate of American evacuation to the discretion of the President and the U.S. Ambassador in Saigon. both of whom seem unduly optimistic about the current military situation in Vietnam. We should not vote any additional aid or authority to use force for evacuation until the administration has demonstrated that it is. in fact. moving expeditiously to bring these people home. My objections to the legislation in committee did not end there. however. The $100 million authorized by the bill for aid conceivably could be used for military purposes and \"justified\" on the ground that it was necessary to evacuate Americans. Such a rationale can be stretched too easily. and in this connection. it should be noted that even the Armed Services Committee apparently has decided that additional military aid would not be wise.",

The withdrawal of Americans. under this authority. cannot be delayed or otherwise stretched out in order to bring out additional South Vietnamese. This bill does not allow the tail to wag the dog.

Will it exacerbate the situation to give new authority to commit American troops. when we are in fact anxious to have a negotiated settlement? I do not know.

Because of the veterans program during and immediately following World War II. we provided for an expenditure of $297 million to authorize special vocational educational programs which trained 7.5 million people during World War II and immediately thereafter at a 5year cost of $297 million. I think we all recall those days. certainly many of the older Members of this Chamber do. That evidence is all in the record when we were studying the 1963 act. Mr. Chairman. H.R. 12835 extends for several more years certain expiring Federal education programs and amends these programs to better focus the funds. The bill has been reported unanimously by the Committee on Education and Labor. Mr. Chairman. I certainly want to pay tribute to the entire Subcommittee on Elementary and Secondary Education and to the gentleman from Indiana and his subcommittee and to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Qui). all of whom have worked handinglove with both subcommittees in bringing the National Institute of Education bill to the floor and the vocational education bill to the floor. The first title amends the Vocational Education Act. The gentleman from Indiana will handle the National Institute of Education. That is the second title. The third title contains various technical amendments and miscellaneous amendments to Federal education laws.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I favor passage of the bill before us and believe it would go far toward addressing those needs which are not being adequately met by current legislation. One such need is for vocational teachers and to remedy this situation I introduced an amendment which was approved by the committee and is now part of H.R. 12835. I would like to explain what this amendment is intended to accomplish. Vocational enrollments at all levels have expanded rapidly during the past decade. While the number of vocational teachers has also gone up. it has not increased sufficiently to keep pace with enrollments. State directors of vocational education have described the vocational teachers shortage as critical. Fortythree States have reported some degree of shortages. It has been estimated by the National Education Association that vocational teacher demand exceeds the supply by 38.7 percent. Despite these shortages. little has been done to entice individuals to enter into the vocational teaching profession. My amendment provides this incentive by authorizing two new types of teacher fellowships to be added to the present fellowships for graduate students in vocational education. The first new fellowship is for teachers who have already been credentialed by the States in other fields and who have job skills in demand in vocational education. There is a general surplus of trained teachers in other fields. Those who have not been able to secure teaching jobs have for the most part become retrained and employed in other occupational areas. The new fellowships would enable certified teachers with vocational skills to obtain the additional course work required for vocational teaching. The second new fellowship is for persons in industry who have job skills in demand in vocational education but who do not necessarily have a bachelors or teaching degree. Such awards would help alleviate the teacher demand and would also bring in people with needed skills. new ideas and experience within an industrial setting. My amendment would also result in better coordination between the courses in which teachers are being trained and the courses for which they are needed. The Commissioner of Education is required to identify areas of shortage and make awards to those who can best fill them. I ask for your support to H.R. 12835 including this amendment which is so crucial to the future of vocational education.",

A lot would hinge. of course. on how very exceptional the circumstances are and how that is interpreted. In Washington State and in other States. under State law each school district must go to the voters. in some instances. for special levies to meet operating expenses over and above that guaranteed by the State. Further. State laws prohibit a school district from trying more than twice in any one year to get voter approval of a school maintenance and operation levy. I would ask the chairman if he would agree with me that double levy failures in areas in which two consecutive levy failures prohibit the issue from being voted on again in that year. would be considered by us to be such exceptional circumstances.",

By this legislation we have substantially increased the authority. the input. the coordination with advisory councils. Mr. Chairman. I really want to take this time to point out to those who come along afterwards and appropriate for this bill how important that section on authorization for appropriations for State advisory councils is. If we cannot get the appropriations to have proper funding for counsel and for help for State advisory councils. they will be nothing more than paper organizations.

Yet. the gentleman now offers as an amendment to the committee amendment an exemption from the restrictions of this act of the very people who would be most likely to be expected to be asserting political pressure on those that come under them because the gentleman says in his amendment: In a position of a confidential or policydetermining character which is excepted from the competitive service. It is my understanding that that is worded so broadly. the staff tells me that anyone appointed by the President. subject to confirmation by the Senate. would be exempted from the provisions of the act. It would seem to me that we are exempting exactly the wrong people. If the purpose of the Hatch Act is to protect Federal employees from undue political pressure by people who are in a position to take retribution against them if they do not become amenable to their political pressures. then these people. above all. should not be added to the exemption which is already very broad. and which was worked out in a compromise with the Republicans. I might say. to exempt the President and all of his personal employees. They are the only people who can draw a Federal pay check and actively campaign on Federal property during working hours. using Federal facilities. We have already given the gentleman everybody that they normally use over there in a campaign. and now he is trying to add to them. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the remainder of my time.",

I do not know whether those allegations are correct or not. but it would seem to me if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and some of his top deputies could engage in political activities during office hours in their offices. the amendment we are now considering should be so drawn that it would make clear that such employees could not campaign in their offices during office hours. That type of amendment strikes me as perhaps an attempt to make the rest of the bill unacceptable. I have mixed views as to whether or not Federal employees at all levels should be permitted to campaign. I have a belief that many employees are denied their constitutional rights if they are not permitted to campaign on their own time.

The agency must place the employee on leave without pay either on the 90th day before the election either general or primary. or on the day following the date which the employee becomes a candidate. whichever comes later. An employee is a candidate when he has taken the action to qualify for nomination for election. or election. or has received political contributions or made expenditures. or has given consent for any person to receive political contributions or make expenditures. with a view to bringing about such employees nomination for election. or election. to such office. In a recent study conducted by the Congressional Research Services International Law Division. the conclusion was that the following countries require that their government employees take mandatory leave without pay: Australia. Canada. France. Belgium. Great Britain. Japan. and New Zealand. So it is certainly not unusual for a government employee to be required. to take mandatory leave without pay. Those candidates who are running for election to parttime elective office. for example. county water commissioner. school board. smalltown mayor. and so forth. shall be exempted from the requirement to take leave without pay upon the application of that employee to the Civil Service Commission. It is contemplated that most elective positions at county level or below will be exempted. However. the Commission must make that determination on a case by case basis. The purpose of the amendment is to prevent those who are candidates for fulltime elective positions from remaining on the Federal payroll while they are campaigning for political office.

The employee may elect to take accrued annual or other paid leave if this is available. Such leave terminates immediately upon the day after election. or when the employee declares that he is no longer a candidate for elective office. The Civil Service Commission is authorized. upon the request of an employee who seeks parttime elective office. to grant that employee an exemption from the application of this provision. It is my expectation that the commission will make a broad definition of the term \"part time.\" This would include public and party positions. the fulfillment of whose responsibilities in the ordinary course of events would not generally interfere with the discharge of an employees official duties. I anticipate that elective offices. especially political party elective offices. in political subdivisions below the county or municipal level would almost always fall within the deftnition of parttime elective office. Public elective offices in less than complete taxing jurisdictions with limited functions and limited periods of compensation would also fall within the determination of parttime elective office. It is imperative that Federal employees maintain not only the reality but the image of keeping political activities separate from the performance of their duties. This provision would provide an additional means of insuring that such activities do not erode public confidence in the impartial administration of government.

I would say that the bill before us is a good bill but it could be better. I support the bill. As I indicated when we had the sparse attendance last week when we debated this bill for some 4 hours. there is still. I am not going to say some fat but there is still some money that can be taken out of this bill and still provide for a generous increase over last year and provide for a strong national defense. We have reductions in this bill alleged as $3.7 billion. As I said last week. of that $3.7 billion. $1.2 billion was for Vietnam. The Budget Committee allowed $1 billion for Vietnam. The Armed Services Committee wisely took everything out. because Vietnam is all over. That leaves us with $2.5 billion worth of cuts. Of the $2.5 billion. $1.1 billion represents bookkeeping changes. representing the ship program. We have not modified any of our ship program. We still have a 22- or 23ship program. We are only accounting for some of the future year escalation. We are only accounting for some of the extra charge claims on file. As a result. the $1.1 billion saving is totally cosmetic. That brings us down to $1.4 billion. We took out $300 million worth of war stock claims. mainly because the war stocks. were not required in the view of the committee. had not been required and allowed in past years and there was no reason to change. In addition. the committee. out of the balance of $1.1 billion took out $521 million very wisely on an itembyitem basis in R.D.T. & E. That left $580 million.

I do not intend to use the full 5 minutes. but I would like just to explain to the membership some of the points that the gentlewoman from Colorado tried to make with respect to AWACS. The additional planes that we are talking about are not for this Nation but for Europe. Originally this aircraft was to fly over what is commonly termed the \"FEBA.\" the forward edge of battle area. However. it was determined. because of the airplanes vulnerability to fighters and to missiles. that we had to move it back from the FEBA a few hundred miles so that it could accomplish its control mission. Let me just tell the Members what this airplane is. It is a Boeing 707. It has about $80 million worth of computers. and it is going to stay a few hundred miles back. vector our fighters against enemy aircraft and look down at any attacking aircraft. The problem is that a Boeing 707 is terribly vulnerable to fighterinterceptors. and that as the airplanes are coming at it. it cannot count the numbers of enemy aircraft attacking it. Therefore. it is very vulnerable to missiles and fighters because it is slow and not very maneuverable. Its main mission. that of looking down and looking into the battle areas for enemy aircraft. cannot be accomplished because it is vulnerable to radiation missiles which home in on its radar. What I am saying is that one of the things we have to understand is that we are selling this plane to our European allies. We already have enough for ourselves. It is a very expensive aircraft. In testing the aircraft. it was found that it was not particularly sound. that it is vulnerable to being homed in on in the sky. and that it is vulnerable to groundbased jammers which the Soviets. if they wanted to. could deploy against us.

As a result of the discussion and expressed dissatisfaction of the test program to date. the Committee voted to reduce the procurement account by fifty percent and conditionally authorizes $260.25 million for three additional AWACS systems.

What I am trying to do is restore the funding that last year was available to the Economic Development Administration under title IX. Last year that agency under title IX received $77 million. Under the legislation before us they would receive only $47.5 million or in effect would face a cut of $29.5 million. My amendment would seek to restore that cut. I think it is very important to look at just exactly what EDA does with this type of appropriation. Basically. it helps through title IX to provide economic assistance to State and local areas facing special needs arising from actual or threatened severe unemployment. Such economic dislocation can be caused by the closure of Federal installationsand that is what I am going to be referring to here tonight. It can also be used to assist communities that are faced with compliance with environmental requirements. or communities who suffer severe changes in area economic conditions. I think it is important to note around the country the tremendous impact that base closures are going to have this year and in future years. This year DOD is talking of cutting back in 22 base areas serving 31 districts in 16 States. The Air Force alone is indicating it is going to cut back installation expenditures by $150 million.

I would say the closing of this base. if it were to happen. and the loss of 467 jobs would mean in that area an overall cutback in the payroll of that community of $136 million. If that cutback would be spread to all 12.000 civilian jobs in the country we are talking about an overall cutback in payroll of some $900 million. The closing of a base or the cutback of a base has tremendous negative economic impact on the community. It seems to me other communities faced with the loss of jobs. because of EPA or DOD action suffer a tremendous economic hardship and tremendous dislocation. We would like to see the people continue to live there and we would not want to lose this trained work force. Rather it is better for EPA to help job development and hold the people in the communities. EPA can help with that effort and show the people if necessary that there is some Federal help available during the transition from a militarybased economy to a civilianbased economy. Let me say to the Members. the Department of Defense. the Air Force. the Navy. and the Army are going to cut back in a myriad of other locations.

The committee has provided a total of $300 million in this bill for the various economic development assistance programs under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 and title II of the Trade Act of 1974. The budget request for this item was only $223.438.000. The amount in this bill is $76.562.000 more than the budget request. or an increase of 34 percent. Mr. Chairman. I believe that out of the total amount provided in the bill. it should be possible to provide a substantial program of economic development assistance including the title IX economic adjustment assistance program. The committe did not earmark the funds provided. EDA would have the flexibility to use the total amount. including the $76.6 million added by the committee. for those economic development programs where the demand is high and which would be most effective. The committee has not in any way limited the amount of funds in the bill for title IX or any of the other EDA programs except in the total amount of $300 million. In addition. I would point out that this program still requires authorization for fiscal year 1977. The committee did not want to earmark specific amounts for the various EDA programs in the appropriation bill in the absence of extension of the authorizing legislation. The total amount of $300 million in the bill will provide the necessary funding for all of the traditional. proven economic development assistance programs. pending the outcome of that legislation. The country is beginning to emerge from one of the worst economic declines in its history. Although the unemployment rate is down from the 8.9 percent of a year ago. it is still at an unacceptably high level of 7.3 percent. The funding level provided for EDA in this bill for jobproducing public works projects. business loans. economic adjustment assistance programs. and other economic development measures will help to maintain the proper balance in the economy necessary to avoid a resurgence of inflation or to halt the limited recovery.

Education. and Welfare in the school systems of my own district and others throughout the country. we must conclude that the witch hunt is back in style. One does not hear of any really solid investigative work to determine the facts involved in any individual complaints alleging racial or sex discrimination. Instead. we find the Office for Civil Rights pursuing an obsession with records. files. statistics. reports. and charts showing the racial and sex composition of schools. classes. courses. and even disciplinary caseloads. Local school officials are endlessly harassed with demands for such data. which can be produced only with large expenses of time and money. Agents of the Office for Civil Rights frequently approach local officials in an accusatory manner. challenging the local jurisdiction to prove itself innocent of race and sex discrimination. The Federal enforcement officials are actually getting deeply involved in the administration of local schools. mandating racial quotas for each school. class and course. and even insisting on racial balance in discipline. The civil rights laws as they were intended by Congress are not being enforced. Instead. what we are witnessing is a classic example of a bureaucratic fuddle factory in operation. perpetuating and expanding its empire by creating turmoil in local school systems. To correct this dreadful condition. I have introduced legislation that would set HEW on the proper course. This legislation would establish an orderly. legal process for the investigation of civil rights complaints. but it would stop the arbitrary and costly demands for records. files. statistics. and reports that burden local educators. Stated simply. my legislation would prohibit the Federal Government from requiring such information from local school systems. except when the data is necessary to pursue individual. specific complaints of race and sex discrimination. Whenever a local school district resists demands for information. the Federal agency could petition for a court order releasing the data. To obtain the court order. the Federal Agency would need to file formal complaints by students or parents and evidence showing \"probable cause\" that race or sex discrimination has occurred. This legislation is consistent with American legal tradition. It is a sound approach to enforcement of the laws of the land. but it protects local school districts from unreasonable harassment and impoundment of appropriated funds. I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

I am submitting for inclusion in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the address of President Ford to the National Religious Broadcasters congressional breakfast which was held in Washington on January 28. I believe all Members of the House and Senate should take the time to read the Presidents remarks. He takes a very strong position in support of religious liberty--one that reflects a positive and sincere expression of his own personal views. It is good that these views guide the man who holds Americas highest office. The Presidents comments were well received by those in attendance who favor strict adherence to religious liberty as guaranteed under the first amendment of our Constitution. The National Religious Broadcasters Association is among those in the forefront of those concerned with protecting our religious freedom and the right to worship in the manner of our own choosing. I believe this speech is timely and reassuring. The President has set the tone for meeting the awesome challenges this country faces here at home and throughout the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in my congressional district. there is a fine little city called Kokomo. Because of the stubbornness of postal management. it has become the rallying cry of indignant letter carriers all over America and eventually could very well be the cause of a nationwide postal strike. In Kokomo. postal authorities are conducting an experiment which they hope to implement nationwide. The experiment is really kind of a super timeandmotion study. augmented by computers. It is aimed at standardizing the routes of the letter carrierforcing them to take so many steps a minute. make so many stops in an hour. and so on. The end result of the experiment is to make the heavy task of the mailman even heavier by eliminating some routes by extending the routes still existing. Management feels it can eliminate 15.000 routes throughout the country. The letter carriers resent this. They feel there are no two routes exactly alike. and no two letter carriers exactly alike. and that it is foolish and vicious to computerize and evaluate them on exactly the same basis. Mr. Speaker. I agree with the letter carriers. These are fine. dedicated men who. for more than 100 years. have been the Nations best ambassadors to the people. Despite all the experimentation going on. the mail service is swiftly deteriorating. Every day it is worse than it was the previous day. Morale is low. The employees are bitter. I sincerely hope the postal managers will abandon the Kokomo plan. and will concentrate their efforts on moving and delivering the mail as swiftly as possible. A postal strike would be disastrous to the economy in these difficult times. It can be avoided only if management puts away its pride and yields to the commonsense of its employees.",

The conference has now reached the point where a summit meeting is being planned for early this year to ratify the conference agreements. By some accounts. the size of this summit will exceed both the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Versailles Peace Conference of 1919. One of the many issues that has been raised at this conference Is the status of the Sovietcontrolled Baltic States of Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. The Soviet Union has urged that the World War II boundaries be accepted by the United States and Europe. A ratification by the West would put a seal of legitimacy on the territorial gains made by the Soviet Union during World War II. An acceptance of the Soviet claim that the people of the Baltic States voluntarily joined the U.S.S.R. would be not only a falsification of history. but also a renunciation of the principles of selfdetermination and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which this countrys foreign policy has long been based. Mr. Speaker. February 24 marks the 57th anniversary of the Estonian independence. It is appropriate at this time for us to remember the people of Estonia.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we have struggled with the proposals to clean up our presently unhealthy air from the pollutants our modern technology produces. we find ourselves increasingly confronted with hard choices. We wish to increase employment to keep up with the growing work force. We wish to increase energy supplies to avoid energy shortages. And we wish to have a long and healthy. as well as a satisfying. life. Air pollution jeopardizes this last goal very directly by deteriorating our health. Yet increased employment. which is based on even faster climbing energy consumption rates. to produce goods that produce even more pollution. is detrimental to our entire way of life. We do not have to employ people in jobs that continue this cycle. People could be employed in laborintensive industries. such as insulating homes. making and retrofitting solar heating panels. and the like. instead of producing automobiles that waste valuable resources. destroy communities. require vast amounts of scarce oil to operate. as well as injure and kill people. If we addressed this issue head on. and dealt with it now. we would avoid the larger problems that are inevitable if we pursue the ways of the past. I discussed a few weeks ago the Presidents proposal to freeze auto emission standards. instead of cleaning up the automobile exhaust. as now required by law. Quite simply. we cannot afford to allow the excess pollution the President is urging. to enter the air we must breathe. But what if we do succeed in cleaning up the automobile to the degree required by law? Will we then have clean air? Mr. Speaker. unfortunately we will not. Some years ago a number of elected officials. including myself. said that the internal combustion engine must be banned from our urban centers. We introduced legislation to do this. but the Congress. in its wisdom. chose to require maximum emission standards for each vehicle. These emission standards have been met by a variety of engine technologies. mostly the internal combustion engine with modifications. and if all autos in the United States meet the standards currently required by law. we would still have harmful concentrations of air pollution.",

The President has concluded. quite wisely I believe. that the American people deserve and need to know the truth about our economy. regardless of how depressing the truth may be. The President believes that it is up to Government to exercise unprecedented fiscal discipline with regard to spending policies. This will require a considerable degree of courage on the part of Members of Congress. For we have become accustomed to having just about anything we want. Another major aspect of the Presidents analysis is the importance of the private sector to do what it can to stimulate production and restore consumer confidence. Many private businesses and industries have already responded to the Presidents call for help. They are initiating special programs involving cash rebates aimed at getting people to purchase surplus goods. One such program has been instituted by the Apache Corp. of Minneapolis. Minn. Mr. Raymond Plank. the president of Apache. recently wrote to me to explain his program with the expressed hope that others in the private sector will emulate his effort. The Apache program provides cash incentives to the first 10 percent of the employees who purchase new Americanbuilt automobiles or major appliances. Mr. Plank writes: We recognize that governmental action is urgently needed. but. if the private sector can also be sufficiently innovative. our Initiatives could supplement yours in important ways. I wholeheartedly concur with this analysis and applaud this gentlemans concern and initiativeas well as the many other businessmen like him who are trying to help cure our economic problems. We can get the economy back on a healthy coursebut only if Government. business and the consumer all work together.

Now the ratchet has been given another hard twist. locking once firm allies into a relationship of mutual hostility. This situation cannot continue. Common sense demands a reconsideration of yesterdays actiona simple and statesmanlike gesture of a kind that only a truly great and responsible nation can offer. The bill I am proposing today can be the vehicle for this reconsideration. It is identical to H.R. 8454. except for the deletion of section 3 in its entirety. Section 3 of course hinged on consideration of our military assistance bill later this year and was largely a confusing encumbrance. This bill draws the lines in a clear and simple way. It allows aid that had already been committedaid vital to the NATO roleto be released. It allows the President to grant licenses for certain commercial sales. It opens the pipeline ever so slightly. but hopefully enough to redress the terrible policy dislocations that have so far occurred. Unless we quickly and effectively lance this painful sore. the secondary infections will be dire indeed: we will have : (1) destroyed the southern flank of NATO. (2) retarded the prospects for peace on Cyprus. (3) disrupted a longstanding bilateral relationship. and (4) given the importance of our monitoring bases in Turkey--decreased the likelihood for any meaningful verification of future strategic arms agreements.

Also. as in our own country. the Germans find themselves confronted with the question of multiparty politics. While we have had considerable discussion of the creation of a third national party in the United States this year. the Germans may be on the verge of having a fourth national political party emerge. Presently German politics is segmented into four parties. but one of them. the Christian Social Union (CSU). headed by Franz Josef Strauss. exists only in the province of Bavaria. In the national legislature. the CSU has been allied with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). On the other hand. both the Free Democrats and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) run as national parties and together compose the ruling majority coalition in Germany headed by Helmut Schmidt. Many Germans. especially those sympathetic with the conservative philosophy of the CSU now feel that only by emerging from Bavaria and creating a national party can the ruling coalition be challenged in the elections. Quite simply they believe that two national parties cannot be adequately counterbalanced by only one national party allied with one regional party. Now this idea of a national conservative party has been given some implicit support in a recent poll in Germany. This opinion poll conducted in Bavaria and NorthrineWestphalia indicated that the CSU and CDU running as two completely separate parties would receive several percentage points more of the votes than they do under the present regional arrangements. Since only a few seats separate the ruling German coalition from the CDU/CSU alliance this poll may reveal the possibility of a new governing coalition emerging with the transformation of the political system into four national parties. Since this poll may imply momentous consequences for the German political system. I wish to bring the results of it to the attention of my colleagues. Therefore.

But Don is also a native of Maine. and. like the true Mainer that he is. he has retained a perspective about the people and the institutions of the Federal Government which others who work in this town so frequently lose. \"The best thing Washington people can do is remind themselves that the real power of America lies not within the geographic bounds of the Federal city but with the people who live beyond it.\" Don Larrabee told the graduates. \"Everything is anywhere but Washington.\" Larrabees message is one that cannot be repeated often enough.

One need not oppose the purposes of \"detente\" to note that the rape of Czechoslovakia. nearly 7 years ago. was and remains a blot on the Soviet record that no number of space spectaculars can erase. Soviet occupation forces are in Czechoslovakia today. in defiance of the United Nations and all the rules of civilized conduct among nations. Think of it: 15 million Czechs. whose only offense is that they had tasted freedom. remain under Russian subjugation. Early in 1968. a liberalization movement was spreading like wildfire in long oppressed Czechoslovakia. The longtime Communist boss. Antonin Novotny. had been replaced as party leader by a moderate. Alexander Dubcek. who by his words and deeds gave notice of his intention to democratize the country. It was too much for the Russians to take. and on August 21. 1968. they sent 500.000 troops to crush and smother the new spirit of liberty. The Russians and their Warsaw Pact allies easily won the onesided contest. of course. Freedom was the losernot just in Czechoslovakia. but everywhere human rights are cherished. And so.

The House could. of course. reverse the action by passing a disapproval resolution. but I cannot imagine any Member who voted against the Members being included in this most recent costofliving increase would change his vote. and over and above these Members there are some of us who supporting reasonable raises for Members of Congress and the Judiciary have all along supported the Presidents suggestion to hold the pending pay raise to 5 percent. Incidentally. Federal employees. exclusive of Members of Congress. the judiciary. and higher levels of the executive branch. have had seven costofliving increases totaling 42 percent since 1969. So. I personally feel one can be consistent in holding to the 5percent figure for those who have had all these raises since 1969 and still support some reasonable figure in excess of that for those who have been frozen without one increase since 1969. And I might say in conclusion. Mr. Speaker. I do not like the idea of tying our own salaries to an automatic escalator.

House Resolution 727. which provides for consideration of S. 584. retirement credit for National Guard technician service. The rule is open. allows 1 hour of general debate. and makes the committee substitute in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. Under the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968. credit for technician service performed prior to January 1. 1969. is permitted only in the case of an employee who performs service as a technician on or after January 1. 1969. Thus. if an employee served for 10 years prior to 1969. but left his position before 1969. he is not eligible to receive credit even though he serves in some other position under the civil service retirement system after January 1. 1969. S. 584. as amended by the committee. provides full credit for pre1969 National Guard technician service for annuity computation purposes to those employees who have served under the technician program on or after January 1. 1969. The committee. therefore. has amended the bill. as passed by the Senate. to continue in effect the existing limits for credit for pre1969 service to those persons who perform as a technician on or after January 1. 1969. An individual who does not so serve on or after January 1. 1969. will receive no credit for civil service retirement purposes for pre1969 technician service under this legislation. Mr. Speaker. while the enactment of S. 584 will increase the unfunded liability of the civil service retirement and disability fund by approximately $128 million. it will not result in a greater retirement benefit for National Guard technicians than has been provided for other groups of employees brought under the civil service retirement program. I support this rule. and I heartily endorse the passage of this legislation. Its enactment will correct a longexisting inequity in the Federal retirement system.",

To have a nativeborn spiritual leader as our bishop Is a distinct tribute to our people. Bishop Flores was born In Agana. Guam. in 1921. After completing his early education at the Guam Institute. he entered San Jose Seminary in the Philippines in 1940 to begin his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained a priest in 1949 at St. Johns Seminary in Brighton. Mass. Since that time he has served with distinction the church of Guam in varied and responsible capacities. among them as chancellor of the diocese. diocesan consultant. rector of the cathedral. and the superintendent of schools. For many years Bishop Flores served as chaplain of the Guam Legislature and is presently the U.S. military delegate for Guam. Wake. and the Mariannas. He was raised to the rank of papal chamberlain in 1959 by Pope John XXIII and to the rank of domestic prelate in 1963 by Pope Paul VI. In 1970 he was raised to the episcopacy. An alumnus of the Fordham. Graduate School. Bishop Flores is a member of the Canon Law Society of America. the National Catholic Education Association. the American Association of School Administrators. and Phi Delta Kappa. His leadership is truly a composite of professional acumen and deep love and concern for the people of Guam and the trust territory. In recent years his direction and zeal have been the impetus in the establishment of the Catholic Medical Center on Guam. I am delighted that Bishop Flores can be with us today.",

My reason for proposing that the word \"domestic\" be deleted from this sentence is that its retention may provide the Federal Power Commission with an excuse for denying the priority provided under this section to any nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer or others who may be selling any of their products in the export market. While our Nation today is a net importer of nitrogen fertilizer. some nitrogen fertilizer is still exported. Much of what is sold for export Is in reality for purposes of a \"swap\" or assurance of our being able to obtain from foreign nations other fertilizer products such as potash from Canada. or other materials which are essential to the production of food. fiber and other U.S. produced goods. When Mr. Nassikas. Chairman of the Federal Power Commission. appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee regarding S. 2310. he as much as stated that he did not believe that any natural gas priority for agriculture was needed since we export so much of our food and fiber. A similar statement was issued earlier this year by the FPC staff. I am told.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as we debate all aspects of the issue of natural gas production and conservation. I want to make certain that we do not overlook the interest of agriculture as it relates to the dairy Industry. Milk production on our farms utilizes very little energy in the raw milk process. but once the milk is produced it is very perishable in liquid form and must be processed to allow for storage so that seasonal surpluses can be utilized and economically distributed. In my State of Minnesota about 3.4 billion pounds of skim milk and 1.4 billion pounds of liquid whey are processed annually as a byproduct of butter and cheese production. If the byproduct is not processed there are only two alternatives for using the skim milk and liquid whey: First. feed as much as possible to livestock. and second. dump the rest. Using this valuable protein source for livestock feed is not economical and dumping creates ecological problems and tremendous economic loss to our dairy farmers and their cooperatives. To even contemplate dumping is unthinkable In the face of the tremendous need for nonfat dry milk. Under the Public Law 480 program about 100 million pounds of milk powder was utilized this past fiscal year. These byproducts of butter and cheese contribute significantly to the Nations nutritional needs and to the agricultural economy. Currently these products are being dried in plants using direct combustion driers. These driers require natural gas as a clean burning fuel for product purity. Propane has been used as a substitute during small natural gas cutbacks but propane supply Is linited and not available to meet total needs. I want to be certain in my understanding that the legislation now being considered does assure a high priority status for natural gas for use in food processing. and particularly in the processing of skim milk and liquid whey into dry form. Is that the sponsors intent?",

I am pleased to see that section 5(a) of the amendments to S. 934 gives a priority for essential agricultural. food processing. and packaging uses of natural gas because the problems of providing food at reasonable prices is of great concern. As I know the Senator is aware. the farmers and food processors in my home State of Minnesota provide commodities for the American marketplace. The quality. variety. and abundance of this produce has been unequaled in the history of the world. A reasonable cost for most of these goods. however. depends upon adequate amounts of natural gas. Certain steps in preparation and packaging simply cannot be done without the use of natural gas. One procedure involves the singeing of hairs and bristles from the carcasses of hogs so that they can be cooked. packed. and distributed in the forms that the public knows and enjoysham. sausage. lunchmeat. and frankfurters. Last year every American consumed the equivalent of 65 pounds of pork. The Senator can understand that a change in processing fuels could mean a cessation of production or a reduction in efficiency of onethird. Therefore. I am concerned that the Secretary of Agriculture have proper guidance in making his determinations as to what is an essential agricultural use. Am I correct in assuming that this essential agricultural. food processing. and packaging priority was added to this bill in order to assure the continued availability of natural gas for essential agricultural commodities where natural gas usage is necessary.",

The problem is there has to be a definition of the word \"friend\" and the definition of the word \"freedom.\" I do not think there is any definition by the Governments of either Cambodia or South Vietnam which defines \"freedom\" and \"friend\" in a way deserving of the support of either Congress or the American people.

Before those who described and dismissed the committees proposal as a boondoggle to big business reject this amendment out of hand. I ask that they consider the changes and several points about the concept which were lost in the earlier rhetoric. Let me list the changes. First. The committee bill would have permitted a firm to apply the new carryback option to any taxable year from 1970 on. Our amendment restricts that option to taxable years 1974 and 1975. That change means that the amendment will assist only those firms whose business has been adversely affected by the current recession and greatly improves the likelihood that with an upswing in the economy. there will be no longterm loss in Federal revenues. Second. Under the committee bill. a company with a supplementary unemployment benefit planSUBwould have put up to 12.5 percent of any refund into the plan. and spread the payments over a 10year period. Our amendment requires that the company puts 25 percent of any refund into existing SUB plans in the year the refund is received. The change means that at least one hardpressed SUB program will remain in business longer. and that those served by the plan will delay the time when they begin to ask the question. \"Where is the welfare office?\"",

In January 1974. Chrysler employed 62.400 hourly wage workers in the Detroit area. This past January. that figure was down to 38.000 hourly wage employees. Detroit has an unemployment rate of 23 percent. One thing that city does not need is any more layoffs. Nationwide. Chrysler normally employs 113.000 hourly wage workers. About 48.000 of those are laid off. and one thing this country does not need is still longer unemployment lines. So it just may be that my parochial interest in this amendment is shared by those representing many other sections of our country. When measured against the costs of increased unemploymentand they range from food stamps to forfeiture of HUD guaranteed mortgages. to welfare payments to the unmeasurable mental strain and waste of human skills and energy resulting from widespread unemploymentthe temporary loss in Federal revenues resulting from this amendment could turn out to be a bargain.

I think it is important to emphasize that there is Important recognition in this bill of the housing industry. There are outright subsidies provided in the bill to stimulate the housing industry. But the other major industry that Is dragging the economy down Is the automobile industry and the depression that we are experiencing in the automobile industry. In our State upwards of 14 percent are out of work and 25 percent of the automobile workers have been out of work. Fortunately. some of them have been called back recently. but It may be a temporary situation. I think it Is important to realize that the investment tax credit that is provided in this bill Is meaningful only to corporations and businesses that make a profit. It does nothing to help a corporation that is incurring losses. The only way that you can help a corporation that is incurring a loss Is to recognize the equity of this particular approach which only allows the corporations Involved to spread their losses over a different period of time. Really. what is involved here would be the Chrysler Corp. and other businesses that are affected getting some of their own tax money back. tax money that they have already paid in in years when they have made a profit. It is to allow them to offset that against the years now when they are incurring severe losses. Furthermore. as the amendment is drafted. although there is some concern about it. there would be substantial help to the laidoff workers involved because a significant portion of what would be involved here would go to supplement unemployment compensation benefits.

One such en.during characterization of our American life is St. Josaphats Basilica. located in my congressional district on the South Side of Milwaukee. Wis. The edifice was constructed at the turn of the century. and this year St. Josaphats congregation is celebrating its diamond jubilee. The richly ornamental neorenaissance Roman Catholic church has fascinated architects. clergymen. journalists. and tourists for the past 75 years of its remarkable history. In the late 19th century. America saw the influx of a large number of Poles who established numerous viable communities throughout the eastern half of the country. Eventually. these PolishAmerican communities. called the \"Polonias.\" came to be distinguished by their social institutionschurches and schools. as well as social and sports clubs. The parish of St. Josaphat was therefore established in 1888 to serve as the central link in the lives of the many Polish immigrants who settled on Milwaukees South Side. With a membership of over 1.300 families. it soon became necessary for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee to approve the construction of a much larger church. CXXII1852Part 23",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to bring to the attention of the Congress a problem that is of great concern to those of us from Colorado. The mountain pine beetle is a parasite that normally occurs in moderate numbers in the foothills of Colorados Front Range. In the past few years. however. the beetle population has grown to an epidemic level. I have toured the infested areas in my district. and have seen hillsides where most of the trees have been killed by beetles. The destruction caused by this epidemic threatens the values that make the foothills of the Rockies a unique residenital and recreational area. Since the infested area is one of intermingled Federal. State. and private ownership. efforts by just one group of landowners cannot control the spread of the insects. For the past 3 years. a limited but effective suppression program has been undertaken by the U.S. Forest Service. the Colorado State Forester. and private landowners. Operating under the authority of a 1947 law that was passed because of the type of problems caused by the mountain pine beetle. the Forest Service has contributed about $230.000 a year to the cooperative program. Earlier this year. the Forest Service expressed grave doubts about whether it will continue even this modest assistance in fiscal year 1977. Since a high percentage of the infested area is national forest land. withdrawal by the Forest Service would end any hopes of the suppression effort being successful. Because of the grave consequences should the Federal Government not contribute to the control effort. I have been in close contact with the Forest Service about the guidelines that it is using to decide whether to participate in the coming year. I am pleased to report that the chances appear far better than they did just a short time ago that the Colorado program will include continued Forest Service participation. The ultimate decision. strangely enough. is up to the Office of Management and Budget. The Chief of the Forest Service. however. has indicated that he will support the Colorado proposal when it is reviewed by OMB. For the information of my colleagues. I am printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD some of the correspondence between the Forest Service and myself. Although these letters do not reflect the telephone conversations and meetings that we have had. they provide a good summary of the issues that are involved:",

Labor Day is the turning point of getting down to business regarding work. political. or otherwise. and also begins the allout open campaign of the exciting and great drama of a Presidential election. My colleagues. I would like to take this moment to hail the occasion of Labor Day honoring the tremendous contributions of the American working man to the cause of the Republic. From American shops. factories. mills. mines. and farms. have flowed the greatest abundance of all time. and American workers have produced it all. But that is not the sole accomplishment of labor. Social and economic justice is as much a goal of the average working man as food on the table. In times of stress as well as times of prosperity. the free trade unions of America are devoted to the interests of the disadvantaged few who. alone among our millions. have yet to experience prosperity. Every segment of the American community must help in this endeavor. in which the labor movement has played so prominent a role. By vigorous employment of our vast national wealth. energy. and intelligence. we will reshape American society in such manner that. eventually if not tomorrow. a useful and productive life shall be the birthright of every American citizen. That is the promise of the American labor movement. and one requiring the respect of everyone. In many ways. the social and economic gains of all America are part and parcel of the grand advances by labor in the current century. Economic gains. oldage pensions. industrial safety laws. and the social security systemall were supplied largely in answer to labors demands. And who is to deny that social gainssuch as extended franchise rights and civil rightsand educational gainssuch as modem public school systemsare not a blessing to the land. These. too. were supplied. in large part. in answerto the protests of labor against educational and political inequality. at the expense of working men and their families. In honor of the workers themselves. and their organizational activities. I join with millions of others in hailing their performance. as a symbol of America in action and the glory of their cause.",

H.R. 3065 would provide a tax rebate of up to $120.000 each year to approximately 40 brewers. Many of these companies are thriving without this unique tax subsidy. others are owned by huge conglomerates which would ultimately benefit at the taxpayers expense. The Ways and Means Committee devoted only a few minutes to this precedentsetting bill. hearing only from the bills sponsors and the lobbyist for the brewers. who properly referred to H.R. 3065 as our bill.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is clear that national policy requires that the vast coal deposits in the upper Great Plains be extracted and converted into energy to assist our country in achieving a greater degree of independence from foreign oil suppliers. What is not so clear. however. is what is to happen after the coal is mined. Essentially there are three possible routes. First. to utilize the coal near to the mining site through mine mouth power generation facilities and coal gasification plants. Second. to ship the coal by rail to powerplants within the region or in other parts of the country. Or. fiinally. to utilize a coalslurry pipeline concept to move coal by this method to generating facilities half a continent away. One of the most ambitious of these proposals is that advanced by Energy Transportation Systems. Inc.-ETSIto construct a coalslurry pipeline from the coal fields of Wyoming to Arkansas. I have been skeptical of the ETSI approach on several counts. There remain technical questions on the pipeline operations Itself. there is doubt if there is sufficient use for that amount of coal at the terminal end of the pipeline. there is convincing evidence that the railroads can haul the coal cheaper. more efficiently and with more diversification of ultimate destination than is possible with the coalslurry pipeline. The accepted national policy of revitalizing American Railroads would seem at odds with the ETSI proposal. Although my State of South Dakota does not have great amounts of coal. it is apparent that ETSI would look to the great reservoirs on the Missouri River in South Dakota to provide the water for their coal slurry line. It is highly questionable if it makes good economic sense to move water from the semiarid upper Great Plains to the south in these quantities. With these factors in mind. I was pleased to note a report by the respected Upper Midwest Council of Minneapolis which. among its other findings and recommendations. suggests that the coalslurry pipline as proposed by ETSI Is not warranted. In addition. the report sets out an agenda for coal and water utilization and development for our part of the country. Mr. President.

I would like to speak briefly on behalf of the pending resolution to create a permanent committee on oversight with the authority necessary to assure that that committee would be privy to crucial information it must have. and so it would have the authority to influence policy in secret where. as is often the case. it can only be handled responsibly in that environment. This resolution is the result of 15 months work of the Select Committee on Intelligence. and it is the result of several weeks of negotiations and serious discussion on the part of the Committee on Government Operations under the chairmanship of the distinguished floor manager and that of the Committee on Rules and Administration under the chairmanship of the Senator from Nevada . I believe the present resolution is a welldrafted. carefully prepared. and practical document. which gives this committee the authority it must have. It provides a membership that is representative of the Senate. It provides guarantees that secrets will be kept and. in effeet. meets the problem that has been unmet. although discussed for years. namely. of creating a requirement of accountability to Congress over the intelligence activities of the whole range of intelligence agencies. I think the bottom line of this issue is very simple and yet very profound. If there is one lesson that our committee felt above all must be learned from our study of the abuses which have been reported. it has been the crucial necessity of establishing a system of congressional oversight.",

The frightening thing about all this is that a very small group of people control almost the entire known supply of the material. Forbes magazine on January 15. 1975. described this tight little operation. The article follows: TBz FivE ARROWS. NucLEARSTYLE Control of the uranium cartel may be far more concentrated than would appear at first glance. As suggested by the fist clenching five arrows in the family crest. the Rothschilds of France and England have an interest in nearly every major uranium mine in the world. Rio Tinto Zinc. a mining company in which the French Rothschilds have traditionally been major owners. holds a controlling interest in Rio Algom Mines. whose Canadian mines have the largest uranium reserves in North America. RTZ owns nearly twothirds of the huge new Rossing uranium mine in South West Africa. It also controls Mary Kathleen Uranium. the only Australian uranium mine capable of going into operation soon. The largest South African gold producer. Anglo American Corp.. is also the countrys largest uranium producer. since South African uranium is produced as a byproduct of gold production. One of Anglo Americans associated companies. Charter Consolidated. has a Rothschild on its board. and owns nearly 10% of RTZ. The centerpiece of the French Rothschilds nonferrous metal group is Imttal (formerly Le Nickel). which has a controlling share of the Mokta and Pennaroya companies. two of the largest uranium producers in France and in the former French colonies of Gabon and Niger. They also participate in joint ventures with the other large French producer. Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann. The Rothschild presence is everything. Baron Guy de Rothschild heads Imdtal. He also sits on the board of RTZ. In turn. Harry Oppenheimer. the chief executive of Anglo American. and Sir Val Duncan. the chief executive of RTZ. sit on the board of Imttal. Only in Australia do the Rothschild companies have a relatively small share of the total uranium reserves.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Dr. William J. Fellner. a member of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers and previously an opponent of indexation for Federal taxes and obligations. came out in strong support of this proposal. in a recent speech delivered in Kings Point. N.Y. On behalf of my colleagues and myself who have worked for many months now on enacting legislation. I welcome his conversion and support. and I wish to share some of the pertinent observations made by Professor- Fellner in his address. This years annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers reveals that the 1974 inflation rate of 11 percent caused personal income tax payments to rise by $8 billion. Mr. Fellner asserted that this increase is directly attributable to the relocation of taxpayers dollar income into new. distorted taxable income levels. He points out: In any event. the $8 billion estimate for 1974 is based on the assumption that the distorting effect of inflation results exclusively from the relocation of taxpayers from nontaxable into taxable brackets. and from lower to higher brackets. because their money incomes reflect an inflationary trend which their real incomes. of course. do not display. Dr. Felner proceeds with considerable detail to advance the need for complete tax indexation since the corporate tax structure also allows inflation to deprive corporate taxpayers of more of their real incomes than Congress intended. Indeed. private enterprise would have been saved nearly $20 billion in 1974 alone had no taxes been levied on inflationary gains. strictly on corporate taxpayers. Therefore. in 1974. the cost of nonindexed. progressive taxation to the Nations taxpayers was almost $30 billion. Conversely. Dr. Fellner continued: I have concluded that tax indexation such as would have excluded the inflationary distortions developing during 1974 would have led to a reduction of tax payments by up to $30 billion in that year. Mr. Speaker. we are all looking for ways to relieve recessionary pressures. while simultaneously combating inflationary elements which removed many natural economic stabilizers. primarily through longrange. comprehensive tax reforms. I invite my colleagues in Congress to join Dr. Fellner In support of the true and effective reforms offered by complete indexation of the Federal tax structure.

Even the Department of Agriculture. which opposes my seed bill. has stated that the contributions of the backyard and community vegetable gardener will be greatly needed. Not needed at some future date. mind you. but needed this year. The rapidly growing world demand. coupled with adverse weather conditions worldwide. can only mean that our own prices here at home will continue to rise sharply. As we have witnessed this week. the Department of Agriculture insists on sending our food supplies abroad. The price of bread has already increased by 1 cent per loaf as a direct result of the first sale of wheat to Russia. More sales will be made. not only of wheat. but soy beans. rice. sugar. and prices will continue to soar. Shortages could develop. trapping the consumer between big government and big agriculture. If we do not even give our constituents the opportunity to grow their own vegetables. we will be exhibiting the height of irresponsibility and callousness.

In my district. tens of thousands of working families and people on fixed incomes have been hard hit by such price hikes for utility services. What is particularly unacceptable to me is that often such utility price increases have been processed and put into force without any kind of required public hearings in many jurisdictions around the Nation. Usually. it is proper procedure for a utility to file a request for price hikes with the appropriate agency. in this case the Federal Power Commission. which possesses authority to pass on these requests when the sales of power are interstate by nature. Public hearings are then scheduled. However. in this process. the Federal Agency seems to almost always grant the price increase as requested and move it along through the proper channels. The purpose of these public hearings is to discover whether or not the price rise is Justified. It is also to allow all parties to make their arguments. pro and con. in a proper forum before any decision is rendered. What is actually happening. then. is a series of events which increasingly are making a mockery out of the concept and intent of the public hearing process.

Indeed. if we consider the record of the World Bank loans before. during. and after the Allende regime. we notice a very familiar pattern. While the loans negotiated in 1969. before the establishment of the Allende Government. total almost $20 million. there are no additional Bank loans until the 1974 Technical Assistance Loan of $5 million. And the policy reversal continues in 1975 with an extension of $20 million for agricultural credit. The recent allocation of $33 million reinforces this substantial upswing. Certainly. the rationale that the Allende loan applications were denied because Chiles economy was \"not creditworthy\" is equally applicable at present. when we consider the current rate of Chilean inflation in excess of 300 percent. and thus we are led to the conclusion that political rather than economic considerations substantially influence World Bank decisions. These actions reflect a similar pattern set by U.S. bilateral aid policies to Chile during the same period. Chiles present status as the prime recipient of U.S. economic aid in the hemisphere stands in stark contrast to the meager aid aggregate provided for the Allende regime. Both records reveal an obvious intent to destabilize the Allende Government and to prop up the present junta.

Every aspect of cattle raising costs has risen. led by the astronomical increase in the cost of feed. At the same time. competition from imported beef and a decreasing share of 3.1441 their beefs sales price due to an increasing middlemens share has cut ranchers income drastically. What has been at best a boomandbust livestock economy has turned into a stagnantandbust one. Without a steady. moderate demand for beef. the outlook for independent ranchers is grim. And Montanas ranchers are not usually a part of some national corporation. Their very independence. which makes them unwilling to accept either Government handouts or interference. makes them vulnerable to slackening of consumer demand for beef. Practically every other agricultural commodity group has asked for. and received from the Federal Government. a series of price supports. subsidies. and promotional work. all at Government expense. What these independent ranchers want is a chance nationally to coordinate their promotional work at no expense to the Government. They are asking for nothing new. Many other commodity groups have similar arrangements. What is new is that any rancher who wants his money back can get it back. so small producers will not have to share in the promotional costs of the group. This small step toward marketing coordination has been carefully considered by the Agriculture Committee for 2 years. It may well be that even its economic benefits and noncoercive nature will not be enough to persuade independent ranchers to accept it. But there is a referendum for that purpose. Congress should at least give the beef industry a chance to hold its own in a tight consumer market.",

This legislation goes a long way to legitimize an organization of beef producers ostensibly to finance a program of research. production. and promotion. The legislation also sets in motion a valueadded tax at the point of slaughter and each point of processing. Taxation Is not and should not be the subject of legislation before the Agriculture Committee. The tax proposed under this billalthough refundable. Is nevertheless a tax which must be reflected in the ultimate price to the consumer. This tax is suggested to promote the consumption of beef. Beef needs no special promotion. The American consumer will buy all that he can afford. The sale and consumption of beef could be considerably enhanced by a reduction in price or by the rejection of any tax which must find its way to the price paid by the consumer. It is incredible for the beef industry to seek funds raised through this tax for research in the beef Industry. The taxpayers of America spent $49.9 million in fiscal year 1974 for beef research in existing agriculture programs. It has never been suggested that these research appropriations are to be reduced if this new taxfunding system is developed. There are other consequences of this legislation that must be considered. It permits beef producers to organize for ostensibly legitimate purposes. However. the organization could develop into an instrumentality of market control. limiting production to stabilize or increase consumer prices. Today. the price of oil throughout the free world is determined by the OPEC cartel which Is able to fix prices by limiting production and maintain price levels completely unrelated to the cost of production. This beef bill threatens to establish a cartel system which will eventually operate to control production. to maintain or escalate consumer prices in the same way. It should be rejected.",

The Beef Board itself will consist of members of eligible producer organizations. Cattle ranchers in the First Congressional District have advised me that the 197273 season was the last in which they made a profit from raising their cattle. One reported that he lost $150 on 200 head in the 197374 season for a $30.000 loss. His losses were not as heavy last season. but he feared that feed and other production costs were going to make him a loser again this season if relief did not come when the time came for him to sell his livestock. It is difficult for consumers to rationalize the inconsistencies that exist at the butcher shop. While consumers are paying more for beef than ever before. ranchers are receiving less for their livestock sales. One of the purposes of this bll is to attempt to prove who is gouging the American public. It is certainly not the cattle farmer.",

I think it is important for the Members to know that Assistant Secretary Feltner has said very plainly in the report as follows: Further. we believe it would be administratively impossible to enforce the provision which requires that assessments be made and collected for each sale. Mr. Chairman. I think there is no question about that. We are opening up a whole new program of what I believe to be Government interference with the cattle producer. which is one thing that the cattle producers have convinced me they do not want. They want to have a marketplace where the cattle producer can make his money legitimately. and the consumer can buy. If this were a new commodity that we were trying to introduce to the American public. then I would say that there is justification. but do any Members know of any of their constituents who do not know of and are familiar with and desire cattle products on their table? They want to have them and to have more of them. Therefore. why take an action that is going to increase the price and make it less likely that this will happen?",

I do not know how we can maintain a free economy and I do not believe we can keep our system of private property running if we are going to let somebody else come in. who did not contribute a dime. and spend the money that somebody else has made and contributed. These cattlemen have to pay these bills. all of them. We have just adopted an amendment that goes so far as to say that we require the cattlemen to pay for the referendum. There is not a labor union in the United States that I know of that pays for the referendum in an industrial plant. Yet the Government holds their elections and pays all the costs. whether they win or lose. But In this the cattlemen will pay all the costs whether they win or lose. The cattlemen are going to pay all the money that is required under this bill. The gentleman from New York said that is going to be a right nice kitty and he wants to put his paws on it. so he says he wants half the people who sit on the board of directors to come from places where they would have paid none of this money. That is just not our system of private property. It is not our system of doing business. There are nations in the world which use this system which has people who contribute nothing but who do the spending. I think it is a bad system. It is a wicked system. It is an inefficient system. It is one which will break our whole American system. I hope the House will recognize this and recognize that this amendment Is intended merely to destroy the bill which is a good bill.

We have already got consumers. 100 percent of them on the board. without the necessity for this amendment. The amendment seems to bring into focus some sort of conflict between consumer and producer. The best thing for a producer is a healthy economy and a healthy consumer to buy his product. The best thing for a consumer is a healthy producer to produce a healthy quantity and good quality product at a cheap price. We are not going to have more beef or better quality beef at better prices if we do not have healthy producers.

Why is it true that a veal calf sells for 32 cents per pound at a loss. and we are paying $3.59 per pound in the market as consumers? It only took me 1 year as a consumer advocate to find out what some of the problems are. Why did six trucks leave Iowa the other day with quartered beef instead of having it butchered in Iowa? Because it had to be butchered in Chicago. We could have had three or four trucks at most instead of six. saving a half or a third of the cost of transportation between Iowa and Chicago. These are some of the things we all know about but will not mention on this floor. We know why there is such a great cost spread between the farmer and the consumer. and it is because everybody is taking a deeper and deeper cut all the way down the line and -raising the cost.. and the farmer gets no more. As to the problem of consumer advocates. that is no mystery either. We have in almost every State of this Nation a State consumer director. people who have done this job. and they find out how the consumer is being taken. We know what is going on in this country. These are legitimate consumer representatives. and I can name a dozen right now. In the State of Wisconsin. for example. the Department of Agriculture has a splendid consumer advocate. So.

I call attention in the bill to the provisions relating to the socalled Boys Market case. I mentioned this in the committee report in the additional views that I presented at that time. There have been one or two developments that ought to be mentioned again since that has occurred. The committee adopted the amendment that I offered which pertains to the authority of an employer to seek an injunction for breach of a nostrike clause which is contained in its collective bargaining agreement. It is. in essence. a legislation codification of the holding in The Boys Market. Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union. 398 U.S. 235 (1970) but somewhat broader to encompass. within Its scope. certain contractual \"final adjustment\" provisions which exist in the construction industry and which fall short of agreements empowering a neutral arbitrator to render a final and binding decision in this case. It is my view that the nostrike violation injunction is an important alternative in encouraging industrial peace in both the construction industry and in other industries. as well. Nostrike clauses provide alternatives to the acrimony and destruction involved in strikes. lockouts. and other selfhelp measures. Accordingly. it is appropriate that this provision be embodied in the National Labor Relations Act and thereby receive the express sanction of Congress. I would like to also mention with regard to this that there have been some recent developments in this connection. in connection with the Buffalo Forge case which is presently on its way up to the Supreme Court. and it raises some question as to what the scope of the Boys Market case might be and I think could raise a good deal of confusion in an area where I thought the case had pretty well settled the matter down.

First. under the present law. a construction union and a nonconstruction union. in terms of an employer signing a contract. are treated identically the same. with the exception of the 7day/ 30day union shop clauseand I will get to that in a moment. Today. an employer in the construction industry or the nonconstruction industry can sign a contract with a union. without any showing of union membership. If the employer wants to insist upon an election. he may. Most union contracts are signed today without any election. However. if 30 percent of the employees sign a card saying they want to join a certain union. the NLRB will hold an election. But let us not have any confusion in terms of the differences between the construction industry and the nonconstruction industry. In terms of signing a union shop contract. the law is the same. So far as the 7 days are concerned. that was a deliberate decisionand I think wisely arrived atthat said that in normal employment. when you go to work. you plan to work. hopefully. for years. But in the construction industry. working a week. 2 weeks. or 3 weeks. is quite common. It is not that you are not willing to work any longer. but a job lasts 2. 3. or 4 weeks and then you sign another contract. An exception was made in the construction industry. Where you have a union shop clause. you cannot ask that people join the union within 7 days of employment rather than 30 days. because if you had 30. most people in the industry would not be on the job that length of time. So far as the hiring hall is concerned. yes. contractors use them. they like them. If a contractor needs 20 bricklayers. he does not want to call a list of 200 bricklayers individually to find if they are available to work. He calls the hiring hall and says. \"Please send me 20 bricklayers for 2 weeks.\" and the hiring hall refers them. But the hiring hall cannot discriminate as to whom they refer. They cannot discriminate racially. They cannot discriminate against a nonunion member. If they do. it is an unfair labor practice.",

The NLRB is replete with cases upheld by the courts in which on occasion unions have tried to do that. and they have been guilty of unfair labor practices. Mr. President. the whole tenor of many of the amendments that have been offered today has been that. somehow. unions are venal or greedy or corrupt. In one of the previous amendments. when we were talking about the construction industry as related to the State and Federal Government. several times the word \"victimize\" was used. It was said that the taxpayers are going to be victimized by the unions. I think it is unfair to paint the building trade as greedy. malicious. unAmerican. unpatriotic. moneygrubbing cheats. They are not. In every barrel there are a few bad apples. but I hate to see the entire union movement painted this way. This amendment would tourn the clock back on the construction industry.

Yet. no one would suggest that if the employees of General Motors who. lets say. put wheel caps on cars. should become unhappy. they should have the right to strike a G.M. plant and shut it down. forcing all other employees out of work. As a matter of fact. Mr. President. that is exactly what the law is today and allows today. Let us use the General Motors example. All the General Motors employees are not necessarily organized by the United Auto Workers. In most industrial plants. as a matter of fact. you will find a variety of craft unions. often machinists. often electricians. They are often in a separate maintenance department. If the maintenance department of General Motors. if it is organized by the machinists or electricians. whoever. have a dispute with General Motors and go on strike. they are legally allowed to picket at the gate of General Motors today and try to induce all of the other United Automobile Worker union members to not cross the picket line.

That is a little different from the hubcap worker who is putting that on a hubcap.

Second. I want to address the issue of the socalled righttowork States. and the effect of S. 1479 on these States. I must say. that the moral justification for righttowork laws. confounds me in this context. If the justification for State righttowork laws is not to prevent unionization. but rather to protect against coercive unionization. S. 1479 literally does not have a direct or adverse effect on these State laws. Since S. 1479 is not in any way interfering with the righttowork States. it would be manifestly unfair and improper to impose the State right to work objective on the Nation by way of an amendment to the situs picketing bill. Similarly since S. 1479 leaves intact the State righttowork laws there is no need to amend this bill to accommodate arguably conflicting interiests.",

If this amendment is successful and this position is held in conference. then we will have saved more than $130 million in budget authority for fiscal year 1976 and the transition quarter. On the other hand. if Congress decides to approriate these moneys now. it is estimated we will be committed to expend for this socalled \"lowcost aircraft\" in excess of $2 billion over the next 5 years. I am also concerned that the debate has failed to address the most important point: What is the F18s mission and how does it fit our national policy? The issue seems to be who will build the aircraft. not why. The National Defense function ceilings for fiscal 1976. as reported in the Budget Committees second concurrent resolution. are tight.

The U.S. Navy has also felt the pinch and has been set back in its weapons procurement by the rising costs of acquisition and operation of new systems in recent years. Mr. President. our national security cannot be allowed to deteriorate in the face of spiraling inflation. The Navy has responded to DOD and congressional directives for cheaper weapons. and the new lightweight fighter. the F18. is a product of this economy effort. I think the Navy has done an outstanding job of selecting an urgently needed aircraft with limited funds. while maintaining superior performance for a fighter. In a letter to congressional committees. the Chief of Naval Operations. Adm. J. L. Holloway sums up the Navys cost problems and force requirements and illustrates how the F18 responds to both contingencies. I quote from that letter: The Navys most pressing tactical air problem today is assuring maintenance of an adequate fighter force level. We have begun the Job with the F14. The F14 is unequalled in its capability to perform the Navys fighter missions. but it is expensive to acquire and operate. and our buying power is shrinking. While we might now be able to afford the acquisition of enough F14s to fill the fighter force levels. we are faced with high followon operating and support costs. I believe the F18 is a clear demonstration of Navy dedication to making the most of our limited funds. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee. I am most impressed by the efforts of the Navy and the Department of Defense to operate within the budget parameters mandated by Congress. As the Senate has indicated this session. we are serious about the need to hold down Federal expenditures. I share Admiral Holloways view that the F18 is an important step toward assuring both economy and security in our Nations defense posture.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I can seldom recall a military issue before the Congress in which It was more difficult to make a decision than this question of whether or not we should enter into development of the F18 aircraft. However. there is no doubt in my mind that the entire lightweight fighter development issue and its planned introduction into the inventory was handled poorl. We intended to have one inexpensive plane to supplement both the F14 and F15. Now we find ourselves with two planes. neither of which are particularly inexpensive. Further. hundreds of millions of dollars will have to be spent to develop them as a part of the hilo mix and their cost will be relatively close to the planes they will complement. However. the Senate Armed Services Committee and later the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of funding the F18 development. Therefore. I have come to the conclusion that in this particular case. I am going to support these committees and the request of the Navy Department and the Marines. I do feel. however. the development of the socalled B engine for the F14 should be completed. This is a part of the pending amendment. My main feeling is that if the whole matter were renegotiated. the F18 would win again. simply because a prototype exists from which data is available and it would be difficult to compete against it with a proper proposal. Further. a delay would undoubtedly cost money if one accepts the point that a supplement to the F14 is needed. Frankly. I think the F14 is one of the greatest aircraft we have ever produced and I would hope the Navy would be allowed to purchase more of this fine aircraft than presently planned. Not only would it be well to have more than presently planned. a version of the F14 could be used later for the A6 role.",

I am pleased to join the Senator from California in offering an amendment which will force the Defense Department to utilize existing Army ammunition plants in the most costeffective manner. I have introduced an identical amendment. No. 1036. which would insert language in the appropriations bill to provide that funds could not be expended by the Army for \"the design. procurement of plant equipment. or construction of new ammunition plant facilities except in areas in which already existing ammunition plants are being closed. placed in layaway. or at which production has been curtailed.\" Pressure has been brought by the Army to enable it to locate an entirely new production base to manufacture a new ammunition item. the 155millimeterM483. improved conventional munition. at Bay St. Louis. Miss. This decision has been made despite the fact that within the last few months. the Defense Department announced closings and reductions at 15 defense installations and 32 commercial ammunition plants. The simple amendment Senator TUNNEY and I axe proposing would simply force the Army to make use of some of the existing facilities and 12.000 workers laid off in the past few weeks at these facilities. The House Committee on Appropriations and the full House have already recognized the need to utilize existing bases before constructing entirely new facilities. In fact. the appropriations bill passed by the House contained the identical language Senator TUNNEY and I are proposing be inserted in the bill. The amendment makes good sense. for unless the new 155 millimeter ammunition item is produced at an existing facility. more layoffs and plant closures might be expected. Highly skilled persons trained at one location would be unable to be utilized at the new location. Consequently. new personnel will have to be trained and a great deal of wasted time and money might be expended. Thus. I urge my colleagues to adopt this simple amendment which has already been agreed to by the House of Representatives. If the amendment is adopted. a more orderly program will result from upgrading existing plants or constructing new facilities near old facilities being phased out. rather than constructing new facilities where no experienced personnel are available.",

Mr. Schorr is not a Member of the House and was not bound by its vote. To insist that Mr. Schorr or any other correspondent should consider himself bound by such a vote or by a White House repression of a Government document would be to say that even a President alone or the House by a majority vote can decide what a free press may or may not publish. I oppose this whole resolution. I would urge my colleagues in the House that there is yet time for us not to commit this very serious invasion of the freedom of the press. We are put in a very interesting position. Many Members who voted against the release of the Pike report have now read this report and have stated that they do not believe that there is anything in this report that should not have been published by this House. I believe there have been resolutions to that effect. If I am not mistaken. the gentleman from Texas . who was one who originally opposed the report of the Select Committee on Intelligence. has now introduced a resolution providing for the printing of this report as a House document. Why are we continuing this witch hunt to determine how this report was leaked? This is a serious responsibility that we undertake. Four hundred witnesses have been subpenaed. We do not know where that will stop. Mr. Schorr will obviously not be the only writer who will be investigated. The New York Times. the Washington Post. NBC. ABC.

Secondly. Mr. Speaker. I do think that there is a serious question to be raised for freedom of the press. Regardless of commercial motivesand we all well know that the media makes a good deal of money from the reporting of the news and perhaps that is part and parcel of a free pressregardless of the motives Mr. Schorr may have had. the chilling effect that this investigation may have on future reporting of governmental activities is of very serious concern. Mr. Speaker. I rise at this time not only to voice my own opposition to this investigation. but to provide an opportunity to set forth for the Members of the House what this investigation is going to consist of. In that connection. Mr. Speaker. I will ask in a moment that the gentleman from New Jersey yield to the chairman of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. The reason I will make this request is that at the time the subpena power was voted for this committee. there was no floor debate about what the scope of the investigation was going to be.

We would certainly hope that it will not be necessary to execute the power of subpena which the House of Representatives voted to this committee by an overwhelming vote. It would be hoped that every present and former Member. officer. or employee of the House would cooperate fully. and we have every reason to believe that that would be the case.

This case is analogous to that of the Pentagon Papers. As the Members will recall. at that time it was the executive branch which prosecuted the New York Times.

Now. the administration concurs in this amendment and suggests that we provide that there be mining in the national forest. The administration testified that about 4 percent of the coal In America was in the national forest. Most of the coal in national forests is in the Custer County National Forest in eastern Montana. As the Senator from Idaho suggested the Custer National Forest is not a forest such as we have on the Pacific coast of redwoods or Douglasfir. or things of that sort. There is a lot of sagebrush. there is a lot of open land. there is a lot of land that was set aside. indistinguishable from other land or other prairie and grazing land. But. nevertheless. this is an agreement that we have all entered Into that there shall be no surface mining on the national forest. It will not interrupt any of the patterns of surface mining because there is not any surface mining on the national forest. nor have We been told that there will be any leasing in national forest land. The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture agreed in the testimony that they do not want to lease land for surface mining in the forest. Now. some suggestion has been made that this would set a precedent that would open up further prohibitions against mining in national forest lands. The present law. of course. is that in all the public domain anyone can go in and locate a claim for gold. silver. copper. and other locatable minerals in a national forest or on BLM land. This does not disturb that situation. nor does it disturb the idea that one can have it underground in the national forest. The only thing we have said is that there shall be no surface or strip mining of coal in any of the national forests. Mr. President.

His contention was that under that set of conditions he could anticipate having a ranch after the operation had been completed with the productive capability to do even better than it now does. plus the fact that he would have some income to do things that he presently cannot do. I say to my friend from Montana that what this language would still do. as I understand it. is to deny such a rancher as Mr. Brewster. if he were to fit the other conditions which would bring him under this section. the opportunity to say whether he desired to have it mined or whether he did not. if it has a substantial effect upon the pasture. the hay lands. or the croplands.

It is not my intention to interfere with or prejudice. in any way. the substance of the waiver requests filed by the Star. I believe it essential. however. that a timely decision be reached in this matter. Certainly in this. the Nations Capital. one can expect a high degree of journalistic enterprise. Competition is an essential element in the gathering and reporting of local and national news. For many long years. the Washington Star has been an aggressive and important factor in reporting the events of the times to the public. Now the paper has fallen on hard times. It is in financial difficulties and the ownership of the newspaper is currently being negotiated. The newspapers publisher has applied for ownership. but says that the papers broadcasting properties are essential to a successful transition. I do not advocate this position. I merely present it. The newspaper has filed petitions with the FCC for waivers of the regulations prohibitIng multiple ownership of broadcasting and newspaper properties. The matter is further complicated by the fact that this is the first case to be considered under newly promulgated rulings by the FCC. As I have stated. it is not my intention to prejudice or interfere in the substance of this matter. It is my intention. however. to the Federal Communications Commission my objections to anything other than expeditious resolution of this matter. Certainly the Star management or those seeking to purchase. needs to know how to go about the business of financial planning. A delay of the magnitude indicated by the FCC could virtually destroy the newspaper. One of Washingtons two major daily newspapers is in financial trouble. It would be totally unconscionable if the newspaper were forced to stop its presses because an agency of the Federal Government could not make a decision on the matter in a timely manner.

The suggestion that the tax cut be extended is a step in the right direction that we welcome. although the congressional Joint Economic Committee has already recommended a tax reduction and the House Ways and Means Committee has been working for some time on a proposal to give a bigger break to middle- and lowerincome earners. We will pass this legislation well before the end of the year. The Joint Economic Committee recommends more stimulus to turn the economic rebound into recovery. It recognizes. as neither Mr. Ford nor Herbert Hoover before him recognized. that arbitrary budget cuts never put a single unemployed man or woman back to work. Nor will they produce a single additional barrel of oil or bushel of wheat. and scarcities in food and fuel coupled with high interest rates are the real bogeymen in producing the inflation the President decries. Congress will look carefully at the Presidents proposed spending cuts. As we have before. we will trim waste and fat and frills.

I am today introducing a resolution expressing the congratulations and deep appreciation of the House of Representatives to Carnegie Hall for its 85 years of cultural enrichment and artistic achievement. Carnegie Hall has long been our Nations most prestigious showcase for the performing arts. It has presented leading performers in every field. In addition to great musical programs. it has brought hundreds of lectures. rallies. dance programs. religious services and art exhibits to our people. But even more importantly. it has brought untold joy and greater artistic understanding to countless Americans. It was at Carnegie Hall that Yehudi Menuhin performed at age 11. It was there that \"An American in Paris\" had its world premiere and it was there that in 1912 many white Americans got their first taste of a new musical phenomena called jazz. On its stage we have seen the worlds greatest symphonies and its finest Dixieland bands. We have heard poets from Yeats to Ogden Nash. We have listened to singers from Maria Callas to Billie Holliday and we have watched performances from Paderewski to the Beatles. This varied repetoire is more than just evidence that Carnegie Hall is a great cultural center. it is a mirror of the cultural history of our times and the artistic achievement of our Nation. Inasmuch as it is celebrating its 85th anniversary on May 18. I can think of no more fitting time for the House to honor Carnegie Hall and to express our deepest appreciation for its amazing history of cultural enrichment.",

It has come to my attention that the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union and the Kansas City retail food stores recently reached an agreement on a 2year contract which specifically prohibits the distribution and sale of boxed beef in the Kansas City area. A spokesman for the retail stores. who asked not to be named. said the stores wanted boxed beef because it would lower their labor costs. and thus their cost of food to the consumer. The union. of course. opposed this economy move. The spokesman said the union \"would have let us have boxed beef. but it would have cost a lot.\" One figure that was mentioned early in the wage negotiations was 50 cents more an hour. It is just this sort of union pressure preventing the sale of boxed beef in cities throughout the country that I have asked the General Accounting Office to investigate. And I have urged the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its study of the boxed beef situation. I believe it is unfair to American taxpayers that one segment of our society can wield so much clout that it can prevent what may be beneficial to the majority of Americans. in this case. the sale of boxed beef.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. it is unfortunate that so many cattle producers have been devastated by packer failures without any sort of security against the losses they have suffered. H.R. 8410. a bill which requires packinghouses to post a reasonable bond for the stock delivered to them by producers. is long overdue. There are four major aspects of H.R. 8410 which are crucial if the producer is to continue providing Americans with highquality beef. First. H.R. 8410 would require that packinghouses promptly pay the producer for his stock. Second. the bill provides that a reasonable bond be posted by the packer in case of fiscal insolvency. Discussions pursued by the Agriculture Committee with the Department of Agriculture indicate that the Department will provide a bonding formula not weaker than the formulas currently used by States which have their own bonding laws. In particular. I have urged fellow members of the committee. and officials in the Agriculture Department. to study carefully the Iowa bonding law in this regard. The Iowa law demands a bond equivalent to a 2day kill. There is no reason why producers should be offered anything less. Third. and perhaps of greatest importance. H.R. 8410 provides that a producers cattle will be held in trust for the producer by the packer until such cattle are paid for. This provision guarantees the producer that he need not fear the loss of his stock to a lender or other party to which the packer is in debt should the packer become insolvent. Finally. H.R. 8410 will assure coverage in all States where beef is slaughtered. While those States which have laws in the bonding area are to be commended for their actions with respect to bonding. many States still lack such laws. In addition. that each State has its own set of rules creates a hodgepodge which becomes unfathomable when attempts are made to apply bonding laws to interstate commerce. H.R. 8410 will both eliminate this hodgepodge and assure producers that they can have confidence that their sales to packinghouses will be secure.",

I believe that H.R. 8410 Is a responsible legislative effort to provide American cattle producers with adequate protection in their dealings with meatpackers. Although the laws of the State of Oklahoma are more stringent than this bill in at least one area. the provisions of H.R. 8410 will provide better. more comprehensive protection against unscrupulous and unsound business practices. Mr. Chairman. those of us who live in cattleproducing areas remember well the disastrous effects in our States when just one large meatpacker went bankrupt--leaving hundreds of ranchers holding over a million dollars in bad checks. Such unfortunate incidents need to be prevented. for the sake of both producers and consumers. even though the bill under consideration today will somewhat weaken several existing State statutes when enacted. the total legislation. with all of its provisions. will provide our Nations ranchers with the kind of protection they urgently need.

In those 4 years. there have been indictments. there has been emotionbut there has been no justice. On December 29. 1975. the results of a study requested by Gov. Hugh Carey of the events surrounding the uprising was issued to the public. That study. headed by Bernard Meyer. a former justice of the- New York State Supreme Court. brought to light much information that those of us who were present at Attica knew to be true. It was reassuring to have before us objective proof that evidence and the gathering of that evidence had been distorted. that the preponderance of indictments against prisoners rather than law enforcement officers was the result of deliberate skewing on the part of law enforcement agencies. and that NELSON ROCKEFELLER. then tha Governor. had himself been a party to prejudicing the fair resolution of the case. But Mr. Meyer concludes his report with the suggestion that a special prosecutor be appointed to reexamine the evidence and decide whether new indictments should be brought. But we learn from Mr. Meyers own words that the possibility of any fair reappraisal of the evidence has been damaged beyond repair: Rockefellers remarks immediately after the retaking in praise of State Police... were inappropriate in view of the possibility that the degree of force used by enforcement personnel may have been excessive... The decision to conduct the investigation sequentially or chronologically was a serious error of judgment. Investigation in depth of the later occurring events was thus deferred. which skewed the investigations inadequate manpower away from ... prosecution of crimes by law enforcement personnel. The onesideness (in indictments) was partly the result of the decision to investigate chronologically ... thereby saturating the jury with evidence of inmates guilt before any law enforcement case was presented. partly the result of partiality and emotion of the part of the jurors in considering charges against law enforcement personnel who were their friends or neighbors. partly the result of the fact that indictments for \"technical offenses were asked for against inmates but not against law enforcement personnel. and partly the result of errors ...",

Brother Rice High School became the city of Chicago football champions by defeating Chicago Vocational School 26 to 0. After a victory 2 weeks earlier over Mount Carmel High School to win the Catholic League Championship. the Brother Rice Crusaders were determined to bring the school its first city football title in its 20year history. Credit for this accomplishment goes to the entire squad. who truly provided a team effort in the win. For this they deserve to be congratulated. but even more important than the accomplishment is the fact that their successful season was the result of a joint effort by the team members and their coaches. parents and fans. Too often in todays society we hear only of the young people who make bad news. It is refreshing to learn of the commendable dedication and teamwork put forth by the young men of Brother Rice High School. I would like to extend to them my personal congratulations and best wishes for continued success.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. \"The Social Scurity Trust Fund is headed for trouble.\" This is the observation President Ford made in his state of the Union address. Monday night. while calling for a threetenths of 1 percent increase in employee and employer social security taxes to be paid into the trust fund. The President did this in order to insure the credibility of the trust fund in the coming years and to make sure that the fund \"takes in as much as it pays out\" and guarantees \"security for our old and young.\" While we must respect the Presidents reasoning and desire to maintain the integrity of the trust fund. we must also recognize that sooner or later the Congress must approach the problem of caring for our elderly and needy in a fundamentally different way. A recent editorial by William Rusher which appeared on December 23 in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune identifies many of the problems that currently beset the social security system in our country. Among many things. he points out. first. that at the present rate of depletion. social security \"benefits\" will be exhausted by the year 1980. second. that the unfunded deficitobligations that will fall due in coming yearsof the social security system now runs at about 2./ trillion dollars. third. and that practically speaking. there is no way in the world that such an enormous deficit and obligation will ever be paid by future withholdings or through general tax revenues. Mr. Rusher goes on to suggest that the answer to these ominous warnings is to provide the workers in the Nations labor force the option of Investing their social security withholding payments. together with their employers matching payments. in a private sector insurance program which would offer both higher interest and greater freedom regarding the use of the payments. Mr. Speaker. it is my feeling that it Is time that we reconsidered our present system of providing for the elderly in our country and carefully weigh the value of continuing to erode the credibility of the social security system by burying It In an astronomical debt which will never be repayed. It is time we turned to the Private sector for the answers to these problems. where real \"social security\" can be found.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. the Federal Energy Administration authorization bill. as reported out of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. was a rarity among energy bills in that it received bipartisan support in that subcommittee. The bill balanced the budgetary needs of PEA and its expanded programs established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. EPCA. with the need to keep Federal spending at a minimum to avoid inflationary impact and further deficit spending. However. two amendments passed by the full committee have added a total of $40 million to the fiscal year 1977 budget and force me to oppose this legislation as it now stands. The first amendment added by the committee authorizes $2.9 million to be used to encourage the use of solar energy in commercial and other applications. This would require the establishment of an entire new program authority for such purposes in FEA. Such program authority aleady exists in the Energy Research and Development Administration. There was no testimony during the hearings on this legislation that demonstrated the need for or cost justification of such an additional program in FEA. In fact. this money would mean unnecessary duplication of funds already being spent by ERDA in its solar energy program. Section 8 of the Solar Energy Research. Development and Demonstration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93473) specifically requires the ERDA Administrator to set up a solar energy information data bank to provide for the processing and dissemination of solar energy technology information to the public. Further. this amendment is an intrusion on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology. to which the rules of the House grant jurisdiction over all energy research and development except nuclear research and development. In H.R. 13350. the ERDA authorization bill that just passed the House last week. the House has approved $345 million for fiscal year 1977 for the solar energy program. with $116 million of that added in a floor amendment. The sum of $80.6 million of the total amount is earmarked for solar heating and cooling demonstration projects which are the most developed of the solar technologies and the closest to commercial application.",

But. simply because this agency has been placed in the role of a policeman is no reason to take away its authority. Now more than ever it is necessary that we retain a strong central direction to address the energy issues which confront this country. We are told by experts that our energy problems are becoming more acutethat our dependence upon energy sources from foreign countries is greater now than it has ever been. This is no time to dismantle the agency established to deal with this problem and to scatter those responsibilities among a group of illcoordinated. disorganized agencies elsewhere in the Federal Government. It may be desirable to reorganize the Federal energy structure. but none of the proposals under serious consideration in either body of the Congress at this time accomplish such a reorganization.

The second area is the growth of the FEA in numbers and pay scales. which. quite evident. have been built up in this socalled temporary agency. I agree with the initial legislation that in a period of crisis in developing a temporary agency it would be difficult to pull together qualified people without offering higher than average pay scales. however. I think we should look at where we find the FEA at the present time. Presently. the number of ES personnel in the FEA is extremely high. They have a total of 19. We can compare that to a much larger agency. such as the Veterans Administration. which has seven. Thecomparable number of employees for the FEA is 3.200. however. the Veterans Administration. with only a 7 ES schedule level has 123.000 employees. The average pay for FEA is higher. the ES schedule is higher than for any other agency. Some Cabinet levels have less numbers of ES personnel. For instance. the Department of Agriculture has 18. HEW has 23. HUD has 20. The Interior Department has 18. The Department of Labor has 16. The Treasury Department has 21. FEA presently has 19. Mr. Chairman. during the amendment process I have a series of amendments which will attempt. No. 1. to limit the extension of FEA to no longer than 15 months. the end of fiscal year 1977. One amendment will require a report from the president through OMB to the Congress. indicating in what manner the responsibilities will be transferred to other Departments. Mr. Chairman. I have a backup amendment to that which would simply limit the authorization of this bill to the end of fiscal 1977. Then there are two amendments which I would attempt to get at the problem that I see in pay scales for FEA. which appear to be out of line with other agencies and departments in comparison to the responsibilities and degree of scientific or technological skill that the agency needs in accomplishing its responsibilities.",

This explains the vigorous efforts we made to defeat the rule an hour ago. I think we now must address the House and address our own consciences as to the basic question. The basic question is: Has the Federal Energy Administration so conducted itself as a regulatory agency that it ought to be continued. and If continued. for how long? The FEA does not merit a single hour of continued life. One of the strongest oppositions I have to the committee bill is that it locks us into the continuation of the Federal Energy Administration for some 39 months. One does not have to be a great student of government to understand that once an agency is given a lengthy life span and a healthy budget. this House has precious little control over its actions. It is those actions to which many of us object on all sorts of grounds. So. Mr. Chairman. I would hope that the committee will not contest the making germane of a substitute which will give those of us who find ourselves in an impossible situation. that is. either voting to continue the Federal Energy Administration for 39 months despite the fact that it has done nothing to merit that kind of stamp of approval. or vote to kill the Federal Energy Administration without taking any responsible actions as to where to put its functions.

Two hundred years ago our Nation was in the planning stages of a great revolution against the British Crown. We were only 13 small Colonies then. but we felt our political rights were being infringed upon by a tyrannical mother government. We risked honor. property. and mens lives in order to secure our basic human rights. A little more than 100 years ago we again found it necessary to go to war. But this war was no different. This war. a civil war. was also one of high ideals. The ideal of human freedom was at stake. Americans acted and slavery in this country was abolished. Half a century after this internal war. Americans saw that it was necessary to fight again. The preservation of democracy and the principles of human rights were again at stake when Americans were sent to fight in the First World War. Only 34 years ago. 1941. we. as a nation. found it necessary to fight once again. In this war. more than in any other. the horrors of racism. dictatorship. and. above all. genocide were paraded before all other nations. In a total effort. America lashed out against these ugly atrocities. The American tradition of support for the ideals of peace. freedom. and human rights has to be continued. The Senate must hesitate no longer. We have the opportunity to help other peoples achieve the same human rights we cherish. We must give serious attention to the Genocide Convention and vote in favor of its ratification.",

Several noted authorities spelled out their proposals to achieve this goal at the recent Institute of Gerontology Conference conducted jointly by the University of Michigan and Wayne State University.

I was particularly interested in the remarks on \"Next Steps in Medicare\" by Arthur Hess. who retired as Deputy Commissioner of Social Security after a distinguished career. Mr. Hess focused on two primary areas for strengthening medicare: Programmatic changes which are consistent with the movement toward national health insurance. and Administrative improvements to simplify reimbursement procedures. control the quality and cost of medical care. and prevent provider abuse and fraud.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I know that my colleagues in the Senate are aware of growing discontent with mail service in this country as expressed by private citizens. particularly those in rural areas. Alarmed by rising postage costs. delays in mail delivery. the closing of small rural post offices. and other periodic irritants. our constituents- are reg.istering dissatisfaction with postal policies at an almost unprecedented level. The current attention within both houses of Congress to legislative remedies for postal problems reflects a growing feeling. I think. that Congress has a responsibility to the people of this country to help resolve some of the: problems that postal service officials have. been unable. or unwilling to resolve themselves. Not too long ago. I introduced the Private Individuals Postal Rate Relief Act of 1975S. 2426designed to insure that postage rates for individual citizens do not rise above the current 10 cents level. Since then. the bill has received bipartisan support from cosponsors representing the geographic span of this Nation. and letters in support of the legislation have come to my office from more than 20 States. This interest. I believe. reflects wellfounded concern among a majority of private. citizens about the neverending increase in rates for firstclass postage stamps. Citizens are suggesting a number of methods by which Congress- might contribute to the efficiency and the economy of mail service operations. Some believe that Congress should resume full control over postal management and policies-. while others believe. that elimination of a Government \"monopoly\" over postal service through repeal of the private express statutes would introduce a healthy system of competition for prices and service. But by far the most interesting. and thoughtprovoking recommendation I have yet received arrived last week from Stockton. Kans. Fifty residents of this small rural community in the northwestern section of my home State addressed a petition to Congressman KEITH SEBLius and myself in. support of \"reestablishing the pony express.\" as a means of improving our nationwide postal system. I believe that the sincerity of the suggestion. and the underlying feeling of frustration that motivated it. deserve the attention of all. Members of the U.S. Senate. We would. do well to heed the message as we study proposals to improve the mail service in the months ahead. Mr. President.

Title XX of the Social Security Act requires that beginning this month. the Federal interagency day care requirements must finally be enforced. Yet. it is increasingly clear that many existing programs are simply not in compliance. and are faced with the prospect of having their Federal funds terminated. In response to this difficulty. some have proposed that we simply delay indefinitely the enforcement of these standards. or lower the standards so that compliance will be easier. These proposals may resolve the fund termination problem. but they provide little or no protection for the children in these day care centers. What we need instead. and what is proposed in S. 2425 which Senator LONG and I introduced last week. is a plan which will make it possible for programs to come into compliance. Toward that end. S. 2425 provides a temporary delay in enforcement coupled with the additional funds necessary to permit child care programs to hire the additional staff and make the other improvements necessary to come into compliance over the short term.

The wages of the crewmen and seamen on the flag vessels of other comtries are about onefourth those of the wages of seamen serving on U.S.-flag vessels.

In that time the cost of living has increased by about 110 percent. military retired pay has increased by 113 percent. and even congressional pay has been increased. These schools are without doubt our best major source of qualified officers and engineers for our merchant marine as well as our ports and other marine facilities. It is important. therefore. that we maintain a high caliber of student and graduate at the academies. The Committee on Maritime Education. in its report. recommended strongly that an increase in the subsistence allowance is necessary to attract and retain quality people. Its study is an attempt to evaluate our maritime needs. and the recommendations made were not lightly arrived at. To allow the quality of students at our State maritime academies to deteriorate is. obviously. wasteful of our entire maritime education system. The object of this amendment is not to expand the State academies. We are talking about the same student load of 2.300 that we have maintained over the last several years. The cost involved is quite small-$1.1 million annually. If we are serious about upgrading and enlarging our merchant marine fleet we are going to have to make much larger expenditures than this. but few such investments offer the return in quality people that this investment will.

I am asking for $1.1 million. We are not talking about a great increase in this program at all. Actually. we are talking about a slight reduction in money-$1.1 million this year. $1.3 million last year. which is no longer in the appropriation. Furthermore. I live in Maine. This academy is not in my district. but I have a great many friends who have gone to the Maine Maritime Academy and who have in fact gone for marine concern. Many of these students cannot avail themselves of more expensive education. They do not have the thousands of dollars it costs to go into medicine or law. Many of them in the State of Maine need this education because it gives them the opportunity to climb up the economic ladder.",

I do believe these academies serve a very important purpose at a time in our history when the whole maritime situation is more and more critical. more critical than we have ever known.

I happen to think that we ought to expedite the mining of coal in this country. 90 percent of which can only be reached by underground mining. But I also think we need to make sure that mining does not destroy other important assets of this country. That is my basic position. If the gentleman from West Virginia had offered an amendment to extend the moratorium until we had a strip mining bill in effect. then I might be more enthusiastic about the amendment. But I do not think that amendment would have a chance of passing this House. Mr. Chairman. what are we faced with here? There are actually three major coal mining bills that are working their way through the Congress at various stages. One is this bill. And this bill will give a firm basis for the Secretary to end the moratorium on the mining of coal on Federal land that he has imposed. Mr. Chairman. there is also a strip mining bill. the same one we voted on twice the last sessionthree times. actually. if we count the veto override voteand each time there was a large majority in favor of the bill. That bill is again on the agenda of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. There is another bill pending in the committee and that is to authorize coal slurry pipelines for movement of coal mined in the west and other coal mining regions. I do not feel we should stop working on the bill before us until we have completely worked through the other coal legislation. But I will say this: When this bill gets through conference and before we vote on the bonference report. if we have not yet gotten a strip mining bill enacted. or assurances that it will be accepted by the executive branch. then we had better take another look at it and the House leadership had better decide whether to hold off on final passage of the conference report until we get the strip mining bill enacted.

I am concerned about this particular amendment because it would appear to me that if the amendment Were to carry and if there were no strip mining bill. the Secretary of the Interior under his existing authority. could simply go ahead and develop leases and make leases with coal companies operating on Federal properties in the West. If we do not have passage of the strip mining bill. we in effect will not have any implementation of this legislation as regards the leasing of Federal coal in the West and we would be right back where we are today. I do believe there are some very valuable features in the legislation we have before us on the floor today. If there were not. we have no business bringing this bill before the committee here this afternoon. As a result. while I support strip mining legislation and tough strip mining legislation. I certainly do not want to say that strip mining alone should have priority over this particular bill. This bill has value. and it should be passed on its own merits. But the amendment would provide that until there is a strip mining bill passed by this Congress and signed by the President. the Secretary could go ahead on his own authority and develop coal leases on Federal property in the West in any way. shape or fashion he likes. Just a few moments ago we had a lengthy discussion as to whether coal leases should be developed in 15 years or 10 years. I lost on that point. and the gentleman made his point that they should be developed in 10 years. Now we are going back and saying that is not important at all unless we get a strip mining bill before this Congress and get it passed and signed. and that this type of legislation has no place by itself in western coal leasing. It seems to me the legislation we have before us today has a place. and it should be passed on its own merits apart from strip mining legislation.",

Mr. Chairman. and in a more serious vein. if anyone would note. in the bill as a whole there are four areas dealing with public hearings. The public hearings involve a public hearing on the landuse plan. on the lease sale. on the logical mining unit if and when it is developed. and on the fair market value of the coal. Mr. Chairman. the Department of the Interior very strongly agrees with this amendment and has very vociferously opposed or stated its opposition to the language of the legislation as we have it before us. It seems to me that there are methods we can utilize to make the hearing procedure more simple and less cumbersome for those companies or organizations that would like to mine the coal resources in the West. The amendment that I have offered would provide for a hearing on the landuse plan. a first hearing. It would also provide for a second hearing on the lease itself. and at the time of the public hearing on the lease if there are any comments concerning the market value of the coal. they could be made at any time. In any event. I would reduce the number of public hearings or periods for public comment from a total of p9ssibly four down to two. I believe that if e have a hearing on the landuse plan and a hearing on the lease itself. at which time comments can be made concerning the market value of the coal. we have done the job as far as public hearings are concerned. We would not in any way. in my opinion. weaken the bill. I believe. however. that we would simplify the procedure elements and the procedures undertaken by any company in developing a coal lease.

It seems to me that the provisions of the bill. as we now have it. calling for public hearings in those three instances. are very reasonable and that they should be supported by this committee. In the preparation of the landuse plans. it seems to me wholly consistent that we involve the States and the public at large or local officials and people who will be adversely affected as well. Our bill makes these provisions. I believe also. at the moment when a lease is tobe actually sold. the Secretary should also be required to call a pubic hearing. It seems to me with respect tothe logical mining units. where we are providing an enormous exemption to the requirements of due diligence and continuous operation by permitting these old leases to be consolidated and treated as one. that certainly the public ought to be heard. they ought to be apprised of exactly which leases are being consolidated and thereby being given this extraordinary exemption.",

So. we do not set a limitation. they make the unit. they decide to lease to the unit and it must be a unit that they have determined is an economic unit that should be developed. But in this section we are dealing with the consolidation of existing leases for the purpose of providing an exemption and therefore the public interest is of paramount importance and before such consolidations are permitted the bill provides that it may take place only after a public hearing. as provided in line 10 on page 26.

When you have to pay $125 to $150 to stay in a soso hotel in London or Paris. I think it would behoove any businessman who wanted to save money to get back here as soon as possible. I once made the mistake of trying to work the same day I landed in one of those cities. and I will never do it again. If I can make it in 21/2 or 3 hours. I will get the job done and get back home and save Uncle Sam some money. The Senator is concerned about the socalled group of people we would be using to discriminate against the rest of the Americans.

In a recent statement accompanying the release of the 1974 annual report by IDB President Antonio Ortiz Mena. the accomplishments of the past year were summarized. I believe it is worth noting that. in the past year. a dozen countries from outside the hemisphere have pledged to seek membership in the Bank and to contribute over a 3year period $745 million. In addition. Venezuela has announced its intention to establish a trust fund of $500 million to be administered by the Bank. Both developments reflect a growing maturity of this institution as an effective promotor of development. They also reflect a broadening of the financial support for the institution with a lessening of its reliance on the United States. All of these developments are positive steps in the Banks growth. However. the United States still has a major continuing responsibility to provide support for the Bank.

Indeed. the United States is the only advanced nation in the world that has not developed any explicit national growth and development policies to date which incorporate population distribution or dispersal. Apparently. no advanced nation but the United States today thinks this subject is so unimportant that it can be entrusted to the market. and whatever the outcome. as being acceptable.

His negotiations with growers. United Farm Workers. Teamsters. the AFLCIO. and other interested groups were finally successful in producing this unique piece of legislation. It. unlike other measures introduced in the past. is particularly sensitive to the differences between farm labor and other industries. differences which require a detailed set of protections to insure that elections would actually permit the workers to decide whether they wanted a union and which union they wanted.

If our Government continues to pile controls and taxes on private enterprise. we will stifle our Industries and unemployment will grow.

(The bank) did not propose to compete with existing banks but to cooperate with them and assist in developing and coordinating the financial services of the State to meet the needs of the people. I would recommend to my colleagues an article which recently appeared in the Sunday New York Times. April 13. 1975. section 3. page 4. which deals in a very thorough way with the bank. The article entitled. \"The Only Bank of Its Kind.\" was written by Mr. Philip Matthews of the Fargo Forum. Mr. Matthews. as usual. has presented the essentials of the story in the concise yet fluid form to which his many readers have become accustomed. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Matthews article be printed In the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Committee on Appropriations has taken a very commendable action in the report on the interior appropriations bill with respect to the national wildlife refuge system. a system which directly affects 49 out of the 50 States. The committee report says that the Interior Department intended to oust the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from three western wildlife ranges. and to place these ranges in the sole charge of the Bureau of Land Management. although the impact of this change upon the national wildlife refuge system was not properly considered. The report directs the Interior Department not to transfer these ranges to BLM unless and until authority for such transfer is provided by appropriate legislation. I applaud this constructive action by the Appropriations Committee. and I observe that the House will soon be considering H.R. 5512. which is now pending on the calendar. a bill that requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to administer all units of the national wildlife refuge system. The three wildlife ranges in question are of nationwide significancethe Kofa Game Range in Arizona. Charles Sheldon Antelope Range in Nevada and Oregon. and Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Range in Montana. And the precedent that would be set by allowing any of these to be turned over to BLM would be a blow to the integrity of the entire refuge system. The Bureau of Land Management. after all. is not primarily a wildlife agency. It is not even primarily a land management agency. despite its name. Its predominant functions are in energy development. Under the fiscal 1976 budget. 59 percent of BLMs program is in the energy field. In view of this conflicting mission. BLM clearly is not an appropriate agency to handle national wildlife refuges and ranges. In New York State we guard jealously the nine refuges which we have in the national wildlife refuge system. Like these refuges. the big Kofa. Charles Sheldon. and C. M. Russell wildlife ranges are national wildlife preserves. deserving permanent protection and management by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. H.R. 5512 would extend a uniform policy to all units of the national wildlife refuge system. protecting them against raids by BLM or any other agency.

The impression is given that we have become even more dependent on Arab oil since the lifting of the 1973 embargo and that this trend must be reversed. In this connection. I think all Members of the House will wish to read an article from the July 14 edition of the Wall Street Journal by Mr. Uzi Arad. an Israeli scholar. which makes the case that. contrary to the impression created by PEA spokesmen. the United States is importing substantially less oil from the Arab countries than it was prior to the Arab oil embargo and that the threat implied by another oil embargo is less serious today than it was in 1973. In fact. the article indicates that the United States is largely invulnerable to direct Arab oil supply curtailment and that proper oil supply and distribution policies could eliminate U.S. supply vulnerability altogether as far as the Arab States are concerned.

D.C.. Maryland. and Alabama. It is difficult for me to imagine anyone with more interests and enthusiasms than Tom McGregor. His entire history is one of diversity. Those who knew him invariably remarked on his candor. his dynamism. and his uncanny ability to communicate with others. These traits and many others contributed to his great personal and business success. Tom McGregor arrived in Washington from his native Alabama at the height of the depression in the 1930s. He was a personal friend of the two Representatives from his home district in Alabama and worked closely with both of them. the late Henry B. Steagall and the late George Andrews. He became an unofficial representative in Washington. who worked quietly to assist his many friends in Alabama. His business enterprises prospered. but he never forgot his friends and his home area. In Washington. Tom McGregor rose rapidly from being a Government messenger to owner of his own printing company. McGregor Printing Corp. in Washington. He also had other business interests in this area as well as in New Jersey. He continued to work closely with the State of Alabama serving as president of the Alabama State Society which coordinated State activities here in Washington in official functions such as the Cherry Blossom Festival. Tom McGregor was the kind of person who will be long remembered for his achievements and his warm personality.

There was obviously a conflict between his responsibilities to warn the nation of the potential effects of the Turkish opium poppy resumption and the State Departments position that Turkey should not be pressured to maintain the opium ban because of our ongoing sensitive negotiations with Turkey over Cyprus. It is clear that the State Department has tried to avoid offending Turkey for the sake of preserving the NATO alliance.

His willingness to make the trip back to Philadelphia each day. often after a long night session. showed to me that BILL BARRETT was truly interested in the views of the people of Philadelphia and assisting them with whatever problems they might have had with the Federal Government. This act of dedication on the part of BILL is representative government in its truest sense. I will deeply miss the sage advice and wise counsel of BILL BARRETT. but feel that I have benefited greatly from having him as a colleague of mine for the 10 years I have served in the House. I extend my deepest sympathy to members of the Barrett family.",

BILL BARRETT was an outstanding public servant with whom it was a pleasure to be associated and I am proud that he was my friend. As chairman of the powerful Housing Subcommittee of the House Banking. Currency and Housing Committee. BILL BARRETT showed no favoritism. He was always available to assist all Members of the House in solving their constituents problems. No problem was too small to bring to BILL BARRETT if it involved a single constituent trying to secure FHA insurance for a singlefamily dwelling. or if it involved flood insurance. or a section 202 housing project for the elderly. Mr. BARRETT was always available and did his best to assist us. Members of Congress are supposed to be ombudsmen for their constituents. We are supposed to. and it is in large part why we are hereto take care of our constituents problems. If the mark of a successful legislator is one of helping his constituents solve problems. then truly this House has never witnessed a more successful legislator than BILL BARRETT. I join my colleagues today in honoring him and I know his family takes much comfort in the knowledge that he enjoyed a full and rewarding life and in the fact that his many accomplishments and successes will long be remembered.",

In that bill. and in a host of susequent legislation. BILL BARRETT used to full advantage his position as chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development. He was highly respected as a figure of importance in the area of Banking and Currency. and had served for 26 years on the committee having oversight in that field.

I never heard him swear or yell or threaten anyone. He could be direct and tell people exactly what he thought. but he never insulted or humiliated them. He always left room for agreement and compromise. BILL was a peacemaker. a conciliator. a man who always sought to bring opposing sides together. He recognized that it was better to talk to someone and try to work out a solution to a problem which involved all sides instead of getting angry and leaving the problem unsolved. Finally.

Considering the fact that the Senate version of the bill would have lost $300 million in fiscal 1977. this accomplishment clearly represents a substantial victory. The conference agreement also represents a substantial victory for the congressional budget process. In the spring. Congress adopted a budget resolution which sought to raise $2 billion in tax reform. Last week the House agreed to assume a savings of $1.6 billion.

Marina Epshtein. 19 years old. Their address--Leningrad. Maikov Skogo 10- Flat 10. On April 24. 1974 they filed applications for exit visas to Israel. After 7 months of waiting. they were refused visas. In addition they were told that they would not even be considered for visas before 1979. These decisions had been based on false statements by persons from Yakov Epshteins former place of work. an office in which he stopped working on September 12. 1973. This outrageous time span is in direct defiance of both the spirit and the words of the Helsinki agreement. We beg you to appeal to the leaders of the Soviet government. L. I. Breznev. A. N.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to add my word for this amendment. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the issue as to the Federal Energy Administrations authority to develop. as part of their entitlements program. aid to construction of muchneeded grass roots refineries. Desirable spinoffs would be the boost to small. independent businessmen and increased employment prospects. Many of the barriers to construction of a grassroots refinery are the result of the already existing regulations which govern activity in this area. It is fitting that this aid to new refinery construction be a coordinated part of FEAs entitlements program. While such a refinerconstructor program would be somewhat of an expansion of the entitlements program. it is not inconsistent with other expansions. such as the small refiner bias. It is not necessary that this program result in the opening of a Pandoras box. On the contrary. it is urged that FEA develop criteria for potential refinerconstructors which would insure a certain degree of feasibility of the proposed project. as well as accounting for the fact that profits realized from the program are being poured into the construction project. Such criteria have. in fact. been developed in conjunction with the FEA General Counsels office. Over the past 18 months or so I have followed closely efforts to build a refinery in Macon County. Ala.. as referred to by my colleague from Alabama. Thus I am aware of many of the problems which must be faced by refinery constructors. I am also aware of the potential impact such refinery construction can have on our efforts at selfsufficiency in the energy field and on an economically depressed area. I feel certain that the amendment will serve these needs. Let me say with reference to the proposed refinery at Tuskegee. Ala.. or in that neighborhood. it was not a matter of shortage of financing ability. As a matter of fact. the financing was ample and many times more than ample. But it was just simply the rigidity of a plan that does not fit in with the Idea. as I see it. of doing what the President has recommended in building a number of smaller refineries throughout the country. I think this is a good amendment. I am glad to be a cosponsor of it. and I hope that it will be adopted.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I join today with my colleagues. Senators ALLEN. SPAxaamA. and BucKLEY to introduce an amendment to S. 2872. the Federal Energy Administration Extension Act. which will establish within the present entitlements program a new category to be known as refiner constructors. The entitlements program. authorized by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act. was designed to eliminate the cost disparities created by the twotier price control system for crude oil. Two years later. however. the Congress discovered that in its operation. the entitlements program had resulted in the anomaly of the Nations small refiners buying $25.000.000 of entitlements per month. The Congress. therefore. created the small refiner bias to alleviate this problem. More recently. the Congress approved the PEA proposal to increase the small refiner bias somewhat while terminating the exemption of small refiners from any obligation to buy entitlements. Once again. the entitlements program needs to be amended to address yet another problem caused by the twotier pricing system: the inability of a new grassroots refinery to enter the market equitably. Our amendment authorizes the PEA Administrator. for the purpose of fostering the construction of new refineries by small or independent refiners in the United States. to promulgate regulations establishing within the entitlements program. eligibility criteria for a category of persons eligible to receive entitlements to be known as refiner constructors. As ranking minority member of the Small Business Committee. I have for several years been aware of the Wallace & Wallace Chemical & Oil Corp.s efforts to build a new major independent grassroots refinery in the United States.",

If his production is 20.000 barrels a day. he has to purchase entitlements for 20.000 barrels. It does not make any difference whether they are 1.000 small refineries or 10 refineries. his payment is not based on the production of those who sell entitlements.

They have obtained a pipeline permit that would allow the crude to comeby pipeline. and I understand they have \\vritten commitments for financing. By the way.

I want to commend the subcommittee chairman and the full committee. and also to commend my colleague from Massachusetts. the distinguished majority leader for what I consider to be a step in the right direction. However. I do not think it goes quite far enough. We are concerned about the economic impact. cost effectiveness. and desirability of base closings and realinements. It seems to me that when we have a military facility with say 25.000 men. but are shifting 12.000 people it should be reviewed by Congress. But it is not under the ONeill amendment. I can understand the reasoning in trying to put a floor under the review procedure. Obviously we do not have that much economic impact if all they are transferring is perhaps 50 people out of 75. I think that type of transfer or relocation or reallocation does not deserve the kind of notice we are talking about because it does not have that kind of impact. We have little communities in New Jersey. however. which have built schools. hospitals. stores. and other facilities around bases such as Fort Dix. that would be devastated if. in fact. major transfers take place. Some Members may say that we are playing musical chairs with military bases. It may benefit some today. but tomorrow they may have the same difficulties as New Jersey and other States are now experiencing. It is wrong. It seems to me that the responsible approach in the years ahead. is to make certain that the Congress does provide some oversightso that we do receive some notice--so that we can prepare for a warranted relocation. If. in fact. it is cost effective. if it makes sense. then I am going to support that type of move. but I cannot see that that has been the case since I have been in Congress. I understand my colleague from New Jersey will offer an amendment which will more effectively target in on all those moves that would have major economic impact.

And as the Members well know. when the original ONeill amendment was proposed. I very vigorously opposed that amendment because it would have eliminated savings of $260 million. It would have required us to appropriate $116 million to keep the bases going for another 3 years. I say to the Members of the House that we just cannot have our cake and eat it too. We went to a voluntary military. and to go to the voluntary military we now have to spend 53 percent. 54 percent. 55 percent for personnel compensation.

We cannot reduce military expenditures in terms of constant dollars as we have been doing in the pastthis year it is a little differentwithout having realinement. without having base closures.

However. we must stop somewhere. If we reduce this to 700 personnel. what about the 500 personnel in a very small community? They could close a base in a small community affecting 500 personnel. and that would have a much greater impact upon that community than a reduction of 750 personnel out of better than 8.000 employees would have on a larger community.

I am happy to have the Senator from California join me as a sponsor. Mr. President. under longstanding policy that goes back more than a decade. Government agencies and particularly the Department of Defense have used U.S. certificated scheduled and supplemental airlines to carry Government traffic. This is a sound policy which has been followed by many administrations. In return for the privilege of carrying Department of Defense traffic. the U.S. certificated airlines have committed many of their aircraft to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet which can be mobilized in time of national emergency or war. At present the Department of Defense is considering abandonment of this longhonored policy by attempting to contract with noncertificated airlines or private carriers for the carriage of some Department of Defense traffic. If DOD were to breach this policy. the financial damage to certificated airlines could be severe. While DOD well understands the severity of the situation.

Since 1970 the Airport and Airway Development Act has had a tremendous impact upon our national air transportation system in terms of improved safety and system capacity. Through the airport and airway trust fund. $1.3 billion in airport development funds have been obligated involving over 2.400 projects. Eightyfive new airports and one hundred seventyeight new runways have been built and hundreds of airports have been upgraded. Experience with the 1970 act has brought to light a number of deficiencies which must be rectified and to which this bill is addressed. Among the shortcomings of the 1970 act is a prohibition against the use of trust fund moneys for the construction and improvement of facilities directly related to the movement of passengers and baggage in airport terminals. In major hub airports. modern automated baggage handling facilities. waiting rooms and allweather boarding facilities have been installed either by the user airlines or by the terminal operator through user revenues. Smaller airports. relying on a much lower base of user funds. face great difficulty in financing capital improvements which do not qualify for matching grants from the airport and airway trust fund. S. 3015 will provide such funding on a 5050 basis. In this regard it is my understanding that the amendments to the 1970 act with respect to project costs as set forth in section 12 and related provisions of S. 3015 will apply to funds authorized to be disbursed for fiscal year 1976 beginning July 1. 1975. It is also my understanding that an airport improvement project involving passenger and baggage movement facilities begun prior to July 1. 1975. and which is still underway as of that date can qualify under the liberalized provisions of this bill with respect to those portions of the work undertaken in fiscal year 1976 and subsequent years.

Provisions for the development of intermodal passenger terminals indicate that the sponsors of S. 3015 are in tune with current theories about the need for coordination in transportation planning.

H.R. 13636 requires that LEAA consut with States to establish minimally acceptable standards for State and local correctional facilities. This bill broadens the provision in the present act to also prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and creed by recipients of LEAA funds and mandates the procedure to be followed by LEAA in the event of noncompliance. The bill further provides that any annual appropriations for the Justice Department after October 1. 1978 must be authorized by a specific authorization. H.R. 13636 focuses funding on programs to prevent crime against the elderly and authorizes the National Institute of Law Enforcement to study the relationship between street crime and drug abuse. It is significant that statistics show that the direct cost of drug abuse to the Nation ranges between $10 billion and $17 billion a year. Law enforcement officials estimate that almost 50 percent of all robberies. muggings and other property crimes are committed by addicts supporting their expensive habits. Mr. Speaker. I urge the adoption of House Resolution 1246 that we may discuss and debate H.R. 13636.",

Mr. Speaker. under House Resolution 1246 the House may resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole for the consideration of H.R. 13636. a bill to extend the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration for 1 year. This is a 2hour. open rule providing for the legislation to be read for amendment by titles instead of by sections. HR.P 13636 proposes to extend the authority of LEAA until September 39. 1977. at a total cost of $1.115.000.000. The bill would revise the standards for the comprehensiveness of State plans and the method of application for LEAA grants. The legislation is designed to develop initiatives for citizens to participate in fighting crime. and special attention is given to reduction of crime against the elderly. Provision is made for the use of discretionary funds to attack the criminal case backlog and delay. Finally. there is a requirement that minimally acceptable standards be developed for State and local correctional facilities. The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration has been of significant benefit to State and local governments throughout the country in the development of their anticrime programs. While LEAA has not been a panacea in our efforts to reduce crime. it has aided in improving law enforcement techniques as well as the general administration of criminal justice. Mr. Speaker. some reservations exist concerning certain aspects of this bill. and it is my understanding that amendments may be offered pursuant to these reservations. However. to my knowledge no one objects to the passage of the rule. I support its adoption. Mr. Speaker. I have no requests for time.",

Local resources are inadequate when they are directed toward the more complex problems of modern penology.

I lock forward to the effective oversight that I know LEAA will be receiving from the gentlemans subcommittee. Mr. Chairman. if I may just add a couple of more points. the gentleman from Michigan has asked what the Justice Department is doing about the terrible problem of crime. I would ask what Congress is doing about helping restore the family as the basic unit of society? We look to all sorts of reasons why we have high crime. why the erosion of authority and the respect for basic rights is no longer there. and yet we see programs in this country designed to erode the concept of the family.

While the present authorization will continue under the assumption that crime is largely a local problem and that the tools to combat it must exist at the local level. the unpleasant truth remains that in spite of improvements in the criminal justice system. the crime rate continues to rise. Incorporated in this bill are authorizations for community action programs. for the enforcement of civil rights legislation. for attacking the criminal case backlog. for improving correctional facilities. and for giving more attention to programs to combat crime against the elderly. Even though the LEAA makes up only about 5 percent of a States crime prevention funding. that 5 percent has done a considerable amount of good in the last 8 years. In that time. the LEAA has provided more than $4 billion through its block grant program to State and local governments. That money has supported more than 80.000 criminal justice projects. projects which have had a significant impact on the quality of justice in this country. As serious as the crime problem remains. without the LEAA it would be considerably worse. While I join many of my colleagues in having reservations about certain portions of this bill. particularly in the overly short period of authorization.

I submit. they are better able to identify the problem and to hit it effectively. Mr. Chairman. if we really read a committee report sometimes we can find something significant in it. I did just that. I looked at the committee report and it says: The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 legislation was based on the acknowledgment that crime Is essentially a local problem and the tools to combat crime exist at the local level. Federal criminal justice funding. therefore. has been administered through a block grant approach for the past 8 years. The problem now is that we are getting away from that block grant approach. If we look at the proposed LEAA budget for 1977. we will see it is for $753 million. which is in accord with the appropriation bill that we passed. If we look further. we will see that the grants to states out of the $753 million is $306 million. which is considerably less than 50 percent. There are further grant funds of a categorical type. such as discretionary funds. made incidentally. on the basis of decisions in Washington on what is to be done with the money. and that is $54 million.

The Senator probably recalls that the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry approved and the Senate and the House both passed a bill setting up a research program on animal diseases. It provided. I believe. for appropriation of about $40 million a year. It was pointed out at the hearings in connection with this bill that the owners of animals in this countryand I assume that would Include cattle. sheep. poultry. horses. and mules. possiblyestimate that from diseases of animals the producers of those animals sustained a loss of more than a billion dollars a year through deaths from disease of animals. This $40 million was to be used for a research program in this area. The President saw fit to veto the bill. and it was not passed over his veto. There we had a $40 million program to be paid -by the taxpayers. But here we have a program that could be as much as $30 million or as much as $60 million being paid for by the cattle producers themselves because they have in a referendum indicated that they wanted to assess themselves for that purpose. for many other research. and for promotion purposes.

In any event. if I may comment briefly on the referendum. there has been opposition from the American Farm Bureau Federation and others concerning the referendum. I can understand the opposition of any general farm organization when some commodity group seeks to help Itself with a program of this kind. They have opposed similar programs. As I said at the outset. we find cattle producers very seldom ask for any Federal assistance. other than occasional assistance in flying in feed during a severe blizzard in South Dakota. Kansas. or some other State. When we look at the support of this bill by the Cotton Council and the National Milk Producers Federation and the support of other commodity organizations. I think that on balance it is a good program. The questions being raised by the Senator from South Dakota are legitimate questions.

I want to call the attention of both Senators here to the time. a year or two ago. when we talked about the retail farm price spread. when the price of beef cattle was either going down or remaining stable and the price of beef in the supermarket continually went up. There was a lot of talk about investigation as to where that spread was going and who was getting it. That really brings us to this point: the promotion aspects of this bill would go only toward retail beef. Of course. that is probably the only place we can promote beef. because it would not do much good to promote wholesale beef to anybody. They know where their markets are and they are established and they are pretty much inelastic. If we are promoting retail beef and taking money from small cattle producers around the country. as well as larger ones. to promote retail beef. there is no guarantee in this legislation of any kind. Is there anything that will guarantee that the price spread might be closed down. or is there a guarantee that a producer himselfjust a producer. not the chainstore that also markets beefwill make one more penny out of the promotion of retail beef?",

This would. in my judgment. provide a program for research and promotion that would be calculated to allow the producers to produce beef at a lower cost to them and it would promote the consumption of beef. These factors would go hand in hand with making a profit. a greater profit. for the producer. No one could guarantee the success of the program. but. based on the steadily declining price of cattle. something needs to be done. This is what cattlemen say will help them. It is something that they say they are willing to pay. themselves. out of their own pockets. The Senator is talking about the cost spread between what the producer gets and the retail price. I should assume that that is something that would be subject to research by this board. to see what causes that. to see what can be done to remedy that. I think the Senator has put his finger on a very sensitive issue here. I think the research provided by this program would enable the Beef Board to check into what causes it. who is getting this addon to the price of cattle as it is sold at retail.

Before an independent audit of the District can be conducted it will be necessary to get the Districts financial accounting systems in order. Therefore. the bill as reported first addresses the problem of designing and implementing new financial accounting systems for the District. The design of such systems will be done by independent contractors under the supervision of the Comptroller General. The Mayor will be required to implement their recommendations with the assistance of GAO supervised contractors. Once the new financial accounting systems have been implemented. the Council will be required to retain a certified public accountant to conduct an independent audit of the Districts accounting records to determine if the Districts financial statements fairly present the financial posion of the District. Such independent audits will be required every 3 years. The committee bill requires the District to pay onehalf of the cost of the GAO contracts to design and implement the new financial accounting systems and. in any event. limits Federal expenditures to $750.000 for each of the fiscal years 1977. 1978. and 1979. The District is required to pay the entire cost of the independent audit. I believe that this bill will serve three salutary purposes. First. it will enable the city to get a better handle on its financial situation and thereby improve its ability to manage itself more efficiently. Second. it will improve the quality of the information available to the Congress when it reviews the Districts budget.

Congress. in carrying out its legislative and oversight functions. has the necessity and the obllgation to know as much about a Departments operation as possible. Any Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs should guard against permitting his or her operation from filtering out information which is necessary to implement Congressional responsibility. The Committee envisions no set of circumstances which would prevent a Member of Congress or any committee staff member from having easy access to any operating or resource personnel in the Department who can provide information and assistance in the legislative or oversight process. I might add that present communications between the Department of Commerce and the committee often leave much to be desired even though not as bad as Health. Education. and Welfare.

South Korea is a country which is a true friend of our country. For example. today I received a set of a new issue of stamps from South Korea that are Bicentennial stamps in honor of the American Bicentennial. I do not know how many countries in the world are doing something similar to this. I might point out that the South Korean Bicentennial stamps contain one with a map of the United States and the impression of Mt. Rushmore on it. and the first and the present flags of the United States. the Bicentennial symbol. the Liberty Bell. the Statue of Liberty. and so forth and so on.

I know of no one who has given more time trying to achieve greater fiscal responsibility in the Congress than the gentleman in the well. As he has so well stated. all he is trying to do here. really. is to shut off backdoor spending. This is nothing new to members of this committee or to the Members of the House of Representatives. For years and years. we have been trying to shut off backdoor spending. and I must say that we have met with considerable success. But in this program we are reverting .to backdoor spending in the largest grant program in the history of this Nation. I refer to general revenue sharing. Sure. all the mayors. the League of Cities. the Conference of Mayors. the National Association of Counties. all the governors are opposed to the amendment that the gentleman from Washington will offer if the Fountain amendment is adopted. They will also oppose the amendment that I will offer if the Fountain amendment is defeated. I will offer the amendment to the Brooks anendment. which has been presented as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. I think we have to face reality here. I think the compromise that will be offered by myself or offered by the gentleman from Washington is simply one that this committee ought to accept on the basis of fiscal responsibility. We have just as great an obligation to the people of this Nation as the governors of States and the mayors of cities and selectmen and county commissioners have to their constituencies. We are dealing with Federal funds. and I think we have a responsibility to be sure that the programs we approve are beneficial to all .the people. We oughtto get a look at them. We will never get a look at them if we continue to appropriate on the basis of entitlement. I hope the amendment which the gentleman from Washington will offer will be adopted. if the Fountain amendment is agreed to.

Members who want to protect that 33 entitlement cannot preserve it from amendment by voting for the Fountain substitute. Under these circumstances I know that no one would want to vote for a law which is unfair. which is inequitable. which fails to provide equal treatment for women and minorities and proper security for labor in this country. Therefore I support the Burton amendment. The entitlement question is going to be open for amendment. whether we favor it or not. and therefore it at least lets us put together a fair deal and a square deal with respect to distribution of the funds.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the most dangerous and destabilizing international developments of the past several years has been the massive increase in American sales of highly sophisticated military weapons to foreign nations. The value of these sales has risen from $3.9 billion in fiscal 1973 to a staggering $9.5 billion in fiscal 1975. accounting for nearly 10 percent of the value of all American exports. Through a series of amendments to the Foreign Military Sales Act. Congress has taken the first step toward controlling this unprecedented influx of deadly weapons into the most volatile regions of the world. The continued growth of arms sales and the infrequency with which the act has been applied. however. clearly indicate that further measures to increase legislative oversight are necessary. I have introduced two bills which would help to achieve this goal. H.R. 3213 would provide for congressional review of sales by private firms. applying to these transactions the same mechanism for congressional disapproval which currently applies only to sales through the Department of Defense. H.R. 5659 would extend the coverage of the Foreign Military Sales Act to all arms sales. removing the current requirement that their value exceed $25 million and insuring that Congress will have an adequate opportunity to review all sales. I urge my colleagues to consider these and other measures to increase legislative scrutiny of the administrations apparent desire to make the United States the arms merchant to the world. It is for that reason that I commend to their attention the following article on \"The Boom in the Death Business.\" by Emma Rothschild. which appeared in the October 2. 1975 edition of the New York Review of Books. In reviewing three recent books on this subject. Ms. Rothschild summarizes the virtually uncontrolled and unprecedented increase in the arms trade. She also points out the pervasive corruption within the industry. reminding us of Secretary of Defense Schlesingers recent remark that revelations of corruption by the Northrop Corp. are probably only the \"tip of the iceberg\" of such activities.

This landmark to Federal bureaucratic wisdom includes such features as an indoor swimming pool. gymnasium. auditorium. theater. greenhouse. and other necessities.

On November 1st. there will be a series of demonstrations in New York. Chicago. and the Bay area of California. demanding the release of five Puerto Rican terrorists who are in prison for the attempt to assassinate President Truman in 195C. and the shooting attack on Members of Congress on the House floor in There is good reason to believe that terrorist attacks. including bombings and possibly shootings. will be attempted by the Puerto Rican terrorist group. FALN. this weekend in coordination with the demonstrations. This is the group responsible for the bombings last week in New York. Chicago. and Washington. D.C. FALN is closely associated with the Weather Underground. Planting bombs is a cowardly act in itself. But there is reason to believe that these cowards have been using the young girls of the Weather Underground to plant their bombs. The House Committee on Internal Security has been abolished. The Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security has had its funds severely cut back. The Justice Departments Internal Security Division has been reduced to a Section. Even the FBI has been curtailed by the present Attorney General. Local police department intelligence units. which had been effective in preventing acts of terrorism in New York. Chicago. and Los Angeles. have had their files destroyed and their operations curtailed. The Bicentennial celebration next year is certain to be the target of terrorist attacks. The bombings last week. and the planned bombings this weekend. are only a sample of what is to come. Our country urgently needs the reestablishment of our internal security apparatus.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in recent years many cities and towns have been hard hit by the mushrooming cost and inconvenience of solid waste disposal. Caught between environmental controls. lack of suitable landfill locations. and an everincreasing flow of waste. most local governments have come to consider their trash. garbage and sewage sludge as little more than a headache and multibillion dollar fiscal liability. In fact. however. recent technical experience indicates that solid waste may be one of our most promising and reliable natural resources. and a source of both new energy supplies and recycled raw materials. There is good reason to believe that active development of systems designed to reflect local problems ane needs will eventually make the processing of solid waste materials into a profitable commercial enterprise. Since many of the most advanced methods of solid waste treatment have not been fully implemented except on a small scale. many local governments have been understandably hesitant to commit themselves to longterm planning and Investment in unproven technology. The psychological impact of successful demonstration of online solid waste systems would undoubtedly loosen up tight bond markets and ease the apprehensions of investors and undecided localities. The Solid Waste Energy and Resource Recovery Act of 1975. which I introduced in July. addresses this problem by establishing a rigorous program of research. development. and demonstration of alternative waste management systems. This bill. H.R. 8745. which has attracted 59 cosponsors in the House. would make advanced. energyefficient processing of solid waste materials a real and affordable possibility for both private industry and enterprising local governments. Following are several recent articles concerning the development of solid waste technology. and local efforts to implement energy and resource processes. which I highly commend to my colleagues: [From the Newark StarLedger.

In its annual statistical portrait of the heads of the Nations biggest and richest corporations. Fortune magazine concluded that todays chief executive \"is still a he.\" While top corporations are opening their doors to the younger and middleclass worker. big business clings to the discriminatory hiring and promotion practices which hold women in economic fealty. Women constitute 18 percent of the corporate work force. but they occupy a meager twotenths of 1 percent of the positions entailing the most responsibility and control. While the percentage of women in the labor force has risen from 37 percent in 1960 to 46 percent in 1974. the percentage of working women occupying supervisory positions has declined. Some women have crept up the corporate ladder. But their progress consistently has been halted short of the top executive posts which shape American corporate policy. Moreover. even when the corporate woman has gained a toehold at the top. she usually finds that sex discrimination has followed her. It impedes her in many ways. not the least of which is her pay. Women executives. according to the January issue of Atlanta magazine. receive salaries barely half59 percentthose of men in comparable positions.

Moreover. even should women be given a presence In corporate America it is essential that she also enjoy a status and stature comparable to the male worker. Barring women from the upper echelons of the business world denies over half of the population a significant economic impact in the United States. It is essential that we confront and overcome the pervasive biases of our society. The role of womel. in corporate America symbolizes the great distance we have yet to travel. Women have dispelled the myth that they are incapable of functioning in the business world. and their abilities and achievements must no longer be ignored in the executive suites and corporate boardrooms.",

My 1976 questionnaire indicated that the two areas of greatest concern are basically the same ones which disturbed people the most as shown by my 1975 poll. They are the problem of ineffective handling of criminals by the courts and a Government which has become too large -and powerful. An Overwhelming number of people believe that Congress should enact legislation imposing mandatory minimum sentences for -criminals convicted of murder. my poll shows. This question drew the greatest number of comments. and many people expressed the views that the death penalty should be restored and that the courts were too \"soft\" on criminals. There was also a tremendous response to the question of whether there is too much Government regulation in the lives of American citizens. People complained not only about overregulation of businesses. but also professions and leisure activities.

In 1961. he was called to Washington to serve on President Kennedys Council of Economic Advisers. Later he was appointed Director of the Budget Bureau and served under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Following his Government service. his abilities found a new fruition at the Brookings Institution in Washington. of which he became vice president in 1965 and president in 1967. For the remainder of his life he demanded of his colleagues at Brookings the kind of quality he imparted to his own work in Government and the academic world.

Eighteen years ago the Congress enacted Public Law 8690. which established Captive Nations Week. For millions of Americans. the \"old countries\" from which their parents or grandparents came to our shores no longer exist. They were overrun by the Soviet Union. Their governments were disbanded. In many cases their people were dispersed to erase their nationalistic identities. Many who refused to accept the bonds of communism were sent to labor camps. The peoples of the Captive Nations. and their descendants and relatives here. never have given up the dream that one day freedom and selfgovernment may return to those countries. Captive Nations Week helps maintain that faith and hope. We also should use this occasion as a reminder that the price of liberty is vigilance against subversion and aggression. There are many in the world who harbor illfeelings toward the United States. If there is ever to be hope that the Captive Nations regain their independence. we must make certain that we. as the greatest independent Nation on Earth. preserve our liberties. maintain our strength. and be aware of the dangers of a perilous world.

The purpose of this program would be to provide nutritional meals to homebound senior citizens. many of whom currently suffer severe malnutrition. Nearly 50 Members of this body now have joined me in sponsoring this important legislation. which was introduced in the Senate by Senators McGOVERN. KENNEDY. and PERCY. The Senate has already held preliminary hearings on the legislation. Given the broad support for the program in the House. I am hopeful we will begin consideration shortly. Title VII. the elderly feeding program. already provides many senior citizens with nutritious meals on a regular basis. But most of these meals are served in a congregate setting. Only 13 percent of all these meals were served to senior citizens in their homes. a total of only about 30.000 meals last year. Considering that there are between 3 and 4 million homebound elderly in American. we have a long way to go. The National Meals on Wheels bill will go far toward providing meals to the homebound elderly. My bill would authorize expenditures of $80 million in the first year. and $100 million in the second year for distribution under the title VII formula to title VII projects or local mealsonwheels programs. A special attempt is to be made to fund existing programs which already have demonstrated their expertise in providing meals to the homebound. Many of these local efforts. which have been successful in the past and which draw their support from the community. have been largely ignored by the Federal Government and. tragically. many have had to cease their operations. My bill would reverse this unfortunate trend. There are great costs to our society at present because of our failure to have a comprehensive feeding program for our elderly citizens. First. there is the health cost. Millions of our senior citizens suffer illness and even death which could be averted had they enjoyed a balanced. nutritional diet. Malnutrition. often caused by an inability to purchase or prepare foods for their own consumption. is a major reason for seniors entering nursing and retirement homes and institutions.

Thus it was that he left a safe seat in the House of Representatives to return to Illinois- and seek statewide office once again. He served ably in the Congress as a member of its important Rules Committee. Following his retirement he again served in various capacities both for the county government and for the Republican Party in DuPage County.

I would like to bring to the attention of this body the fine record of this pioneering organization. I have a high regard for the Girl Scouts and strongly support the scouting concept. My experience as a scoutmaster in South Dakota meant a great deal to me and fostered an interest in scouting which has persevered over the years. The Girl Scouts are the worlds largest voluntary organization for girls. with over 61/ million members in 90 countries. Since its inception in 1912. 27 million girls and 7 million adults have participated in the organization. Today. the Girl Scouts boast 3 million members in the 50 States. We are all familiar with the famous boxes of cookies which the Girl Scouts sell throughout the Nation. These cookies provide the organization with badly needed funds which allow the Girl Scouts to sponsor a multitude of national and international events. purchase equipment and property. and provide camperships. The Girl Scouts have played a major role in encouraging women to develop a positive selfimage. They allow girls to acquire skills in the areas of their choice and provide opportunities for career exploration. The ethical and spiritual code which unites the girls is a partnership which stands out as an exemplary model of national unity. The Girl Scouts organization enables girls from varied cultural. ethnic. and economic backgrounds to share their heritages and develop a strong sense of community responsibility. I commend the Girl Scouts of America for the fine efforts which they have made in behalf of our great Nation. They have made outlets available for our young people which have withstood the test of time. Rooted in traditional American values. the ideals of the Girl Scouts have developed millions of girls into leaders and responsible citizens. The Girl Scouts help girls become young women with good moral standards and the capacity to do something for themselves and their communities. Their work is truly outstanding and worthy of the commendation of this body. I. therefore. encourage my colleagues to join with me in saluting the Girl Scouts of America.",

Since fusion can generate more energy per pound of fuel than any other reaction. the use of fusion neutrons to produce hydrogen could be an inexpensive and highly efficient process. The lack of cheap hydrogen has been an impediment to economic coal gasification. With cheap fusiongenerated hydrogen. it would be possible to produce methane cheaply and abundantly by making hydrogen react with coal or with carbon derived from limestone. \"If it works.\" say the chairman of a pipeline company that supports research at KMS Fusion. \"it will be like the invention of the electric light.\" Siegel and his associates figure that by taking the shortcut from pellet to pipeline. their company could cut years from the development of economic fusion power. The design of a methane generator would be simpler than that of an electricgeneratiing fusion plant. Scientists at KMS Fusion talk about having a pilot methane generator operating about five years from now if the company gets enough financial and technical help from the government and from larger companies.

Starting in 1969 the subcommittee began its current series of hearings entitled \"Trends in LongTerm Care.\" To date. 25 hearings have been held in this series and more than 3.000 pages of testimony have been taken. We are now releasing a 12volume series of reports: \"Nursing Home Care in the United States: Failure in Public Policy.\" Earlier this month. we issued our third supporting paper. \"Doctors in Nursing Homes: The Shunned Responsibility.\" The reaction to these reports in the press and from the public has been heartwarming. In particular. I appreciate the support from organizations such as the National Council of Senior Citizens which have pledged their assistance in helping to bring about the enactment of nursing home reform bills I introduced on March 12. The February 20 edition of the New York Times carried an article by Martin Tolchn which gives the broad outlines of our legislative strategy and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the REcoRD an article in Modem Healthcare by Jerome F. Brazda entitled. \"Senator Moss Prescription: Once a Month Until Reform.\" an article in the February 1975 edition of Medical World News entitled \"U.S. Nursing HomesA Mess Says Moss\" and an article entitled \"Nursing Homes: A Story of Neglect\" by Bernard Nash. executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons which appeared in the FebruaryMarch issue of Modern Maturity.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. Senate Resolution 111 is a continuing resolution to continue through May 31. 1975. the authority of Senate committees to pay compensation and make expenditures for inquiries and investigations. and for other purposes. This continuing resolution was proposed because the Rules Committee has had a very difficult task of proceeding with all of the money resolutions for the various committees and at the same time trying to carry out Its responsibilities with respect to the New Hampshire election. and as well to give consideration to a proposal known as the Gravel resolution. which would change the makeup of the staff allowances for Members for representation on committees. So the Rules Committee unanimously reported Senate Resolution 111. to continue present authority until the end of May of this year. because that would permit the Senate committees to continue expenditures at the basis that they have been spending up to the present time. or during the last quarter. and at the same time would give us the opportunity. immediately when the New Hampshire election count of the votes is concluded. to hold a hearing on the socalled Gravel resolution and make a determination with respect to that matter. which might in turn affect some of the allowances given to the committees under the money resolutions that are now before the Senate. Based on that. Mr. President. we have given the assurance. and I again give the assurance now. that we will proceed to hold hearings on the Gravel resolution at the earliest possible time. and we have assured its sponsors that we interpret that to mean that we would try to hold them so as to conclude the matter within 2 weeks after the conclusion of our counting of the votes with respect to the New Hampshire election. We are anticipating that we will not need the period of time covered by this resolution up until the end of May. but to cover possible contingencies we did make the resolution effective to the end of May. As I say. It has the unanimous approval of the members of the Committee on Rules and Administration. Mr. President. I have nothing further to say on the matter. unless some Senator has a question.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment and I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. this amendment Introduces a wholly new element into the law that had been passed earlier by the Congress. When we first conditioned the Turkish assistance on some progress in the Mediterranean we were very careful not to tie it to a political settlement or political progress between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. We said that was not our responsibility. that our interest centered on the Turkish armed forces and their presence in Cyprus and the need for them to pull back or to withdraw. This amendment however injects the final political settlement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots into the condition for aid and I think it represents a very serious mistake. What it says is that the President would have to certify that there has been progress with respect to the refugee problem. This could be viewed to mean that the refugees need new tents and running water and perhaps enough food to eat. but obviously that is not what is intended. What is intended is that the refugees should have the opportunity to go back home. which they should have. and that there should be an opportunity for these communities to be restored to what they were before the aggression by the Turks took place. but accomplishing that result involves a political settlement. It involves the political settlement that I hope will come between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots. That is not our responsibility. This is something we cannot dictate. It is not a result the Turkish Government or the Greek Government should be dictating either.",

I want to make one further point. The trouble with our posture on Turkey is that we have. in fact. put American intentions and the American will directly against the nationalistic feelings of the Turkish people. and it Is a nowin game. If we pursue this course. not only will there not be progress on Cyprus. but we can figure we have practically destroyed any kind of working relationship with Turkey for the long term. I would be prepared to sacrifice that relationship with Turkey if I thought it would bring progress on Cyprus. but it will not. If anything. it means there will be no progress.

When the President certifies that there has been some progress on refugees. he can immediately release $185 million worth of military equipment that was contracted for prior This is a creative Initiative. It is an initiative that gives the Turkish Government an opportunity to come off a very hardnosed position. It gives the President great flexibility in making that determination. We in the Congress do not have to make it. If the President determines that the movement of 25.000 refugees is adequate progress. then he can make that determination. and we leave in the hands of the President the right to make that determination.",

I have paid close attention to the colloquy thus far here today on the floor. but it seems to me. since this act was passed in 1972. we should have some results that we could evaluate at this point. What has it cost the consumer to get these bumpers which supposedly are safer? What is the cost increase? I have heard figures of anywhere from $100 to $300 representing the increased cost of an automobile for this item. That is the first question. and the companion question I wish to ask along with it is this: Once we know what that cost is. what is the benefit?

There are two minor problems that they correct. The first would remove the word \"knowingly\" from section 411(a). The effect of the existing provisions would be to require a greater burden of proof for civil penalties than for criminal penalties and thus to encourage the Secretary to use a criminal penalty rather than a civil penalty. which is quite the reverse of what ought to be and what the committee intended. The second amendment deals with the criminal penalty section and merely makes it clear that not only are we talking about positive acts. but we are talking about acts of omission or also acts causing another to violate the statute.

In August 1950. the Department of Interior granted to the city of Yakutat a parcel of land. better described in Patent No. 1143948. under the terms of the act entitled \"An Act to direct the Secretary of Interior to convey abandoned school properties in the Territory of Alaska to local school officials.\" (64 Stat. 470). Certain restrictions were made a part of this land grant by placing the parcel of land in \"school reserve\" status. At the time of the land conveyance. this restriction did not pose a problem. However. in recent years the city of Yakutat has changed substantially. and the city now finds the restrictions on this land greatly encumber the formation of comprehensive planning and zoning policies. Since the time of the land grant. the Yakutat school complex has been relocated approximately 1 mile away from the land in question. This parcel of land is no longer needed for school purposes. Another factor which is greatly affecting the city of Yakutat is the U.S. Department of Interiors announced accelerated Outer Continental Shelf petroleum leasing program wherein the Gulf of Alaska adjacent to Yakutat is scheduled for immediate leasing. The development of Yakutat into a primary port city is imminent. The city has sufficient present and contemplated municipal lands for future public use purposes but has had difficulty in providing land to Yakutat residents for homesites and other private uses. In addition. there is a scarcity in Yakutat of lands for economic development located in areas identified as suitable for that purpose in the citys overall land use plan. The city feels it must be able to plan the use of all municipal lands based upon uptodate planning and current needs assessments and accordingly desires the encumbrances attached to the school parcel removed. The bill I am introducing today would allow the city of Yakutat to dispose of this parcel of land in order to further economic development and enhance the citys aggressive program of planning for the impact of Outer Continental Shelf leasing. Proceeds from the disposal or lease of the land in question would. under the terms of my bill. be used for public school or other public purposes. Mr. President.

Under present law. the United States is handicapped in working with nations such as Saudi Arabia because of religious discrimination against American participants. If we are to deal with this situation effectively. we must deal with governments on our terms as well as on their terms.

Mr. Aspinall was the first of what we hope will be a long series of men in public life who venture to the Laramie campus to teach in the field of government and politics. This exciting concept is made possible by the establishment of the Milward L.

As the statement of purposes of the fund saysFew people have had a greater influence upon the State of Wyoming than Milward Simpson. As a member and President of the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees. as Governor. and later as a U.S. Senator. the name Mlward Simpson is synonymous with honest government. loyalty. personal courage. and a progressive and innovative outlook.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to call attention to the retirement of a unique Oregonian. Mr. Hillman Lueddemann. from public service to the people of our State. When I was Governor of Oregon. I asked \"Lueddie\" to undertake a very difficult task. We had put together the fist department. where we took agencies and departments that were under no central direction. and we grouped these related areas under a State department of commerce. What was important about this was that it paved the way for later consolidation and streamlining of other agencies. departments. and bureaus. What was unique about my choice of \"Lueddie\" to head this important post is that he was 69 years young at the time. He had finished a distinguished career as a businessman. and was at an age when most people think about enjoying retirement. But not \"Lueddie.\" He now has worked for three Oregon Governors. and done an outstanding job for all three of us. He has announced his intention to retire at the stillyoung age of 80. As I have heard in Oregon since this announcement was made. he probably really is not retiring in the usual sense. but merely getting ready for some new task. I believe it of \"Lueddie.\" At a time when all of us are aware of growing budgets and growing bureaucratic kingdoms. I also want to call attention to another quality of this remarkable Oregonian. I know my fellow former Governors will take special note of this accomplishment. His own office has remained only \"Lueddie\" and a secretaly. There has been no empirebuilding. no coveting a stable of aids. no attempt to persuade the budget committee that he merited special appropriations for a personal office and staff. Itis truly remarkable. To a longtime friend. I say congratulations. You have earned a respite from the struggle of providing better service for the people of Oregon. But when I read the word \"retirement.\" I just do not believe it.

    "speech": "Mr. President. recently the Office of Management and Budget produced a report. still embargoed. entitled \"Interagency Report on U.S. Government Export Promotion Policies and Programs.\" This report. which stirred strong opposition within the administration and by American exporters basically concluded that the United States should deemphasize export promotion programs and rely instead on the operation of floating exchange rates to correct trade imbalances. This overly theoretical model of the way international trade works is totally divorced from reality. In fact. there is no free market in currency markets. Every country will. from time to time. intervene in these markets for political. social. or economic reasons. Since exports are much more important to all of our competitors economies than to the United States. these governments either engage in dirty floats or stimulate exports through expensive programs or both. Unilaterally dismantling American programs would clearly leave American exporters at a disadvantage. I should finally note that the interagency report reached its conclusions with very little attention to the effects which adoption of Its recommendations would have. On July 14. 1975. the Wall Street Journal printed a column which pointed out further weaknesses in this monetarist analysis. Principal among the columnists findings was the fact that changes in currency values are not the accurate. finetuning instrument they were once thought to be. He writes that a Scandinavian official noted. \"Central bankers rarely know more than any outsider about why money is moving in or out.\" The column is an interesting. though indirect commentary on those academic theorists who would weaken our export efforts and rely instead on floating to correct trade deficiencies.

The first deals with educational laboratories and centers. The conferees agreed to Senate language Which would continue the centers at or near last years level. It Is our intention that existing centersbe allowed to compete for funds on an open. fair basis. In another area. it is our intention that $5 million of the NIE appropriation be used to continue satellite communication experiments and demonstrations. using the soontobelaunched communications technology satellite and other satellites such as the applications technology satellite. Senator Stevens and myself feel very strongly about this. It appears to be a good. sound investment of NIE time and effort. More Importantly. this will result in the education community reaping the benefits of technology. The Senator from Alaska also made a strong statement supporting the continuation of education experiments and demonstrations by the National Institute of Education on the Communications Technology Satellite. to be launched in December. and on the existing Applications Technology Satellites. Mr. President. I could not agree more with my colleagues. It is a \"good and sound investment\" for the National Institute of Education to pursue a strong program in the use of technology to bring educational services to the people of this country. The Government has invested millions of dollars in experimental communications satellites and the Senator from Washington and the Senatox from Alaska and the Appropriations Committee are right when they urge and direct an agency of the Government to use these satellites for experimental and demonstration purposes so that the benefits of technology can reach the people. I hope that the committee has been heard by the National Institute of Education and its new director. and that NIE will pursue a strong program using these communication satellites for experimental and demonstration purposes. Mr. President. I commend the Committee on Appropriations for its forthright action in stating its intention that the National Institute of Education pursue these educational satellite experiments and I congratulate the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Alaska for their leadership.",

Ambassador Moynihan has noted in a recent speech. liberal democracies are being replaced by to-. talitarian regimes and there is little if any evidence of a trend in the other direction. In light of the defeat our policy has sustained in Southeast Asia. the continuing instability of the Middle East. and the grave uncertainties surrounding future developments in Cyprus. Greece. Turkey. Spain. Italy. India. Portugal. Angola. Argentina. and so forth. I believe it is safe for us to conclude that the international environment is neither stable nor conducive to American interests. Whenever the international environment becomesconducive to our national interest our security is adversely affected. Thus I believe that we must continue to bear the burden necessary to maintain a strong and unassailable military posture. I believe that a strong America and a strong free world will not only help to contain future Communist expansion but will serve as a source of hope for the millions of people now living behind the Iron Curtain. I would hope that whenever we enter into an agreement with any of the Communist nations we would seek concessions designed to make it more difficult for them to maintain the repressive domestic policies they have pursued in the past. Our objectives could include a freer exchange of ideas and people. freer emigration. prohibition on jamming. and other similar measures. By pursuing such a policy. we could also increase the security of the United States and the free world by making It more difficult for our adversaries to pursue their military and expansionistic objectives. I think all Americans might reflect upon your importance of Captive Nations Week to people on both sides of the Iron Curtain. To those citizens of the nations which have fallen to Communist aggression. Captive Nations Week holds out the hope that they have not been forgotten in their continuing struggle to regain there freedom and independence. To the people of the United States and the free world. it Is a time each year for us to reflect on just how precious. valuable. and fragile our freedoms are and how important it is for us to be vigilant in the dcfense of them.",

A popular argument against ratification was one brought up by members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and by the American Bar Association: Article III (c) of the Convention concerning \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" violates freedom of speech and press in the United States. There is no basis for such a concern. The convention does not abridge the first amendment. There has never been unrestrained freedom of speech here in the United States or anywhere else in the world. Incitement has a definitive meaning in American law and under this meaning. has often been made a punishable offense. By our law. criminal acts include incitement to riot. to murder of officials and to mutiny. The convention only seeks to apply the same principles to acts of genocide. Moreover. the Genocide Convention provides that the contracting nations enact legislation to make the convention effective \"in accordance with their respective constitutions.\" Among those citing this case is the American Civil Liberties Union: If this Convention did interfere with the First Amendment. the American Civil Liberties Union would be the first one to complain. without regard to whether or not we commend the objectives of the Convention. However. we do not think there is any problem under the First Amendment to the Constitution. With the clarification of this point.

Now. in a June 28 article for the Washington Post. Reischauer urges us not to panic in repeating in Korea the mistakes learned so painfully in Vietnam. Reischauer points out that today. South Korea enjoys superiority over the North in manpower and weaponry andinternal unity not known In South Vietnam. Neither China nor Russia shows an inclination to support a North Korean military venture into the South. Moreover. American public opinion is not likely to sanction a repeat performance that would draw us into another Asian war. particularly to defend a goverjment of which it does not approve. But. Reischauer says. a situation is developing which \"over a longer time span may produce conditions like those that proved fatal to South Vietnam.\" The Park government is using repressive measures which are beginning to build up internal forces of resistance. Economic problems brought on by oil prices and worldwide recession haunt the South Korean economy. It Is. therefore. possible that the presence of 40.000 American soldiers near the border could threaten to draw the United States into a future conflict brought on as much by forces internal to South Korea as external. While it would not be appropriate for the United States to take immediate action. we must begin now to institute a policy of gradual but deliberate disengagement from Korea. one which would. be fully understood by our most important friend and ally In Asia. Japan. As Relschauer says: Now is the time. while the Vietnam dust is settling. to start thinking through thi1 problem.

I am particularly pleased that a conference agreement has been reached on this much needed legislation. For too long the educational needs of handicapped children have been neglected. S. 6. which we are considering today. seeks to resolve that problem by increasing Federal aid for education of these children. and by providing guidelines to insure that individual needs will be met. Certainly. this legislation is not a panacea. we still have a long road to travel before the needs of all handicapped children are met. But. with enactment of this legislation. we will have made an important commitment. S. 6 gives first priority to \"unserved\" handicapped children and then to children who have been inadequately served even though they are severely handicapped. The legislation requires States and localities to undertake extensive child identification programs and to prepare a \"full service\" goal and a timetable for reaching that goal. There must be parent consultation and individualized programs for all handicapped children. In addition. there must be an assurance of an effective policy which guarantees the right of all handicapped children to a free. appropriate public education. at no cost to the parents or guardian. Mr. President. the education of handicapped children is a costly effort. The special skills and services involved in special education do not come easily or without expense. However. we must come to realize that the money we spend on these programs is a national investment. If we do not make this commitment now. we will pay dearly in later years through lost talent and productivity. For this reason. I would urge me colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting the conference report on S. 6. Further. it is my sincere hope that President Ford will also recognize the importance of this investment and. in so doing. sign S. 6 so that its provisions can be implemented promptly.",

This is an authorization and this years appropriation for this program is accommodated by the 1976 first concurrent resolution. However. I cannot say with equal confidence that spending in subsequent years will be so easily accommodatedparticularly if the appropriations voted for this program increase as fast as its authorization levels. For example. under the current formula. in 1982 this programs authorization might be as high as $3.2 billion. In short. Mr. President. this legislation creates what is known in budget parlance as a \"wedge.\" That is. we appear to be establishing a program that may not look like a big commitment now but may soon become a very substantial one. It is the task of the authorizing committees to identify the needs for programs such as this. and I am especially appreciative of the Labor and Public Welfare Committees efforts to translate such needs with the clarity that has been exhibited in this legislation. However. the probability that we will fully meet these needs seems small. Unless we forfeit on commitments to other important priorities in the Federal budget. it strikes me as unlikely that we will be able to fund this program at the full authorization in the near future. Mr. President. I am of two minds on this bill. I applaud the specificity of the outyear authorizations in this bill. yet I have reservations about this first step toward committing ourselves to authorizations for such large spending in the future. And so. Mr. President. I believe we need to understand clearly that large outyear authorizations. such as those included in this bill. do not mean that we will necessarily spend at those levels. Unfortunately. the administration has suggested publicly that Congress is committing itself to vastly increased spending and continued deficits by legislation such as this. We know that that is not so. since the decisions to appropriate funds for programs such as that authorized by S. 6 come to us for a vote each year. both in the budget resolution and in appropriations bills.

It seems to me there is no justification to allow this inequitable treatment to continue in just one sector of the construction industry. namely residential construction. In talking about residential construction. one might get the impression that this is just small business. limited contractors. and limited development. But the economic facts are that in residential housing we have giant business. and developments of scores. hundreds. and even thousands of houses. In pursuit of the theory that construction should receive equal treatment with industrial opportunities and activities. I suggest that a development of several hundred houses is very comparable to an assembly line of automobiles. It is an assembly line that is being applied to residential housing. If there is support for. removing the inequity which now exists. that inequity should not be protected for what can well be big business in residential construction.

Cloture was invoked. after several votes. by two votes. and I would rather suspect that by the time this bill is voted on for final passage. there will probably be 43 or 44 Senators strongly in opposition to this measure. So. to me. it should not be treated as a sacred cow. It is very suspect as to its basic merits. and I do not think that we as Senators should approach it on the basis that amendments of whatever kind or character should not be offered or passed. That has been the tenor of the debate throughout the course of the day: That C0202357Part 29 despite the merits of an amendment. it will not pass because the feet of Senators are cast in concrete. It has been repeated to me during the course of the consideration that the reason organized labor wants situs picketing is because of its effect on major construction. that they could not care less about housing. As Senators have indicated. the union impact upon housing in this country already is minimal. It is less than 20 percent. Most of the housing construction in this country today is open shop. or. as the Senator from Ohio has indicated. mixed. So it seems to me. that in this particular situation. we have a meritorious piece of legislation with insignificant impact upon situs picketing as such. and I believe that it would make a very objectionable bill. to me. somewhat less objectionable. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.",

Further. it does not follow economic realities. The number of structures of three stories or less without an elevator which can be put on any site is very large. For example. there are builders in the country who build hundreds of houses on a single site. A very wellknown example. of course. is the Levitt & Sons enterprise. which builds whole cities. Second. Mr. President. this represents a large share of construction. For example. in ordinary economic times 50 percent of the working carpenters are involved in construction of residential housing. I have not heardand we argued it in committeeany compelling economic interest which should cause us to segregate these workers from the construction workers generally. All builders are small. There are not any enormous construction industry complexes in this country.. There are some that are larger than others. but essentially it is a small business enterprise. This amendment would simply create an arbitrary distinction. excluding a very large number of construction workers who have no economic base. For these reasons. Mr. President. I believe that those who favor the structure of this bill and acknowledge the reason for enacting it into law should join in rejecting this amendment.",

As we stated in the committee report. it is not entirely logical to preclude picketing under this bill where such picketing is designed to support a product boycott. which is primary activity when engaged in to preserve work traditionally performed by the striking unions. However. the bill already has two notice requirements. which I intend at the proper time to transfer to section 8(g) of the act which are carefully restricted departures from the strict logic of allowing primary picketing in all circumstances. Because of the concern that some Senators have expressed. the distinguished Senator from New York and I have agreed to accept this further restriction. and to retain Denver Building to the limited extent stated in the amendment. In the committee we defeated an amendment accepted by the sponsors on the House side which would have retained the Denver Building rule where the picketing was in support of a product boycott. We did so because some forms of product boycotts are primary activity. as the supreme Court held in the National Woodwork case (Woodwork Manufacturers v. Labor Board. 386 U.S. 612). and the theory of the bill is that a union should be entitled to engage in primary picketing in support of primary objectives. However. as the amendment that has been proposed indicates. some Members believe that it would be unwise to combine these weapons. even though they agree that Denver Building was wrongly decided and National Woodwork was correctly decided. In examining the question of what economic weapons are to be allowed under section 8(b) (4). I have concluded that the better course is to preserve the product boycott under the principles stated in National Woodwork. and in general to overrule the Denver case while retaining it in this limited context. just as we have sanctioned carefully limited restrictions on common situs picketing in other provisions of the bill. I therefore support this amendment.",

We have heard a lot about the complexity of the paperkeeping and one thing and another. The fact is that this is something that has been studied in great detail. with great care. It has been the subject of an exhaustive article in the Harvard Law Review. This particular bill has the blessings of the National Apartment Association and the New York Landlords Associations. They are the people who worry about this paperwork. With respect to the complications for the tenant. again the New York Tenants Association. the California Tenants Association. and others understand this legislation and do not feel it is too cornplicated for the people who would be saving the equivalent of up to 1 months rent a year. We hear a lot about double deductions. The fact is that \"double deductions\" is a catch phrase. It is a very common thing in taxation that one item of expense may be. in effect. deducted by several different taxpayers. Someone manufactures a chair. He pays for lumber. He deducts the cost of that lumber. He then sells that chair for a profit to a business. That business deducts the cost of the chair. which includes the cost of the lumber. We are talking practical consequences and the practical consequences of this amendment are two: No. 1. the landlord neither gains nor loses. No. 2. every tenant having an income of $5.000 or more gains by having the cost of his housing reduced because. for the first time. the tenant will be receiving the benefit of the property tax deduction that he. in fact. is paying for.

One matter is the unclassified provision to Congress by the President of the results of the administrations investigation into that assassination at which time the second contingency of whether Congress might want to continue. depending on the outcome of that investigation. aid to Chile. As colleagues know. there have been a number of political assassinations around the country of the enemies of the Junta in Chile.

So this method of waiting for 120 days to cut off aid. pending the outcome of an investigation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. while the World Wars may seem like light years away because .of all that has happened since on both our foreign and domestic fronts. in reality. it has not been so very long since these wars were a way of life. The veterans of these wars are still alive and need our help. I have before me a resolution drawn up by the Veterans of World War I of the U.S.A. which underlines the necessity for care for the veterans of World Wars I and II. Many of these people. as stated in the resolution. are old. without families. and in the low income category. The services at this point in. time are not adequate for their needs. Because of the dearth of available rooms at the existing VA facilities. some of the veterans have been forced to go to commercial nursing homes. While these institutions do their best. they cannot provide all of the services at hand. and. unfortunately. for some they are simply too expensive. Most of us here today have participated in some field of the Armed Forces. be it in the World Wars or after. Just as these veterans showed their concern by fighting for our country in its -time of need. so too must we show ous by working to enact legislation so as not to neglect these people in their time of distress. i-.knOw that myfellowMembersof Congress join me. in my realization of the vitalness of this resolution from the Veterans of World War I. and I therefore ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

I feel it extremely important to call to this bodys attention the fact that the ocean and naval policy of the Soviet Union is making evergreater strides in its competition for world domination. An effort by the National Ocean Policy Study to examine this development resulted in the report. entitled \"Soviet Ocean Activities: A Preliminary Survey.\" which clearly shows that within the last two decades. the Soviet Union has emerged as a major maritime nation. capable of utilizing the oceans and their resources to serve Soviet domestic and international economic and military interests. An article in todays Washington Post by George C. Wilson further scores the need for the leadership of the United States to recognize the impact of the growth of Soviet maritime and rnval power in the world. The article recounts an interview with retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt. the former Chief of Naval Operations. who believes that the Soviet Navy has achieved at least a powcr parity with the U.S. Navy. and that Soviet Adm. Sergei G.

In comparison U.S. marine affairs policy has often been disjointed. redundant. and misdirected. I would like to advise my colleagues that because of the great significance which should be attached to the development of such policy within the U.S.S.R.. I have directed that the National Ocean Policy Study undertake a major examination of Soviet ocean policy. This work will be ably coordinated by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress along with the NOPS staff. drawing upon the Nations most eminent scholars and experts in the field of Soviet ocean policy. This report should be available in January 1976. In addition. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I previously introduced S. 1173 which would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to effect three necessary reforms in Federal estate tax law. Specifically. my bill would increase Federal estate tax exemption. increase estate tax marital deduction. and provide an alternate method of valuing certain real property for estate tax purposes. The first of these reforms would increase the Federal estate tax exemption from $60.000 to $200.000. The $60.000 figure has been a part of the law for more than 30 years and the inflation we have experienced in that period warrants such an increase. I am pleased to note that several of my colleagues have also introduced bills to increase the Federal estate tax exemption to- give recognition to the effects of inflation. Further evidence of the effects of inflation on Federal estate tax was noted in an article in the Wall Street Journal of July 9. 1975. The article cited newly released IRS figures for 1972 which show 175.000 estate flings for estates exceeding $60.000. This is a 31percent increase over 1969. the last previous year studied. This is further evidence that the $60.000 exemption is no longer adequate in todays changing economy. I am hopeful that the Committee on Finance will act favorably on my proposal to increase the estate tax exemption when It considers the general subject of tax reform later in this Congress.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. taking a hard look at the future we can see that in addition to the energy crisis America also faces a shortage of mineral supplies. Such shortages would damage our economy and threaten the standard of living for the Nation as a whole. In view of the materials crisis. it would be folly for us to continue policies which in effect can deny our people the minerals needed for the public good. On Friday in Coeur dAlene. Assistant Secretary of the Interior Jack W. Carlson gave an excellent talk before the Idaho Mining Association regarding this problem. He pointed out that when we designate huge amounts of land as wilderness areas. we may be sealing off potential mineral reserves which will be desperately needed in the future. Worst of all is the fact that in some cases this may be done without knowing how much mineral potential is being sacrificed in the name of environmental protection. It seems to me that if we are to make rational decisions regarding the use of our public lands. we must know exactly what it is that we are doing. We should know what mineral potential is involved before we classify land in a category that precludes mining. Once we know what the mineral potential is. then we can balance this consideration against the desirability of taking the extreme action involved in wilderness classification. Mr. President. I support the idea that there are areas in our country which should be designated as wilderness and set aside so there is a minimum disturbance of nature. Some of these areas are within my own State. At the same time. it must be emphasized that what we are doing is to take land which often has several uses and restricting it to a single purpose which produces no tangible assets for most of the 213 million Americans. Mr. President. at a time when we are trying to make some important decisions regarding what our national priorities should be. this address by Mr. Carlson carries special significance. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the RECORD for the benefit of those Members of Congress who are deeply concerned over this problem.",

Reaping these potential benefits will call for continued technical advances in the area of ocean engineering. These advances are needed not only for achieving economic objectives. but also for protecting the ocean ecosystem and mitigating any adverse impacts that accompany development. Being chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and Atmosphere. I follow closely the activities of both the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and AtmosphereNACOAand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNOAA. Recently. after considerable study. a panel of NACOA proposed that an Institute for Engineering Research in the Oceans be established within NOAA. The Institute would coordinate the development of the rapidly growing field of ocean engineering. It would foster technical research in order to broaden the engineering alternatives for solving the problems of ocean resources management. The NACOA panel considered nine different existing Government entities as \"parent\" organizations within which to locate the new Institute. NOAA was recommended as being the most suitable agency to contain a new program whose focus is on better coordination of civilian ocean technology and management of ocean resources. With pleasure I call to the attention of my colleagues a recent article by David A. Katcher which appears in the June 1975 issue of the Marine Technology .Society Journal.

JR.. of Ohio. which appeared in yesterdays edition of the Washington Post. Congressman WHALEN. of whom I hold in very high esteem. outlined a very poignant case for the continuation and completion of negotiations with the Government of the Republic of Panama over a new Canal Zone Treaty. As Mr. WHALEN points out: The future of the Panama Canal may be one of the most explosive issues to confront the Western Hemisphere during this century... I concur in this observation. At issue is the future course of United StatesLatin American relations. in which we have a tremendous stake. and the narrow. somewhat dubious national claims we might lay to the Panama Canal as a sovereign entity of this Nation. As Congressman WHALEN astutely notes. however. even the issue of sovereignty is in dispute. Conclusion of a new treaty is expected within the next few months. Yet the negotiating principles already have come under sharp congressional attack. In the mistake notion that the HayBunauVarilla Treaty accords sovereignty to the United States in the Canal Zone (as early as 1904 our government recognized that Panama remained the titular sovereign there). legislative critics argue that the proposed treaty represents a \"giveaway.\" The distinguished Congressman also points out that if we do not succeed in arriving at a new treaty relationship with the Republic of Panama. the Canal Zone most probably will be the target of uncontrollable violence as unrestrained nationalism will once again rear its head as it has periodically since 1958. He notes: ... the Canal Zone could be rendered inoperable. It is vulnerable to sabotage. Further. ship owners may be reluctant to route their vessel through the Canal where they would be \"sitting ducks\" for terrorists activities. As our distinguished negotiator. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. has reminded us on numerous occasions. the United States is negotiating to protect our interests on the Panama Canal. Our interests will be seriously jeopardized if such a treaty is not agreed upon between our two nations. Congressman WHALExNS article is an invaluable contribution to the debate within the Congress over a new Panama Canal Treaty. I would urge my colleagues to devote considerable attention to his wellthoughtout presentation on behalf of a new treaty. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the RECORD.",

His optimism rests on the lessons of history and the hope that all countries adopt policies providing for research and incentive for agicultural production. Dr. Johnson observes that in 193539. grain production per acre was almost identical for the developing and industrial countries. Since this time a large disparity has developed. Throughout most of the recorded history of mankind. most of the worlds population has been but one poor crop away from disaster and suffering. Dr. Johnson believes that we have the ability to correct this situation. The world has the capacity in terms of intellectual and natural resources to improve the per capita food supply of the worlds poorer people. The issue is: Do we have the resolve? To improve the food production in developing countries. Dr. Johnson recommends that the world increase agricultural research. improve the availability of supply inputs. provide peace in the Middle East and develop food policies that provide incentive for developing nations. Dr. Johnsons thoughts add new perspective to the onandoff concern that both developing and developed nations give to food needs. Perhaps. as he observes. one of the major defects of efforts to expand food production is the inability to undertake a longrun effort and maintain it consistently.

As Senator Ralph Yarborough cautioned: The people need to be informed now. because at the end of five years they are going to be asking who voted this burden on their backs. We have now had 5 years of postal reform and the American people are indeed clamoring to know who voted this burden on their backs. I am one of the guilty ones. I voted for that reform package in 1970. I made a mistake. Congress made a mistake. It is time we owned up to it. I would like to share with my colleagues a resolution agreed upon today by the national board of the National League of Postmasters. The resolution calls for a return of the postal purse strings and accountability of the postal management to the people. objectives contained in the Housepassed postal reform bill.

The veto was a tragic mistake and should be overridden. We in Congress tend to measure the success of Federal Government programs in terms of dollars and cents. an analysis which ignores the broader human and social service needs those programs are intended to fulfill. The child day care center program and legislation is an example in point. But. in this case the Presidential veto ignores both the fiscal soundness and the service to human and social needs which this program has provided. The St. Louis County. Minn.. Welfare Board conducted a study of the cost of three day care centers in Duluth. Minn. The study covered 150 families and 213 children served by those centers. Thanks to the availability of day care. the parents earned over threequarters of a mililon dollars a year. more than double the Federal contribution toward the operation of those three day care centers. Not only did day care service give those people an opportunity to be selfrespecting. productive members of society. it also helped get them off the welfare rolls and on the tax rolls. Without day care. 138 of those families would return to welfarea tragedy both in lost human dignity and loss to the economy. I doubt very much that the President has ever considered the value of day care in the human context. but whether you consider it in human terms or economic terms. all of society comes out a winner. I hope tomorrows vote to override will make us all winners. The St. Louis County report follows: REPORT TO ST. Lous COUNTY WELFARE BOARD",

One of the best features that has been helping clean out some of that inventory has been the tax credit. There are fullpage ads. and I can say it has stimulated some newspaper ads. It stimulated a lot of buying. stimulated a lot of real estate people to go out and try to get people to put their money in. That has paid off some in my State. I cannot say about any other State. but this provision has been one of the best things we got out of the last tax bill. Then it took a while before we could correct it. because we had some kind of problem as to whether the property had ever been sold at a lower price. We got that corrected. When we did that. if we say there was a slight effect as it started. much of that is because there was a hiatus time in there and people did not know whether they could use this plan or not. It is working well in my State. I should like to see it extended. because I can say it is helping make jobs for the people in the State of Florida. I do not think it is costing dollars.

One of the ardent advocates was the gentleman from Massachusetts . I asked him after the debate whether he was personally acquainted with the physical facts of the projects and he said he was. Subsequent to that. during the recess. the gentleman went up and saw the project. He came back and he was the chief advocate of this proposition. He had studied it and he was learned on that as a result of the job that he had on the Appropriations Committee to evaluate projects. There is no more knowledgeable person that the gentleman from Massachusetts as far as being able to judge and assess the project of which the gentleman has just spoken. Let me say this to the gentleman from Massachusetts. He says he has not been in the business of making analyses of projects. I have been in the business for 29 years of trying to evaluate the investment related to the profits to the U.S. Government. I will say to the gentleman today there has never been a proposal that was more consequential or of greater value than the one we have under consideration today. Mr. Chairman. we will have no difficulty in passing this proposition.",

Mr. Chairman. there Is one provision in this bill that is absolutely vital to my constituents In northeastern Pennsylvania and to the thousandsof tourists who come to the Delaware Water Gap area. I am referring to the appropriation of $4.6 million in funds to acquire the land and begin construction of U.S. Route 209 through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Mr. Chairman. the committee has agreed to provide funds to eliminate the worst traffic hazard in the entire Nation. One innocent victim is killed or injured every 48 hours here. because this 24foot wide road has inadvertantly become the link between two interstate highways84 and 80. Because huge truck haulers must commingle with tourists. schoolbuses. ambulances and emergency vehicles. we have here a tremendously dangerous situation. which unless corrected could lead to further loss of property and lives. The committee has wisely recognized the extent of this threat and given its approval to the Corps of Engineers to acquire the remaining land necessary to relocate 23 miles of Route 209 through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Once the land is acquired. construction of a safe. modern. fourlane highway. replacing the existing hazardous twolane road can begin. I believe that because of the tremendous Federal presence here. we have a Federal obligation to improve this road and protect property. Today the committee and the Congress are meeting that obligation. I am grateful for the tremendous cooperation of Chairman Evms. my colleague from Indiana . and all of the other members of the subcommittee who have expressed the willingness to solve this terrible problem.",

I want to commend both the subcommittee and the full committee. under the able leadership of the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Texas . I especially want to call the attention of my colleagues a matter of the utmost importance to my constituents of the Third District of Illinois. For years. the people of the southern suburbs of Metropolitan Chicago have lived with polluted conditions of the Little Calumet River. and we in Congress are finally in the position of being able to help them in their efforts to restore it to its once freeflowing state. The first phase of the cleanup would entail the removal of fallen trees. roots. waste. and other debris along a 12mile course of the river. The work would be carried out by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. which estimates the total cost for fiscal year 1976 and the transition quarter to be $290.000. Over 200.000 people reside in the 16 communities through which the Little Cal River flows. Through the formation of concerned citizen groups. many of these people have conducted several river clearing projects on their own. For the successful completion of this project. however. these citizens need the help of the Federal Government. Many beautiful rivers and lakes have been forever lost to us through our failure to act in time to save them from the effects of pollution. We must realize that it is imperative that we act now to restore the Little Calumet River while restoration is still a possibility. The benefits of having this river cleared of obstruction and debris will be numerous. Besides ending the obvious hazards to public health and safety. the waterway will once again be available for recreational use. By appropriating the necessary funds. the Congress will help the people of the Chicago area to take the first step toward restoring a once vibrant river as the lifeline of south suburban Cook County. I urge the House to realize its responsibility to the people of our society and their right to enjoy this natural resource in its Godgiven state.",

I regret that uncertainty remains on the problem of Canadian objections. Mr. Chairman. although there have been a host of charges and countercharges over many aspects of the Garrison unit project. I think that we should concentrate our consideration on two main areas: the long term and unchanged opposition by our best internationally allyCanada. Mr. Chairman. Canada first voiced doubts over the repercussions of the Garrison diversion in 1970. Since then. the Canadian equivalent of our Environmental Protection Agency has studied the potential polluting effects of the North Dakota irrigation system. and strongly questioned the impact on Canadian waters. The Canadian Parliament voted unanimously to seek a moratorium on the project. and numerous diplomatic exchanges have further illustrated the large concern of our Canadian neighbors. Canadians are concerned that the runoff waters from the Garrisons irrigated lands will pollute at least two rivers that flow into Canada. Despite American \"assurances.\" it appears that Canada presently has absolutely no guarantee that the Garrison system will not indeed pollute Canadian water. Mr. Chairman. it is my hope that future funding for the Garrison project will be carefully reviewed to insure the protection of environmental interests and to determine if the benefitratio justifies the tremendous commitment of Federal funds.",

The committee has been advised that present plans are to underground test three toppriority. highyield weapons in this period. which are the B77 fullfusing weapon. the W78 Minuteman warhead. and a new MIRVtype warhead which is still experimental and being developed. They have also indicated that they would be testing three intermediate and lowyield types of weapons. Mr. Chairman. these tests are being held to the absolute minimum. It would be absolutely unthinkable. in my judgment. for this country. at this particular time. to sit back and let other nations around the world continue to develop new weapons and test them while we do nothing. We are not adding additional weapons to the arsenal. These weapons and testing proposed are replacements with a more sophisticated and safer type ol weapon. They are merely replacements. The nuclear material in the weapons being retired will be placed back into the system for fuel. and if these proposed weapons are not needed. the fuel will be taken back into the system and used for reactortype fuel. It is not really advocating a war position for this country at all. In fact. quite to the contrary. history has indicated that the stronger a nation is the more apt it is to maintain peace. This is an investment in our security. Testing is very much needed to improve the weapons. to make sure they are safe. and to replace some outdated weapons in our present arsenal.

It is through his broad knowledge and many contributions that so many Members of Congress have come to know DAVE and his important contribution to the making of our Federal statutes. The gentleman from North Carolina is not only a highly competent legislator. but also a very effective representative of the people in his constituency. He is known as a hardworking Congressman who listens carefully to the voices of the people. DAVID HENDERSONs contributions to this House are many and he has certainly earned a long and happy retirement.

DAVIDS retirement represents the loss of one of the most respected legislators to serve in the House. His departure further provokes a personal note of regret. since DAVID and I both joined the ranks of this great body at the beginning of the 87th Congress. DAVIDS hard work and commitment to serve his country. home State of North Carolina. and constituency are exemplified by his distinguished 16year service on the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee and as its chairman since 1975. He dedicated his efforts as chairman of the Subcommittee on Manpower and Civil Service to correcting the inequities encountered by civil servants employed by the Department of Defense. He sought to secure equitable pay and Job assignments for these civilians and effective and efficient utilization of their skills by the Department. As the principle author of the Federal Wage Board Act of 1972. DAVID led the charge to the first reform of the Federal Wage Board since the end of the Civil War. His tasks have not been easy ones. yet DAVID persevered to accomplish significant changes and reform. DAVIDS outstanding contributions in the fields of aviation and economic development through his assignment to the House Public Works and Transportation Committee add yet another dimension to his distinguished service record. It has been a great honor and privilege to serve with DAVID for the past 16 years. and to gain his respect and friendship. DAVID will be missed by all who have known and worked with him over the years. I wish him the best of everything in his future endeavorsyears of happiness. contentment. and good health.",

I appreciate the gentleman yielding and providing me an opportunity to express in my humble way the great amount of esteem I have for two of the most conscientious Members of the HouseRoy TAYLOR and DAVE HENDERSON. In their respective areas of legislative Jurisdiction. both of these gentlemen have contributed to progressive legislation that has benefited their constituents and the people of America. They have never been content to simply serve as chairmen of their committees and subcommittees. but rather they have always acted and worked in a manner that has brought distinction to themselves and the Congress. For one State to lose the services of two such dedicated public servants at the same time is indeed a blow. But the people of North Carolina must also feel a great sense of pride in the fact that they made it possible for DAVEHENDERSON and RoY TAYLOR to serve their State and Nation. Mr. Speaker. I have not envied DAVID HENDERSON his position as chairman of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee because I know of the many problems and frustrations he has faced in trying. to bring order to a chaotic postal system. However. because of his leadership we have seen the enactment of legislation just recently that hopefully will provide good mail service at reasonable rates. This has been no small task and we all owe Chairman HENDERSON a vote of thanks for his hard work in this area. One can go to any State in this great Nation of ours to see the results of the good work and dedication of RoY TAYLOR. All of our people can be thankful for the vast improvement of our national park system under the guiding hand of Roy. He has not been contented to rely on staff reports on proposals to expand the Nations parks. He has gone to the areas himself to get a firsthand feel for the situation. As a result of this personal interest. the people of America now have an additional 4 1/2 million acres of parkland to enjoy. Mr. Speaker. I feel quite grateful to have been able to serve with Roy TAYLOR and DAVE HENDERSON. They have been an inspiration to me and I shall always be thankful for the advice they have so freely given over the years. I wish them the. very best in the years to come.",

In this space before I have told of merchant directories. education days and group discount plans. all of which are causing cash discounts to be offered on a more widespread basis than ever before. I was further gratified this past weekend to notice that a D.C. area business has taken the initiative here by using cash discounts as a major promotional vehicle. When the Market Tire Co. decided recently to have a sale in anticipation of large increases in tire prices resulting from the current rubber strike. they could see the promotional possibilities of offering a 5percent discount to any customer who pays cash. The cash discounted price of each tire is listed in the newspaper ads that the company is running. One salesman estimated that in his location alone. some 50 percent of all of those who wanted to charge the new tires thought twice upon hearing about the discount offer and then decided to pay cash. He mentioned the fact that the credit card company charges between 4 percent and 7 percent on every tire he sells by credit card and therefore. by offering cash discounts he can \"pass the savings on to the consumer without it costing his business anything.\"",

Pomfila stunned everyone by reading with considerable fluency and demonstrating a vocabulary of over 400 different words. When Pomfila was a year old. her parents had her tested and were told by doctors that the child had the abilities of at least a 3yearold child. She could even work puzzles and draw a straight line.

She can distinguish the differences between Ajax and Comet. Tide and Breeze. and many similar brands. Mr. Speaker. I am told that she can even remember the names of every person to whom she is introduced. a feat which we politicians have attempted to master for years. The extraordinary talents of this child have been recognized by one of the leading newspapers in Ohio. the Cleveland Call and Post. She has also been cited by the Cleveland City Council and the Ohio House of Representatives. Because of her considerable abilities. the doctors have asked the family not to push Pomfila too much. Recently. they have started to give her books and other educational reading materials. Prior to this time.

Many electronic and heavy equipment firms that operate in Massachusetts. after raising some questions about the advisability of the Massachusetts law. raised no objections to its passage by the legislature.

As such it was admittedly important. for it constituted a long overdue recognition of the evil nature of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. and hence a major step forward for blacks and whites alike. But symbols cannot generate hope forever. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights wrote in a 1974 report. that the Brown case was \"instrumental in generating legitimate expectations among minorities and women\" for opportunities in education and the economic field. The deprivation which has followed in the wake of these expectations has resulted in the violence of the 1960s and now. in a profound dissatisfaction with the American political system. Our Bicentennial celebration has been a time for remembering many symbols. and the 1954 decision. no less than any others. stands as a monument to hoW far we have come and how far we have yet to go. We must not forget our obligation to carry out the spirit of this decision still today and thereby insure the right of all our citizens to full educational opportunities.

Also. the Kissinger proposal would permit the Soviets to deploy their new Backfire supersonic bomber without counting it in the limit. This proposal has been strongly opposed by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. What alarms me most. however. is that it is reported that President Ford is siding with Kissinger and the State Department over the advice of Secretary Rumsfeld. This agreement. if finalized. would eliminate the cruise missile as a supplement to the U.S. Strategic Triada supplement we badly need in light of the advantages given to the Soviet Union in the 1972 SALT accord by Dr. Kissinger. Furthermore. it is a terrible mistake. I think. to allow the Soviets to deploy the Backfire bomber without having to count it in the ceiling agreed to. Most noteworthy and disturbing is that the details of this agreement are being kept quiet until after the Republican National Convention next week. It is obvious that if the American people and the delegates to the Convention were to know what is going on in the SALT negotiations. it would be a tremendous boost to Gov.

Mr. Huey reports on the uncertainty of the present situation. It would appear that improvement has taken place at some of the grain elevators which previously had serious inspection problems. The article makes clear. however. that the current legislative uncertainty needs to be resolved in order to provide some permanent reforms of the system. The Senate and the House conferees have been meeting informally to resolve the differences of their two bills. I am hopeful that a satisfactory compromise can be achieved. I am disappointed that the administration has shown so little interest or initiative in this area. and the Congress has continually had to lead in this area. Mr. President.

Schellhardt. focuses our attention on a point many of us concerned with the preservation of competitive business practices tend to overlookthat most pricefixing activity occurs locally and regionally. rather than on a national scale. An interesting fact is that most of the pricefixing cases in the last few years have been instances of regional price fixing. not national cases. Most importantly. the Justice Department has been getting help from employees in the Departments efforts to expose and bring criminal cases. This aid is attributed to more public awareness of criminal responsibility because of Watergate. While it is disturbing to note that small business is so deeply involved in pricefixing. It is heartening to see a positive feedback from the Watergate trauma.. Leaders are human and err. whether in politics or business. It is a good point to remember. Mr. President.

PAUL FANNIN. and the word. integrity. are almost synonymous. Those of us who have worked with him know that if he says he is with you. you can count on his loyalty. He has given his utmost to his Senate careerhe has a voting record of 89.22 percent. He is ranking Republican on the Senate Interior Committee. second ranking on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Joint Economic Committee. He has labored intensively in the fields of energy and finance and is generally considered an authority in both of these areas.

I am pleased to report that the Environmental Protection Agency has today formally announced final guidelines for a returnable beverage container system on Federal property similar to laws now in effect in Oregon and Vermont and to legislation which I have sponsored in the U.S. Senate. Based on a 5cent refundable deposit on all bottles and cans containing soft drinks or beer. this returnable program is expected to save up to 2.000 barrels of oil per day with annual savings of materials estimated at 6.000 tons of aluminum. 24.000 tons of steel. and 80.000 tons of glass. The experience of Yosemite National Park. which I have discussed in earlier remarks to my colleagues. is indicative of the kind of success a program of this kind can achieve. Contrary to those who maintain that bottle bills and guidelines such as the ones adopted today will ban the can. I would like to point out that at Yosemite. where most of the beer and soft drinks are sold in cans. a 7percent return rate on containers has been reached. leading to the weekly recycling of more than 1 ton of aluminum cans. I applaud this action by Russell Train and the Environmental Protection Agency as being the most significant step since passage of bottle bills in both Oregon and Vermont toward implementing a national system of returnable beverage containers. Perhaps with the continuing success witnessed in these two States. along with the new EPA guidelines and additional studies by agencies of the Federal Government. critics of legislation such as my Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act will finally realize how effective a program of this kind can be in ending the \"throwaway ethic\" which is such a drain on our valuable energy and natural resources.

Nowhere is the evidence for this conclusion more compelling than in the field of energy. In the words of Alan Reynolds: There is no energy problem. There is just another problem of government regulation. Mr. President. I wish to call the attention of my colleagues to an excellent speech analyzing our Nations Governmentcaused energy crisis made recently by Alan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds is a vice president of the First National Bank of Chicago. He was formerly senior economist with the Argus Research Corp. in New York. Before that he was a contributing editor in economics with National Review. Articles by Mr. Reynolds have appeared in many journals. including the New York Times. The Wall Street Journal and the Marvard Business Review. In a paper prepared for delivery at Hillsdale College in Michigan. Mr. Reynolds documented the disastrous consequences that Federal price controls. environmental regulations. allocation and \"entitlements\" programs and other FEO and FEA policies have had upon Americas energy situation. In the view of Mr. Reynolds and other leading economists. Federal policies have worsened our energy problems by exacerbating domestic shortages. increasing our dependence on costly foreign reserves and frustrating our national goal of energy selfsufficiency. Mr. Reynolds scholarly statement was delivered in a seminar held by the Center for Constructive Alternatives at Hillsdale College. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of his paper. \"The Federal Energy Agencies: The Solution or the Problem?\" be printed in the RECORD as it appeared in the September 1976 edition of Imprimis. a publication of Hillsdale College.",

I would like to continue my statement by saying that the doctrine of parens patriae necessarily includes accountability. and accountability is not served by contingent fee contracts. Law firms should not be permitted to approach States with a norisk contract. by means of which the law firm gains control of the case. The primary interest of a firm employed under such a contract would not be in protecting the interests of the citizens of the State. but in whether or not it gains a fee from the rendition of services. Parens patriae actions brought on behalf of a State should be the responsibility of the State attorney general. who is accountable to the electorate. and such cases should remain under the State attorney generals control. I believe that States can and should develop the resources and capabilities to represent the States legal interests wherever needed. I do not believe that only the largest States need or can afford such a legal capability within the State attorney generals office. The State of Arkansas has demonstrated that a State can develop its own effective antitrust legal resources. Where needed. a State attorney general can draw on the advice and assistance of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justitce. Where needed. he can also hire outside members of the private antitrust bar. on an hourly or per diem basis. out of the resources of the State. to assist the State in handling unusual situations requiring specialized expertise. States should develop their own inhouse legal capabilities. and hire any needed assistance by outside lawyers on a definite and specific hourly rate or dollar compensation basis out of the States resources. based on the attorney generals responsible professional judgment as to the merits and prospects of a case.

I find myself once again compelled to vote against the conference report on Senate Concurrent Resolution 139. the second concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1977. The original raison detre. of course. for adopting the congressional budget process was to establish more acceptable and realistic budgetary goals and priorities for our Nation. Unfortunately. this laudable objective has not been realized. Congress. too. appears to have fallen into the trap of labeling \"sacrosanct\" programs for the military and \"expendable\" programs designed to deal with our urgent social needs. Once again. the tail is wagging the dog. . Mr. Speaker. I am aware of the fact that the committee has an exceedingly difficult task in bringing about an acceptable and workable balance between our resources and needs. I sincerely hope that by the time it considers the next budget resolution. it will attain this difficult goal. In the meantime. I must once again cast a \"no\" vote for the budget.",

Today ought to be an occasion for celebration. Today Members of Congress could and should be showing concern for the future of this Nation by adopting the lower spending targets that would promote the economic wellbeing of America. But instead of reflecting restraint. this budget calls for an outlay deficit of over $50 billion for fiscal 197677. for budget authority $89 billion above revenues and raises the national debt to $700 billiona travesty of the responsible budgeting which Congress promised the Nation when the new process was established a year ago. By legislating a deficit of such stupendous proportions. Congress forces the Nation to risk renewed inflation. unemployment and declining productivity and economic sluggishness which have become depressingly familiar in recent years.

Every year American agriculture is buffeted by a sometimes fickle mother nature. The blizzards of last winter annihilated thousands of cattle and left many producers reeling at the brink of bankruptcy. The recent torrential floods in the Red River Valley have not only destroyed this years crops. but they demolished entire farms. Much the same sort of crisis has occurred in Maiyland and Virginia in the past 2 weeks on a somewhat smaller scale. While some disasters are more dramatic than others. the hardships for the individual producer who has lost his crops. livestock. and the results of a lifes work is the same in a $5 million disaster as in one of the $100 million magnitude. It is impossible for anyone or any program to totally alleviate this suffering or replace the lossesbut they can be minimized. It is. therefore. of paramount importance that our disaster programs be rapid in application and adequate in scope so as to reduce to a minimum human suffering and economic losses. Mr. President.

Hyman Rickover. First it was Admiral Holloways attack before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the issue of the Navys shipbuilding budget. Now. today. it is a fresh and even more hysterical attack by Navy civilian Gordon Rule in the Washington Post on the matter of settling almost $2 billion in pending shipbuilders claims against the Navy. I am not one who believes that Admiral Rickover is infallible. He can no doubt make mistakes like the rest of us. But his track record over the past 30 years has been phenomenal. and I daresay he has done more for the Navy than any other man or woman alive today. What troubles me most is that neither Admiral Holloway nor Mr. Rule has bothered to address any of the crucial and complex issues involved. All they have done Is to pull rank. tell him to shut up and follow the Navy party line. This is unworthy of any top Navy officer or civilian. And in any case it will not work with Congress. which ultimately will have the final say on both questions. We intend to listen to the arguments and get the full facts. whether the Navy or the Defense Department likes it or not. The decision to launch this \"get Rickover\" campaign while Congress is still deciding the fate of the Navys budget is. In my judgment. a very grave error which both the Navy and the administration will come to regret.",

Early this year I received a touching letter from Marks mother who resides in Haifa. Israel. It was in September of 1975 that I adopted Mark as my second \"prisoner of conscience\" and his mother wrote to thank interested Members of Congress who are seeking the release of Jews from Soviet prisons. A portion of her poignant letter reads as follows: The heads of governments have signed in Helsinki the document which gives the citizens of the world the right to join their families. and the right to freedom. But the Kremlin does not follow the terms of the Helsinki Accord. Why does the free world keep quiet about this? All our pleas to the Soviet Union. to Brezhnev.

He did not receive a commission in the U.S. Army after successfully completing the West Point curriculum. The reason for this. we understand from national network television. is that Cadet Peter Burke is a victim of Hodgkins disease. The disease was diagnosed somewhere along in his first or second year at West Point. but there was reportedly a remission. and Cadet Burke was permitted to go on with his studies. Now. after having invested 4 years of his life at the Academy. in the expectation of serving his country as an officer in its Armed Forces. Cadet Burke is denied a commission. Mr. Speaker. Peter Burke Is not a resident of my congressional district. I never met this young man. nor do I know his parents.

Since Turkeys invasion of the island in 1974. little has changed. the refugees remain homeless. the island remains divided. and Turkish troops have entrenched their occupation of northern Cyprus. .Two years of Turkish intransigence has. not only prolonged the tragedy on Cyprus. but it has also undermined all efforts- to achieve a negotiated settlement. Indeed. commitments and obligations assumed by the Turkish authorities. as a result of intercommunal agreements or understandings. have been broken at will. Nothing illustrates this more perhaps than the flagrant and continuing violations by Turkish authorities of the intercommunal agreements concluded in Vienna a year ago. The agreements were in part a quid pro quo: th*e CypriotTurks living in governmentcontrolled areas in the South would be allowed to go to the occupied areas under United Nations auspices if the CypriotGreeks living in the occupied North were allowed to remain and live normal lives under U.N. protection. The record shows that the Government of Cyprus expeditiously and humanely carried out its obligations under the Vienna agreements and permitted the free departure to the North of all CypriotTurks who wished to leave. But Turkish authorities have broken every principle of human decency by harassing. mistreating. and expelling CypriotGreeks living in the occupied areas. Out of some 11.000 to 12.000 CypriotGreeks who were living in the North at the time of the invasion. little more than 5.000 still remain. And those that do continue to be harassed.

    "speech": "Mr. President. opponents of the Genocide Convention have often expressed concern over the meaning of the phrase \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide.\" especially as it relates to the first amendments freedom of speech guarantees. However. actions constituting direct and public incitement to commit genocide cannot be construed as an exercise of free speech. Rather. there is a clear line between protected speech and the prohibition of the convention against direct and public incitement. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this distinction in the 1969 case of Brandenburg against Ohio: The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. (395 U.S. 444.) This decision refutes those critics who insist that direct and public incitement to commit lawless actions is protected by the Constitution. The act of genocide is a most tragic and final end to the exercise of free speech. Certainly the Jews in Nazi Germany did not have the opportunity to exercise freedom of speech. Furthermore. genocide violates not only an individuals rights but the rights of an. entire group. The Genocide Convention does not seek in any way to inhibit or prevent freedom of speech. It does attempt to inhibit and prevent the tragic act of genocide. In doing this it is necessary to In.elude \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\" as a punishable act. an act which in no way can be construed as a protected exercise of free speech. As a small step forward in protecting -the free speech of all peoples. we must ratify the Genocide Convention. SUGAR",

This amendment saves some half a million dollars a year. When we see excess waste and see people reading books instead of operating elevators. and sitting in front of the elevator instead of in the elevator. we ought to have the courage to clean the situation up ourselves. I think this is a reasonable amendment. because we still end up with some 90 operators. we are saving some 62 positions. My guess is. if anything. that is still a little fat. but I think it is a good start and a fair proposal. I think we must look at ourselves. I think when we have a $100.000 investment per elevator we ought to be able to show the taxpayers that they are getting some savings in return for that hundred thousand dollars. It seems to me this is a good place to do it. So I do not normally differ with my chairman. I respect his leadership and judgment. and in 98 percent of the cases we do agree.

Certainly in the Dirksen Senate Office Building there is absolutely no reason for a person or persons to be at the basement level. pushing a button for Senators when they step from the elevator. I offer this further suggestion: We may not realize it. but I think many of our constituents who come to Washington. D.C.. would like very much not to see a regimentation of elevator operators or other employees of the Capitol and the Senate office buildings. but they would like to see jackets worn by those persons operating the elevators. say a blue or a red jacket. Our persons who are giving the guided tours here have distinctive jackets that they wear. I am not now for dressing up someone just for dressing up that person. But I think it would help. It would identify.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today we have taken another major step in the new budget control process as the Budget Committee has reported out for the first time a second concurrent resolution on the budget. While the first concurrent resolution adopted last May established spending \"targets\" for fiscal year 1976. the significance of the second concurrent resolution is that it establishes spending \"ceilings\" for fiscal year 1976. Once adopted. these ceilings become legally binding limits on Federal spending for fiscal year 1976. Thus we are taking another step in the process in gaining control of Federal spending not only for fiscal year 1976 but also the transition quarter which follows. The second concurrent resolution provides for the following totals: First. Revenues of $300.8 billion. Second. Budget authority of $406.2 billion. Third. Outlays of $375.6 billion. Fourth. Deficit of $74.8 billion. and Fifth. A public debt ceiling of $623.2 billion. -These recommended totals were derived from months of analysis. hearings and other efforts by committee members and staff. While the budget authority. outlay and deficit numbers are higher than many of us would have preferred. most of the growth in spending since the first resolution derives from increases in entitlement and other existing programs rather than from new spending initiatives. Many of these entitlement program increases are directly related to the state of the economy such as unemployment compensation. food stamps. medicare. medicaid and veterans benefits. On balance. we believe that the totals in this resolution. give us a basis for continued economic recovery without a reoccurrence of double digit inflation. Fiscal discipline is a challenging project and the budget represented by the second concurrent resolution will necessitate continued restraint on the part of the Senate in every category of spending. This is a tight budget with no room for slippage and I urge my colleagues to continue their assistance in this historic effort.",

In addition. his career encompassed the leadership of one of our Federal Governments most important regulatory agenciesthe Securities and Exchange Commissionand the authorship of numerous books. Justice Douglas has. to put it mildly. never been timid about speaking when he perceives injustice. I was amused to read a comment attributed to Justice Black who. after working with him for many years. remarked that the first cry Justice Douglas uttered when he was born \"must have been a protest against something he saw at a glance was wrong or unjust.\" For three decades. Justice Douglas has been recognized as the great champion on the Supreme Court of individual rights. particularly of free speech.

It was my great privilege to serve in this body for some 15 years with Clint Anderson. and I certainly shared in large measure the deep respect and affection which all those who knew him well. had for him. Clinton Anderson first came to Congress as a Member of the House in 1941. He was twice reelected and served in the House until June. 1945. when he resigned to become Secretary of Agriculture in President Trumans Administration. In that capacity he was an advocate of the Marshall Plan of aid for postwar Europe. and time has certainly proven the wisdom of his stand. In 1948. Clint Anderson was elected to the Senate. He was subsequently reelected three times and served a total of 24 years before retiring in January. The interests to which Senator Anderson devoted his considerable energy were varied. and his accomplishments were many. Many remember him best for his pioneering efforts. through the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. to advance the application of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes. In addition. as chairman of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. he was an enthusiastic backer of the space program. Furthermore. he was one of the leading supporters of the often unorthodox views of Vice Adm. Hyman Rickover. a man whose vision has now been proven to have been most farsighted indeed. Mr. President. I think my own strongest memories of Clinton Anderson involve his sponsorship of one of the most farreaching and compassionate legislative programs ever enacted by Congressmedicare. Throughout the early 1960s. Clint persistently tried to enact legislation that would provide health care for the elderlya cause that was at that time controversial. to say the least. Finally. in 1965. he coauthored a bill that formed the basis for the medicare program enacted later that year. Throughout his life. Clinton Anderson suffered from ill health which included tuberculosis. Parkinsons disease. and diabetes. But he never allowed these great obstacles to stand in his way. and his outstanding achievements are all the more memorable for that. I know that all of us who knew and worked with Clint Anderson are deeply saddened by his death. and Mrs. Williams joins me in expressing our most heartfelt sympathy to his wife.

Those figures were prepared by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of the Committee. I think they are very illuminating. Mr. President. With respect to the appropriations cuts in the last few years. they will confirm the statements that I made in my remarks a few moments ago. In this years appropriation. Mr. President. it is significant to note that while we are cutting more than $7 billion from the military. the other agencies of Government are presently over the budget by $2.437.100.000. The Defense Department is bearing the brunt of the cuts. For example. Mr. President. in table G which we placed in the RECORD. there is information. as compiled not by the staff of the Appropriations Committee but by the Congressional Budget Office. showing where the increases in the cost of government have come from during the past 10 years. I have covered these in my remarks. Mr. President. but I urge my colleagues to examine these tables. They are accurate so far as I know. They confirm what I have been saying to this body year after year during the past 3 or 4 years. National Defense spending during the past 10 years. Mr. President. has increased only 65 percent. whereas the costs of other Government agencies have gone up between 100 percent to more than 1.000 percent. So it is not the military.

The Appropriations Committee has tried to work in good faith. under the original first concurrent resolution. Under those limitations. and with respect to budget authority. we were able to hold down budget authority and be under target. But when it comes to expenditures. it Is far more difficult to reduce the outlays to within that target limitation without doing violent serious injury. in our judgment. to the military establishment. The Senator pointed out that he receives information late from the President. It causes him to have to make readjustments. If we had the target proposed by the Budget Committee in the second resolution that the Senators committee reported last night. it would have made our work much easier. We make every effort to try to cooperate. I am concerned. and I will continue to be. about trying to get some control of expenditures.

This would represent a fourth nuclearpowered aircraft carrier to follow CVN70. the U.S.S. Carl Vinson. The Navy did not originally request this carrier this year. however. the $350 million was included in a fiscal year 1977 budget amendment in the amount of $1.2 billion transmitted to the Senate on May 10. 1976. after the President lost the Texas primary. The amendment arrived too late for consideration by the House. The Navy estimates that this carrier will cost $1.9 billion. In my opinion. the initial funding of another large nuclearpowered attack carrier is premature. We are not certain at this time that the administration has in fact decided on whether or not large nuclearpowered carriers will be the most cost effective approach to naval air in the 1980s and beyond. The National Security Council and the Department of Defense are currently studying the future composition and size of our Navy for the 1980s and 1990s. This study has not been completed. This study could well recommend that smaller. less complex. and less costly carriers utilizing V/STOL aircraft technology is the way to go. The Navy has approximately $60 million in the fiscal year 1977 research and development budget for V/STOL aircraft development. We have only one shipyard capable of building a nuclearpowered aircraft carrier. This shipbuilder is seriously behind schedule in the construction of almost every Navy ship in his yard. including two nuclearpowered carriers. Furthermore. this shipbuilder is embroiled in a massive claims dispute with the Navy. and he has threatened to stop work on several nuclearpowered ships unless and until the claims are settled. Currently. the Navy has 13 aircraft carriers In the fleet. The Navy has not reduced this number. even though the Secretary of Defense directed a couple of years ago that the number of aircraft carriers be reduced to 12. In addition. we learned this year that the Navy plans to extend the service lives of several of the current aircraft carriers by 10 years or more. This plan should eliminate the need for funding an additional carrier at this time. until we are able to assess the results of the National Security Council study on the future size and composition of our Navy.

Long lead funding for CVN71. the fourth Nimitzclass carrier. was recommended by the President after an assessment of future naval force level requirements by the National Security Council. The issue is the balance and number of forces required for the future. Twelve deployable major carriers are planned for the future. The $350 million long leadtime funding is timely in maintaining 12 deployable carriers into the 1990s. CVN71 is the nominal replacement for U.S.S. Midway which will have been in service for 40 years when replaced. Even with the CVN71. the Forrestalclass carriers will have to be extended in service well beyond the 30 years they were expected to serve in order to maintain 12 deployable carriers into the 1990s. Denial of the $350 million now. will delay the delivery date of CVN71 1 year. to October 1985. and will increase the end cost of the ship about $178 million. Additionally. there is serious concern that nuclear propulsion plant component manufacturers will have to shut down or divert to other work and delay the delivery greater than 1 year and increase costs to as much as $200 million. I urge defeat of the amendment. We have a global responsibility. We are spread thin worldwide. The Russians are improving their naval power year by year. Trends in the naval balance over the past 10 years have seen the United States shift from unquestioned superiority to a position in which the U.S.S.R. is favored in many areas.

It Is recognized that it is not of significance in a strategic sense. This is an. area where the Soviets have no strength. They have no equivalent to. any of our attack carriers. They have one medium carrier and one more. I believe. under construction.. So it. is not an area where we are responding to a Soviet threat. What we have been told we should be concerned about is that the Soviet Union has been building a navy with a great many ships and we are told we are falling behind because of this. Thus. a year from now a decision might be made to go for more ships and for less expensive carriers that will not end up costing us $3 or $4 billion apiece.",

Furthermore. during the Yom Kippur war we learned we cannot always rely on those air bases being always available to us. For the foreseeable future. therefore. the aircraft carrier will be the principle offensive striking arm of the Navy for providing the tactical air power beyond the range of land bases and in the event the use of available land bases is denied to us. As we continue the present trend toward fewer carriers. this increases the number and types of airplanes the remaining carriers must accommodate. Therefore. our carriers must remain large in size and highly complex until we are able to perfect and introduce into the fleet optimum V/STOL fighterattack aircraft. which is the kind of aircraft that the Russians are putting on the small carriers they are currently building. A viable V/STOL aircraft. with the capability we think is necessary. is many years away. .

In all of the Navy organization. there is no other mechanism by which the community can work in concert with the Navy in full partnership for the efficiency and betterment of our national defense. The Navy district provides coordination for virtually all local government. civic and social group concerns. By representing the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations. each commandant is the main line of communication between the community and the military. The naval districts relieve force commanders from the necessity of maintaining individual community relations staffs. staffs which would perform overlapping functions in areas with a great many separate commands. They eliminate confusion within the civilian community in deciding which force or unit to contact to request action or assistance. Should the naval districts be disestablished and the functions reassigned and distributed to other staffs. two results can be assured: those commands with primary responsibility for specific fleet or national security functions would be impeded. and various city and county agencies would find it more difficult to obtain required planning and assistance coordination so necessary for any communitys continued growth. In my home district of San Diego. the Commandant of the 11th Naval District performs innumerable functions. among which are: to act as the primary point of contact and liaison between community officials and the Navy. to serve as the Emergency/Disaster Coordinator with the community. coordinates Navy real estate transactions and negotiations with local comnimunity and real estate officials. coordinates environmental plans and control actions with local and regional regulatory agencies. coordinates the Navy shore patrol as an adjunct to local law enforcement agencies. and serves as Admiralty Claims Review Official in relationship with local residents.

The objective of this sectionwhich is section 132 in the billis to insure that students have sufficient information about financial assistance and the institutions they select. and to be intelligent consumers in the educational marketplace. By providing for such information. it will help reduce the abuses associated with student aid programs. Avoidance of abuse is the purpose of Senator PERCYs amendment. I should like to quote briefly from the committee report. on page 31: The Committee believes that students and prospective students can make intelligent choices about financing their education only if they have sufficient information. For many young people. education after high school represents the largest expenditure they have ever made. The Committee has also found that some students undertake obligations. particularly in student loan programs. without full knowledge of their responsibilities. Testimony before the Committee and before the Senate Committee on Government Operations indicates abuses have entered these programs partially due to lack of information by participants. Complete disclosure and understanding of students rights and responsibilities in participating under Federal aid programs should result in a reduction of the abuses. Another provision on improved fiscal responsibility will strengthen the administration of student aid by colleges and universities. It provides for standards as well as review of institutional aid activities. This also should insure that educational institutions participating in these Federal programs reflect the fiscal stability and administrative competence necessary to properly carry out these programs. The committee also provides that a student may not discharge in bankruptcy his guaranteed student loan obligation for a 5year period after his repayment period begins. This ensures that students will be held to the fiscal obligations they rightfully owe. I believe each of these measures adds worthwhile improvements in the same vein as the criminal sanctionsto witto stop abuses of these fine programs.

Mr. Frazer states: For every additional dollar we must spend on required federal paperwork. a cost currently estimated to be $2 billion. we must pass on at least 650 to our students. Yet. cost alone does not dictate that we must reduce the burden. Every additional demand for Federal paperwork means that colleges. universities. high schools. and elementary schools must either hire more personnel or shift professionally trained faculty into at least parttime administrative and paperwork duties. At a time when the quality of our Nations educational system is being seriously questioned. we can ill afford to have faculty members away from the classroom.

    "speech": "Mr. President. time and time again in recent years Democrats and Republicans have remarked that \"Harry Truman looks pretty good in the light of history.\" Indeed. he may have been one of our greatest Presidents. In addition to a capacity for great decisions. President Truman had perspective. He knew where we Americans had come from. and this knowledge influenced his view of where we ought to go. Further. he gave us many insights into the nature of the Presidency. I was reminded of these virtues and contributions when I recently discovered a column he wrote 11 years ago. His subject was the proper role of the Central Intelligence Agency. Truman as President appreciated the importance of having accurate and uptodate information on world affairs. He wanted \"a special kind of intelligence\" product that would not be slanted to suit the biases of any one executive department. So he signed the National Security Act establishing the CIA. A decade and a half later. Truman as private citizen was not happy with the agency he had set up to be \"the intelligence arm of the President.\" In calling for the termination of the covert operations side of the CIA. Mr. Truman cogently expressed some of the concerns that motivate us today as we go about establishing a select committee to investigate the intelligence agencies of our Government. He wrote: I never had any thought when I set up the CIA that it would be Injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations. Some of the complications and embarrassment ... we have experienced are in part attributable to the fact that this quiet intelligence arm of the President has been so removed from its intended role that it is being interpreted as a symbol of sinister and mysterious foreign intrigue . . . Harry Truman closed his article by reminding us. as did the majority leader in the Democratic Caucus of January 14. of the historic commitment of the American people to free Institutions and an open and decent society. Our ideals are a vital part of our reputation in the world as we go about our international business. We cannot ignore the costs of amorality. of violating this tradition. The practitioners of \"Realpolitik\" often do not seem to understand this. I ask unanimous consent that President Trumans remarks be printed in the RECORD.",

I knew Dick Wallace ever since he went to work for Senator Estes Kefauver in 1951. Throughout the years no one was more diligent and faithful than Dick in working for fruitfully cooperative relations between the nations of the Atlantic community. Formerly the Executive Director of the United States Citizens Commission on NATO. and SecretaryGeneral of the Atlantic Convention of NATO nations. Dick Wallace for the past 12 years headed the nongovernmental Atlantic Council in Its efforts on behalf of closer relations in the Atlantic area. He was a tower of strength to those of us in the Congress supporting a strong and progressive Atlantic community. He was a constant help to the U.S. delegations attending the NATO parliamentarians annual conferences. A graduate of Memphis State College. Dick Wallace received a law degree from Memphis State University. He then became a political reporter and editorial writer for the Memphis PressScimitar during the 1940s and early 1950s. He left this post twice. first to serve in the Armed Forces in World War II. receiving the Commendation Medal. and in 1950 to attend Harvard University. through selection as a Nieman Fellow. In 1951 he joined Senator Estes Kefauvers staff. serving as administrative assistant to Senator Kefauver from August 1951 to January 1959. During the Senators two campaigns for the Presidential nomination in 1952 and 1956 he worked as press secretary. I had the highest respect and admiration for Dicks outstanding professionalism and devotion to the undertakings he believed in. Mr. President. I wish to read Into the RECORD a copy of a resolution adopted by the Board of the Atlantic Council on The Board of Directors of the Atlantic Council of the United States: Deeply conscious of its debt to Richard J. Wallace for his farsighted practical wisdom. his kindly leadership. and for his dedicated and outstanding contributions toward closer relations between the nations of the Atlantic Community. Resolves to express In this form its gratitude and appreciation for his twelve years as Director General.",

Many individuals. some who ought to know better. feel obliged to pounce on every suspicion raised in the press. and proclaim them as evidence of the repressive nature of our system. These people are apparently unable to distinguish between the CIA and the KGB. and are unwilling to wait until all the evidence is in before passing judgment. Happily. there are cooler heads. I call the attention of the Senate to a column in the Sunday Washington Post by Mr. Joseph Kraft. certainly not to be confused with a kneejerk defender of militarism and espionage. As Mr. Kraft points out. the charges of \"massive\" illegalities do not stand up. further. the information on U.S. citizens which is in the files was collected pursuant to the legitimate activities of the Ceneral Intelligence Agency. as it went about the job given it by the Congress: that of overseeing antiAmerican activities conducted abroad. It may be that the CIA needs closer direction. and a more clearly defined mandate. but the legitimate goals of protecting our Nation against subversion will not be accomplished by uncritical acceptance of every charge raised against the intelligence agencies.

Bentons America is portrayed as abundant prairie lands. deep. sleepy rivers. muscled laborers. and rugged. rural faces set against seasons of struggle and harvest. He gave us insight into the way of life of farms and river towns. mountain music festivals. camp meetings. and the earthy side of political life. I commend to the attention of my colleagues a recent article about this great American. In reading it. I found that his work and his life have lessons for all of us. During the postwar years. Bentons work was increasingly bypassed as being \"embarrassingly overdrawn.\" Besides showing a proper Midwestern disdain for fads. trends. and assorted tastemakers. he did not think twice about changing his style. Benton stayed clear of closed circles. believing that an artist and his work were always better for remaining in the open and among others. The Benton legacy is a rich one. Not only are we the beneficiaries of Thomas Hart Bentons unique portrayal of an exciting segment of American life through his art. we fondly remember his namesake and great uncle. Missouris first U.S. Senator. the first among us to serve 30 consecutive years.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I was gratified with the scope and detail of the Presidents proposals last week on the economy. However. a good many of us have questioned the wisdom of increased budget deficits at this time of doubledigit inflation. In fact. some of the figures suggest that the austerity which has been in effect in recent months may be about to produce the desired reduction in inflation with an accompanying reduction in economic dislocation. The only justification for the deficits has been the overwhelming need to stimulate consumption. Before reliance Is placed on dangerous deficits. we must be clear that they will produce the desired results. In that connection. the columnists Evans and Novak report in the Sunday Post on some preliminary indications now becoming apparent. If these indications are borne out in the end. we will be saddled with burdensome deficits without any corresponding economic stimulation. In the final analysis. of course. all deficits must be paid for. either through taxation. borrowing. or inflation. As the junior Senator from New York pointed out in his statment on the state of the Union message last week: Government borrowing is already absorbing more than 60 percent of the funds available in our capital markets. Such borrowing makes capital formation difficult. dries up available savings funds. thus driving up interest rates. and causes additional business failures through siphoning off needed liquid capital. The transfer of funds from private capital markets to Government spending is a transfer of money from production to consumption. This point has been cogently made by George Will. another columnist. in the January 17 issue of the Post. I urge that Senators consider these implications of further deficits carefully before abandoning the fight against inflation. and I ask unanimous consent that the two newspaper columns referred to be printed in the RECORD.",

Durkin for the seat of U.S. Senator from New Hampshire. The uniqueness of this case is the absence of charges of fraud or illegalities. the key to it Is the closeness of the election results and the questionable judgment of the New Hampshire Ballot Law Commission. Mr. President. the Senate is faced with two sets of credentials for the Senate seat. both signed by the appropriate New Hampshire State officials. After an appeal to the New Hampshire State Ballot Law Commission. a recount was held. However. serious questions have been raised as to the validity of the commissions judgment and allegations of irregularities in the commissions recount only exacerbate an already difficult. delicate. and complex situation. The actions of the Senate in this case will be critical for the responibility of the Senate to act according to legal guidelines and not on the basis of partisan politics is at stake. An historical precedent Is being set. Hence it is imperative that we .proceed cautiously. fairly. and scrupulously. It is imperative that the letter of the law be followed. And the law is clear: the Constitution of the United States gives to the Senate and the Senate alone the authority to determine the qualifications and judge the credentials of its Members. New Hampshire law as well prescribes the U.S. Senate as the last appeal in a contested election. It is for these reasons. Mr. President. that I support the Mansfield resolution which calls for the Senate Rules Committee to investigate this case. recount the disputed ballots and make its recommendation to the full Senate. The New Hampshire elections were close but tlfe legal final body of review. the U.S. Senate. has not yet made the determination as to whether the election is too close to call. Until that decision is made another election in New Hampshire would be premature and set a dangerous precedent. Much is at stake. not only for the people of New Hampshire but also for the Nation. Clearly the fairest solution for all concerned is a thorough. nonpartisan investigation of the disputed ballots so that the full Senate may fulfill its constitutional obligation to judge the credentials of Its Members.",

Some 600.000 seniors are presently going without the care they need because of their coverage limitations. At the same time the 1 million who are in nursing homes have not received maximum help. in some cases they have encountered lifethreatening conditions and even physical abuse. Moreover. the report also criticizes limited efforts by the U.S. Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. In December. we published our first supporting paper. \"The Litany of Nursing Home Abuses and an Examination of the Roots of Controversy.\" The subcommittees supporting paper No. 1 reveals the following were the most important nursing home abuses: Negligence leading to death and injury. Unsanitary conditions. Poor food or poor preparation. Hazards to life or limb. Lack of dental care. eye care. or podiatry. Misappropriation and theft. Inadequate control of drugs. Reprisals against those who complain. Assault on human dignity. and Profiteering and \"cheating the system.\" The inevitable conclusion is that such abuses are far from \"isolated instances.\" They are widespread. Estimates of the number of substandard homesthat is. those in violation of one or more standards causing a lifethreatening situationvary from 30 to 80 percent. The subcommittee estimates at least 50 percent are* substandard with one or more lifethreatening conditions.

I would like to say that I am pleased with the compromises we reached with our colleagues in the Senate and Pleased with the substance of the conference committee report we are considering today. There is one matter. however. which I think needs clarification. I refer to the language on page 14 of the Senate report which sets aside $15 million for new commitments to Indian housing. There was no language on this subject in the original House report and. of course. nothing in the bill. H.R. 8070. itself. Because the House approved the total $662 million of contract authority. which included the $15 million for Indian housing. the subject of a setaside for Indian housing was not discussed in the conference and does not appear in the conference report. It is my understanding that. in this case. the Senate report language provides a -clear indication of legislative intent that $15 million is indeed earmarked for Indian housing. The Senate recognized that HUD has misinterpreted the Indian setaside provision in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 by using the setaside to meet old commitments. dating back to 1969. The need for new commitments for Indian housing is undeniable since over 70 percent of the housing on Indian reservations is substandard. This is why the Senate specified that $15 million be used specifically for that purpose. It is also why both the Senate and the Ilouse overwhelmingly approved an Indian amendment to the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 (H.R. 4485. subsequently vetoed by Mr. FORD). which mandated that HUD see the setaside for new commitments only.

The veterans benefits In this conference report exceed the first budget resolution by $900 million for fiscal 1976. The reason is that hundreds of thousands of veterans cannot find jobs in todays depressed jobs market. So veterans are going to school. instead. and qualify for financial assistance under the education benefits of the GI bill. Instead of having jobs and paying tax dollars into the Treasury. unusually large numbers of veterans are being forced to draw veterans benefits. This is a direct consequence of the misguided policies of the Ford administration. The administration policies mean a prolongation of high unemployment and recession conditions. I am informed that later today another member of the Budget Committee will insert remarks with further detail on the amounts in this conference report.",

    "speech": "I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. . Mr. Speaker. I am a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the Committee on Banking. Currency and Housing. and I would urge the House to vote down the agreement between the House and the Senate. In my city of Los Angeles I suspect that 75 percent of the section 8 money could be spent for new housing because it is that type of city. In the city of Washington. though. I doubt if they could spend 50 percent of the money for new housing because basically the problem with the city of Washington is that they need to rehabilitate existing housing. There just is not the space for new housing. When we dealt with this section 8 provision in the Committee on Banking. Currency and Housing. this is the problem we dealt withdifferent problems f acing each city. I realize there is a recession in the area of home building. but if a city does not have space to build new houses. then the city cannot spend its money under this conference report. So I would urge that this 50percent restriction be knocked out. Our whole thrust in dealing with section 8 housing was this: Let us allow the local housing agencies to decide where they want to put their money. because each specific community has its own specific problems. By putting in a 50percent restriction. we would not affect my city. but we might affect a city that is 20 or 30 miles away because of the makeup of its housing base. Therefore. I would urge that we support the position of the members of the Committee on Banking. Currency and Housing. who spent weeks and weeks on this provision. and that we send this congressional report back so that the Senate and the House can further negotiate the issue. The House has taken a policy position in treating the section 8 program. and frankly. I am sick and tired. as a Member. of having the Senate legislate on appropriation bills. I think it is about time that we tell the Senate that we do not appreciate their legislating on appropriation bills and that policy legislation is supposed to be up to the Policy Committee and not the Committee on Appropriations.",

The Atlanta region. for example. and the Dallas region are not interested in new housing at this time.

I had written to President Ford last week urging that action was needed to bring these concerns to the EECs attention. This concurrent resolution was checked out with the Office of Special Trade Representative. and they are in agreement with the language and purpose of the resolution. I made some recommendations on improving the language of the resolution which have been incorporated in it. It is important that we signal our concern to both the EEC and the administration. This resolution will do just that. With the recent flood of dutyfree palm oil imports and last falls embargo on exports. our soybean producers are extremely concerned over the future of their markets. The new EEC regulation would have a twofold effect on European importers. First. it requires them to include in their feed mixtures a minimum of 5 percent nonfat dry milk from EEC sources. This stipulation in itself could cut European imports of U.S. meal by as much as 500.000 tons per year. according to official estimates. Second. the regulation obliges importers to pay a deposit of $34 per ton on imported oilseeds. oilseed protein and certain other feeds until proof can be obtained that they have complied with the requirement on utilizing the nonfat dry milk. That measure is expected to force up the prices charged by importers for feed mixtures. by tying up capital needed to meet the deposit requirements. We already have a heavy carryover of soybeans. and this action could lead to 18 million bushels less in export sales. It is urgent that we overturn this step and do so without delay. Mr. President.

The principal reasons are: \"Projected funding levels will support a force level of not more than 13 or 14 fully capable carriers. \"At force levels of 13 or 14 carriers. high individual carrier capability is required to meet tactical requirements. \"Carriers significantly smaller than the Nimitz Class cannot support the practical minlmium number and types of aircraft required to perform missions alone in the presence of an air threat. Nimitz size carriers provide more than twice the combat capability of the smallest practical nuclear powered alternative. \"Nimitz size carriers have more flexibility to incorporate changes in characteristics that may be required during the life of the ship due to changes in the threat and new technological developments. \"For a threecarrier procurement program. the cost of three Modified Nlimtz size carriers is about the same as the cost of three of the smallest sized carrier concepts developed.\" I concur in the conclusion of the carrier .study that we should continue building Nimitz Class carriers. A substantial portion of the higher investment cost of a nuclear carrier is directly offset by the elimination of the cost of buying and delivering propulsion fuel oil. also. by the reduced cost of the logistic support forces needed due to less frequent replenishment of combat consumables because of the larger capacity of the CVN for aviation fuel and ammunition. Navy studies have shown that it takes the equivalent of an extra fleet oiler just to provide the peacetime propulsion fuel support for an oilfired aircraft carrier. Of course. in wartime the oilfired carriers vulnerability is largely determined by its requirement for a continuous supply of propulsion fuel and the extreme vulnerability of oilers.",

He said: Only the possibility of war is a more critical problem than an economy which has no jobs for people who want to work. Doing something about this tragic waste of talent and resources is of the highest priority with me. The failure of the United States to develop a longterm national economic policy toward the goal of full employment without inflation has created imbalance in our economy and led to the severe economic decline weve just experienced. No single government body is now responsible for carrying out a systematic and comprehensive plan to reach sound economic goals and policies. Without such a central body. it is impossible to predict and prepare for the future. Mr. President. I greatly value Conressman BOLLINGS support on this vital piece of legislation.

    "speech": "(By Sarah Booth Conroy) Samuel C. Mitchell Jr.. 49. chief of the State Departments civil service counseling and assignment division. died Wednesday at his home. 500 Underwood St. NW. of complications following a heart attack some time ago. Mr. Mitchell was widely known throughout the department and the Foreign Service. Much of his work involved finding jobs in the United States for Foreign Service employees who could no longer serve abroad. He also was a member of the committee working with labor and employee organizations. and prepared individual grievance cases for employees. Mr. Mitchell was known to his friends as an accomplished cook of traditional American recipes. In an article about his cooking by Washington Post food editor William Rice. Mr. Mitchell said that he did the cooking in the family for his wife. twin daughters and son. \"I was taught by my dad that a beautiful steak is a work of art. and picked up an interest in cooking from him. He was a porter. then went on the White House staff and became steward of President Franklin D. Roosevelts railroad car. He worked for Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. too.\" Mr. Mitchell was a graduate of Shaw Junior High School and Dunbar High School. He attended Howard University and graduated with honors with a bachelors degree. He then went to Harvard law school but ran out of money and went to work. as he once said. \"with the Post Office as a substitute clerk. I never figured out who I substituted for because he never came to work ... I worked an average of 1011 hours every day.\" Mr. Mitchell started at the State Department as a clerk in machine records and worked his way up until his last promotion in April. He joined the Army in 1943 as a private. and was assigned to attend Transportation Corps Officers Candidate School. He was commissioned a second lieutenant and served in the southwest Pacific. Mr. Mitchell Is survived by his wife. Juanita. a teacher in the D.C. schools for almost 30 years. a son. Samuel III. and twin daughters. Janice and Jacklyn. all of the home.",

It involves the special supplemental food program. known as WICwomen. infants. and childrenwhich expires on The House of Representatives has already passed legislation extending WIC well beyond this date. As a result. I fully expect WIC to be extended by Congress. There is tremendous professional and community support for WIC. However. it does not appear that this new legislation will become law until late June 1975. That is what necessitates this bill. as the States need some more immediate guarantee that funds will be available to continue WIC. Each State must receive its letter of credit containing WIC funds by or near June 1. 1975. or they will have to close down their programs. disrupting the nutrition support and medical supervision of hundreds of thousands of lowincome infants. children. and pregnant women. Some States have already sent out the word to shut down programs. This disruption is not only necessary. it would be bad public policy to stop the WIC program. dismantle the fooddelivery mechanism. and stop the flow of medical data. only to have the entire program authorized and funded soon thereafter. This is the scenario this bill seeks to avoid. I am informed by the Department of Agriculture that there will be several million dollars unspent from this years WIC authorization. This money can be carried over for the 3month period authorized in this bill. thereby eliminating the need for any new funds. Of course. it Is my hope that a permanent extension of authorization will soon become law. However. Mr. Speaker. until that happens. this provision is necessary for the future of this valuable program.

I refer to the nonprofit. nonpartisan. public affairs television show. \"Ask Congress\" which was designed by our colleague. Mr. WOLFF. \"Ask Congress.\" which is filmed in the House of Representatives studio. invites two Members each week. one from each party. to answer questions sent in from viewers across the country on major issues before the Congress. The gentleman from New York . who moderates \"Ask Congress.\" is careful to insure that both sides of an issue are explored and that Members from both parties are represented. In this way. the public Is educated on the whole of an issue and Is exposed to the various viewpoints of Members from around the country who may represent districts very different from that of the viewer. The people are able to get a more wellrounded and accurate insight into the workings of Congress and of the men and women who make up the House of Representatives. \"Ask Congress\" serves the publics interest. and I hope it will continue with the success it has enjoyed over the years.",

I used to represent about 30.000 farmers until. among other things. the farm policies of the present administration in the last 8 years put about half of them out of business. But the problem with this amendment is the same problem that we had last year with the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois . The gentleman. from Kansas tells us what this amendment does. is to exempt farming operations which employ less than 10 people. but that is not what it does. The practical effect of the language is otherwise. Let me read it to you. It says: Provided. That none of the funds appropriated under this paragraph shall be obligated or expended to prescribe. issue. administer. or enforce any standard. rule. regulation. or order under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 which is applicable to any person who is engaged in a farming operation and employs 10 or fewer employees. This is because the standards promulgated under the authorizing legislation. do. in fact. cover all farmers. This does the same thing that the Findley amendment erroneously did last year. it effectively eliminates enforcement for all agriculture. We would wipe out enforcement for all of agriculture. The Department of Justice right now is moving to force the Government to set up tighter standards for migrant camps. Have any of you ever been in a migrant camp? I have. I have been in some good ones and I have been in some pretty lousy ones. We would exempt all of the migrant workers in this country if we accept the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kansas. I know that that is not his intent. but that is what the language says. If we were to pass this amendment. while the intentions of the amendment might be good. the practical effect is that because there is a defect in the way the amendment is drafted we will. in fact. be eliminating all agriculture from OSHA inspection.

The example of requiring farmers to provide hand washing and toilet facilities of a prescribed description within a 5minute walk of any field hand. or drive. if the farmer provides the transportation. is just the latest instance showing the ignorance of OSHA regulation writers in respect to the farming operations in the Great Plains area. Anyone who has bothered to look at the situation is well aware that mechanization in modern grain farming has enabled American farmers to handle large acreage operations. In fact. modern farming economics almost dictate that they do so. Typical farms include hundreds of acres tilled and harvested by a few workers. more often than not the farm family. using large and expensive equipment. Obviously. no one in OSHA has ever seen a wheat harvest. It is obvious to me there is little difference in OSHAs eyes between harvesting operations for wheat and corn and the truck and fruit farming operations where hundreds of farm laborers work at once in a single field. I realize that these regulations have not yet been finalized. and I have urged my own constituents to contact the De20369 partment detailing how their own operations would be affected. At the same time. I am convinced that OSHA regulation writers are not listening. or that they dont understand what they are hearing. There is no other explanation for the Federal Government requiring outhouses in the middle of wheatflelds. Therefore. I strongly urge the adoption of the Skubitz amendment exempting these family farms from further harassment from OSHA. These farmers have a great stake in farm safety and health. and they have been meetingtheir responsibilities for many years without OSHAs interference.",

I offer this amendment really in the hope of clarifying this matter. because I want to ask some questions of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken against the Skubitz amendment. I have some knowledge of migrant labor. When I was in the New Jersey legislature. I sponsored. and they are now law. two bills: one concerning wages of migrant laborers and the other concerning privies in the fields. for migrant laborers. so I am not unaware of the conditions described. but I think we will find we cannot talk about farms. period. We must discriminate between the intensive farming that migrant labor does. \"stoop labor.\" hard picking. These farms do not employ only 10 people. they employ dozens of people. They have big barracks. We have laws in the State of New Jersey governing those barracks and how they should be constructed and what their water and sanitary facilities should be. but when we are talking about a nonintensive. small farm. we have a different situation. Our bad health statistics come from the migrant labor farms. The bad health statistics do not come from farms employing 5 or 10 people. but dozens and dozens of people. Mr. Chairman. this is why I think we must differentiate. I do not think we have 5 people working on a farm. with the intimate relationship that exists between employer and employees. that we have need for the OSHA investigators. Mr. Chairman. what I would really like to ask those who have spoken against the Skubitz amendment. what figures do they have that show where these accidents happened? Are they not on farms that employ far more people than 5? The figure given by one of my colleagues was 87 percent of all farms would be included under the number of 10. What figures are there on farms which employ 5 people? Have we any indication how many people are employed where we have these high infant mortality and other illness rates?

There is no duty imposed on the Secretary that is in any way different from the duty imposed presently by the statutory law that we are appropriating this money for. We do not impose any new duty. He did not draw any new definitions. It is simply a question of whether he will assess monetary damages against a person who is accused of a violation that falls within the purview of any one of these section 17 definitions. It does exactly what the gentleman from Kansas attempted to do and more nearly approximates what he said he was doing than the language of the Skubitz amendment.",

Under the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kansas they would have to issue new regulations. they would have to dfaw up new forms. they would have to monitor recordkeeping by farmers. they would have to change the inspector instruction manual. they would have to verify employment records. and a number of other duties.

Mr. Hildebrand has evidently become an apologist for the present Cambodian government. since our office. based on direct information from within Cambodia. as well as a very careful investigation on the many stories concerning Cambodia as circulated abroad in the past year. has determined that the evidence substantially establishes the present Cambodian government as one of the most oppressive. despotic regimes in modern history and that proportionately. the deaths traceable to the present action of the Cambodian government exceed those of the concentration camps of Hitlers Germany. and of the Soviet regime between 1919 and 1954. that the present Cambodian government is systematically destroying the family unit. has torn the economy assunder and has survived by terror and oppression.

I would like to emphasize that both the House and Senate agreed on the amount to be authorized for the InterAmerican Development Bank and the African Development Fund. All the points of difference were minor. and the conference report does not change the substance of the action taken by the House on this bill.

We also agreed to a Senate amendment that declares swine influenza to be a serious international problem that requires the full cooperation of our Government with international agencies concerned with this problem. The amendment is a sense of Congress declaration. and has no tangible effect on the bill. Finally. we agreed to add into the human rights amendment Senate language dealing with international terrorism.

The simple effect of this amendment is to give the Congress the opportunity to review the export of fuel and technology to those countries which have not had their agreements for cooperation previously scrutinized by the Congress before they were signed. I should point out that included in that category are such countries as Japan. Spain. South Africa. Portugal. Israel. India. France. and Brazil. The United States had signed agreements for cooperation with those countries which I have just named. but those agreements have not lain before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for the 30day period required under Public Law 93485. because they were entered into prior to the amendment that was made to the law on October 14. 1974. So. under the current system. without the amendment that I have just proposed. it would be possible to export nuclear technology to these countries without further congressional review. As I have indicated. this amendment. if adopted. would require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to submit the first license to export technology following the enactment of this legislation. They would have to submit this license to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

It should be noted that House Concurrent Resolution 570 was the result of the extensive hearings conducted in the fall of 1975 by the Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific Affairs which I chair published under the title \"Nuclear Proliferation: Future U.S. Foreign Policy Implications.\" Out of these hearings came irrefutable evidence pointing up the mounting danger of nuclear proliferation. While my own resolution and this amendment will help to offset that danger. more needs to be done. I am therefore hopeful that my subcommittee will resume consideration of this problem soon as a means of exploring other possible solutions. I once again express my support for the amendment and urge the committee to adopt the amendment.",

I indicated some sympathy for the position which she took and said I would give it great consideration and did entertain some thoughts in favor of her position.

I have been informed by the vice chairman of the committee that the committee does intend to hold hearings on that ERDA report. I think that this is a sufficiently important question that it does deserve the kind of study and investigation that can be achieved only through congressional hearings. It is complicated. as my friend the gentleman from Illinois has said. Weapons research is something that is not. of course. distinct from energy research. Laser fusion had its beginning in the classified weapons program and the physicists working on that very quickly realized that in the research being done on laser fusion there existed very real possibilities of making a fusion reactor using the same principles applied to military purposes. Out of that grew the civilian laser fusion program. In fact. there is a constant relationship that does exist between the weapons program and energy and research and development activities that are devoted to the peaceful use of the atom and to the civilian sector. I for one want to study very carefully this detailed report before I come to a final conclusion.

I agree that the funds for the Library addition should be authorized. that the needs for the Library are vast and that additional space is now necessary and has long been needed and requested. The needs are fully recognized because the shelf space has long been exhausted. The very. very lovely Jefferson Reading Room of the original Library of Congress has long been cluttered with a multitude of desks in virtually every nook and cranny. Now the Congressional Research Service. formerly known as the Legislative Reference Service has hardly room to move. There is a piling of books in every conceivable place of that facility. it is just jammed full. Having said all of that. Mr. Speaker.

In view of that. my suggestion is that this is the appropriate time to examine the entire question of what Capitol Hill is all about. what its purposes are. both functional and philosophical.

Mr. George White. and the Library of Congress Librarian. Dr. Daniel V. Boorstin. both of whom appeared before the committee. This money is needed to complete the interior and related work of the annex. At the present time bids for the completion of the Library have been accepted and with this authorization an award can be given so that the final phase of this project can begin. If the additional funds are not authorized. the bids will expire and new bids must be solicited. which may result in further increases in the cost of this building. At the present time the contractors with bids in for the final phase of this building have agreed to extensions. totaling 6 months. on the award of a contract. The final extension is due to expire February 21. It is obvious there is need to move this bill quickly. Furthermore. nothing in this legislation authorizes any transfer of space in this building to any other purpose. The building remains intact for library use exclusively. Mr. Speaker. one of the points that has been raised here today is about contingency fee and the increase of costs that would result if this building is delayed any longer. I would like to point out that we have gone into this very extensively in the committee. and everybody in the construction field is agreed on one thing: In this country we face an escalation of about 9 percent increase in cost of construction a year.

    "speech": "Mr. President. from the earliest years of our Nations history. the people of the United States have responded generously and compassionately to victims of disasters at home and in nations around the world. The legislation I introduce today to provide relief and rehabilitation to the victims of the Guatemalan earthquake continues that proud tradition. In the early morning hours of February 4. a powerful and devastating earthquake struck Guatemala creating human tragedy and suffering of terrible magnitude. Twenty percent of the people of Guatemala were directly affected. Over 22.000 are dead. 74.000 injured and a million homeless. Compounding the tragedy is its impact on the urban and rural poor whose adobe homes and shanties collapsed with the tremors. burying families in their sleep. Mr. President. the U.S. Government. private voluntary organizations. international organizations. and 25 other governments responded promptly and. by all accounts. effectively to aid the people of Guatemala. To date. the U.S. Government has provided over $4 million for disaster relief including mobile hospitals. medicine. food. and technical advisers. But much remains to be done before the onset of the rainy season when reconstruction of homes. roads. and other facilities will become difficult or impossible. The bill I introduce today will help the people of Guatemala meet their urgent. immediate relief and reconstruction requirements. Without our help their difficult task will become impossible. Without our help their suffering will be prolonged. Mr. President. our time is short and the human need is great. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Assistance. I pledge prompt consideration of this legislation and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to aid the people of Guatemala. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

However. other airportrelated expenses are financed by the general taxpayer via the Federal Aviation Agency. In particular. the cost of maintaining and operating the air navigation control systemair traffic controlis borne by the general taxpayer and not by those who benefit from this system. I have prepared an amendment which will give the taxpayer some indirect relief. My amendment would allow future trust fund surpluses to be used to finance the expense of maintaining and operating the air navigation control system. up to certain maximum amounts. Capital expenditures would be protected by a provision that only the \"balance\" of the trust fund revenuesthe surplusmay be used to finance the maintenance expenditures. A similar provision is contained in the Housepassed version of the bill. but my amendment would provide for a larger reallocation of funds. Continued subsidization of air travel by general tax revenues makes little sense in view of the low energy efficiency of air travel and the hundreds of millions of dollars currently being spent to encourage people to ride AMTRAK. Moreover. as I explained in my minority views to the committee report. the use of general tax revenue to subsidize air travel can only represent a regressive transfer payment because air travelers and the users of private planes are considerably more affluent than the general taxpaying citizenry. My amendment would help to reduce this subsidization. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment and my minority views be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last Thursday. February 19. 1976. I had the privilege of testifying before the Finance Subcommittee on Financial Markets concerning the lack of adequate capital resources to meet the Nations needs. Numerous studies have been pubished in recent months concerning both the need for new capital investment in the various sectors of our economy as well as the prospect for meeting those needs. All of the studies concur that our need for new capital investment during the next decade will far exceed that of any previous decade. Developing new sources of energy. expanding job opportunities to absorb the vast numbers of unemployed and underemployed. and improving the environment and working conditions constitute an incomplete list of our pressing needs for new capital investment. These same studies generally agree that new Federal policies must be adopted in order to meet these extreme investment needs. Our historical rate of savings and investment simply will not provide the resources necessary to satisfy the many capital requirements of the American people. On February 2. 1976. I introduced S. 2909. the Investment Incentives Act of 1976. This bill is designed to redirect our Federal tax policy so that savings and investment on the part of individuals and corporations are more clearly encouraged. My statement before the Financial Markets Subcommittee discusses both the need for new capital investment as well as the Investment Incentives Act.

For more than 22 years they have carried the burden of his death without the benefit of knowing its true cause. This I find inexcusable. Since there were no national security secrets involved. his family should have been told the truth. Instead. his wife and children have suffered in ignorance.

Minnesota lost an outstanding and dedicated community leader and I lost one of my dearest friends. I will greatly miss his sound advice and counsel. His sudden death. earlier this month. is a matter of deep sorrow to me. He did so much for so many and asked so little for himself. As the publisher and editor of the Minneapolis Spokesman and St. Paul Recorder. he demonstrated rare capability. compassion. and understanding. I do not think there was any injustice or human need that escaped his attention. He especially will be remembered for the important contributions he made toward the achievement of civil rights for all people. Cecil Newman did more for human rights than anyone I know or have known. He was instrumental in defining my views and guiding my actions on issues of civil rights and social justice. His life is a true. meaningful testament to the kind of human dignity he believed should be awarded to all. Through close to 40 years. I have valued his judgment and admired his ability. He was a very practical. yet idealistic man. Literally hundreds of people can testify to his individual acts of kindness. He is one of the few men I have known in public life who never sacrificed the goals he had in mind for any short cuts or quick drama. So many times I called on him for his good counsel. During my time as Vice President he accompanied me on an important mission to Africa. There was always something deeply reassuring about having this good man at your side.

The Maritime Administration told the Navy in April 1973 that it supported Lykes \"flat refusal\" to give the plans to the Navy. which claimed it was entitled to them because of the governments investment in the vessels creation. Committee investigators said Maritime Administration officials have since reversed their decision. The investigators accused the firm of a \"selfinterested disregard\" of legal requirements and the nations need to improve its merchant fleet. \"The United States. a major commercial power with a broad range of maritime interests. has been hard pressed to maintain its position in world shipping.\" the report said. \"The episodes described in this report suggest that the difficulties may be compounded by inadequate management of both federal subsidy programs and technology transfer procedures.\" Two sets of plans were sold to the Soviets for $500.000 each. The plans were developed during the construction of three ships for Lykes Brothers under a construction subsidy contract with General Dynamics. The Maritime Administration contributed $519.168 to the preliminary design work and later paid General Dynamics more than $57 million in subsidy for more than half the total construction cost. the report said. The government received nothing from the proceeds of the sale to the Soviet government even though it had a proprietary interest in the design data because of the subsidies. the report said. The report said the Maritime Administration approved the sale because the plans were published in technical publications and the ships could be seen in many world ports. the report said. \"Whatever the public availability of the designs. the Soviets must have considered them sufficiently inaccessible--or surely they would not have paid $1 million in order to obtain them.\" the report said.

It points out that the embargo on soybean sales to Japan 2 years ago helped encourage production in Brazil. and that country has now become a significant competitor on the world soybean market. The article also points out the major contribution which the agricultural sector is making to the total economy in terms of \"carrying the less efficient and less competitive nonagricultural sector. A positive U.S. trade balance last year resulted only because a $12 billion agricultural trade surplus more than erased a nonagricultural deficit of $10 billion.\" The article also emphasizes the adverse side effects which this \"kneejerk reaction to rising food prices\" can have on longrange inflationary trends. I have emphasized many times that it makes little sense to encourage farmers to plant row to row and promise them access to the world export markets and then later establish export controls of one kind of another without adequate warning or understanding regarding the impact of such intervention in the market.

The Secretary also related congressional actions on Angola to a questioning of American will: What will be the perception of leaders around the world as they make decisions concerning their future security? It is important to note. however. that it was not the Congress which blew the significance of Angola way up out of proportion. it was not the Congress which saidboth during the closing days in Vietnam last spring or after the Senate vote on covert involvement in Angolathat other nations would no longer trust the United States as they had before These statements. made by the President and the Secretary of State. themselves created any problem they now seeand flew in the face of uncontested facts about our strength as a nation and our unbroken record of willingnesspast. present. and undoubtedly for the futureto meet any threat to truly vital U.S. interests.

The Coast Guard. through its 40.000 men and women provide an extensive service for all those who use the inland and coastal waters as well as the high seas. Their search and rescue work is probably the most familiar to us. but in recent years the Coast Guard has expanded their activities to meet a wide range of concerns. Aside from safety of life and property. the Coast Guard must maintain a sophisticated network of aids to navigation. conduct oceanographic. research and enforce offshore fisheries law. As the foreign fishing fleets encroach on our domestic fishing fleets. the Coast Guard has the added responsibility of maintaining our territorial sovereignty. In my district. probably the most important function of the Coast Guard is the enforcement of vessel traffic safety and the prevention of marine pollution. The New Orleans port area becomes increasingly congested with traffic bearing petroleum products. Every vessel movement and every transfer operation has the potential for serious damage to life. property. and the environment. Effective enforcement of pollution and safety laws requires a wellequipped. wellmanned Coast Guard. This bill provides procurements which will assist the Coast Guard in meeting its obligations under the marine inspection and safety laws. This includes the procurement for port safety and inspection boats and the mediumrange surveillance aircraft. Admiral Silers testimony before our subcommittee indicates the Coast Guard will need more support in the future if we expect to see its mandates fulfilled.

During the couse of our recent Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board hearings. we learned of the increasing vessel congestion in our inland waterways and harbors. Further. we learned of the enormous increase in serious vessel accidents over the past 3 years. The Coast Guard is shouldered with enormous responsibility in these areas. They must be provided with funding to obtain the necessary. equipment and facilities to carry out their responsibilities. This bill does provide for the procurement of badly needed vessels. aircraft and facilities needed to enable the Coast Guard to properly administer their responsibilities. Fellow Membersthis is a responsible bill which enables the Coast Guard to perform their safety and enforcement responsibilities without any reductions in essential programs. I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.",

One group is the U.S. Senate. presently continuing its consideration of H.R. 10612. the Tax Reform Act of 1975. The second group is the House Task Force on Capital Formation. This special 10member committee. appointed by Chairman AL ULLMAN of the House Committee on Ways and Means. is conducting an ongoing study on the current capital formation crisis in the United States. Depending upon the nature of the ultimate findings and legislative determinations of each body. the formation of capitaland hence the growth of the economy and the creation of jobs in our countrycould be made either much easier or much more difficult. The formation and the availability of investment capital is intrinsically connected to job creation and economic prosperity in our Nation. The measure of progress and prosperity which our country has enjoyed up until nowand the measure to which we will enjoy it in the futureis Inseperably related to the ability with which the free market system can raise capital. and hence grow and expand. A recently released advertisement of the Bethlehem Steel Corp. addresses the urgent need for tax laws in the United States which will aid in closing the anticipated capital gap and provide the needed investment funds for continued growth and expansion of the private sector. The advertisement also effectively illustrates the role of capital in the creation of jobs. and how jobs. in turn. help the wellbeing of every citizen. Mr. Speaker. I would urge all of my colleagues. before making a final judgment upon tax policies which will affect so greatly the welfare of our Nation and its citizens to read and consider the wisdom of the following short. but significant message of Bethlehem Steel:",

This organization is active in Philadelphia and in my district. This open letter sets out in brief the case for the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 393. the socalled righttofood resolution. We all sense that in the not too distant future the world will face a food crisis. The growth of the worlds population is the prime cause for this situation. The U.S. farm system will stand between millions and the prospect of starvatiorn. House Concurrent Resolution 393 puts the Congress on record as accepting that challenge by promising within time to dedicate 1 percent of our gross national income to feeding the worlds population. I urge the House to support this resolution. The letter follows: DEAR CONGRESSMEMBERS: As members of Bread for the World. a nationwide Christian citizen movement established to work towards a world which every person has an adequately nutritious diet. we would like to encourage your support of the Right to Food Resolution. Thisletter is a followup of our meeting with Congressman Nix of your subcommittee on Saturday June 19th. We want to impress upon you the fact that we and those we represent in Pennsylvania Congressional District No. 2 strongly support the type of foreign aid which the resolution advocates. In particular. in section No. 4 of the resolution a specific concern must be shown that development assistance and food assistance reach the 1% target of our total national production (GNP). According to the World Book statistics for 1975. the U.S.. ranking 13th of the developed countries. give .23% of its GNP. The OPEC and Sweden. among other countries. have reached the 4% target. We would like to point out that this is development aid which should help the people become self sufficient by caring for their own nutritional needs. Once self sufficient. future U.S. food aid of this type would be unnecessary. On the local and national scene we view this resolution as a foundation on which future legislation can be built to ensure a nutritionally adequate diet for all our citizens. Looking forward to cooperating with your subcommittee in preparing for future legislation which will be based on this resolution.",

It Is always difficult to explain ones opposition to bills establishing agencies for consumer protection. There are few among us totally without consumers in our districts. Nevertheless. there are few bills coming before Congress which promise as much as does H.R. 7575 yet achieve so little. At a time when the public has grown so weary of big government and so intolerate of overbearing Federal regulation. we propose to engraft upon our system still another layer of bureaucracy. Supporters of the Agency for Consumer Advocacy contend that theirs is a \"nonregulatory\" agency. At present. it has no powers to promulgate rules or regulations. Apart from the inevitability of the ACA coming before us again in the near future and claiming that rulemaking authority has become necessary to more effectively carry out their mandate. this argument misses one of the basic points of Government regulation. The ACA may have individuals subpenaed. they may intervene in administrative proceedings and may initiate their own judicial appeals. they have the power to receive and publicize consumer complaints. and they may conduct extensive surveys and investigations. Whether or not they are empowered. at this point. to issue formal rules or regulations. they possess all the trappings of other Federal regulatory agencies which the American public have grown to hold in such low esteem.

We are strong as a nation today. in no small measure. because of the Marines. and the Nation is grateful. The Marines are a proud group. and it has been my pleasure to associate with many in the Marine Corps for more than 30 years. I congratulate the Marines in their 200th year on behalf of my colleagues and constituents. and I believe the spirit and tradition of the Marines can be summed up with the inscription on the Iwo Jima Marine Memorial statue: \"Uncommon valor was a common virtue.\"",

Increased public awareness of the arbitrary disinvestment of entire neighborhoods. commonly known as \"redlining.\" by some financial institutions. led to the adoption of title III. which requires financial institutions to publicly disclose home mortgage lending practices. As was evident from the floor debate on title III. the disclosure information required will assist both public officials and private citizens to identify the beginning stages of \"redlining.\" the point at which a neighborhood can be saved. As we prepare to go to conference on S. 1281. I thought my colleagues would find of interest a very timely editorial which appeared In the November/December 1975 issue of Trial. published by The Association of Trial Lawyers of America. The article. appearing as a message from the president of the association. Ward Wagner. Jr.. is entitled \"Stop the Rot\" and quite convincingly favors \"redlining\" disclosure laws.

She was a wonderful First Lady. and the great admiration I have for those who have succeeded her in that position cannot diminish the special feeling I shall always have for her. remembering as I do that it was she who first welcomed me to the White House when I was a freshman Congressman back in The great good humor and sunny disposition that she has always displayed have made her a favorite of the American people. even as her husband was. America loves Mamie. and for good reason. She was born in Boone. Iowa. 79 years ago today. the second of four daughters in the family of John Doud. a prosperous meatpacker. She married Lt. Dwight Eisenhower in 1916 and spent the ensuing decades as an Army wife. constantly packing and unpacking. constantly moving from post to post. The White House was their home for longer than any had been before. and the farm at Gettysburg where she now lives is the only home they ever owned themselves.

To accomplish this goal. the bill provides that all areas which are included in the National Wildlife Refuge System as of January 1. 1975. and thereafter shall continue to be a part of the System. and in general cannot be transferred or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an act of Congress. Additionally. the legislation would require that all areas within the System be administered by the Secretary of Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. except for the Kofa. Charles M.
