    "speech": "Mr. President. it was with deep sadness that I learned of the passing of his beatitude. Archbishop Makarios. the President of Cyprus. This tragic loss of one of the worlds most courageous leaders creates a void that will not soon be filled. I join with the people of Cyprus and with freedomloving people everywhere in mourning the archbishops untimely death. Archbishop Makarios came to symbolize the character and destiny of the island republic of Cyprus. Born as the son of a village goatherd. he became head of the Greek Orthodox Church and a leader in his countrys struggle for independence. Seventeen years ago. when his vision became a reality. Makarios won an overwhelming victory in the first presidential election ever held on the island. Unique. as both the spiritual and temporal leader of his people. Makarios served his country faithfully and selflessly until his death. I had the great honor of meeting this great man in August 1975 when the archbishop came to the United States seeking economic assistance. I know that no successor can command the authority and prestige that accrued to him in his nearly three decades of leadership. A man of great intelligence. strong principle and profound faith. Makarios asserted the democratic values which we all share and cherish. His deeprooted ties to his own people enabled him to sustain them and lead them courageously. He was a tower of strength and a vital stabilizing force. The archbishop had a dreama dream for a peaceful and independent nation. It is a great tragedy indeed that he will never live to see the realization of his hopes for his beloved Cyprus. His rare and extraordinary qualities will be deeply missed. His passing deprives the world and the Republic of Cyprus of a great statesman.",

I call their attention to a recent newspaper article appearing on July 25. 1977. in the Huron. S. Dak.. Daily Plainsman. Small farmers just are not making a living from farm income alone and must supplement it through offfarm jobs or working wives. What is alarming is that of an average farm income of slightly over $19.000. $11.000 of this total comes from nonfarmingrelated activity. Regardless of the size of the farm as reflected by gross sales. every category of agriculture relied in one degree or another on a substantial part of the family income coming from seasonal. parttime. or spouseheld employment.

This bill would give the small operator a chance to compete with the larger federally inspected meatprocessing establishments. I have received a copy of House Concurrent Resolution No. 101. which was passed by the house of representatives and senate of the State of Texas during the regular legislative session earlier this year.

Mr. President. the small operator is not asking for any special favors. he only wants to be able to operate in a competitive situation with the large federally inspected meat processors. I believe this bill will alleviate an inequity currently existing in the meat industry. and will benefit the cattleman. processor. and consumer alike.

This tribute to him and to the many Americans who devote a substantial part of their lives. energy and wisdom to the performance of public service. is noteworthy. Verl W. Snyder is a native of West Virginia. and resides in Berkley Springs. In addition to distinguished service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Mr. Snyder served in public schools as a teacher. coach. and as superintendent of schools in Morgan County. From 1954 until 1964 he served as assistant State superintendent of schools of West Virginia. He then joined the U.S. Office of Education as an education program officer administering ESEA title III. In 1966. Mr. Snyder returned to West Virginia to serve as administrative assistant to Gov. Hulett Smith. In 1967. he rejoined the Office of Education as a program officer and branch chief with both the ESEA title V program and the consolidated title IV program primarily working with State departments of education to improve the leadership resources and management of those agencies. Mr. Snyder ably represented the Federal Government while serving as an individual program officer. as a member of State management review teams. as coordinator of a special project on interstate planning. and as an expert in the area of the organization and administration of the State departments of education. In these capacities. Mr. Snyder has made a significant contribution. and I am pleased to note tlhat distinguished service to the field of education and to the Federal Government. and through this Government. to the youth of the Nation. It is hoped that his commitment. contribution. and dedication will serve as an example to others who carry on the governmental function of providing an equal and adequate educational opportunity for the young people of our great country.",

It is quite likely that by the time we reconvene the Canadian Government will have taken a definitive position on a transCanadian pipeline. which they have not done to date. and that the President will have sent us a recommendation about his preference for a transportation system to bring Alaskan natural gas to the lower 48 States. The Alaskan Natural Gas Tranzportation Act provides for congressional approval of the Presidents recommendation for an Alaskan gas pipeline. Under this act. President Carter is to recommend a route to the Congress by September 1. although he can take an additional 90 days if he needs to. The Congress will then have 60 days to approve the Presidents recommendation by joint resolution. If we fail to approve it. the President is allowed 30 days to offer a second and final recommendation. Every indication we have is that the President will make a recommendation at an early date and that we will be faced with a decision on this issue shortly after we reconvene in September.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Carter administration took a step forward this week in its efforts to guarantee equal economic opportunities for women. I am referring to the national womens business ownership campaign. The Small Business Administration proposes to increase the number of women in small businesses by doing the following: Sponsoring seminars and conferences which tell women how to enter business and how to develop and expand the businesses they work for. Having SBA district offices pay more attention to the borrowing needs of women. Assisting eligible. womenowned small businesses which desire to participate in Government contract work. And by providing general management assistance through the use of preexisting SBA programs. These steps are small but important ones in a larger effort to end discrimination against women who choose to enter the business field. All one has to do is to look at the figures to see the present imbalance in business ownership and management. Today women constitute 51.3 percent of the population in the United States. yet they own only 4.6 percent of the businesses. In 1976. only 11 percent of SBA loans went to women. Women must not be denied a chance to participate in the economic life of the Nation. Recent figures indicate that they are more eager than ever to enter the business field. Whereas in 1975 and 1976. 27 percent of those attending SBA training sessions were women. this year the average has risen to 40 percent. Implementation of the womens business ownership campaign should allow this percentage to increase even further. In addition to this commendable new SBA program. the Small Business Administration assures me that it will put greater emphasis on the appointment and promotion of women within its own ranks. The agency should. of course. practice what it preaches. and I hope its example will be followed by all government agencies. In conclusion. Mr. President. I support this latest step in assuring an equal chance for women in the business world. Women should be able to pursue their interests just as easily in this sphere as in any other they may choose.",

Now it seems to be a generally accepted fact that the corporate approach is the only way to make good in business. That being so. it is heartening and worthy of mention when you find there are exceptions to that rule. I encountered an example of that indi vidual achievement a few weeks ago on a trip to West Virginia when I talked with Frank Schirtzinger. the owner and operator of the Charleston West Auto/ Truck Stop. His facility. located at exit 9 off Interstate 64. at Hurricane. is one of approximately 2.200 being operated in other parts of the country. as it is not unique in itself. It is what this 45yearold West Virginian has done to develop the establishment. from a modest beginning. which makes his accomplishment impressive. He has. in the first place. thought and built big to the point that his property is more than twice the size of the national average. with an investment of about $1.7 million in land. buildings. and equipment. The complex features a restaurant. motel. gift shop. store. and diesel repair shop to supplement fuel service facilities. The combination is producing annual sales estimated at $6.2 million. From the Governments standpoint that translates into annual taxes of $1.3 million. The way he figures it. that comes out to some $2.49 per minute of his operations. Those operations also translate into jobs for 144 people with an annual payroll of $856.000. His story does not stop there. Along with managing and expanding that enterprise he serves as president of Citizens for Community Improvement. as a trustee of the Thomas Memorial Hospital. as past president of the West Virginia Truckstop Operators and second vicechairman of the National Association of Truckstop Operators. Granted. it took the Federal highway program to provide Frank Schirtzinger with his opportunity. What he did with that opportunity proves that individual initiative. imagination. and hard work do pay dividends in our free enterprise system. That is why I wanted to share his story.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to bring to your attention the action taken yesterday in the House of Representatives which overwhelmingly defeated two separate proposals to increase the Federal gasoline tax by 4 or 5 cents per gallon. I welcome this action in the other body as it dramatically demonstrates the folly of the prooosals in question. Without question. we all want to do everything reasonable to conserve energy. At the same time. however. we must recognize that actions taken as mere symbols or demonstrations of dedication often can be disastrously costly and yield no significant conservation. The gasoline taxes are precisely such empty. but terribly painful. gestures. I No advocate of the gasoline tax. inside the administration or elsewhere. seri- ously argued that such gasoline taxes E would result in substantial savings in n petroleum consumption. What was argued was that such a tax would generate useful revenue and that it would be a symbol of the conservation ethic. Now gestures and symbols are fine. so long as they do not cause more harm * than good. These taxes would have cost consumers $4 to $5 billion each year. I for one do not think gestures are worth that price. On the other hand. if our goal was to generate needed revenue. we should not propose a tax which would fall hardest on those least able to afford it. The gasoline sales tax would be a grossly regressive tax. While those who were well off financially could easily afford the added financial burden and may even reap a strange sort of pleasure from the symbol of conservation. those people with lower incomes. those people least able to afford either the new tax or new. more efficient cars. would have another burden to carry as they struggled to make ends meet. I hope that the Senate draws the obvious conclusion from the House action. and rejects the quick but futile and costly route of these gasoline taxes as part of a comprehensive energy policy.",

An amendment of this nature is subject to two tests of germaneness. First. it has to be related to the subject matter under consideraion. and second. the fundamental purpose of the amendment must be germane to the fundamental purpose of the bill. In my view. the gentlemans amendment fails both tests. With respect to the subject matter. as compared to the content of the amendment. we note that the amendment in no way really deals with grant military assistance or military training or foreign military sales or narcotics control assistance or economic assistance to Turkey or the various elements of the subject of this bill. H.R. 12514. To the contrary. the fundamental purpose of the amendment is to lift existing economic trade sanctions against the Government of Rhodesia. an action not within the scope of the bill before us which has as its principal purpose the authorization of international security assistance programs for the fiscal year In addition. the bill has other provisions which primarily relate to other kinds of bilateral U.S. assistance. It in no way addresses the issue of nonmilitary trade or economic trade sanctions in general. nor does it seek to apply or to lift such sanctions against any individual company. and it in no way addresses the issue of U.S. imports from any source. May I just conclude. Mr. Chairman. by reminding the House that earlier. in consideration of this matter. the gentleman from Missouri had a similar proposal. but upon finding out informally that a point of order would be sustained against it. he withdrew his amendment.

At the present time. the United States has joined with Great Britain. in an effort to bring together all the parties invoived in the Rhodesian conflict. to negotiate their differences in the hope of arriving at an early negotiated settlement that will establish majority rule in Rhodesia. The United States has not endorsed the internal settlement plan proposed by the Smith government. and passage of this amendment would be perceived as an endorsement by the United States of the internal settlement. The internal settlement has not brought about changes in the Rhodesian Government that will bring outside Rhodesian factions into the Government. If there is ever to be peace in Rhodesia. all the Rhodesian factions must have a chance to participate in their Government. Presently under the internal settlement. there has been no change in the whitedominated police. army. or judiciary as well as no major change in discriminatory statutes. Passage of this amendment will clearly tend to strengthen Ian Smiths firmness in his negotiating position. and this will. in turn. spell disaster for Rhodesia. While the solution for peace in Rhodesia is. at this moment. very far away. it will be even more so if this amendment is to pass. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the Bauman amendment to lift economic sanctions on Rhodesia. This is a premature move that will not contribute to ending the violence in Rhodesia or improving the economic conditions in Rhodesia as long as war continues. The major issue facing Rhodesia today is the conflict between the Smith regime and the Patriotic Front. Frankly. the economic. political. educational. and social life for the 250.000 white Rhodesians is excellent in comparison to that of the 7 million black Rhodesians who live in oppression. The lifting of the sanctions would give the false impression that the United States supports the Governments efforts to bring about a settlement through the Salisbury agreement. An agreement that is not recognized by the majority of Rhodesias people. the Patriotic Front. other African nations. or the world community and which the black people of Rhodesia will have no opportunity to vote for. The internal settlement has not brought about an end to the violence. Just the other day. the Rhodesian Government waged an attack on the Patriotic forces in Mozambique. It does not offer promise of change in the racist system instituted by the Government. and will preserve the same oppressive government and leadership. Lifting economic sanctions would be a violation of the human rights provision contained in the committee bill which prohibits recipient governments from repressing the populations rights under the United Nations Declaration of Rights. It will encourage the Patriotic Front to look more and more to the Soviet Union for aid and sympathy and would lessen their interest in further negotiations. I cannot accept the position that Rhodesia should receive greater assistance from the United States so that it can use it to raid the Patriotic Front forces and its oppressed black Rhodesians. When I consider all the effort Congress has taken thus far in behalf of Soviet dissidents. I would think it could find the heart to speak up for blacks in Rhodesia and against assisting the Government in its oppressive rule. We should not be overly concerned about improving Rhodesias economic situation or the availability of Rhodesia chromium for U.S. industries.0",

Mr. Chairman. the principal features of my substitute are: First. the amendment would not allow sanctions to be lifted immediately. The lifting of sanctions at this time would simply imply a recognition of the internal settlement. an action which would nullify the claim of the United States to be an impartial mediator in the Rhodesian dispute.

Mr. President. given todays current high rate of inflation. I believe that it is necessary for us to scrutinize every budget increase with a great deal of care. Continuing Federal expenditures will only serve to increase the Federal deficit. Frankly. I am concerned that our present level of Federal spending may be overstimulating the economy. The result of this overstimulation is further inflation in both the housing market and other sectors of the ecoromy. Inflation in the housing market will make it only more difficult for lowincome people not in public housing to afford housing. I believe that the 375.000 units proposed by the administration is an adequate increase in the number of lowincome units to be constructed for any 1 year. To authorize an additional 80.000 would create serious inflationary pressures in the economy. I am also concerned with the impact of the present committee auhorization on the Senate budgetary process. The Senate Budget Committee voted twice to reject amendments which would increase the budget authorizations for housing assistance. Both the House and the Senate agreed to the first budget resolution which kept the budget authority for housing at the same level as the Presidents original request. Now here we are attempting to increase the level of spending for the housing authorization by other means. If Congress is serious about the budget process then I think we have an obligation to keep spending within the limits that we have previously prescribed in the first budget resolution. To do anything less I feel is irresponsible. We have been reading about the impact of Proposition 13 and what it means and what it does not mean. One lesson is clear. people are tired of watching Congress continually vote more money for pet projectswhether they be defense spending. housing. or social servicesand worrying about the consequences later. When we set budget goals each year and then turn right around and exceed them. people have a right to be skeptical. I believe that the Senate should be serious about making our budgetary process work and reject the committee recommendation before we exceed both the Presidents request and the first budget resolution for fiscal year 1979.0",

This proposal points out once again the fine line that exists between Federal protection and Federal intervention into our private lives. Before this ban is enacted. we must consider the inconvenience involved in depriving obese and diabetic individuals of saccharin. While we now suspect a possible relation beween saccharin and cancer. the dangers of diabetes. hypertension. and heart disease related to obesity are known to all. Also. I note that the danger of saccharin use does not appear to be such that the FDA required recall of products already on the market. If there were a suitable replacement for saccharin perhaps we would be facing a different problem. but it is the only artificial sweetener permitted in the American food supply. To the millions of diabetic and weightconscious people of the United States. this ban may present a health hazard greater than the possible risks of saccharin use. I feel a special sympathy for the many hundreds of diabetic children in the country. Although it is true that sweets are not nutritionally necessary. it is hard for a child to see other children eating candy and treats with no chance to enjoy them himself. Also. I reiterate that it is very hard to understand the continued sale of tobacco with its proven carcinogenic effect. while depriving Americans of saccharin. As the Delaney clause now exists. it does not permit the FDA to analyze the relative benefits of a particular food additive versus the possible risks involved in its use. It specifies only that any substance that causes cancer when consumed by man or animal must be banned. This legislation should be revised to allow the FDA to weight the risks and benefits in an additive. Time should be allowed for further study and evaluation of saccharin and its continued marketing until we have more definitive evidence that it is harmful. At the least. there should be a review. as there is to be in Canada. of the role of saccharin in special foods for diabetics and exemptions or sale by prescription through pharmacies should be permitted.",

As a result. a severe hardship will be imposed on approximately 10 million people who suffer from diabetes. millions of heart patients. and some 40 million overweight individuals who must control their weight to decrease their chances of becoming heart patients. For these people. saccharin is a necessary part of preventive medicine. This same point was made this past weekend by Dr. R. Lee Clark. the president of the American Cancer Society. While in Sarasota. Fla.. Dr. Clark stated that diabetes and obesity pose more immediate dangers than the possible cancercausing ability of saccharin. I am cosponsoring legislation. introduced by my colleague Congressman MARTIN of North Carolina. which remedies the defects of the Delaney amendment. The bill. H.R. 5166. provides a mechanism for a reconsideration of an adverse determination when an additive is found to induce cancer in test animals. Under the proposal. the petition would be able to ask the Food and Drug Administration to reconsider its decision and the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. would then be authorized to make a finding regarding the public risks and benefits of the given additive. taking into account the best evidence and expert judgment possible. before finding a substance unsafe. Corrective legislation like the Martin bill will permit Federal agencies to make their decisions in a more responsible manner in determining whether a substance should be banned from the market and I urge my colleagues to strongly support H.R. 5166.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am cosponsoring with Congressman LONG of Maryland a bill to ban steeljaw traps. These traps cause a great deal of suffering to animals. and I question the use of them from several points of view. Chairing the House Communications Subcommittee brings me into contact with a lot of people who are concerned about what we are showing our children In our own homes. They worry. for example. that there is too much violence on television. I am sympathetic to that concern. Perhaps. as parents. we are less concerned than we should be about the kinds and degrees of violence that our children see. Perhaps we should be making a greater effort to demonstrate for our children a respect for living things. Steeljaw traps are used by trappers. many of them young people. Some States pay a bounty for what are considered undesirable animals. Additional animals are trapped for the sale of desired fur pelts. The victims sometimes include household pets or endangered species. The steeljaw trap works by pinning the leg of an animal between two steel bars. Typically. the animal struggles against this restraint. Often there is a long slow death by exposure or starvation. Some animals are known actually to try chewing off the caught leg. A trapper finding a half dead animal usually mercifully clubs the struggling creature. A child observing such incidents might come to accept them as routine. and why not? They are sanctioned by most State fish and game departments. I wonder if all this may be analogous to television violence. whereby young people are inured to violence. accepting it as normal. Some will argue that violence is a normal part of nature. But predators do hot. take several days to kill their prey. Many other countries have banned the steeljaw trap. Other devices are available which are more discriminate. and more humane. Let us lose no more time in putting the United States on the right side of this issue.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in 1959 the Congress amended the Food. Drug. and Cosmetic Act of 1939 to include a clause offered by Congressman DELANEY of New York. The amendment requires that food additives be approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and \"that no additives shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal * * *\" There are no ifs. ands or buts about the regulation. the law is absolute. So when some Canadian scientists found that laboratory rats developed cancer when forcefed large amounts of a sugar substitute called saccharin. the FDA had no choice but to announce plans to ban the sale of this popular artificial sweetener. For more than 70 years saccharin has been used as a sugar substitute with no known adverse effects. In 1970. when the FDA banned the sale of another sugar substitute. cyclamate. saccharin achieved universal use. The 1970 ban left saccharin as our only known source for artificial sweeteners. To millions of Americans who are diabetic. who suffer from heart conditions. hypertension or who are overweight and depend on saccharin to control their diets. the announced ban on this artificial sweetener was a bitter pill to swallow. I suspect that if the laboratory studies had been reasonable the announced ban would have been accepted. but some very reputable organizations have shown that absurd amounts of saccharin were needed to cause cancer in the laboratory rats. Most estimates I have seen show that a human would have to consume 800 12ounce cans of diet soda a day. for life. to match the amounts of saccharin which was forcefed the rats. Certainly no one wants to allow a cancercausing substance on the market if reasonable and realistic tests demonstrate possible health hazards. The Delaney rule. however. does not allow for rationality but only looks at the bottom line result. I question the wisdom of this and I have cosponsored legislation which will set up a procedure whereby the FDA Secretary will have a select panel to evaluate a substance on a public health benefit risk basis. I believe Congress should allow commonsense to play a role in Federal regulation of food additives so as to reduce the chance of unjust. unreasonable. and unwanted intervention as in the case of the proposed saccharin ban.",

On that date in 1918. the Republic of Lithuania was created. and declared its independence from the Russian Empire. On this occasion I am proud to join with all Americans of Lithuanian descent to commemorate this anniversary. Over 1 million people of Lithuanian ancestry live in the United States. Many of them left their native land when it was occupied by Soviet troops and came to the United States. Thousands fled to. other countries and many more were interned in Siberian prison camps. In the 22 years of its independence. Lithuania. though a small nation. made great progress in reestablishing its national identity. its culture. and its society. Agriculture and industry also grew. However. this freedom was short lived. ended by the 1940 invasion of the Soviet troops. Today. despite the fact that on modern maps Lithuania is shown as being part of the territory of the Soviet Union. the U.S. Government has maintained a policy of nonrecognition of this forcible seizure of Lithuania and her neighbors. Indeed. both the President and the Congress declared in no uncertain terms that agreement with the Helsinki Accords in no way constitutes a shift in our nonrecognition policy on Lithuania. The Lithuania struggle continues to this day. Partisans of freedom and Lithuanian human rights continue their struggles. It is only fitting to pay tribute to their efforts and to the thousands of descendents and relatives that now grace this country with their work and their culture.",

Education. and Welfare to take immediate action on the implementation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 is that part of the Rehabilitation Act which prohibits discrimination against disabled citizens by recipients of Federal funds. Regulations to implement section 504 were developed last year. and have been reevaluated by an intraHEW task force. Unless regulations are signed. the handicapped will continue to be denied access to the labor force. public transportation. educational programs. hospitals. and other services. Delays in implementing section 504 have been cited as contributing to the consistently high rate of unemployment among disabled persons. which is a rate which exceeds the figures for all other categories of people. This situation will continue to exist unless the most stringent guidelines are provided affirming the responsibilities of educational institutions or employers in the treatment of the handicapped. This fall it will be 4 years since the Rehabilitation Act was passed. Urging Secretary Califano to implement the regulations expeditiously is a necessary step toward fulfilling the commitment we made in 1973 to incorporate our handicapped citizens into the mainstream of our society. Mr. Speaker. because of these long delays. the handicapped community has found it necessary to express their dissatisfaction directly to the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. Tomorrow. at 1 oclock e.s.t.. the handicapped strike. Demonstrations will begin at the 10 HEW offices across the country. including the Department headquarters here in Washington.

We in the Maryland congressional delegation knew Mr. BYRON as a Member to whom we could unhesitantly look for guidance and relentless support on numerous issues. While his constituents knew him as we did. they also knew a slightly different side. They knew the GOODLOE BYRON who was strongly dedicated to physical fitness and a strong Federal commitment for programs in this area for all Americans. The sincerity with which he addressed this issue was well illustrated. particularly by his active participation in seven of the 26mile Boston Marathons.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment is intended to remove the anomalous designation of the State of Hawaii as an international point under section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934. It would do this by amending section 222(a) (10) to include Hawaii within the definition of \"Continental United States.\" It thus would remove the applicability of the international/domestic dichotomy to the Hawaiian market and would foster competition among all carriers serving that market. My amendment would further amend section 222 by adding a new subsection. which would provide that carriers currently serving the Hawaiian market may continue to do so. Additionally. it would provide for the entry of additional carriers and the offering of new or additional services to the Hawaiian market. subject to the approval of the Federal Communications Commission. Mr. President. my amendment is identical to S. 1866 which passed the Senate unanimously last August. Before the Senate passed S. 1866. extensive hearings were held on the issue by the Senate Committee on Commerce. Science. and Transportation. Nearly all witnesses. including representatives from the State of Hawaii. the Federal Communications Commission. the IRCs. the Office of Telecommunications Policy. and Hawaiian business and consumer groups testified in favor of extending to Hawaii telecommunications services comparable to those available in the continental United States. S. 1866 is currently pending before the House Communications Subcommittee. In response to my inquiries. the chairman of that subcommittee has said he has no problem with S. 1866. but inasmuch as he believes section 222 of the Communications Act should be repealed in its entirety. he prefers to consider S. 1866 in that overall context at a later. unspecified date. Meanwhile. Mr. President. the consumers in Hawaii and those on the mainland wishing to communicate with Hawaii suffer. This situation is especially exasperating for those who wish to communicate between Hawaii and the mainland because the House could pass S. 1866. without jeopardizing its consideration of legislation to repeal section 222. In other words. the one does not preclude the other. I therefore urge the Senate to once again in the form of my amendment pass the necessary legislation to treat Hawaii equally with her 49 sister States.",

H.R. 9851 makes one limited change in Public Law 95163 which we passed last session to establish a program of regulatory reform of air cargo service.

Supplemental carriers have been pioneers in the development of allcargo equipment and have a substantial cargo life capability which they can use to provide scheduled allcargo service under the new program. Exclusion of the sup.plementals from the first stage of the program could have an adverse economic impact on these carriers since they would be subject to new competition from scheduled carriers. but would not have the opportunity to compete by instituting new scheduled allcargo service.

This legislation simply corrects a flaw in the air cargo deregulation provisions of H.R. 6010the omnibus aviation bill which was signed into law by the President on November 9. 1977 (Public Law 95163). As I stated during our conference committee deliberations on H.R. 6010. and again on the floor during consideration of the conference report. the cargo deregulation language in the billSenate language. I might addprecluded supplemental (charter) air carriers which provide allcargo service from applying immediately for new allcargo certificates. Instead. they were required to wait until 365 days after the legislation was signeduntil November 9. 1978to submit their applications. The conferees recognized that this exclusion would work to the disadvantage of the supplementals. because other allcargo air carriers would have a substantial head start in establishing service in lucrative markets. In fact. the chairman of the conference. Senator HOWARD W. CANNON. agreed with me that our intent was to apply the cargo deregulation provisions to all categories of allcargo air carriersand he went on to state that \"it was probably inadvertent on my part\" that the supplementals were not included. Because inclusion of the supplementals would have gone beyond the scope of the conferencedue to the fact that there was no House provision on cargo deregulationthe conferees decided to go with the Senate languageand remedy the problem involving the supplementals at a later date. The bill before us today. H.R. 9851. accomplishes this result. It places the allcargo supplemental air carriers on the same footing as all other allcargo carriers in terms of their eligibility for new allcargo certificatesalthough it is true that they will be penalized to some degree because the Civil Aeronautics Board already has issued 54 new allcargo certificates under the authority provided in Public Law 95163. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 9851. Equity and fair play dictate that we eliminate the present disparity in the lawand it is essential that we have prompt action.

The legislation introduced by the gentleman from California and others is of great interest to the citizens of Alabama. Being off the mainstream of most trunk carrier service routes. the cities of Alabama have for the most part not received the air freight and mail service enjoyed by others. The rapidly growing industrial centers in Alabama require healthy allcargo service patterns in order to provide the product distribution capabilities necessary to compete in both domestic and world markets. The supplemental carriers. many of which presently fly scheduled allcargo service domestically for the Department of Defense. have the fleets of allcargo aircraft to greatly improve this .short to medium haul lift. Additionally. as was mentioned. it was the initial congressional intent to test the deregulation theories. particularly that of free entry. on the air cargo industry. Without the presence of the supplementals. the free entry provision would only receive token attention. The 401(d) (1) carriers who presently qualify for the grandfather provision of H.R. 6010 basically operate allcargo aircraft suited primarily to longhaul high density markets. Their economic ability to enter the short and medium haul markets are either limited or nonexistent. The other group of carriers qualifying under the grandfather provision operate small air taxi type equipment. not suitable for larger shipments or the majority of air cargo containers presently in use today.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. throughout 1977. committees in both Houses of Congress devoted considerable time and attention to legislation which would substantially deregulate the air transportation industry. The adoption of meaningful deregulation legislation. however. has been delayed due to the many questions which have been raised as to whether free market entry would create destructive overcapacity on some routes and reduced service on others. and whether greater pricing freedom would damage the shaky financial condition of some of our major scheduled passenger carriers. It finally was decided that the air cargo industry--severely underdeveloped from the beginning---could be used to test the highly controversial issues of a total deregulation billwithout running the risk of derogating our existing scheduled passenger service. In the fall of 1977. the Senate added an amendment to the omnibus aviation bill which provided for deregulation of the air cargo industry. The language. however. as my colleagues have noted. precluded the immediate certification of supplemental carriersthereby creating not only a competitive disadvantage for them. but also failing to accomplish the stated purpose of the bill. Prior to the enactment of H.R. 6010 into lawin fact during the conference on H.R. 6010some of my colleagues on the conference committee pointed out the error. but. due to the legislative situation. the necessary changes could not then be incorporated in the bill. In order to remedy the problem. and with the full concurrence of the Senate conferees and the able and willing assistance of the gentlemen from California . H.R. 9851 was developed and promptly reported by both the Aviation Subcommittee and the full Committee on Public Works and Transportation. Mr. Speaker. enactment of H.R. 9851 is a matter of simple justice. It will provide for inclusion of our supplemental air carriers in the allcargo deregulation programalong with the other allcargo carriers already covered by Public Law 95163. The supplementals operate the majority of the large. modern allcargo aircraft in our civil fleet. Several have been true pioneers in aviation development over the years.

During that time the income of executives in the country went up 59 percent. the cost of living went up over 60 percent. and we voted over a 65percent increase for all other Federal employees. Everybody knew that for that same 8year period a 5percent increase for Federal judges. the top scientists at NIH. top executive branch officers and the Congress. was inadequate.

I do not believe support of tax credits can be equated to nonsupport of public education. It is not the public schools which are loosing students because of inflation and I have seen absolutely nothing in the way of surveys or statistics to indicate that there will be a mass exodus from the public schools with the passage of this bill. I have heard it said that this bill will be some kind of a windfall for the richwell. if $250 represents a windfall to someone who is considered wealthy. then all I can say is our economy is in worse shape than anyone imagined. I say this $250 represents nothing more than a recognition that tuition costs are as legitimate and allowable an expense as. say. interest payments. Besides. no matter what rhetoric we have heard today. the fact is that those who will benefit most will be the middleclass taxpayerremember him? He is the one who has been picking up the tab for all the other educational help programs his kids cannot participate in. I have also heard it said that the bill is unconstitutional. I realize this is a debatable question. and while I believe this is no more unconstitutional than tax deductions for contributions to churches. I say let us give it a try and let the Supreme Court decide the issue. Finally. I believe the crux of this whole issue is freedom of choice in education because with the financial pressure created by high taxes and runaway inflation. the only people who will be able to afford a choice will be the rich. I say. let us give the folks who have been working so hard to pay the enormous bill of Government a small break. Let us let these folks keep a tiny bit more of what is theirs in the first place.

Clearly. the Kremlin feels that this inquisition will intimidate others from proclaiming the fundamental human freedoms that are the birthright of every man and woman. As President Carter declared before the United Nations: No member of the United Nations can claim that mistreatment of its citizens is solely Its own business.

The \"right to freedom of opinion and expression.\" the \"right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.\" and the right of everyone \"to leave any country. including his own. and to return to his country\" are all guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and systematically denied by the Soviet Union.

It is for the Raiz family. their 7monthold son Moshe and other Soviet Jews who are being detained in the U.S.S.R. as a result of their Governments repressive emigration policies. that we are here today in Congress conducting this vigil. Vladimir and Carmella Raiz of Vilnius have applied numerous times for exit visas since 1972. It is their dream to join their relatives in Israel. Their application was denied by the local chief of OVIR who said that Dr. Raiz. a molecular biologist at the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Academy of Sciences. was in possession of secret scientific information. However. the institute has certified that his research was conducted over 14 years ago and is no longer considered secret. The Raiz family has endured considerable hardship since first applying for an exit visa 6 years ago. Dr. Raiz was fired from the institute. and has been working at menial jobs ever since. Mrs. Raiz. a violinist in the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. was also fired. In May. Mrs. Raiz wrote: Every day is a terror. I never know If my husband will return when he leaves for work. The Soviets are trying to cut off the Raiz communication with the rest of the world. In 1975. the Raiz phone was temporarily disconnected and they were warned it would be permanently disconnected if they again used it for international phone calls or for calls by tourists visiting them. Last month. I wrote to Chairman Brezhnev. Ambassador Dobrynin. and the chief of the OVIR urging their reconsideration of the Raiz visa request. I have not received a reply. In addition. I wrote to Dr. Raiz through registered mail. I have yet to receive the return receipt and fear he is not receiving his mail.

This is the first kidnaping of an Italian political figure since the end of World War II. The severe political turbulence which has rocked Italy in recent months has been fueled by a rash of political assassinations and kidnapings committed by Fascistbased terrorist organizations. The kidnaping of such a prominent figure as Aldo Moro. demonstrates to the people of Italy that the terrorists will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. Beyond the personal tragedy involved. this kidnaping will have broad political ramifications in Italy. The most immediate concern is the impact it will have on the recent agreement worked out by current Premier Andreotti to give the Communists a role in government for the first time in 31 years. Moro played a key role in the development of this agreement. If this arrangement does not materialize. the tenuous fibers of Italian democracy could be worn to their limit.

Of much greater concern than the quantitative dollaryen relationship. however. is the apparent disharmony caused by American and Japanese efforts to bolster the respective economies. Ambassador Mansfield correctly identified as a major problem the perception that the Japanese market is less open to our goods than is our market to Japans product. Certainly there are examples of \"administrative guidance\" and quotas that support this interpretation. On numerous occasions. as chairman of the East Asian Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have enunciated my conviction that diligent. cooperative efforts are the only means of easing the growing frictions between the United States and Japan. Mr. President. it is with these concerns that I shall submit for the RECORD an insightful article written by James N. Wallace which appeared in the U.S. News & World Report of August 14. 1978. His observations are persuasive evidence of the critical need to intensify our com*As included in the U.S. Munitions List. a part of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). mitment to spanning the gap which the current economic imbalance has widened.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to an article which appears in the August 21 issue of Forbes magazine. \"KempRoth and Proposition 13: The Cart Before the Horse?\" It discusses an important alternative to the drastic taxcutting proposals which are now before the Congress. The alternative I speak of is the \"Sunset\" plan proposed by my distinguished colleague from Maine. Senator ED MUSKIE. The plan would provide for review of about onefifth of Federal spending programs every 2 years. Under the Sunset plan. Congress would have a chance to evaluate the worth of existing programs and eliminate those which it found to be wasteful or ineffective. It could also reduce duplication of programs in different agencies of the Government. This proposal would enable us to reduce Federal spending in a far more rational. sensible manner than would be possible under proposals like proposition 13 or the KempRoth tax cut bill. KempRoth type proposals constitute \"meat ax\" legislation: they would have us take a wild chop at Federal spending. rather than permit the kind of skillful surgery which is really needed. Tax cut plans encourage the Governmert to increase deficit spending or cut back programs at random. It would be far better for the Congress to review the laws and programs it has already established. making rational and careful judgments about which programs need to be cut or reduced in spending. as Senator MUSKIE has proposed. I support Senator MUSKIES Sunset bill. I urge my colleagues to give it careful consideration. In order that Members of the Senate may read about it. I ask that the Forbes article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. an editorial in the Washington Star on August 13 demonstrated the core of the controversy over building the Seabrook Nuclear Generating Station. The regulatory redtape involved in construction and licensing of nuclear powerplants has needlessly delayed a worthwhile project. Because of Government regulations. it now takes 10 to 12 years to license and construct a nuclear plant in the United States. roughly twice the length of time it takes in other countries. For each year that completion is delayed. an additional $120 million is added to the cost of a nuclear plant. A reduction in licensing and construction time from 11 years to 8 years would reduce the average familys electric bill by $40 per month over the life of the reactor. Mr. President. due in large part to the efforts of Governor Thomson of New Hampshire. the delays in construction at Seabrook may be over. The Senator from Kansas hopes that the tribulations of Seabrook will persuade Congress to correct the bureaucratic mess that threatened to prevent construction of the Seabrook plant. Mr. President.

When Paul assumed the papacy in 1963. his tenure began in the midst of a time of selfexamination by the church. Pope Paul continued with the Second Vatican Council begun by Pope John XXIII. a gathering which resulted in reforms for the Catholic Church. Paul implemented those reforms he found essential for the modernization of the church and rejected those he felt were not in keeping with the churchs strong traditions. Pope Pauls keen insight and forward thinking enabled him to guide the Catholic Church into a changing society without breaking with centuries of tradition. Chief among Pope Pauls attributes was his commitment to peace. He traveled to every continent but one during his papacy carrying this message. And his struggle for peace and justice extended to a wide range of situations. Paul was equally at home with factory workers and heads of state as he sought to overcome the ills that plague society. No burden was too great for His Holiness. He accepted each challenge with equanimity. Pope Pauls stature and compassion as a church leader and as a world leader will not easily be matched. He will be missed. but the presence he brought to bear during his days on Earth will remain with us.0",

Several bills for the settlement of these socalled \"d2\" lands are now before Congress. Mr. President. as the senior Senator for Alaska has pointed out on many occasions. Alaska is a special kind of Statea State where the lifestyle of the people is closely tied to the use of the land. Alaskans have consistently sought to protect Alaskan wildlife species and scenic wonders of national importance. In fact. twothirds of the wildlife refuges in the United States and 24 percent of the Nations national parks are already located in Alaska. But. in the face of legislation which would create over 100 million acres of park systems and include 75 million acres of wilderness. Alaskans rightly fear that the traditional uses on which their lifestyles have depended will be severely restricted. It is hard for us here to understand the vast amounts of land in question or the magnitude of the decision before us. The area considered by some of the legislation is onefifth of the State of Alaska15 times the total land area of the State of Maryland. As Senator STEVENS stated in a recent article in the Baltimore Sun. the decision on numbers of acres is far less important than the decision on what activities will be allowed on these lands. We must allow flexibility of management for this vast amount of land. These lands are de facto wilderness and we do have a chance to do some real planning to accommodate all of the interests. As Senator STEVENS pointed out. \"We must strike a balance--environmental protection and enough flexibility to allow development for recreations and other uses and to permit decisions about use in the future to be made as circumstances require.\" I ask that the recent article by Senator STEVENS be printed in the RECORD.",

And five timesin 1950. 1970. 1971. 1973. and 1976the committee favorably reported the treaty to the Senate. How did the Senate respond to the committees recommendation? On each of these occasions. the Senate refused to ratify the Genocide Treaty. We have not joined the 83 nations that have outlawed the crime of genocide. For 11 years. I have urged my fellow Senators to ratify the Genocide Convention. Last month. when I concluded my July 31 speech. I was pleased and proud to learn that my friend. Senator JAVITS. will attempt to place the treaty on the Foreign Relations agenda early in the next session. I salute the distinguished Senator from New York for his strong and consistent support of the Genocide Convention. His announcement has renewed my commitment to the treaty. I am even more determined to see it ratified in the next session. Mr. President. this will be the sixth time that the committee has taken up the Genocide Convention. What can we expect from the committees deliberations? Will they again favorably report the treaty? Undoubtedly. they will. The case for the Genocide Convention is stronger than ever. Daily we are reminded of atrocities perpetrated against many of the worlds citizens. Need I mention Cambodia. Uganda. or Nicaragua. President Carter strongly supports the convention. as do many major interest groups. including the American Bar Association. We continuously reaffirm our official commitment to human rights. yet we have failed to ratify this crucial human rights document. Our support for the Genocide Convention has never been more important. The Foreign Relations Committee will undoubtedly agree with me. But what about the Senate? Will the Senate oppose the committee a sixth time? Will we again fail to protect the most fundamental of human rightsthe right to live? I sincerely hope not. Mr. President. I call upon my colleagues to reflect seriously upon the Genocide Convention. In the coming months. I trust that each and every Senator will ask what he or she can do to further the cause of human rights. What can we do. Mr. President?

Under current law. enacted as Public Law 93340 in 1974. the various Federal agencies withhold local income taxes when both the worksite and the Federal employees residence are within the local jurisdictions boundaries. The withholding of local taxes for Federal employees who live within a locality but are employed elsewhere in the same State is voluntary. This situation has led to problems for both Federal agencies and employees. as well as for the cities and counties which impose such local earnings taxes. This bill. Mr. Speaker. would correct these problems by requiring the withholding of local earnings taxes from Federal employees who live within a locality. but work at a Federal agency located outside of that locality. as well as requiring withholding of local earnings taxes fron. Federal employees who live outside of that locality. but work at a Federal agency within it. The legislation is virtually identical to a bill the House passed in the last Congress. and is supported by the Department of the Treasury and the various cities and counties which impose local earnings taxes. The 1974 law. Mr. Speaker. authorized the Department of the Treasury to enter into tax withholding agreements with cities. While that legislation provided for mandatory withholding from employees who worked in a taxing city. it did not require withholding from employees who resided in that city but worked elsewhere. The Treasury Department and the Civil Service Commission did place in effect in 1975 some procedures which allowed employees who are not residents of cities. but who are subject to these earnings taxes by virtue of local ordinances. to have the city tax withheld on a voluntary basis. This bill. Mr. Speaker. which I have cosponsored. would extend this type of withholding by making it mandatory rather than voluntary. I urge the enactment of H.R. 8342.

In addition. it will authorize for those optometrists and veterinarians who came on active duty on or after July 1. 1975. the same $100 monthly special pay which is payable to optometrists and veterinarians who entered active duty before that date. The amount of the special pays range from $100 to $350 monthly. In addition. there is a variable incentive pay ranging up to $13.500 annually for medical officers in pay grades 03 through 06. A special continuation pay of up to 4 months basic pay is authorized for dental officers and for those flag officers who are not entitled to the variable incentive pay. S. 1731 is similar to the bill H.R. 8011reported June 30in all aspects except the type of extension authorizing special pay to optometrists and veterinarians. The House bill has no expiration date for these payments. the Senatepassed bill has an expiration date for all special pays and bonuses of September 30. 1978.

My concern is with the potential impact on recruitment and retention efforts directed at physicians and dentists. I can think of nothing more discouraging to those efforts than to see headlines in the Stars and Stripes or the Service Times stating \"Doctors Bonuses in Doubt\" or \"Doctors Bonuses Delayed.\" The doctor shortage is real. Although a Defense witness indicated that they expect an overall shortage of 6.4 percent. the shortage at particular bases will be much larger. I have seen this in my district as I am sure many of you have also. As a result. military hospital care is not available for retirees or their dependents at some locations.

This particular proposal was described as a model way to handle this problem. I do not think it is. The last gentleman in the well said this burden should be placed on the coal industry. I am not sure it should be. Are we then going to say. in the case of asbestosis. that the burden should be placed on the asbestos industry or the building industry? We are setting an extremely poor precedent for handling of occupational diseases with this bill. Black lung is a mistake. to start with. If we are going to contin!e this. it is going to come back and haunt us very quickly. The system cannot stand it. We cannot use it for the handling of byssinosis or a model for handling some of the carcinogens which are being discovered today. when the employer or industry. or anyone else. did not know they existed. ! think at some point we are going to have to say that this will be a burden to society. We should handle it on a disability basis but not on the basis of either years in the mines or years in employment. We should in fact say that we will pay people if they have the disease. This bill is a charade. because one does not have to have the disease. One does not even have to show that he has the disease. and in fact. if there is evidence to show that he does not have it. the Government or the operator is precluded from offering it. That is a little bit ridiculous. it seems to me. No one worries about tomorrow. it seems. nor about what we are doing today in the coal industry. Most of us care about the coal industry evidently. but yet there are very few Members on the floor listening to this debate. Where do we go tomorrow if this is going to be the great guide for the handling of occupational diseases? This would be a great disaster. Mr. Chairman. it is for those reasons that I believe the Erlenborn substitute certainly provides the logic and the reasoning to deal with this problem. and that is why I support it.",

After listening to the previous colloquy and the references made to the States workmens compensation funds. many Members might be led to believe that the State workmens compensation funds should not be required to pay benefits. This seems like a rather strange argument. I thought that is what the State workmens compensation funds were for. Just over the weekend I was talking to several of my constituents who make very high contributions to the State workmens compensation funds because they are in industries that traditionally have frequent injuries. Their risk is higher. so their contribution rate is higher. Are we establishing the idea that State workmens compensation funds are no longer going to be responsible for injuries or illnesses that take place in their States? The State obviously gets the benefit of the coal mines. it gets the benefit of the industry. Are they trying to say now that we do not want the workmens compensation funds to pay benefits for Pennsylvania or West Virginia or Ohio workers who are injured through activities that take place in those States? The employers pay premiums into the workmens compensation funds largely for that reason. and now we have arguments here that workmens compensation funds should not cover this kind of an illness or injury. I would like to have the comment of my colleague. the gentleman from Connecticut . who is one of the most learned members of the committee on this particular aspect in the area of workmens compensation. I thought this was a rather curious idea. the thought that we might no longer make the workmens compensation funds of the State pay for injuries that occur in that State. That is the usual reason for having a workmens compensation program.",

I must say. however. that I am very sorry that the Senate has seen fit to deny the widows of our World War I veterans with an additional 25percent pension which the original House bill called for. I am. however. going to support this measure because of the provisions which have been left in the bill. The 6.5percent costofliving increase. plus the increase in the earnings limitation. will be most welcome to our veteran pensioners and their eligible dependents. The Veterans and Survivors Pension Adjustment Act of 1977 is very important for several reasons. The first. of course. is the costofliving increase. which will be important to all of our pensioners. The mere fact alone that the VA pension program is a needsbased one is justification alone. I would be remiss if I did not expand a bit more on my disappointment with the decision made by the Senate to delete the pension addon for widows upon reaching their 78th year. Last Congress. we approved a 25percent addon for the veteran upon reaching the age of 78. It seems to me that extending this additional assistance to widows is most definitely the obvious next step. Our committee hearings showed. and I think commonsense shows. that the financial impact on our older citizens is a critical one. If one qualifies for a needsbased pension. I think the fact of the impact is even more obvious. When a woman reaches the age of 78 and has lost her husband. as well as living near the poverty level. that is very conclusive. I believe. But unfortunately the Senate sees it another way. I do not know the reasoning behind their decision. It most certainly could not be the cost. The 25percent addon would amount to only $34.5 million in fiscal year 1978. At the rate the Senate likes to add to money bills that does not even make a drop in the bucket. It is truly unfortunate. So. with reluctance. I urge all of the Members to support this measure so that those pensioners will receive the costofliving increase. which they so definitely need.",

The gentleman was quite prepared to respond to those comments in a very vigorous way and to defend the impact upon Puerto Ricos economy by the private investments that have taken place there. Unfortunately. the gentleman is not on the floor at the moment. Let me just mention one or two figures. From 1950 through 1976. net income per capita in Puerto Rico increased from $279 to $1.989.

The uncertainty regarding the dollar is jeopardizing not only the efforts of American business to move abroad. but jeopardizing investment in this country. That is a heavy contributor to our imbalance in payments. I think we are dealing here with very critical matters and we just cannot drive it through on the basis of putting statements in the RECORD. Therefore. I should like to ask the Senator from Delaware the following: The bill is supposed to raise the ceiling on direct loans to firms under the Trade Adjustment Act from $1 to $3 million and on loan guarantees from $3 to $5 million. What has happened to that in the amendment?",

Second. it permits no new waivers as of October 15hopefully. the day by which we adjourn. but one. But if there is going to be any new waiver granted. it would have to be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury that such a waiver Is essential to bringing the country in which such article or merchandise is produced into becoming a signatory to the agreement or agreements governing the use of agricultural or industrial subsidies. In other words. what we have provided to the administration is something they had not previously thought of as a very strong lever. Let us say that the Brazilians. who have been subsidizing textile imports into this countryif we can get the Brazilians to sign an agreement to phase out their subsidies. in 1. 2. or 3 years. for a date certain. this is to everybodys advantage. Then the amendment provides that the President may continue the authority I have just described on countervailing duties past February 15. only under two circumstances: First. that he makes a number of important certifications to Congress and describes the new substantive rules governing export subsidies. describes with particularity the provisions governing consultation and dispute settlement. describes with particularity the provisions governing notificationand all these things as to what they do and why they constitute a significant improvement over present foreign national government practices and policies.

The amendment is a modification of provisions which were included in H.R. 7200. which went by the board when its provisions were deleted and the sugar bill added in its stead. I have long been solicitous of the rights of welfare recipients and the need to provide adequately for those who are in need. This amendment might at first blush seem uncharacteristic. because it may tend to reduce a welfare recipients grant. However. this is a matter of trying to adjust a situation in a household where there may be a number of people contributing to the family income who do not qualifly for welfare assistance and it will therefore permit a prorating of the shelter payment. and that. it seems to me. is a fair test in respect of what welfare amount shall be paid. The amendment would provide that when total family income. including those of noneligible relatives. exceeds the State standard of need. a recipients grant for shelter would be prorated in proportion to the number of ineligible persons in the household. In determining income. work expenses and mandatory payments such as child support would be deducted to reach countable Income. This is the same test as is applied to applicants for welfare. In States that do not designate a separate shelter allowance. a fiat 30 percent of the grant would be deemed to be shelter. The welfare dollars in States are severely limited.

This bill provides that when an artist dies. his art work. manuscripts. compositions. and similar material will. for estate tax purposes only. be valued at the cost of the materials in the work and not its market value. If during his lifetime an artist gives his work to a nonprofit. taxexempt organization. such as a museum or library. his only tax deduction is the cost of materials in the work. Hence. it is only fair to tax his estate accordingly. Unfortunately. because of the unfairness of the present law. the family of an artist is often forced to sell a majority of the deceased persons work on the open market. the value of the work is drastically deflated. In addition. the estate is then forced to pay income tax on the sale of the work. thus paying a double tax. Under present tax laws a maximum of 15 percent tax on earned Income. goes up to 70 percent on \"passive\" income. Passive income consists of earnings from such sources as dividends. royalties and interest. where no physical effort produced the income. Therefore. the heirs of the artist receive income from a source they did not help create and which may be subject to a 70 percent tax rate. It is clear from the legislative history of both the 1950 enactment of the Internal Revenue Code and the 1969 amendments that it was never legislative intent to penalize the estates and heirs of qualified creative artists. Naturally. under the proposed revision. if the heirs sell the art work they will still pay an ordinary income tax on the total sales price over the cost of materials. America is losing thousands of valuable art works each year as artists destroy their unsold work rather than place an untold financial burden on their families. I hope that all of us in Congress will act swiftly to pass this legislation and put an end to this oversight in the current tax law before an entire era of American art and reflective history is lost forever.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the least concrete. but most important. considerations that must be weighed in deciding the fate of the boundary waters canoe area in northern Minnesota is the need to set aside areas in which people can experience the solitude and tranquility of a natural setting undisturbed by human manipulation. The national wilderness preservation system was established to protect areas in which \"the Earth and its community of life retains its primeval character and where the imprint of mans work is substantially unnoticeable.\" In these areas. one might observe natures community as it was before humans entered the balance. Margot Hornblower of the Washington Post recently traveled to the BWCA in an attempt to capture the flavor of the controversies that have surrounded the area since enactment of the 1964 Wilderness Act. She filed two articles. both draw attention to the basic struggle between the \"wilderness ethic\" and the feeling that multiple economic and recreational uses best serve the interests of the majority of the people. One hand. she records the strong antiwilderness feelings of many local residents. On the other hand. she quotes two of the most eloquent spokesmen for wilderness preservation. Miron Heinselman and Sigurd Olsen. Heinselman. a retired forester. observes: People who live in an urban society have no ide. how drastically man has changed the world. We are just beginning to understand life systemsfrom plants to man. We ought not to destroy the last remnants of the natural world until we know more about it. Olsen. a writer. says: The average urbanite thinks wilderness is a place to go fishing. But once youve been there a few days. you start noticing the sunsets and the calling of the loons. A certain calm descends on you. The preservation of wilderness is more than rocks. trees. beautiful lakes and riversits the salvation of the human soul. It satisfies our hunger to experience the primitive. the natural world. It is all too easy to lose sight of these values when confronted with a problem as complex and long standing as the fate of the boundary waters. The Hornblower articles help keep these values in perspective. I commend them to my colleagues attention: [From the Washington Post. June 19. 1977]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday we saw tens of thousands of women. men. and children united across party. geographic. ethnic. and economic lines. marching to proclaim their support for the extension of the equal rights amendment. Today. as National ERA Lobby Day progresses we have all been visited by many of our constituents. and by lobbyists groups who seek our support on the extension resolution. The ERA. as you are all aware. is designed to eradicate the discriminatory loopholes in statutes as they currently stand. I have found that there are 800 laws on both Federal and State levels which systematically discriminate against women. These include inheritance tax statutes. scholarship and fellowship availability. employment opportunity laws. and penal code provisions. The ratification of the equal rights amendment is not merely a symbolic act. or an empty gesture. it is a real and necessary measure which must be passed now. if we are to achieve the equality in life and law for which we all strive. Unfortunately. the amendment is in peril of dying if the extension resolution is not passed. We cannot let it die. Currently. 35 of the 38 States necessary for the ratification of ERA have approved it. but the time limitation placed on the measure at its inception in 1972 will run out as of March 22. 1978a mere 6 months away. When the 92d Congress sent the ERA to the States for ratification. and arbitrarily decided 7year \"deadline\" was included with the amendment. The 7year time limit was imposed before many of us joined this congressional body. This Congress has the absolute and unrevocable authority to prescribe or determine the time within which State legislatures may effectively ratify a proposed constitutional amendment. We face a great moral dilemma if the extension resolution is not acted upon favorably. Thirtyfive State legislatures. representing twothirds of the population of the United States have ratified the ERA. We. as elected representatives. would do a grave disservice. not only to ourselves. but to all the American people if we allow the equal rights amendment to fail. On behalf of all those thousands who came to Washington yesterday to show their support. I urge my colleagues. especially those who serve on the Judiciary Committee. to vote in favor of the extension resolution for the ratification of the equal rights amendment.*",

I suggest department stores. office work. or construction. In nearly every case. they make it plain they want to go to work for the Government. Most of them seem to feel that they are going to make more money by working for the Government than they can make in private industry. Today we are interested in balancing the budget. We should also stabilize civil service and not increase its size. We want to keep Government wages in line but it may be that the full pay package in the Government is substantially more than the private sector. Another evidence of this is the fact that so few people leave the Government for other jobs. And when we check to see why they left. we find that many senior employees are leaving because they are able to draw early retirement from the Government and then go out and take a job in private industry in addition. There are other advantages to Government employment. The chances of being fired in the Government are practically impossible. This means you have permanent job security. I was interested in a report by Ms. Sharon Smith that was reported in the Washington Post. Ms. Smith had published a book last year by Princeton University where she made an in depth study of the Washington pay schedule. The Smith report was furnished to the OMB and to congressional staff.

PCP is the most dangerous drug on the streets of our city today. An increasing number of young people are experimenting and/or continually using this drug each day. While many experts differ over the effects of marihuana and cocaine. there is no dispute over the serious health effects the use of PCP will have on any individual who continues to use this drug. I hope my colleagues will take the time to read this informative editorial. THE ULTIMATE Low \"Angel dust\" has no heavenly qualities. Narcotics officers call it the most dangerous drug on the street today. It is an anesthetic with hallucinogenic properties. Even heavy drug users shy away from it. But \"angel dust\"-also known as PCP. for 1-(1phencyclohexyl) piperidineis relatively cheap and easy to make. It is therefore popular. and alarmingly popular among teenagers seeking the ultimate high. \"Weve had people in our clinic who have to physically climb up on a scale on their hands and knees when we asked them to get weighed. They literally dont know up from down.\" said a San Franciscan who is an expert on the drug. \"Theyre glassyeyed. and they have trouble telling you their names.\" Worse. they may die while under the influence of PCP. Water attracts PCP users because they like the way it feels. but. not knowing which way theyre swimming. theyve been known to drown even in shallow water. PCP users can become extremely violent.

They organized a public protest demonstration to plead their emigration cases. Such demonstrations are perfectly legal under the Soviet constitution. One may well ask whose actions were more malicious and hooligan in naturethose of the accused or those of the accusers.

The United States and its NATO allies realize that any probability of war in Europe equates to a war starting on NATO territory.

His views and support have always been greatly valued in the Armed Services Committee on critical matters concerning our Nations defense and security. I understand and appreciate the Presidents desire to further the Nations efforts toward the goal of arms control and peace throughout the world. I also believe the President sincerely believes that the cause of peace might be advanced by his proposed deferral of the production phase of this new development in the nuclear weapons field. On the other hand. I believe that after consideration of all the facts related to this matter. our interests would be better served if we proceeded with the production of these weapons. As the Secretary of Defense stated last Sunday. the actual availability of such weapons which. of course. requires entry into the production phase. best serves the Nations military objectives. In addition. the clear defensive nature of these weapons cannot be questioned. Our potential adversaries. contrary to their published statements. understand this. This fact. along with the positive indication of our commitment to do whatever we consider necessary to assure our security should. in my view. further efforts by the Soviets to attain real disarmament objectives. I believe the views set down in our recent letter to the President express the principal considerations relative to this matter. I would like to include this letter at this point in the RECORD. The letter follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. first it was the B1 bomber. Now it is the neutron bomb. They are different weapon systems but their fate. so far as I can see. is the same. Each is essential to our national defense and the defense of the free world. Each provides a service that no other weapon or weapon system can provide. Yet each has been cast aside by President Carter without getting anything in return from the Soviet Union. I realize that the official version of the Presidents decision is that we are holding off production in hope the Soviet Union will make a concession. But now we learn that the Secretary of Defense is saying the neutron bomb is \"not vital.\" I believe we are being given a very strong hint as to where the administration is leading us. There are hundreds of learned documents. thousands of hours of arguments. and many. many experts involved in this debate. But what it has come down to is the view of President Carter as to what is best for this country. As much as I wish I could agree with him. the facts of the matter are. to me. absolutely compelling: NATO forces without the neutron bomb will be pushed back to the sea in a matter of days if the Soviet Union. with its overwhelming lead in tanks. decides to invade the West. The Soviet Unions massive. well coordinated propaganda campaign against the neutron bomb and the advice of some of the Presidents senior officials have carried the day. I wish I could say that this incident is one that can be written off as an accident. a mistake in judgment. But I fear it is not. I fear that it accurately reflects the Carter administrations views on national defense. The President evidently believes that if you make enough unilateral concessions to the Soviets. they will make concessions in return. If that idea were not so tragic in its implications I would laugh. The question is no longer one about the B1 or the neutron bomb. The question is one about the competence. the philosophy. and the will of the administration in matters of national security. Mr. Speaker. we are in trouble. Period.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the course which President Carter has followed with respect to the neutron warhead is not that which I recommended. In an individual letter I sent to him shortly before his decision. I urged him to proceed with production of the weapon at full speed. while at the same time inviting the Soviets to offer us an arms control proposal which would give us an incentive to trade it off. Mr. Carter has not followed my advice. But it seems to me the course he has chosen does capture the essence of what those of us who supported the enhanced radiation warhead were trying to do. The initial stages of the program will now proceed at a vigorous pace. If the Russians respond by offering a satisfactory tank reduction or termination of the SS20. we will be able to negotiate a termination of our neutron program. If they do not. we can and presumably will proceed to convert our new warheads to the neutron configuration. Since Mr. Carter appears to have captured about 90 percent of the best of both worlds. it is my view that criticism of his decision on the grounds of weakening the defense of Europe. or of giving in to the Soviets. is inappropriate and not based on reality.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the automobile emission section in S. 252 has serious implications for the protection of public health. It would again delay the implementation of pollution controls on auto emissions and weaken the ultimate standards to allow more nitrogen oxide pollution from cars. Supporters of this section. as well as supporters of industry efforts to further weaken automobile emission standards. argue that stringent control of automobile pollution is not needed to protect public health. They also argue that the technology to reduce automobile pollution is expensive and involves a substantial decrease in fuel economy. These arguments are not supported by the facts. Stringent control of auto pollution is needed to reduce the incidence of respiratory disease and to reduce the presence of cancercausing substances in the air. Furthermore. the necessary technology is available. And. this technology can be employed at reasonable cost with no loss of fuel economy. S. 252 allows for a 1year extension of emission standards. We support this provision. Without this relief. auto manufacturers might have to shut down in We do not support. however. the committees stand on longterm nitrogen emissions. The committee proposes to relax the 0.4 gram per mile NO. standard to 1 gram per mile. allowing 250 percent more pollution from cars. This is neither necessary nor safe. The amendment we are introducing today strengthens S. 252s ultimate nitrogen oxide standard by requiring a 0.4 gram per mile NO standard in 1983. together with a flexible financial incentive program of noncompliance penalties and rebates. The administration has endorsed the approach taken in this amendment. but the Presidents recommendation to Congress provides that the adoption of this approach be left up to administration discretion. Our amendment differs from the administrations recommendation only in that the 0.4 gram per mile standard and penaltyrebate prograri would be established by congressional mandate and not be left to the discretion of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. President. Mr. Douglas Costle of the Environmental Protection Agency testified before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that current evidence points toward the need for a 0.4 gram per mile NO. standard. We agree with Mr. Costle and ask that our colleagues act on that evidence when the Senate takes up S. 252 by rejecting efforts to weaken the committee will and by supporting our amendment.",

Extensive hearings have been held before several House and Senate committees. Careful balancing of the protection of the public health and safety and possible medical benefits is imperative. In the Washington Post of May 24. 1977. Victor Cohn has written about the recent breakthrough in insulin production using recombinant DNA techniques. The worlds diabetics are nearly outstripping the ability of current technology to sunply sufficient insulin to maintain their lives. This breakthrough holds the promise of producing virtually unlimited quantities of insulin. However. we must not allow the promise of future benefits to override careful consideration of the safety aspects. Current guidelines from the National Institutes of Health cover only a part of the research now underway or proposed. They do not directly address the question of production of recombinant DNA products such as insulin. As an interim measure the NIH guidelines must be extended to all research and careful study must be given to revising them if necessary. I have introduced legislation to this end. S. 945 would extend the guidelines to all researchers and create a national commission to study the current and anticipated impact of recombinant DNA research and technology on health. safety. and society.

Although I am delighted with this longawaited good news. I am disturbed by the lack of stability which plagues the housing industry. Each turn that the economy takes is magnified in the housing industrya recession in the rest of the economy will insure a housing depression. as we have recently seen. This depression. of course. is felt throughout the housingrelated industries such as the lumber. insulation. concrete. furniture. appliance industries. and the like. Our economy simply cannot afford to have the housing industry fluctuate so severely in response to swings elsewhere in the economy. Housing simply should not be a boom or bust industry. Not only is this phenomenon detrimental to the rest of the economy. but it also deprives Americans of the opportunity for home ownership. It is important that each American be assured of a decent and affordable home. A housing slump not only limits the units available. but. in doing so. drives up their prices. The March 1977 median price of a new home was $46.000. up 6 percent from March 1976. and 18 percent from March 1975. At this pace. it is becoming increasingly difficult for young families to purchase homes. At this point I would like to call your attention to the legislation I have introduced to create a Federal Housing Bank. This bank would make mortgage funds available for home purchases at no more than 6 percent for most mortgages and on a consistent basis related to housing needs. I cannot overstate the importance of such legislation. The Federal Government must not leave the fluctuations of this important sector to the capriciousness of the private market exclusively. We must insure potential homeowners low interest rates. market stability. and affordable homes. Without these. homeownership will become a privilege reserved only for the wealthiest segments of our population. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. last week Secretary of State Vance made an important trip to Argentina. Brazil. and Venezuela. The key issues on his agenda were nuclear nonproliferation. world oil prices. and human rights. In this connection. the Coalition for a New Foreign and Military Policy wrote asking him to encourage the Argentine Government to account completely for over 15.000 persons who have been kidnapped or detained. to permit prisoners under the state of seige to exercise their constitutional right to leave the country for exile. to provide safe passage for those who have taken refuge in foreign embassies. and to begin the essential process of restoring democratic rule. When I met with Secretary Vance on November 17. I urged him to act favorably on the Coalitions requests. drew his attention to a number of particularly urgent cases which remain unresolved. and reminded him of continuing concern in the Senate about abuse of the most elementary human rights in Argentina. It is my understanding that the Secretary has followed up on these important points with the Argentine Government. I believe we should all watch closely the results of our interventions in the months ahead. Mr. President. I request unanimous consent that the Coalitions letter to Secretary Vance and a prison population profile for Argentina be printed in the RECORD.",

But since it becomes necessary to correct certain erroneous conclusions. the following observations on the effect of article I. sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution. are respectfully submitted. The power of the Congress and of the States with regard to Federal elections is prescribed in the Constitution in two separate clauses: Article I. section 4 states thatThe times. places. and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof. but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations. except as to the places of choosing Senators. Article I. section 5 provides that each House of the Congress is empowered to \"* * * be the.judge of the elections. returns. and qualifications of its own members.\" It is. of course. patent and explicit in the Constitution that the House. by article I. section 5. possesses the ultimate power to be the final judge of elections of its own Members. On this point there can be no serious dispute. However. it has been suggested that judicial precedents recognize the propriety of State proceedings incidental to an election contest of a Member of Congress. and that such judicial recognition comes by virtue of the power of the States under article I. section 4. It has even been suggested by the distinguished gentleman from California",

Though there are very few slaughterhouses which will have to change their methods due to this bill276 in the United States and about 2 percent of Australia and New Zealands slaughterhousesbecause most of them have voluntarily done so due to the economic benefits of the lessbruising methods provided in the 1958 law. I still feel that humane methods of slaughter should be nationalized. With the constant invention of new technological marvels which have revolutionized our system for raising. killing. packing. and distributing meat. we. at least. should be able to insure all possible elimination of pain. discomfort. and terror that these animals undergo in the slaughtering process. This legislation would achieve such a purpose and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting its rapid passage.",

My concern about definition is simply to illustrate that without a more precise definition we will. in fact. potentially remove even more coal from available production. particularly coal on private lands. by the adoption of the Hart amendment. I am almost as equally concerned about the language that the committee proposes for the same reason. There is considerable impreciseness in that definition which the Senator. I believe. sees as an advantage but I see as i disadvantage because of how far and how sweeping the interpretation that they be made either by the Department of the Interior. the Secretary of the Interior or by the courts. And as a matter of fact. this is another question that I was going to ask the Senator from Colorado.

My amendment does not tamper with the committees definition of what alluvial valley floor is at all. If anything. my amendment would prevent the kind of latitude which the Senator is concerned about in that it tightens up what activities can and cannot be carried out in these areas and removes from the Administrators discretion what kinds of commitments qualify for an exemption from the act. So If the Senator is concerned about arbitrariness or vagueness. he would be well advised. I think. to support an amendment which more narrowly and carefully defines the activities. if not the areas concerned. to prevent an administrator or bureaucrat. or someone. from getting into a hornets nest from which they cannot get themselves extracted. I shall simply try to specifically respond on the question of how much coal we are talking about. citing the following information. It is my understanding there have been three studies which address themselves to the question of the alluvial valley floors and their relation to the strip mining of coal. And the following information is taken from those studies. one by Mr. Malde and Mr. Boyles. in 1976. who mapped alluvial valley floors and strippable coal in a number of counties in Montana for the U.S. Geological Survey. They found that. of the surface area within the study area underlain by strippable coal. only 2.67 percent of the land surface studied overlay surface minable coal which falls within the figure which I have already indicated in my opening remarks of some 2.5 or 3 percent of strip minable coal which is in the area which we are talking about here. Also. an EPA study in 1977 on the same subject found that. of land presently leased for coal mining in eight Western States. meeting the alluvial valley floor criteria contained in this bill. 2.88 percent of the area of the leased lands was In alluvial valley floors.

It would eliminate $60.000.000 which was added for buildings and facilities and reduce increases for services by $21.000.000. This would still allow for an increase of $53.000.000 over the House and Carter budgets for health services. This increase in services is more than adequate in terms of requests and justifications given in testimony by PHS officials during the fiscal year 1978 hearings. In addition. it would allow sufficient additional funds to eliminate shortcomings--Identified in a GAO study of the PHS hospital system. Specifically. it would permit hospitals and clinics to maintain current services. purchase adequate supplies of drugs and related needs. and maintain existing equipment and facilities. Mr. President. there is a serious question concerning whether or not additional funds should be invested in upgrading or expanding PHS hospitals. Most are located in communities which have large surpluses in hospital beds and expensive medical technology and facilities. Expansion of PHS hospitals would add to redundant capacity and inefficient utilization of health resources. Funds could be more effectively used to assist existing facilities to convert surplus capacity to outpatient and ambulatory care centers. Such facilities could easily provide services available through PHS hospitals and clinics. Mr. President. this amendment is not only consistent with the current administrations recommendations concerning funds for PHS hospital construction and facilities. but priorities and goals of past administrations. No funds were recommended or appropriated in fiscal year 1977 and none were included in the Presidents budget for fiscal year 1978. Finally. Mr. President. there is a serious national concern over rapidly rising health care costs. Federal expenditures for health has doubled during the past 5 years and may double again by 1980. Thus. it is imperative that we critically evaluate every expenditure in order to determine if it is the most effective use of tax dollars. In view of widespread uncertainty as to the need for expansion of PHS hospitals and clinics. this appears to be one area in which a more realistic level of funding can be achieved without endangering legitimate health care needs.

Mr. President. in 1964 in the South 8 percent of the black schoolchildren attended integrated public schools. only 8 percent in 1964. In 1972. 8 years later. 92 percent of the black schoolchildren in the South attended integrated schooLs--from 8 to 92 percent in only 8 years to show that it can be done. The Senator from New York referred to some of the violence that happened in Boston. of which I was ashamed. But I am proud to say that they had a graduation the other day of the first class under the desegregation orders. There was not one act of violence. which goes to prove that if we let the children alone. and let the teachers and the children work this matter out. we could do in the North as they have done in the South. We do not keep coming up with these amendments. as the Senator said. requiring us to fight a rear guard action year after year after year on every bill possible without giving hope to those advocates of violence and those who still want to deny equal educational opportunities to all children in this country. that we could get on with not the integration of schools but the desegregation of public school systems in this Nation. So I thank my colleague from New York who spoke so eloquently. as I thank my colleague from North Carolina who also spoke eloquently. for different reasons. but he spoke and he stood up because he knows what is right and what is essential in this Nation.

As I will get into later in the debate. talking about the segregating and isolating factors of urban school systems. there happen to be five on this list that are from the South: Houston. Dallas. New Orleans. Memphis. and San Antonio. and my remarks are equally applicable to those five cities as to the other cities on the list. starting with New York. and going down through Kansas City. Second. in response to the Senator from New York. who is at all times eloquent and a person who most sincerely speaks with great compassion. I thought his remarks were in his customary vein of being compassionate and understanding. It is a little bit troublesome to me in referring to the fact that for 20 years in this body we have been having this debate and. as Senator JAvrTs points out. some of the greatest segregation is now in school systems in the North.

The gentlemans amendment clearly would place substantial additional new duties on officers of the Government. Mr. Chairman. in chapter 26. section 11.1. of \"Deschlers Procedures.\" the following is stated: But when an amendment. while curtailing certain uses of funds carried in the bill. explicitly places new duties on officers of the government or implicitly requires them to make investigations. compile evidence. or make judgments and determinations not otherwise required of them by law. then it assumes the character of legislation and is subject to a point of order. Mr. Chairman. the gentlemans amendment intends that aid should be provided to certain countries if such assistance will directly benefit the needy people in such countries. Several legislative provisions currently exist that presently provide for such determinations. but these provisions do not apply to all the funds appropriated in this bill. In addition. the gentlemans amendment would require officials to make judgments and determinations that they are not required to make at the present time. We presently have no AID programs or AID missions in any of these countries. In two of the countries we do not have diplomatic relations. Vietnam and Cambodia. In one country we have no U.S. Government representative. and that country is Uganda. The gentlemans amendment would not only allow direct assistance to flow to these countries. which is not now possible. but also would require some U.S. Government official to determine if the assistance is reaching the needy. This would require a U.S. Government official to travel to these countries to make an onsite inspection since there are no AID missions in any of these countries and no U.S. Government representation present in three of the countries. The gentlemans amendment definitely places substantial additional duties on U.S. Government officials. Also current law prohibits any direct assistance to Vietnam. Laos. Cambodia. Uganda. Mozambique. or Angola. The gentlemans amendment would allow direct assistance to flow to these countries if the assistance would benefit the needy people. This in effect changes the existing law.

Angola and Mozambique are completely hostile to our interests. They are controlled by avowed Marxist leaders that openly profess their contempt for democratic principles. Typical of their views is a 1977 speech by Samora Machel. the leader of Mozambique. before the Third Frelimo Congress. He stated: The historic mission of the Party which we have created is to direct. organize. orientate and educate the masses for the destruction of capitalism and the building of socialism . . . The Party which our Congress created is an internationalist one . . . To make our country a pure revolutionary base for the struggle of other oppressed peoples and classes and to reinforce the world antiimperialist front are essential tasks of our Party... Today we have a MarxistLeninist Party. as the vanguard organization of our people. which will know how to lead us firmly along the path to build socialism. This is a completely new factor in our history. It shows the decisive and irreversible advance of our fight. to the phase when we openly face the forces of capitalism within our country. and the armies of imperialism at the external level. The Marxist regime of Augustina Neto in Angola is being propped up by Soviet arms and thousands of Cuban troops. There is still an active antiNeto force fighting this brutal dictatorship. U.S. tax money should not go to help these nations which are under Soviet domination. Our dollars will simply be used to perpetuate their rule over the people. I urge adoption of my amendment.",

So long as he bargains in good faith. there is no penalty against him whatever. Second. the penalty is a percentage penalty. so it would be based on the standard of wages or salaries involved in the case. So it seems to me that those factual details are dealt with fairly. But as I say. we are trying to consider a better approach to the index. One thing the Senator has said which I would beg him to consider carefully: That is that if we prescribe a remedy where there is no remedy. is it fair. then. to say \"Because you have prescribed the remedy. it will encourage unions to make complaints\"? That is really the philosophic question which we face. There is no remedy now. We should give a remedy if we really mean what we say.

I practiced law in the courtroom for about 20 years. and I always sought as much as I could to leave the impression with the judge that I wanted to be cooperative. but it was the other side that was wanting to be cantankerous and difficult to get along with.

I could go back beginning with the coal mine health and safety bill of 1969 and trace it through other bills. and this is just out of the labor area of our activity. the occupational safety and health bill. pensions and minimum wages. pregnancy disability. the amendments we had there. We have with time been able to be well received by House conferees in our product. and. in good measure. it has been the final product of the conference. in areas of labor concern.

Most fundamentally. the bill represents a recognition by the Congress of the importance of ecosystem management rather than just species management. S. 1140 will encourage the development of State and Federal programs which reflect a realization that while some species may be more important than others under certain circumstances. each is an integral part of the wildlife resource for which we are responsible. The expansion of present wildlife programs envisioned in this bill will facilitate the enjoyment by millions of Americans. particularly those in our urban areas. of a vast and interesting array of wildlife that heretofore has been essentially untended. I am particularly pleased that the bill will yield benefits in environmental quality and environmental educational opportunities for a large number of citizens who. for various reasons. are currently unable to enjoy our Nations wonderful wildlife resources. The legislation should result in the development of some very innovative programs for the management of urban wildlife. This is most important because. as our society has grown to be increasingly urbanized. it has been difficult for a large group of Americans to remain in touch with and understand many ecological processes and relationships. By having wildlife in its natural habitat nearby. the public will be better able to understand and appreciate the importance of natural habitats. complex food chains. and other principles upon which our own existence. as well as that of wildlife. depends. Wildlife habitat in urban areas also has important indirect environmental and economic benefits. It offsets many of the adverse environmental effects of urbanization by improving air quality. slowing storm water discharge rates. and so forth. Economic benefits will undoubtedly include an increase in property values and a reduction in open space management costs. Mr. President. in short. the bill before us for consideration today provides the public with a means fully recognizing the importance of all our fish and wildlife resources and their contribution to our daily lives.

I make a point of order that section 805 of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. if offered as a separate amendment to H.R. 10929 as introduced. would be in violation of clause 7 of House Rule XVI regarding germaneness. This provision which deals with the withdrawal of troops from Korea. and section 805 which deals with the withdrawal of troops from Korea. is not germane to the Department of Defense authorization bill. Mr. Chairman. a key criterion in determining germaneness is a committees jurisdiction over a matter. The Korean troop withdrawal issue falls clearly within the jurisdiction of the Committee on International Relations. Both sections 805(a) and 805(b) fall clearly within the jurisdiction of the Committee on International Relations. pursuant to clause 1. subparagraph (k) of House Rule X. Compelling evidence of the primary jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee over the issue of troop withdrawal from Korea is found in the fact that all legislation. the Presidents arms transfer request. and related reports have been referred solely to the International Relations Committee. Thus. there can be no doubt that the issue of the Korean troop withdrawal lies within the jurisdiction of the Committee on International Relations. and accordingly section 805 is not germane to this bill. In addition. the issue of U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea is not relevant to either the subject matter or to the purpose of H.R. 10929. as introduced. As introduced. H.R. 10929 consists entirely of provisions relating to the annual authorizations for the Department of Defense. It contains no general policy provisions for the Department of Defense. It contains no general policy provisions of any type. let alone any policy provisions relevant to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea. It is well established that an amendment of a general and permanent nature is not germane to a bill containing only temporary authorizations. Thus. by what ever test of germaneness one examines. section 805 is not germane to H.R. 10929. Mr. Chairman. without regard to the merits of the issue. H.R. 10929 is not the proper vehicle for House consideration of the issue of U.S. troop withdrawal from Korea. Accordingly. I must insist on the point of order.",

I believe we should remind ourselves that there are 138 countries which are presently contributing to the World Bank.

None of these countries have attached strings to their contributions to the Bank. If one country is permitted to attach strings. all others will do the same. and the World tank will go out of business. Sensing this. the World Bank. obviously. will not accept any contribution as a matter of policy from any country which would attach strings. I think we are missing the point here. Mr. President. When we say no assistance may be made directly or indirectly. it does not cover just the World Bank. but all of the U.N. programs: the refugee assistance programs. the health programs. the education programs. Is the United Nations to stand aside mute. immobile. if there is a huge disaster in Uganda. just because Idi Amin happens to be the boss man?

It is more properly a subject for the military construction bill. but I wanted to raise it with the distinguished chairman of the committee very briefly. The Vice President did me the great honor this year of appointing me a member of the Board of Visitors of the Naval Academy. The Naval Academy is. of course. an institution in which we in Maryland take great pride. It is one of our most historic and timehonored educational Institutions. It has produced many great Americans and. I believe. the President of the United States would share this view. I have been to the Academy many times. and each time I come away with a new sense of the dedication with which both the faculty and the midshipmen apply themselves. However. the last time I was there. xuhich was within the last 10 days. I took a look at the physical education facilities. The gym at the Naval Academy is an old torpedo boat shed buit in 1905. and they just filled in the slip where the torpedo boats used to run in. What it called the natatorium. where they get swimming training. survival training. water survival training. was built in 1924. and together they were only constructed or designed to meet the needs of a midshipmen batallion of about a third the size of the present enrollment. Of course. the swimming pool. I do not have to emphasize. is a very important facility for the Navy because of the fact that every naval officer should be expert in water survival. So I was pleased when the chairman included in the military construction report a reference on page 15 to the need for this facility. I am. therefore. taking this time to ask the Senator from Mississippi. who is diligent. as he always is. when I brought this matter to his attention. whether he feels that the language on page 15 of the construction indicates that the committee will give sympathetic attention to this problem in the coming year.",

I think it should apply to general U.S. Federal construction in the various Stateswhen a State has high consistent unemployment the contractors in those States pay high administrative costs trying to keep their staffs and trying to be in position to participate in construction opportunities. that is. opportunities for construction contracts as they come along. Unfortunately. however. there is no preference for the contractors who would hire local people when these moneys are made available through the Federal process for military construction or other Government construction. such as the GSA manages. The purpose of this amendment would be to give preference to bidders who would employ the residents of these States of high unemployment. and to give them that preference similar to the Buy American Act by giving them a 6percent deduction from their bid offered price as compared to those contractors from outside of that State.

It is a combination of old individualism and new activism. To my way of thinking. the way things get accomplished in Oregon is more important and significant to the rest of the Nation than the accomplishments themselves. Nevertheless. many of the accomplishments are meritorious and deserve recognition. so I rise today to include in the RECORD a recent story published in the New York Times describing the city of Portlands nearly completed downtown mall. As the story indicates. enthusiasm is building for the 15block area which has enhanced the appeal of Portlands inviting downtown. I cannot help but think of this project as bringing full circle an earlier. controversial decision to scrap a major freeway that would have allowed motorists to speed back and forth from the city to nearby suburbs. The freeway was killed because it would have acted like a centrifuge. spinning people out of the citys center and making the city less vital. The Portland Mall. on the other hand. acts like a magnet. drawing people into the city. increasing its vitality and. perhaps most ironically. its worth to the surrounding communities. Portland. through efforts such as the mall. is not being allowed to degenerate into a meaningless glob of concrete. or an annoyance to be overcome in scurrying from one suburb to the next. Rather. the city is being refit for our times. Ours is an age in which people can be together. not apart. they conserve. not consume. they can have quality. rather than gross quantity. Our cities are forgotten resources hidden by the tarnish of years of neglect. But underneath. the value is there and city officials and civil leaders in places such as Portland are to be commended for discovering this wealth and polishing it off for all to see. and to use. The Portland Mall. with its wide sidewalks. renovated stores and outdoor art. is a tribute to new vision and new commitment to restoring a place for people. an energyefficient living environment. a place of texture. diversity. interest and personal satisfaction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this amendment relates to the need to deal with the problem created by the passage of Public Law 94253 (effective March 31. 1976) amending section 374 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with the tax treatment of exchanges under the final system plan for Conrail. This legislation provided for no gain or loss to be recognized on exchanges under the final system plan for reorganizing the Eastern railroads but did not deal with recapture of investment tax credit which might result from such exchanges. The following discusses a recommendation for a solution to the investment credit recapture problem. Specifically. the difficulty relates to the transfer by Erie Lackawana (Erie) of certain of its assets to ConRail effective April 1. 1976 in pursuance of the final system plan. Erie is a whollyowned subsidiary of Dereco. Inc.. which in turn is a subsidiary of Norfolk and Western (NW). Thus. Erie is a member of the NW consolidated group and its tax results are reflected in the NW consolidated group and its tax results are reflected in the NW consolidated return. Erie became an affiliate of NW in 1968 pursuant to order of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) following protracted litigation by NW opposing the inclusion of Erie In its system. Notwithstanding its objections. NW was compelled by the ICC to acquire the stock of Erie in 1968 at a cost of $55 million in NW common stock. Erie entered bankruptcy reorganization proceedings in 1972. Subsequently. the reorganization court found that Erie could not be reorganized on its own and. pursuant to the ConRail legislation. Erie conveyed a large portion of its property. including virtually all of its railroad equipment. to ConRail under the final system plan. In March 1976. ConRail proposed tax legislation relating to the exchanges under the final system plan. This legislation was passed and became Public Law 94253. It amended section 374 of the Internal Revenue Code by adding a new subsection (c). which provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized where rail properties of a railroad corporation are transferred to ConRail in exchange for stock or securities of ConRail or certificates of value. It further provides that the basis of assets conveyed to ConRail will be the same as their basis in the hands of the transferor railroad and that the basis of securities received by",

H.R. 6362 barely passed the House Agriculture Committee by a 22 to 20 vote and is opposed by the administration. so I do not stand alone in the belief that this legislation should not be enacted into law. There are several misconceptions which proponents of oral bidding will be advancing in the debate to come on this legislation. Among these are the arguments that oral bidding of national forest timber does not promote collusive bidding practices. that there is no difference between oral and sealed bidding in the amount of revenue derived by the U.S. Treasury. that sealed bidding seriously hurts small dependent communities. and that the provisions of section 14(e) of the Forest Management Act do not accurately reflect congressional intent. I would like to address these misconceptions. particularly since it seems premature to repeal regulations which have not been given an adequate period of time for fair evaluation. The fact of the matter is that sealed bidding has thus far proved to be not only quite workable. but also very profitable to the Federal Treasury and U.S. taxpayers.",

The administration and I agree that the present natural gas conference report will lead to a significant reduction in the regulatory burdens on all segments of the oil- and gasproducing industry. The cumbersome and unnecessary regulatory requirements of the Natural Act that are now applied to all sales in interstate commerce will be terminated for all onshore and offshore new gas and for gas from onshore production wells. even from acreage that is now dedicated to interstate commerce. The producer who sells such gas to an interstate pipeline will not be required to obtain a certificate from FERC. to make regulatory rate increase filings. to obtain abandonment authorization from FERC when the contract expires or the well is depleted. or wait for 2 to 3 years to learn what price can be charged for the gas.

But if these industrialists are correct. consumers will end up paying those higher prices. and they may lose their jobs as well. What is needed. clearly. is flexibility.

There is one critical element of the incremental pricing provision which deserves highlighting in thit regard. The incremental pricing provision operates to increase the price paid by incrementally priced industrial users until it is equal to the Btu equivalent of the cost of alternate fuels. The mechanism is designed so as to prevent it from being the cause of industrial conversions. As the Joint Statement of Managers notes. the determination of the cost of alternate fuels is to be made on a regional basis. It states on page 100: The conferees recognize that It may be necessary or appropriate for the Commission to make this determination in advance of the effective date of the first rule. The conferees urge the Commission to take whatever action it deems appropriate or necessary (including expeditious consideration of these proceedings and consolidation of these cases) to avoid any delays in reducing the substitute fuel level so as to avoid the likelihood of conversions from natural gas by industrial users if those conversions would result in increases in natural gas rates for any residential. small commercial. or other high priority customers. The conferees intend that in determining the likelihood of these conversions occurring. the Commission move rapidly in the administrative hearings so as to avoid the irreparable damage which the conferees believe will occur to high priority users if these other indsutrial users. faced with uncertain natural gas rates. begin takIng steps to secure alternate fuel supplies. The administration is very much aware of the need to implement incremental pricing in an equitable manner in order to assure that the public interest is best served. I would not that this bill does not compel incremental pricing with respect to any industrial use other than in large boilers.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I will not use the full 5 minutes. I rise in support of this amendment. I had an opportunity to spend about a week in Nicaragua last fall. and I toured extensively throughout that country. I had a chance to travel without the accompaniment of Government officials. I had a chance to talk to opposition politicians. to opposition newspaper editors. to people who were highly critical of the Government. They told me that they were amazed at the progress that was being made in that country. though they certainly wanted more. Now. I read a story in the Washington Post about a week ago containing a long list of horrors recounted by a reporter who toured that country recently. To read that story. which referred to the bishops report. one would think that all those atrocities were occurring right now. I investigated that story and found that the events that were referred to in that story all occurred more than a year ago. The bishops pastoral letter was in mid1976. not in 1977. Most of these events were in the early part of 1976 when the Sandinista terrorism was at it speak. This does not mean that the Government countermeasures were good. They were bad. but they are not happening now. People I talked to indicated that the Government response was a pattern which developed because of the very atrocities imposed upon people by the terrorist themselves. I regret very deeply. as all of us do. that we have terrorism and the kind of methods used by the Sandinista front and others of that stripe. I deeply regret that it is sometimes necessary to fight violence with violence. After spending a week in that country I found a strong spirit of dissent. the freedom to stand up and criticize the Government. Newspapers were printing editorials attacking the Government just as in this country. I do not say that they have anything remotely approximating the freedom we have. but just because this committee devoted a great deal of time and attention to analyzing that one country. we should not single it out for discrimination.

My information received from the State Department today reveals that their present assessment of the problem of human rights in Nicaragua is that there is a meaningful recognition by the Nicaraguan Government of the need that substantive steps taken to protect human rights and that there are indications that there will be a movement for change. I would not accept an indication of a movement for social change as being adequate. I have been assured by the State Department further. which was contained in their testimony before the Committee on International Relations. that this aid would not be granted without proof acceptable to the State Department that actual change had taken place. In view of that commitment by the State Department. and in view of the fact that the gentleman in the well has witnessed himself some of the progress that Nicaragua is experiencing. I feel that our commitment to human rights can best be served by extending support on this conditional basis. which provides a reward for the fulfillment of the promise in terms of the aid which they claim to need very badly. Thus. I support this amendment. and I feel that on a countrybycountry basis. we will be less than accurate. less than just. less than informed. if we are to make broad. sweeping judgments of principle which are unrelated to the specific facts in the individual countries affected and the assessment of our own State Department and of our President. Mr. Chairman. the relationship between our governments and the people of Nicaragua remains a warm and friendly one.

As I travel across my district in Oklahoma. the cry most commonly heard is for Congress to bridle the bureaucracy. Our most effective control would be to have review and veto over the rules and regulations which are imposed daily upon the people of this representative democracy by a bunch of faceless. nameless bureaucrats. And of all the agencies which are running amok. the Federal Trade Commission is the absolute worst example. The latest example is a 346page report by the staff of the FTC concerning television advertising of certain products containing sugar. Surely. this report will be followed by proposed regulations whichwisely or unwiselywill place great restraints on private enterprise. Not only will our cereal and candy companies be affected. this rule will additionally regulate and restrain the television broadcasting industry. TV already has enough troubles with the FCCbut now it is facing a new intrusion by these bureaucratic dictators. I believe the elected Representatives of the people should review these rules and that. as Representatives. we should be able to say \"no.\" The people in my district and the business people of this country deserve that additional chance to talk back to the bureaucrats. During my term in Congress. I have protested numerous rules and regulations. I do not believe the regulators listen toor carewhat any Congressman says. They follow the advice of an untouchable. insensitive staffand the regulated have no recourse. I strongly urge this House to reject this conference report and send it back with instructions to restore the right of congressional review and veto of FTC ruleswhich we approved 272 to 139 last October. Last October. the House voted 4 to 1 to delete a part of this bill which would allow the FTC to have a trustee appointed to run a business which the Commission suspects of violating the law. That should be eliminated from this bill. Mr. Speaker. I think that the people of this country are ready for the bridle we placed on the FTCand which the conference committee has now removed.

Some people say that Congress does not have the time to deal with it. that we have too much work. The fact of the matter is that the Federal Trade Commission has only made rules of this sort in a very few instances. and it is not likely to come out with the outpouring that some of the agencies do. but when they come out with a rule. it covers an entire industry. it covers an entire segment of the American public.

I came back a total loser. and I am really disappointed. because I think this is pretty basic to what we are about here in this legislation. I do not think that the conference report reflects the House view at all. and therefore I think it should be rejected. I am referring to the equitable relief provision. Last October. by a vote of 4 to 1. the House adopted an amendment to the bill deleting the equitable relief section from the House bill. Now. the conference report has stuck it back in notwithstanding the fact that we thought there was a compromise. The new equitable relief section is really no compromise at all. Regardless of how the FTC goes about getting a receiver appointed over a business. that business is irreparably harmed. That is what we are talking about. We are giving the power to libel and slander a small business to the FTC. That is exactly what happens. Their reputation is irreparably harmed. and their ability to carry on business is curtailed. The thing that concerns me as to what happens under this legislation is that when the Commission issues a complaint alleging that a person or business does engage in deceptive acts. the Commission can by majority vote state its reason to believe that such person is about to waste the assets of that business. and that consumers are going to suffer.",

Their fear is not only that equitable relief might be gained improvidently. but also that hints of equitable relief might be used as a bargaining ploy In negotiating routine consent orders. Small business people have expressed the fear that they might be confronted with a Hobsons choice of either signing a consent order or defending an equitable relief case in court. They fearAnd I am quoting from the conference report: They fear that in such a situation. those with limited resources would have no choice but to sign the consent ordereven when they were innocent. What comfortand I repeatwhat comfort do we get from the conference report? Here. let me read it for you: The conferees certainly do not intend for such situations to arise. That is comfortable. The conferees certainly do not intend for such situations to arise. The substitute is not designed to give the Commission an unfair tactical advantage in consent negotiations.

Nevertheless. the possibility exists that some few overzealous staff people may be tempted to suggest equitable relief as a negotiating device. even when they know it would not be proper.

The current language in the conference report proposes to place a respondent company (accused of violating section 5 of the Federal Trade Ccmmission Act) in a bankrupt situation based upon mere suspicion by the FTC and certainly without a full exploration of the facts. The filing alone of an equity action in court against a small business will result in several conseauences adverse to that business which I do not believe any of us want to contemplate. For example. such filing will substantially harm the reputation of the target business. it probably will foreclose the active carrying on of the business on a daytoday basis. and private property effectively will be taken before a full investigation of the allegations and before due process is allowed to work to protect the parties involved. All of these consequences will tip the scales of justice in favor of the FTC.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Secretary of HEW does not like tobacco. With the zeal of a reformed sinner. this Cabinet member. who was a threepackaday smoker. wants to wipe out all visible signs of his past habit. He has placed his vast bureaucracy in the vanguard of the \"War Against Smoking.\" He is personally leading the attack. Needless to say. he has reaped a great deal of press coverage. The President of the United States. on the other hand. has received far less attention. The Presidents view that further Government activity against tobacco is neither necessary nor proper has gone relatively unnoticed by the press. Certainly the HEW Secretary seems not to be listening. As a result. many people are beginning to wonder who is in charge of the U.S. policy as it applies to tobacco. Fortunately. the Congress has been reacting and the Secretary shows signs of paying some attention. He has lowered the vigor of his attack on tobacco. He no longer. he says. wants to stamp out tobaccoall he wants to do is to save the children from taking up the practice. No one could quarrel with that aim except to question how much time. effort and taxpayers money should be devoted to letting the Federal Government take over a matter that is better left up to parents. Nevertheless. I would urge the Members of Congress to remain on the alert. For despite the Secretarys present soft sell. his battle plans against tobacco are a grave threat. Last year. he assembled a task force of scores of HEW employees and ordered them to brainstorm his pet project. They worked about 1 month and came uo With about 3 dozen ways to make life difficult for millions of Americans. For most peoplelike farmerswhose livelihood depends upon tobacco. the HEW program of prohibitionist schemes adds up to a blueprint for economic disaster. It might strike tobacco farmers as ironic that in the guise of health. a member of the Presidents Cabinet would lead them into the welfare system. It might strike others as equally ironic that an appointee of the man who campaigned against Federal overregulation",

This is a muchneeded move on the part of the United States. In terms of its budgetary impact. the effects will be modest. but it certainly is an important part of our. so far. inadequate efforts to turn the tide on inflation. I believe. too. this administration has. at least. recognized its inconsistent record on the human rights issue. Ive spoken out on this before. and I am glad to see that there will be some lessening of the economic consequences of placing an embargo on sales of American manufactured goods to nations with a questionable human rights policy. In my own congressional district. an important industry faces the cancellation of a contact with Argentina because our State Department is not satisfied with that countrys policy on human rights. I will be the first to agree that much needs to be done there to deal with the most unpleasant situation. of which more needs to be known. But I do not see why jobs in my district must be lost. why the local economy must suffer. when other nations with a comparable human rights record are receiving favorable treatment from the United States in the area of international commerce. Why should we give competing industries in other countries a carte blanche market for products which we have traditionally sold? The success of the administrations new export policy will address the serious problem of our balanceoftrade deficits. Presently we are importing $30 billion more a year than we are shipping abroad. Of course. this has significantly weakened the dollar on world exchange markets. Granted. we are placing less of a priority on a number of matters which this administration has regarded with greater urgencyhuman rights. environmental concerns. consumer issues. and so on. But considering the grave nature of our economic posture right now. this decision by the Carter team makes good sense. We need not ignore human rights. the environment. and the consumer. but until we can put our fiscal house in order. the new approach to our export policy is a wise move.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. at 3:30 this afternoon. President Carter addressed the joint annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. He delivered a strong message to the world community that his administration seriously intends to grapple with important economic problems which this Nation confronts. He delivered an equally strong message to the Congress that these are important problems with which the administration and the Congress must deal. The three problems which the President emphasized were inflation. oil imports. and exports. For the first time. the President has pledged to develop a longterm program to expand American exports. which will meaningfully reduce our staggering trade deficit. I look forward to tomorrows announcement concerning the details of the program. because this is one of the most serious economic problems in the worlds economy. I am pleased that the President has declared that the administration will take new steps in the battle against inflation. because the present rate of inflation is intolerable. The President also stated that he will continue to make every effort to curtail U.S. imports of oil. because those imports are exacerbating that trade deficit. I believe that Congress must do its part in finding solutions to these problems. This week alone. Congress is working on the conference report for the Witteveen Facility which will strengthen the International Monetary Funds ability to deal with international financial disorders. This Wednesday. the Senate is finally expected to vote on the conference report for the longdelayed energy bill. While the Congress considers these important bills. the eyes of the world will be particularly on Congress. since the worlds economic leaders are here in Washington. D.C. I believe that the world community will comorehend the seriousness of the Presidents message.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the uncertainties and the seriousness of our energy situation are clearly upon us. There are many illustrative examples of these uncertainties. and also examples of how at times we think we have solved our problem and then we find that we really have not. One such example of a solution that is yet to be a solution has been well illustrated by a recent article in the August 18. 1978. issue of Science magazine. entitled. \"Pipeline Problems Exacerbate West Coast Oil Surplus.\" This article outlines in some detail. which I think my colleagues will find of interest. the complexities that now face us in getting the particular type of oil being produced in Prudhoe Bay. not necessarily through the pipeline but from the pipeline to someplace where it can be used. Part of the problem. of course. has to do with chemical characteristics of that particular type of crude oil. which is commonly known as sour crude. that is oil which is rich in sulfur. There is a limited capacity on the west coast to refine this crude and. therefore. before we will be able to fully utilize the capacity of the Alaskan pipeline and the resources which attach. we are going to have to figure out ways to get that sour crude to refineries in middle America in a variety of locations. The issue has been complicated by the present inability of the United States. because of congressional action. to trade the sour crude of Alaska via Japan for crude oil from the Middle East. which could be brought to the United States through more normal channels. The Nation must move to reduce its dependence on imports of crude oil and refined oil products. However. in the short term. it must also learn to be flexible in how we make use of our own resources. In this particular case. a trading mechanism. an exchange mechanism. with Japan and Middle Eastern suppliers certainly appears to be appropriate. but the administration must move rapidly to determine the best longterm solution. because anything that depends on supplies from abroad only makes our difficulties worse. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the article from Science. entitled \"Pipeline Problems Exacerbate West Coast Oil Surplus.\" be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. also related to this general issue of energy and our dependence on foreign supplies of fossil fuels at the present time is the issue of the economics of another energy source. namely. nuclear power. The claims and counterclaims notwithstanding as to the economics of nuclear power. it appears that it cannot be argued that. to some degree. we are going to be dependent on its availability. The users of electricity in the Midwest during this recent winter and the coal strike that came with that winter found that their only reliable source of power for many. many weeks was that coming from a variety of nuclear plants in the Midwest. A recent article. again from Science magazine. that compares the economics of nuclear power and coalgenerated power is. I believe. \"must\" reading for individuals who wish further to understand this very complex issue. The article was printed in the August 18. 1978. issue of Science. and is entitled \"Economics of Nuclear Power.\" written by A. D. Rossin and T. A. Rieck. Although there are major economic differences and many other differences between nuclearand coalpowered generating plants. the conclusion reached in this article as a result of the Commonwealth Edicon Co.s experience with both types of power in a very broad scale. is that both coal and nuclear power must be available in the foreseeable future. I think that is a rational conclusion. It is not an ideal conclusion from the perspective of anyone. whether environmentalist or developer. but it appears to be the only conclusion that is warranted by the present facts. It comes down to a question not only of operating risks. but also one of supply of both coal and nuclear fuel. Again. this article. entitled \"Economics of Nuclear Power.\" is an important article for all students of this problem. I hope that all the 100 Senators. by this time. have become students of the energy problem in general and of the nuclear power problem specifically. Mr. President.

Nagel. writing in the September 15 issue of Science magazine. an article entitled \"Operating a Major Electric Utility Today.\" describes many of the more general questions facing the U.S. electrical power industry. The question. will there be sufficient electrical power for short- and longterm futures. is clearly without an answer at this point. Mr. Nagel defines very. very clearly and. I think. extremely well the various questions that must be answered before we can come to an answer to the broader question. Congress and the administration. most of all. must remove the bottlenecks to the use of presently available technology or very rapidly accelerate our efforts to find generally acceptable paths around those bottlenecks. particularly toward alternative energy sources. Mr. Nagel cites as the principal difficulties and uncertainties the following items: The general power needs that the country will have over the next several decades. the problems of facility siting. whether nuclear. coal. or other energy sources. the regulatory delays in construction lead times that are now upon us. commonly amounting to more than 10 years. the general question of environment and the costbenefit analysis of how we protect the environment. at the same time providing electrical power. what will be the primary fuel supplies in various locations. and. finally. how all of this will be financed. I would add to this only the very profound question of what we are going to do with nuclear waste. Are we going to bury it or are we going to utilize it as a resource? And when are we going to accelerate research and development in a variety of areas related to nuclear power generation. most specifically in the development of higher efficiency conversion systems. both for existing technology. such as nuclear and coal. oil- and gasfired plants. and also for a more modem technology. such as the fuel cell?",

As one example. the Post argued that my proposal \"has the weight of logic behind it.\" The Times said: Such charges make sense ... Righting the balance (in transportation subsidies) would lower the total cost of hauling freight around the country. In relation to the Post editorial. I would note that barge tonnages are expected to increase by at least 40 percent over the next decade. even with the most severe assumptions of my proposal. In their conclusions. The Times urged a Senate vote for \"substance instead of tokens.\" while The Post asked for \"a change instead of a gesture.\" It was the view of The Herald that \"the free ride of the waterway users leads to unfair competition and unfair distribution of the Federal tax load.\" while the SunTimes declared that \"Domenicis amendment deserves support.\" I appreciate these words of strong support. In addition. a smaller paper. the Gainesville (Fla.) Sun carried a similar endorsement of user charges. This editorial does not step lightly. it hammers hard.

At that point. the competitor had control of over 80 percent of the market. Shortly after the dominant company lost this large customer to its smaller competitor. the chairman and vice chairman of the relevant American Society for Mechanical Engineers standards committee got together. The vice chairman of the ASME committee happened to be a vice president of the dominant company. The two decided- that an official letter from ASME stating that the kind of device manufactured by the small company did not meet the ASME code would be extremely useful. Such a letter soon appeared and for all practical purposes. the small manufacturer found the marketplace closed. The Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee held hearings in March 1975. to look into the circumstances. The hearings revealed that when a reporter from the Wall Street Journal began investigating the small companys plight. the vice chairman destroyed the communication between himself and the chairman. which resulted in the fraudulent letter. What did ASME do? Its Professional Practice Committee issued and published a resolution which stated: Be it further resolved that the PPC concludes that John James conducted himself in a proper manner. and finds no improper or unethical conduct in his actions ...

Mr. Schlesinger is bright and tough. a man who knows his way around Washington and how to get things done. But after reviewing this pronosal. I believe the administration is putting the cart before the horse. This proposal should be presented to the Congress at the same time as or after the administrations energy policy recommendations. We are being asked to create agencies to perform functions when we *do not know what the functions are. It seems to me that these substantive questions of policy should be resolved first. In addition. I have serious doubts about the wisdom of folding regulatory and develooment responsibilities together.

I have long felt that one of the major blocks to the development of a satisfactory energy policy in this country has been the fragmentation of those policy makers in Government responsible for energy issues. Between the Federal Energy Administration. the Federal Power Commission. the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. the Department of the Interior. and numerous other agencies in the White House and other Cabinet departments it has proved extraordinarily difficult to set up a coherent policymaking apparatus which is capable of taking all necessary factors into consideration when dealing with energy issues. The result has been duplication. fragmentation. and confusion. Another factor in our failure to develop a responsible energy policy over the past 4 years has been the constant partisan wrangling on policy between Congress and the administration. I am pleased to join in sponsoring Mr. Carters reorganization plan today because I believe that our energy policy. like our foreign policy. should be pursued on a bipartisan basis without regard to shortterm political advantage. The issue is far too important for that. Of course. as a member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. which will consider this legislation. I intend to examine its details carefully and. if necessary. propose modifications that will further the creation of a cohesive department. but I believe our commitment to the concept of energy reorganization should be a bipartisan one. and I urge my colleagues to join in support of the Presidents effort.

    "speech": "Mr. President. you may recall that on February 3. in a brief floor statement regarcing the serious drought conditions in the West. I indicated that I would be introducing various parts of a water resource legislative package in the Senate this year. Today I wish to introduce the first of these bills. the Water Resources Research and Development Act of 1977. Title I of this act deals with general water resources research. It repeals the Water Resources Research Act of 1964 and replaces it with similar. but stronger and more comprehensive language. Major provisions of title I are the maintenance of the State water institutes which were created under the old act and the continued support of nonacademic water resource research centers. Title II reestablishes many of the provisions of the now expired Saline Water Conversion Act of 1971. The saline water conversion project. despite congressional support of a viable program. has suffered severe budgetary cutbacks during the past 5 years. and I believe that it is time we redirected our attention to this important program. I would especially like to draw your attention to what I consider to be a primary thrust of this bill. It is my firm conviction that water supplies of the future for irrigation. energy development and domestic uses in the inland West are contaihed in vast. brackish or saline aquifers. These aquifers are known to exist beneath every western State and are. for the most part. unallocated and unutilized. In the south central portion of my own State of New Mexico. for example. a brackish aquifer underlying the Tularosa Basin contains more than 150 million acrefeet of waterenough to create a river the size of the Rio Grande for several centuries. Historically. our efforts to develop and apply desalination technology have focused on reclamation of saline river waters and coastal brackish water. I believe that it is now time to apply the technology we have developed and to invent new technology where needed to exploit these vast brackish groundwater resources. Accordingly. title II contains special provisions for demonstration projects aimed specifically at the development of saline aquifers in a region where they are critically needed for irrigation and energy production. I urge my colleagues to take affirmative action on this important and overdue legislation and I also ask that the bill be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

I send to the desk a bill that would assure a more careful and effective review of the possible use of excess Governmentowned space when the General Services Administration is considering the location of any new Federal buildings project. The need for this legislation came to light a couple of years ago when the Congress was asked to authorize the construction of a new consolidated law enforcement training center. The Committee on Public Works of the Senate. con.cerned over the very high costs of the proposed project. told GSA to reexamine the possible use of an excess military base for this activity. The GSA subsequently concluded that it could effectively convert a justabandoned Naval facility at Brunswick. Ga.. rather than building a new facility at Beltsville. Md.. and this shift was found to save the taxpayers $20 million or more. The approach of the bill I am introducing would provide greater assurance that GSA will examine such alternatives. and not automatically conclude that a new building is the best approach. Studies of alternatives. I believe. hold particular promise in any cases of special use. such as a training center. Our taxpayers will benefit. A study of such alternatives is within the spirit and intent of Public Law 94541. the Public Buildings Cooperative Use. That law mandates a review of possible use of older. nonFederal buildings for conversion into new Federal offices.

That is one way to divide some on the Senate floor. According to the Consumers Income Series issued by the Census Bureau this year there are only 173.000 persons 65 years and over whose total money income in 1975 was $20.000 or more. This is only 6 percent of all older workers who earn income. Ninetyfour percent made below $20.000. This is total income. That includes rental income. dividends. interest. pensions. and other income not subject to the ceiling. Actually wages subject to the ceiling average about $4.500. hardly a rich persons income. If we look at the total family income. which includes the combined incomes of three or four family members. the Census Bureau report shows only 11 percent of all families headed by older workers had combined incomes of $20.000 or more for all families who had earned income. So statistics which may be used against this amendment are not correct. Let me also point out that Members of Congress are not subject to the social security system. The President of the United States is not subject to the social security system. The Vice President is not subject to the social security system. Members of the Cabinet are not subject to the Social security system. So we pass in judgment and make the policy although Congress is not even part of the system. We do not understand all the complexities and all the down sides of the system. We do not have any earnings limitation.

Now I am highly gratified that the Senate is about to approve a committee bill which will raise that limit from $3.000 to $6.000. and provide for automatic future increases in that $6.000 limit by increases in the cost of living. These features will allow our present social security beneficiaries to undertake other work and to earn up to $6.000 without a reduction in their social security checks. This is the content. of course. of the action we have just taken to reduce from 72 to 70 the age at which our social security beneficiaries may have unlimited outside earned income without any reduction in their benefits. Removing the earnings limitation entirely would make a radical change in the character of the social security program. It would convert the social security program from a retirement program to an annuity program. The social security program has always been designed to the needs of our older Americans who have retired from the work force. Lifting the earnings limitation would actually benefit only a very small group of recipients with earned income in excess of the $6.000 provided in the committee bill. Even so. this amendment would add billions of dollars of extra new -costs to the severely strained social security system. These costs would have to be made up with added taxes from employers and employees. I believe the committee bill represents a major increase in taxesan increase which the American people are willing to support. I think it is unwise at this time to add to the major payroll tax increase already provided in this bill.",

I voted for it in the Finance Committee where it lost by a tie vote and I urge my colleagues to support it now. To me. the earnings limitation on social security is unfair. It is inequitable. It dampens work incentives. And. it imposes an oppressively high marginal tax rate on those least able to pay. I would prefer to see the earnings limitation abolished outright. But. short of that. I am delighted to support a measure which would phase it out by 1982. Earlier this year. I introduced S. 1020. a bill which would have the same effect as the Goldwater amendment but which would eliminate the earnings limitation by reducing the age limit 1 year at a time from its present level of 72 down to 65 in 1984. by which time the test would be abolished entirely. INEQUITY Mr. President. it is all too easy to argue that virtues of frugality and the need for individuals to make their own provisions for retirement as a theoretical justification for penalizing those who must work to make ends meet because they simply cannot make it on their meager social security allowances. But. that argument ignores the suffering which these individuals must endure because of the retirement test. while others. with substantial investments and alternative pension incomes. utilize social security benefits for pin money. As a member of the Finance Committee and one who has devoted considerable attention to social security questions. I simply cannot accept the argument that those who must work to live should be penalized. but those who have ample income from other sources may continue to receive full social security payments. I understand the problem with applying a means test to investment income and I have no intention of going that route.

As Americans. we can be proud of our role in helping to make Israel a strong democracy in a volatile region. Israel has had to struggle for survival from its inceptionand the end of the road is still not in sight. Composed of the remnants of the ovens of Europe. the nation of Israel was created 30 years ago today. The day she was born. her Arab neighbors declared war. vowing to drive the Israelis into the sea. In spite of this grave and formidable opposition. three major wars and a beleaguered economy. the tiny state of Israel has prospered and is now stronger than ever. Today she remains the principal refuge for persecuted Jews throughout the diaspora. absorbing hundreds of thousands of Soviet. Arabian. and European Jews without regard to quotas or the effect on the economy. Had there been an Israel for Jews to turn to in the 1930s and 1940s Hitlers holocaust might not have claimed 6 million Jewish lives. The United States has been a strong ally of Israel since its beginning. President Truman lobbied heavily in favor of the states creation and without his support. the first Jewish state might never have become a reality. Today. however. this special relationship is for the first time in jeopardy. The proposed sale of advanced fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia. President Carters commitment to the principle of a Palestinian homeland and all out support for President Sadats terms of peace are worrisome developments to those concerned about the future and security of the only democracy in the Middle East. As we celebrate the miracle of Israel. I am condent that these recent developments will not compromise Americas longstanding support for Israel. I am encouraged by President Carters recent declaration: For thirty years we have stood at the side of the proud and independent nation of Israel . .. we will continue to do so not just for another thirty years. but forever . . . we will never waiver in our absolute commitment to Israels security.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there has been a lot of talk in this body and elsewhere about the unduly high taxes paid by the American public and the need to effect drastic reductions in the tax burden. regardless of the effect on inflation and on our overall fiscal condition. I think. frankly. that a lot of this talk has been irresponsible. and that we should make decisions on taxesand everything else. for that matterbased on facts. not unsupported allegations. I would like. therefore. to help put our debate about tax levels into perspective. We have heard that a number of other industrialized nations have relatively lower tax burdens than does the United States. I recently came across an article by Allen D. Manvel in the May 30. 1977. issue of Tax Notes. the highly respected journal of tax analysis. dealing with this subject. and I want to bring Mr. Manvels research to the attention of my colleagues. The most telling point. I believe. is that of the 22 industrialized nations surveyed. only 6 have a tax burden lower than ours when taken. as is appropriate. as a percentage of each nations gross national product. The six were Australia. Greece. Japan. Portugal. Spain. and Switzerland. Fifteen others analyzed. however. levied taxes at higher rates than in the United States. including West Germany. Norway. Canada. and the Netherlands. to name but four. I should emphasize. Mr. Speaker. that the figures presented in this article include taxes from all sourcesFederal. State. and localwith respect to each country surveyed. I think it is imperative that we reduce taxes in the United States. But we should do so based on an objective analysis and presentation of the facts. The Manvel article which follows. helps provide these facts:",

Ohio. Present at the dinner will be the national American Nuclear Society past president. Dr. Walter Myer. and the Youngstown State Universitys ANS student branch president. Joseph Leone. Dr. John J. Coffelt. president of the university. will attend the dinner. as well as Prof. Leslie Szirmay. the local organizations sponsor and a member of the YSU Chemical and Nuclear Engineering Department. The parent organization of the student branch was founded as an international organization of scientists and engineers on December 1. 1974. by the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. D.C. The manifold objectives of the society include: the advancement of science and engineering relating to the atomic nucleus. encouraging research. establishing scholarships. disseminating and sharing information. and cooperating with Government agencies. educational institutions and other organizations having similar purposes. The American Nuclear Society membership presently includes persons engaged in fundamental and applied research. teaching. consultation. administration and engineering. as well as other individuals interested in the advancement of nuclear science and technology. More than 11.000 current members represent over 1.500 corporations. educational institutions. and Government agencies in 41 countries. While the structure of the society is designed to provide members with opportunities to complement personal career objectives and professional growth. the entire nuclear industry benefits from its activities and programs. The student branches of the society provide students with the opportunity to interact with professionals in the field. These organizations also provide students with access to current industry information and a chance to engage in student conferences and presentations. The Youngstown State University student branch of the American Nuclear Society. chartered by the national organization on October 8. 1977. is also served by Vice President Ron Proch. Secretary Don Hurt. and Treasurer Paul Schiller. Mr. Speaker. I commend the Youngstown State University students and faculty members who have formed the student branch of the American Nuclear Society. As one who is very interested in the development of Youngstown State University. I am pleased to learn of the establishment of this student organization on the campus. I know that the student branch of the society will make an important contribution to the university. and I wish the members every success in their endeavors.0",

Recently. George H. Weyerhaeuser. chief executive officer of the Weyerhaeuser Co.. wrote an analysis of the present state of the economy. which I submit for the R~coRD: INFLATION: CAUSE OF EcoNoMys PROBLEMS (By George H. Weyerhaeuser) In my annual report message this year. there was something of an essay on the current state of our world. Problems in our European and Japanese markets were mentioned. along with the rising cost of energy. capital goods. raw materials. labor .. . and virtually everything else. It would be nice to report today that the situation has changed dramatically. It has not. There are some signs of improvement in specific and important markets and in controlling specific costs. but the pace of inflation has also since accelerated. not slowed. And. it is inflationthe inflationary bias In all the developed nations. but particularly the United Statesthat is the root cause of all of these problems. In this country. we like to blame the oil crisisthe action of the OPEC nations several years ago in suddenly quadrupling the price of petroleumfor the current inflation. And. indeed. that did help accelerate and maintain the inflationary momentum. But inflation already was out of hand before the crisis. We need to recognize. as the leaders of the other Western nations do. that perhaps the greatest engine of inflation abroad in the world today is the continued mismanagement of the United States economy. the apparent inability of this nation or Its leaders. to face up to the hard decisions that must be made.",

I have initiated a request for an official response from the VA to provide the committee with a thorough report on Agent Orange and what outreach and research efforts the VA has in mind. While it is perhaps too soon to draw any definite medical conclusions. there are certainly a lot of unanswered questions about Agent Orange. I think the Congress has a real responsibility to follow up this issue to insure that the needs of our Vietnam veterans are met. In the June issue of the Progressive. there is an excellent article on the filing of Agent Orange related claims in one VA regional officethe Chicago office.

I was unable to be in the Chamber at that time. I appreciate their courtesyin offering the amendment. Mr. President. my amendment would clarify the Commerce Committees jurisdiction relating to organized sports. The Commerce Committee traditionally has had responsibility over this area. as such sports generally affect interstate commerce. However. through a minor oversight. the subject of organized sports was not assigned to any specific committee. In the past. the Commerce Committee has dealt with numerous sport issues. For example. last Congress we authorized funds for the 1980 Olympic games to be held in Lake Placid. In the 93d Congress we reviewed the state of amateur athletics in the United States and reported out Senator PEARSONS bill. S. 3500. which passed the Senate. S. 3500 created a sports board to oversee our amateur athletic and Olympic programs in the United States. We have also had jurisdiction over broadcasting of sporting events. Each year the FCC reports to our committee on the effects of antiblackout restriction. This past year I have served as a member of the Presidents Commission on Olympic Sports. The Commission suggested numerous proposals to strengthen our athletic program in the United States. including resolution of the long standing disputes between such organizations as the NCAA. USOC. and AAU. These matters should be referred to the Commerce Committee. My amendment would clear up any jurisdictional confusion that might arise in the future. It merely states that the Commerce Committees jurisdiction should include. but not be limited to. such subjects as.: Public broadcasting of sporting events. Olympic and Pan American games. organization and development of athletics in the United States. resolution of franchise disputes between national governing bodies and multisport organizations. and athletes rights. The Commerce Committee has had jurisdiction over sport issues in the past. It has the staff and expertise to continue its work in this area.

    "speech": "This amendment further clarifies eligibility of committee staffs for transition period protection. In general. the select committee and the rules committee agreed that staff displaced in their jobs as a result of the reorganization required by Senate Resolution 4 should be retained until July 1 on an appropriate committee staff with no reduction in salary. Already covered in title VII are committee staff displaced by the consolidation of a committee or the transfer or committee jurisdiction. Because of a drafting misunderstanding. another category of staff was omitted from those eligible. The category described in this amendment is staff affected by the committee and subcommittee assignment limitations and the subcommittee chairmanship limitations of Senate Resolution 4. In other words. these limitations may require some committees to consolidate several present subcommittees which now are separately funded. They may require a Senator serving as chairman of two or more subcommittees to give up one chairmanship. if the two subcommittees are not consolidated under his chairmanship. The committee assignment limitations may force a Senator to resign from a committee leaving unsponsored his previous employee paid by that committee. This amendment brings such staff under the transition protection. Eligibility will be determined by recommendation of the subcommittee chairman and ranking member to the full committee chairman and ranking minority member who shall then certify the eligibility to the Committee on Rules and Administration. That committee would decide any uncertainties. Another part of this amendment defines \"continuous service\" as permitting resignations for a period of 4 days or less as sometimes occurs for administrative purposes. Another portion of the amendment clarifies paragraph (2) on line 3 on page 96 which states an employee eligible for transition protection may not be removed \"except for cause.\" This is clarifled to mean that an employee who would otherwise be eligible to accept an annuity on July 1 under involuntary retirement would not have to wait until July 1 to do so. This amendment includes other technical changes to facilitate committee financing during the transition. Mr. President.

I had hoped we could finish the bill tomorrow night because. as Mr. RIBICOFF has stated. if we adjourn sine die Saturday it is going to be absolutely necessary to finish this bill tomorrow at some point. So. Mr. President. I hope that Senators will all keep this in mind tomorrow. I hope the Parliamentarian can arrange to have a listing of amendments that are not germane. of amendments that are out of order. because they go to different places in the bill or are out of order for other reasons. and let us have that list by tomorrow morning. if it is not already available. This may be helpful as we proceed tomorrow. So. with that understanding. Mr. President. that we try to complete action on the bill tomorrow night. I withdraw the request.",

So the Senator from Indiana revised his amendment. so that it would not take effect until the beginning of the next fiscal year. and thus there would be no revenue loss. As originally presented. the revenue loss would have been $1 million for calendar year 1979. and since that would have left only 9 months in the fiscal year. the amendment would only have cost about $750.000. but that is moot. because as it is revised there would be no revenue loss this year. I delayed in presenting the amendment. because I hoped there would be amendments passed which raised revenue and provided room for my proposal under the budget resolution. Unfortunately this has not occurred. I would hope. however. that in conference the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee would consider making the amendment effective on January 1. 1979. if further amendments or action in conference make this possible under our budget procedures. This amendment would make financing through industrial development bonds more available to communities participating in the urban development action grant (UDAG) program. My amendment. Mr. President. would not increase the small issue exemption beyond the $12 million provided for in the Finance Committee bill. It would. however. permit IDB financing for facilities involved in a UDAG program which will be worth more than $12 rillion and up to $20 million Under the committees bill. eligibility for the small issue exemption is lost if the total expenditures for the facilities exceed the $12 million limit. More simply put. if my amendment were enacted there could be up to $12 million in IDB financing for a UDAG facility worth up to $20 million. I believe. Mr. President. that the change I propose will be extremely helpful to the 181 communities presently participating in the UDAG program and the scores more which will participate in the future. That program has not been a total Federal subsidy. On the contrary. UDAG money has acted as seed money to attract many times more private dollars into projects to revitalize and reclaim severely distressed urban areas and neighborhoods. On an average. each UDAG dollar has attracted $5 from private sources. In some instances the ratio has been as low as one Federal dollar to 30 private dollars.",

It makes such good sense to stimulate private investment in our urban areas to help reverse the economic deterioration. high unemployment. outward migration. and housing abandonment which have plagued so many of our cities. And it is because I believe so strongly in addressing the problems of distressed urban areas that I propose this amendment. As interest rates grow higher. the cost of financing facilities in UDAG programs will become increasingly burdensome. In some instances. high financing costs for private capital will limit the scope of the project. In others. parties with much to offer will be discouraged from taking part in the UDAG program. To insure maximum participation and projects of the highest quality I believe it is important that we provide at least some low cost financing to the private investors who are willing to address our great urban problems. This could be accomplished through industrial development bonds if we were to provide tax exemption for IDBs even though the facilities they financed cost more than $12 million. which they do in many instances where UDAG grants have been extended. My amendment would give such an exemption. Mr. President. and I believe that for a very small loss in tax revenues it will provide a strong impetus to our urban program and bring much needed help to our distressed urban areas.

I want to point out that in the committee report on page 28. there was included a paragraph from our Committee on Armed Services report which stated: The Committee is concerned about the underutilization of the Naval Post Graduate School at Monterey. California. It pointed out that the current enrollment there forces it to operate in a relatively inefficient manner and it is underutilized. Yet. in the report on the next page your committee is asking the Defense Department to reassess the necessity for operating both the Naval Post Graduate School and the Air Force Institute of Technology.

I want to say that the knowledge the gentleman has gained on that new committee. the Select Committee on Intelligence. has been invaluable to us on the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations. What he has been able to learn there has been of great benefit to us. I do not know how the gentleman does both jobs so well. but he does. Mr. Chairman. in the remaining time that I have. let me suggest this: As I was sitting here and as the debate was going on. I was thinking about GEORGE MAHON. There must be an awful lot he can tell us. He has been here about 44 years now. He was the first chairman of the subcommittee that handled the defense bill back in 1949.

Praise has been heaped upon members of the subcommittee. especially upon GEORGE MAHON. but we have neglected to say what we should say about the men in uniform with whom we have worked through the years. This Nation has been very. very fortunate in having such distinguished men in the military services. It is well to take note of the high quality of our military personnel. I have been closely associated with them for decades and I can testify to their dedication and loyalty. We complain about the mistakes that have been made. and there have been mistakes that have occurred in such a large and complex worldwide operation. But the opportunities : have had to observe the high quality of the men in uniform has been a great experience for me. I refer to General Marshall. General Eisenhower. General Bradley. Admiral Nimitz. Admiral Halsey. and many others of lesser rank. In the old days there were only five members of the subcommittee. We now have 13. The tendency on the part of Congress at that time in military matters was to say. \"Youve got to trust somebody. Therefore. we will trust General Marshall\" or others in high positions in the uniformed services. That was more or less the tendency at that time. but there has now been a distinct change in procedure. Our problems are much more complex. The subcommittee has been increased in size. the staff of the subcommittee has been greatly increased. and the individua: members of the subcommittee have defense staff members. So we have gone much deeper into the actual operation of the Defense Department. and that. I think. has been a healthy development. We have a changing world. but I continue to look forward with a great deal of optimism to the future. I believe we have the strongest defense establishment in the world. I think we are going to keep it that way. I take my hat off to the military men and women in uniform who have continually fulfilled their responsibilities.",

The President and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court have called for more mediation and arbitration as alternatives to litigation. Legislation is pending before the Senate to use dispute resolution centers for consumer complaints. Before this gets much further. let us get an independent study of the whole issue. Let us see where the Federal Government can helpwith training of mediators. public education. research coordinationand where the Federal Government should stay away. Mr. Chairman. we pay an exorbitant price in money and human suffering when conflicts result needlessly in violence and destruction. We cynically assume that we must pay these costs. We do not. Many conflicts can be avoided. The payoffs from this study could be enormous. I think we should find out. Mr. Chairman. this language simply establishes a ninemember. 1year commission that selfdestructs. and its purpose is to see if we should have a center for conflict resolution at all.

I am introducing today a proposal which would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make emergency loans in an area if he determines that a labor dispute. in which farmers are not participants. results in losses in production or sales of agricultural products. During last summers brief cannery strike in California. which occurred at the peak of the harvest season. agricultural producers were unable to deliver their crops to processing plants and suffered disastrous losses. The entire apricot crop was lost and over 200.000 tons of tomatoes and 75.000 tons of peaches rotted during the work stoppage. It will take years for many producers to recover their enormous losses. which presently are not covered by the emergency loan provisions of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C.A. 1961). These emergency loans. administered by the Farmers Home AdministrationFmHA--of the Department of Agriculture. are available only in the case of natural disasters. The bill would allow farmers. ranchers. and aquaculture operators to obtain loans at the same terms as those available for victims of natural disasters. A 5 percent per annum rate is charged for loans covering actual losses. It should be clearly understood that this legislation does not seek to undermine the rights of either labor or management. The bill seeks only to protect the innocent producers who are not parties to labor disputes. but who. nevertheless. suffer the consequences.",

Although project leaders inform me that such consideration is normal for any nuclear powerplant. I wanted to state several points for the record. First. Tennessee is pleased and happy to have the Nations first largescale demonstration breeder sited at Oak Ridge. Tenn. Our citizens. particularly in this area. understand nuclear technology. recognize that development of the breeder is essential to keeping our few energy options open. and are proud to have this historic project right where it is. These frigid mornings of the winter of 1977 tell us all too chillingly of the consequences of inadequate energy. We simply must develop our options wisely. and for the foreseeable future the answer lies in conservation. coal. and nuclear power. Beyond 2000 only the breeder reactor offers a strong possibility of success for being the longterm assured. safe. and reasonably economical energy resource this Nation so urgently needs. National needs for the breeder and Tennessee preferences aside. there are compelling reasons not to change the site of the Clinch River project. After 4 years of aggressive and nonrelenting effort. a firm partnership of Government and electric power industry have forged the team that can make the demonstration breeder a reality in the mid1980sin time to make the economic and other evaluations crucial to deciding on whether the technology can and should be applied broadly in this country. Transfer to another site with the same project goals would mean 3 to 4 years delay. a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. and an unacceptable reduction in our odds for meeting future energy needs in a timely way. There is no doubt the Nation needs more energyto sustain jobs and services for our people and to provide hope for those who have not yet reaped the full benefit of Americas high quality of life. The breeder is the key to developing nuclear power as part of our overall energy requirement. and only siting the breeder demonstration plant on the Clinch River site will meet the timing and utility objectives which are essential for the breeder to become a real energy option.",

The buttons they wear read. \"Stop Rhodesian Chrome.\" and this particular pressure group makes it their cause to repeal the Byrd amendment which permits reciprocal trade with other nations. These people who complain about the Byrd amendment seem to have always been with us. and hopefully they always will be with us. because it would be as strategically dangerous as it would be economically foolish to actually repeal the law which permits us to buy Rhodesian chrome. Sentimentalists in foreign policy look at the imperfections we see in the Smith government and hold that we should not let our dollars travel there. Yet to trade with a country. to give it something it wants for something we want even more. is hardly to vote approval of its regime. or we would stop buying beans from Colombia. spices from India or glass from Poland. Moreover. particularly so in the Rhodesian case. our trade helps to raise the general level of their economy. bringing prosperity to people regardless of race or creed. In the past. the only alternative to purchasing chrome from Rhodesia has been to buy it instead at a higher price from the Soviet Union. hardly one of the worlds more liberal regimes. While recent technology has only this year enabled a few other. countries to produce chrome at Rhodesias price levels using South Africas lowsulfur process. Rhodesia remains our primary source of relatively inexpensive chrome.

Kosciusko came to our shores from his native Poland in 1776. on his own initiative and at his own expense. to join the Revolutionary cause as a colonel of Army Engineers. He distinguished himself in the Carolinas and in the battles of New York and Yorktown and engineered the fortifications at West Point now the site of the U.S. Military Academy. As Gen. Nathaniel Greene. commander of the Southern campaign wrote: I can liken to nothing his z:eal in the public service. and in the solution of important problems. nothing could have been more helpful than his judgement. vigilance. and diligence. He was fearless of every danger. He never manifested desires or claims to himself. and never let opportunity pass of calling attention to and recommending the merits of others. At the close of the War for Independence. Congress granted Kosciusko tlhe rights and privileges of American citizenship and commissioned him a brigadier general. The people of my congressional district are proud to have a bridge named in memory of this PolishAmerican patriot. spanning the border between Brooklyn and Queens as does the friendship between the people of our country and those of his native land. Kosciuskos struggle on behalf of the common folk of Poland after the partition of 1792 reminds us of the abiding aspirations for freedom and liberty voiced by the Polish people.

I am speaking about the inability of small and minority businessmen to effectively bid for Government contracts because of outdated Federal bonding requirements. Because of a provision in the 1935 Miller Act. small and minority businessmenand I am talking now primarily of building contractorsmust secure insurance company bonding when seeking a Federal contract of more than $2.000. While the need for surety protection is a valid one. the $2.000 ceiling is ridiculously low and not only hurts the small businessman but it means loads of paperwork. far out of proportion to the payment received. for insurance companies. I propose to raise the $2.000 to $50.000. This would mean that bonds will not be required on Federal contracts of less than $50.000. Small and minority businessmen. perfectly capable of performing quality services. oftentimes cannot get surety bonds for reasons unrelated to their professional ability. It becomes a vicious cycle. Without bonding you cannot get work. Without work you do not have the building record that will encourage an insurance company to bond you. And on and on. What I am trying to do with my legislation is to cut through the heart of this problem. at least as far as contracts let by the Federal Government. By raising that $2.000 limit to $50.000 I am merely bringing up to date a statute that has unintentionally barred small and minority contractors from competing for Federal contracts.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. early this year I introduced legislation to eliminate the earnings restriction of the social security law. I sought to repeal the provision which denies an older worker $1 in benefits for every $2 of earnings he or she makes over the limit which this year is $3.000. In my view this restriction is unfair and discriminatory. It serves to penalize those older workers who most need the income from continued employment in order to maintain a decent standard of living. Older Americans who have substantial income from investments. stocks. bonds. rents. or similar assets are not subject to any reduction in their social security benefits based on these holdings. This issue has been one of my main concerns since my election to the House in 1970 and I am deeply gratified that today we have the opportunity to strike this restriction from the law. Under this amendment the earnings limitation will rise to $5.000 in 1980. $5.500 in 1981. and be totally eliminated in 1982. H.R. 9346 already provides that the earnings restriction will move to $4.000 in 1978 and $4.500 in 1979. This progression toward removal of the cap on outside earnings will vindicate the rights of those older workers between the ages of 65 and 72 to continue working without being penalized through the loss of their social security benefits. Proponents of retaining the earnings limitation often argue that a change in the law would deviate from the intent of the original social security program. Yet. such arguments are not supported by fact. As the program was first reported by the Committee on Ways and Means in 1935. there was no earnings limitation included. The first Advisory Council on Social Security in 1938 described the contributory program as one in which payments would be \"afforded as a matter of right.\" When the Congress acted on the Councils report by passing the Social Security Amendments of 1939. both the Ways and Means Committee and the Finance Committee reaffirmed this concept by declaring that \"by granting benefits as a matter or right it preserved individual dignity.\" The concept of an individual earning a right to his or her benefit was restated approvingly by the Advisory Councils of 1948. 1958. and 1965. Time for repealing the earnings restriction is long overdue and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

I have been a sponsor of legislation to increase the outside earning income limitation to $10.000 in every session of the Congress since 1973. I have done so because of the number of retirees in my State who have written and talked to me about their need to continue working after retirement just to make ends meet. The Ketchum proposal will once and for all eliminate this repressive provision of the law that has virtually told the Nations senior member of the labor force that he cannot retire and at the same time continue to work to the extent he wishes after age 65. Under current law. a social security beneficiary who earns more than $3.000 during the year is penalized $1 for every $2 over that amount earned. The Ketchum amendment would continue limitations in 1978 at $4.000 in 1979 at $4.500. in 1980 at $5.000 and in 1981 at $5.500. Beginning in 1982. the outside earnings limitations would be completely eliminated for those citizens over age 65. To offset the increased payments in 1982. the amendment provides for an increase in both the employer and employee tax rate of 0.1 percent each. Mr. Chairman. many Americans of retirement age are capable of working. want to work. and are still valuable members of the work force. This Congress is working toward wiping away a gross inequity to the Nations elderly with passage of legislation earlier this year to end mandatory retirement for most of the Nations senior workers. We should eliminate this inequity as well for those who want to retire. continue working on a parttime basis and still retain the full measure of social security benefits that are rightfully theirs.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of my colleagues amendment which would remove the earnings limitation on recipients of social security benefits. I have always thought that it was unfair to impose a limitation on the amount of money which a retired person receiving social security benefits could earn. These workers have earned their benefits and should receive them while still being allowed to lead full. active. and productive lives. This ceiling on earnings discourages our older citizens from continuing to contribute to our economic wellbeing and limits the jobs available to those who choose to work. The earnings of these workers continue to be subject to social security taxes. so there is no great loss to the overall system. In addition. both Houses of Congress have recently voted to raise the mandatory retirement age in private industry to 70. Previously workers were forced to retire at age 65 although many had no desire to do so. Hopefully this change in the age discrimination law would allow millions of workers to continue their employment. This. of course. would eliminate some of the financial burden on the social security system and would solve the problem for many who do not choose to retire. But what about those who have already been forced into retirement? This amendment will assure their equality under the law and rectify what I consider to be an injustice.",

The current law allows up to $3.000 in annual earnings. Every $2 earned by a social security recipient beyond that amount results in a $1 loss in benefits. The bill before us today does improve the situation. It would raise the limitation to $4.000 in 1978 and to $4.500 in 1979. This is a step forward but I do not believe it goes far enough. In fact. I am sponsoring a bill that would immediately increase to $5.000 the amount of outside earnings permitted each year without deductions from benefits. The high rate of inflation has been especially difficult for older Americans. They should not be penalized for working and trying to better their economic status. After years of paying into the social security system they are entitled to full benefits. benefits that are rightfully theirs. I urge Congress to give a financial break to our Nations older Americans. I urge the complete phaseout of the social security earnings limitation.",

I proposed this amendment to create a National Commission on Social Security. It failed there on a 17to17 tie vote. However. fellow members. both Democratic and Republican. have urged me to offer this amendment. I believe it will have the support of a great majority in this Chamber. The reason that I introduced the amendment was the paucity of information on the various proposals for the longterm financing of our social security programs. There is little doubt that H.R. 9346 addresses only the shortterm financial needs of these programs. I believe that the Congress must soon find solutions to the longterm problems. Indeed. if this Congress raises the taxes on American citizens. as this bill proposes. to finance the programs between 1978 and 1985. I think it is equally important to assure our taxpayers that we intend to maintain a viable system through longterm solutions. I have come to the Congress without much confidence in study and advisory councils. Too often they serve little use. However. as a member of the committee which has debated the intricate and complex issues in social security. I am convinced that a high level. nonpartisan. independent Commission with the mandate to work quickly and report to the Congress would well serve the Nation. In its entire history the system has never been studied by an independent group. Previous studies have been entirely by -the administration without a broad scope or outlook for innovative financing methods. I In my judgment the study is necessary if the Congress is going to enact necessary longterm solutions to retirement. survivorship. disability. and health insurance programs. I urge your support. Let me add that creation of this Commission is not an original idea. It is the composite idea of many Members of Congress. Mr. LEVITAS. my friend and senior colleague from Georgia. introduced a similar measure in the last Congress and earlier in this session. Our friend. Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin. has introduced similar legislation and urged its enactment. The Commission is a basic first step in our providing assurance of the longterm existence of social security.",

Most importantly. because it is mandated to go beyond the social security advisory committee that does exist under the law. although the one that is supposed to be apnointed has not been appointed. but while they have looked at the social security system they have been rather myopic. That is all they have looked at from the standpoint of how do you do the best job for the system. Retirement is not isolated to social security. It affects IRAs. Keoghs. and private employer systems and it is that which the Commission should address itself to.

When we waived this provision on the food stamp bill 2 years ago. what happened is that the Agriculture Committee had worked extensively in trying to cut down food stamp expenditures. We had a program then estimated to cost about $6.5 billion. The Agriculture Committee. with GEORGE McGOVERN and BOB DOLE leading the fight. came up with reforms that would have cut it to about $6 billion but they would not have gone into effect until October 1 of. that particular year. At the same time. the Department of Agriculture announced regulations to go into effect immediately which would have cut the annual cost of the food stamp program to $4.8 billion. This Senate. I was one and most of the other Senators were on final passage. let alone the budget waiver. thought that cut. which was legal under the existing law. was too deep. So by virtue of waiving the rules we cost ourselves and this country about $1 billion during that year. money we thought justifiable was to be spent. But let no one think that by that waiver we saved money from what would have been cut from the food stamp program had we not waived it. We would have cut an additional $1.2 billion by administrative action. It is because our ox collectively was being gored. We did not want to cut it that far and we waived it.",

It is not grants. The loans are to be fully reuaid at the cost of interest to the Treasury. I agree with Senators DURKIN and KENNEDY that affordable loans are the answer to the cash crunch problem confronted by middleincome families. particularly if their children want to attend high cost private schools or colleges. S. 3403. the National Student Loan Bank Act is different from the DurkinKennedy plan in both its repayment requirements and its structure.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the revised tuition tax credit bill now before the Senate is designed to provide tax relief to individuals for college fees and tuition and to parents for tuition paid to private elementary and secondary schools. It has strong support because inflation has increased tuition costs at all levels of education. impacting heaviest upon low- and middleincome families. I sympathize with those who see their tax bills climb simultaneously with the cost of living and who are finding it increasingly difficult to provide the best possible education for their children. As revised by the Finance Committee. the bill provides an immediate tax credit for up to 50 percent of tuition and fees for fulltime students in colleges and postsecondary vocational schools with a maximum of $250. By October 1. 1980. the bill would increase the credit to $500 and would extend a credit of up to $250 for tuition at private elementary and secondary schools. Students attending college at least onehalf time. but less than full time. would also become eligible for the credit. Clearly. college tuition costs have risen enormously in the last few years. Since the 197071 school year. average fees and tuition for 4year colleges rose 54 percent at private institutions and 57 percent at public institutions. Similar increases have occurred at 2year colleges. Yet existing Federal student assistance programs are aimed primarily at lowincome families. Only those with income under $15.000 are eligible for the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant program. and only students from families with adjusted income below $25.000 are eligible for subsidized interest payments on a federallyguaranteed student loan. As a result. thousands of families find themselves ineligible for any existing student assistance program even though the burden of rising tuition costs has become increasingly severe.

This program was also rejected by the House Appropriations Committee as well. These actions are in addition to the fact that the House Appropriations Committee had already earlier rejected the Presidents proposal to rescind $463.4 million for B1 aircraft Nos. 5 and 6 that were appropriated in fiscal year 1977. So once again the Congress has sent aclear message to the Presidentit does not \"buy\" his rationale for canceling the B1. And is it any wonder? We spend millions of dollars to come up with an aircraft to handle the manned penetration mission. Then the President cancels this program and persuades the Congress to go along with him because he says we do not need a manned. penetrating bomberthe cruise missile can do it all. And now he turns around and says to us that well. yes. maybe we will need a new bomber and that he supports spending $20 million to initiate a study to develop the FB111H. I think the President had better tell us exactly what he does want. Because if he thinks we need a manned. penetrating bomber. which I strongly feel we do. then we should purchase the most costeffective aircraft to do the jobthe B1. Testimony before the Congress indicates that to develop. purchase. and operate a fleet of FB111H aircraft would be 50 percent more costly than to operate an equally effective number of B1 aircraft. This most recent action by the House provides further evidence that Congress does not share the Presidents perspective on the FB111H. I therefore. strongly urge the President to lift the termination order affecting fiscal year 1977 funds on the B1 so that aircraft Nos. 5 and 6 can be completed.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to express my support for the Advanced Harrier program. At present. our only V/STOL aircraft is the AV8A Harrier. which is built in Great Britain. The AV8B Advanced Harrier will be built in the United States by McDonnell Douglas. This potential for employment by our American citizens is a very important consideration to me as chairman of the Senate Labor Subcommittee. In fact. based on our experience with the F15 and F18 programs. it will mean $150 million in new business for the State of New Jersey alone.. Given the inordinate needs of our economy. the jobs represented by the investment can come none too soon. Not only will this mean more jobs for Americans. but it will insure that we have the technology and the manufacturing capability for V/STOL aircraft in the United States. I believe it is important for our economy and for our national defense that we have a defense industry which includes all vital aspects of modern military technology. The critical role for V/STOL aircraft in our future national defense requirements makes it especially necessary that we have an American V/STOL. The Advanced Harrier. although technically a Marine Corps aircraft. shows great potential in several naval roles. One of the most important tasks facing the Navy is antisubmarine warfare. In the tests conducted by the Navy of the U.S.S. Guam in the role of a sea control ship. the existing Harrier proved extremely valuable in the ASW task. The greatly increased payload of the Advanced Harrier. 6.000 pounds with a short deck run. will make it a more costeffective investment than the AV8A for this and other roles. If the Advanced Harrier program were terminated. the United States would be dependent on other nations for V/STOL aircraft until the early 1990s. when the Navys Type A and Type B V/STOLs should enter service. We would yield the promising VSTOL field to Great Britain and the Soviet Union. It is somewhat disquieting to note that the new Soviet aircraft carrier. the Kiev. carries a V/STOL aircraft. the YAK36. I do not believe that we would serve our national interest to surrender all progress in this field to other nations. Accordingly. I hope that the Advanced Harrier program will be allowed to proceed. to give our Nation the technology to produce operational Advanced Harriers by the early 1980s.",

Senator RANDOLPH. for making it possible to consider H.R. 2817 at this time. The legislation which we are about to consider tonight is one of particular interest to myself and the citizens of Pennsylvania. H.R. 2817 would authorize the appropriation of $7.25 million for the preservation of the last remaining saltwater marshland in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In 1972. Congress created the Tinicum National Environmental Center. The refuges 1.200 acres provide a unique outdoor laboratory for the purpose of exploration and development of new techniques in the field of environmental education and interpretation. Tinicum is the first environmental center in the United States. With the passage of this legislation the Interior Department will be able to expand the present area. and also fulfill the intent of the original legislation. The citizens in and around the Delaware County area have made the Tinicum National Environmental Center a local priority. Not only have individuals banded together to form a citizens group for the purpose of raising money locally. but additionally Delaware County officials have pledged to eliminate four sewage treatment plants. that discharge treated waste into the lagoon. at a cost to the county of $8.42 million. In closing. I recognize the people who have worked so diligently and ardously to make this dream a reality. The citizens group. Concerned Area Residents for Preservation of Tinicum Marsh (CARP). the League of Women Voters. and the Delaware County officials are to be commended for the fine effort that they have expended on behalf of all of the residents of Pennsylvania. Their time and effort has assured our State of a fine facility of which we can all be most proud. Without the timely passage of this bill that tonights action makes possible. Tinicum marshland areas now available for inclusion would be irrevocably destroved. In fact. at this very moment. a land fill permit for 78 acres of vital marshland is now pending before the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources.

The amendment would allow businesses to \"carry back\" product liability losses and apply them against taxable income for the 10 preceding years. This is an extension specifically for product liability losses 7 years beyond the 3year period permitted for most business losses. By allowing businesses to use previous taxable income as at least a partial reserve against major product liability losses. the amendment would help assure that a business which suffered a major product liability loss would have the funds both to stay in business and provide reasonable compensation to injured consumers. The cost of this amendment is estimated to be approximately $10 million annually beginning in fiscal year Second. this amendment makes clear that prudent businesses which set aside funds after taxes have been paid on them to serve as a reserve against product liability losses shall not have those funds subject to the accumulated earnings tax. Under current law. this approach. which is in the interest both of consumers and of businesses. is actually discouraged by the fact that there is a disincentive to create such a reserve.

This amendment has been considered by Congress in previous years. It relates to American corporations doing business abroad. and the way that their earnings abroad are treated for tax purposes. Today these earnings are subject to U.S. in:ome tax. but the tax need not be paid as long as the profits are left abroad. This amendment has nothing to do with the right of American corporations to credit foreign taxes against any tax they might otherwise owe the United States on profits earned abroad. All that this amendment does is to treat Americanowned foreign subsidiaries. doing business in other lands. in the same man-. ner that solely basedU.S. corporations currently are treated. namely. that they pay income tax in the year that the earnings are realized. Under current law it is possible to defer the tax payable on foreign earnings. that would otherwise be owed to the United States. if and until such time that the profits are repatriated. This means. in effect. that an advantage is given to those Americanowned businesses that operate overseas as compared to businesses operating at home. The Foreignbased businesses can defer the payment of income taxes on their profits until such time as they decide to bring those profits home. That may be 1 year. 10 years. 20 years. or never. As long as they leave the profits abroad. they need not pay any U.S. in ome tax on those earnings. This amounts. in effect. to an interestfree loan from the U.S. Government for the period that corporations choose not to repatriate profits. However. we do not give interestfree loans to businesses operating here at home. least of all for tax purposes. If the corporation chooses to leave those profits abroad indefinitely. then it can indefinitely avoid any payments of income tax on those profits. For these reasons. I think it would be strongly in the interest of U.S. taxpayers for the Senate to enact this amendment. I am joined by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts as a cosponsor of the amendment.

The present law does not cause \"U.S. jobs to be exported.\" In our judgment. the net effect of the present deferral provision results in increasing the number of jobs available in this country. We point out that the \"tax deferral\" provision is only operative when the foreign tax does not equal. or exceed the U.S. tax. When the foreign tax rate equals the U.S. rate. there is nothing to defer.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. under the present U.S. law. and the laws of almost every country in the world. earnings by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies are not subject to U.S. tax until these earnings are remitted to the corporate parent in the United States. In a particular country. the subsidiary pays the same taxes as all other corporations located in the country. Thus. until profits are actually paid to shareholders outside the foreign country. all businesses competing In the same foreign country are taxed the same. This \"separate entity\" treatment results in equality of tax treatment. What the Church amendment proposes is that the United Statesbreaking away from the other major industrial powersdisown this concept of equality of tax treatment. It would do this by saying that it does not matter whether all or any part of the earnings of the foreign subsidiary are actually paid out in dividends to its American owners but that the United States will compute taxes each year as if all such earnings were paid out. This. in effect. is the imposition of an \"anticipatory tax\" and is a bad idea for the following reasons:",

    "speech": "I really only needed 3 minutes. Mr. President. but I asked for 5 minutes. Mr. President. we have debated this extensively in the past. and if we want to debate this later. tonight we will. Let me talk about the key document to point out in perspective what deferral really means. as to what the professionals who deal with it really understand it to mean. This is a document leaked to me by the White House. It was the Treasurys recommendations to the President when he was considering this. At the bottom there are three lines for \"agree.\" \"disagree.\" and \"want to discuss further.\" Here is what it says: Proposal. Treasury does not recommend deferral be eliminated. 1. Few companies invest in less developed countries merely because of tax considerations. There is little evidence to suggest that the net impact of foreign investment on domestic employment is large. Other policy instruments are more effective in stimulating domestic employment. 2. Removing deferral is an incentive to a foreign country to raise its taxes on funds withdrawn from the country to the American level of taxation. This is likely to mean that we will obtain little in revenue from removing tax deferral (even less would be received if the corporate rate is reduced.) In fact. this proposal in the long run may result in a loss in revenue to us. since it will encourage foreign countries to impose higher taxes on income withdrawn from their countries than they would if deferral were reteined. 3. The balance of tax incentives now generally favors domestic investment over foreign investment. Although foreign investment benefits from deferral. it is denied the investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation (ADR). In the aggregate. these domestic incentives more than offset the effect of deferral. As a result repealing deferral would represent a step away from taxing domestic and foreign investment at the same effective rates. 4. To deny tax deferral means that income from U.S. investments overseas will be discriminated against relative to other investments in the same foreign countries. The income on these other investments pays only the tax of the foreign country (and usually will not pay any tax to the country from which the investment originated).",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho to eliminate foreign tax deferral. Mr. President. the principal beneficiaries of this amendment will be foreign governments and our foreign competitorsnot the U.S. taxpayer or U.S. worker. U.S. exports in 1977 were $120 billion. From onefourth to nearly onehalf of total U.S. exports are to overseas affiliates of U.S. firms. Accordingly. between $30 to $60 billion of 1977 exports from the United States were shipped to these affiliates. And it is these overseas subsidiariesthe best customers for U.S. goodswho would be economically harmed by subjecting their income to current U.S. taxation. Their profits would be taxed at rates higher than those of their competitors who would be paying on a current basis only the tax of the host country. In general. no country taxes unremitted earnings from operations of foreign affiliates of their corporations. If the United States decided to do so. we can be certain that. in view of current fierce competition for world markets. no country would follow our lead. Secretary Vance noted in a recent speech to the Governors that nearly 10 million American jobs depend on U.S. exports. Using the estimates of U.S. exports earlier referred to. there are between 2.5 to 5 million American workers producing exports for the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. firms. If \"deferral\" were eliminated. many of these jobs would be in jeopardy since the major overseas customers of American exports would be economically damaged. A firstofitskind study recently completed by Arthur Andersen & Co. based on financial data from the overseas subsidiaries of 88 American companies demonstrates that the proposal to eliminate \"deferral\" under the most likely circumstances would result in additional foreign tax payments of $294 million. a U.S. Treasury revenue loss of $88 million. and an overall net tax increase of $206 million to the 88 companies. This would result from the interaction between foreign \"withholding\" taxes and the U.S. foreign tax credit. Overseas subsidiaries would change their distribution policies so as to minimize tax costs. Most companies would increase their profit repatriation patterns from the historic level of about 50 percent to a new level of about 75 percent. \"Deferral\" is a universal system. For the United States unilaterally to eliminate it for U.S. firms would damage their overseas subsidiaries with consequent harm to the U.S. economy and U.S. workers.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the final results of the plebiscite in Panama on the new Panama Canal treaties were announced at an official ceremony on October 28. 1977. We had known from informal reports that Panamanians had voted 2to1 in favor of the treaties. The official tally. certified by the Provincial Polls Committee to the National Electoral Tribunal was 766.232 total votes cast. 506.805 \"yes\" votes and 245.117 \"no\" votesbetter than 2to1 for the treaties. Of the total. 14.310 ballots were voided. I was impressed with both the results of the plebiscite and with the successful exercise of the plebiscite itself as an instrument of the democratic process. First. the Panamanian Government took active measures to inform Panamanian citizens about the treaties. Open and free debate on the treaties was permitted and encouraged. Thorough procedures for verifying the vote were followed. These factors combined give great credibility to the better than 2toi vote in favor of the treaties by Panamanians. Second. I am greatly encouraged that this democratic process was successfully carried out in Panama. I am confident that the United States will use its Improved and renewed ties with Panamathe result of signing. and. hopefully. ratifying the new Panama Canal treatiesactively to encourage such democratic procedures and institutions in Panama. The fact that this vote was conducted in Panama is a constructive consequence of the effort of our country and theirs to work out a treaty beneficial to all concerned. The development and use of democratic practices and procedures in Panama will only enhance the recognition and protection of basic human rights in Panama. Mr. President. the Panamanian plebiscite is the counterpart to our ratification procedure. But obviously. it is a different system and unfamiliar to many Americans.

Mr. Abramovich. a respected electronics engineer. applied for permission to go to Israel in 1971 and has been repeatedly refused. The courage and endurance which Mr. Abramovich and his family have revealed is a lesson to us all. It is courageous that Mr. Abramovich now openly lists his occupation as a Hebrew teacher. unremarkable in any place but the Soviet Union where it is impossible to obtain textbooks. training. or the official recognition accorded teachers of other foreign languages. Pavel Abramovich is one of a small group of heroic figures. the Hebrew teachers of Moscow. who are selftaught and dedicated to a future in Israel. Pavel has publicly renounced his Soviet citizenship. claiming instead. Israeli citizenship. He has sent appeals to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. issued press statements. and has been arrested on several occasions for protesting the treatment of Soviet Jews. His home has been repeatedly searched and personal property confiscated. Pavel has now been threatened with the familiar charge of \"parasitism.\" an example In \"Catch22\" logic. despite the fact that he has been earning his own income by teaching. This pattern of harassment begins with the first application for an exit visa. The loss of livelihood. the curtailment of mail. the harassment of being searched. arrested. and finally tried for \"parasitism\" and sentenced to years in labor camps or prisons is this kind of persecution endured by those who wish only to leave Russia and live in Israel. The willingness of Pavel Peretzovich Abramovich and other Soviet Jews to stand up and to resist Soviet violation of the Helsinki accord. and to endure the hardships resulting from this choice of conscience. should move those of us who are not bound by such constraints to speak out against this travesty of justice.

After 1975. the Internal Revenue Service began making this determination by issuing new tax rulings that reclassified many selfemployed individuals as employees. and demanded that they pay back taxes for the years they were allowed to file as independent contractors. This reclassification has resulted in staggering tax assessments---and often double taxationfor many selfemployed persons. If allowed to continue. it could easily force millions of individuals. including real estate agents. beauticians. barbers. doortodoor salespersons and gas station operators. out of business or into the bankruptcy courts.

It is at such times when the need for peace and quiet is essential for the health and wellbeing of the public. For this reason. many foreign airports have instituted night restrictions on aircraft operations. Curfews have been imposed on both night flights and runup and warmup tests. These are the findings of a survey conducted by the TownVillage Aircraft Safety and Noise Abatement Committee of Lawrence. N.Y. In yesterdays REcORD. I inserted that portion of the committees report which deals with curfews imposed at our domestic airports. Today I would like to follow up. with the results relating to foreign airports. The report states that 37 percent of the airports have restrictions now in effect on both flight and test operations. 14 percent have flight restrictions only and 13 percent have test restrictions only. As in the case of U.S. airports. the typical restricted hours are from 11 p.m. to 6 am. Several of the airports surveyed commented that they had taken additional steps to reduce the effect of noise from lowflying aircraft on the surrounding populace. For example. Tegel International Airport in Berlin. Germany. reported that it has installed soundproof windows in all buildings in their approach and takeoff sectors. These findings lend support to my legislation. H.R. 70. the Airport Noise Curfew Act. which would establish a ninemember commission to investigate the establishment of curfews on night flight operations. The report concludes that night restrictions are a feasible shortterm answer to the growing noise pollution problem. Until such time as all aircraft are manufactured according to established specifications for the reduction of noise. curfews may help to alleviate this problem which is so disturbing to the emotional and physical wellbeing of those living near airports. Noise is truly an international concern. and airports both here in the United States and abroad have shown that night restrictions are an effective solution. I am inserting below the~second portion of the study on night restrictions. I trust my colleagues will find it as informative and impressive as the first: SURvEY o7 NIoT RESTRroNs ON AiScAYT",

This relates specifically to private property which was confiscated by the Cuban Government following Castros rise to power in 1959. This includes claims by private individuals. corporations. churches. and charitable organizations. On July 6. 1972. the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission certified that the principal value of all private U.S. claims for expropriated property totaled slightly more than $1.8 billion.

In other words. the figure set by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission is a 100percent figure. If we agree to a 100percent figure. we do not need negotiators. But if not. they are needed to negotiate. If we negotiate. we want to keep that top figure in mind. but not tied by law to that top figure. because we will not be able to negotiate.

I am only trying as a result of negotiations outside. the State Department authorities who are very familiar with this. they. right down the line. want to arrive at a settlement as near the 100percent value. taking in interest amounts and everything else.

These funds. though a relatively small amount. were requested by the administration for an extremely important function. They would permit the Bureau of the Census to survey a sample of State and local governments concerning finance and employment on a quarterly basis. This action will improve the national economic accounts and provide more timely information on the financial conditions of individual governments. This data will be invaluable to the Congress and to the administration in determining where the needs are for Federal assistance and the direction of change occurring in local economies. This will. to a large extent. minimize the guesswork involved in providing assistance to local governments. Unfortunately. however. the House did not include funds for this survey in their legislation. The significance of the data to be conveyed by the survey will. I am confident. compensate for the cost many. many times over in the accuracy and efficiency of Federal transfer payments to local governments. I strongly urge the chairman to insist upon this provision when the bill is considered by the conference committee.",

I just wanted to comment briefly on the committee report and its recommended deduction of the technical assistance component in the assessed U.S. contributions to the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies. The deductions total $19.250.000including $15 million for the World Health Organization. I am very much concerned over the committees actionnot only because it sharply reduces the amounts needed for us to meet fully our commitments and obligations. but also because it jeopardizes many important humanitarian and developmental efforts by the international community. especially in the field of health. Moreover. the committees justification for the reductions raises some troubling questions over the effect of their action and over our future relations with the international agencies involved. And I know this concern is fully shared by the Department of State and many of our colleagues in the Senate. Mr. President. I have expressed my concern in this matter to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. Because of the widespread congressional and public concern. I feel the record should show that it is not the committees intention that we default in meeting our obligations of membership to the United Nations and the specialized agencies affected by this bill. I also understand that it is the committees intention to reconsider the reductions in this bill and to restore our mandatory obligations through subsequent legislation.

Mr. Chairman. one of the points that seems to have been lost in the debate on the Kelly amendment. and seems likely to be lost also on the Jeff ords amendment. is the fact that the food stamp program is not one that enjoys a high level of confidence with the American people. One speaker today has said the Kelly amendment to bar some strikers from receiving food stamps is not worthy of House attention because it covered only a fraction of 1 percent of the total food stamp cases. The question is not how many persons have to collect benefits not intended for them. The question really is whether the program serves a clientele. which most Americans believe to be genuinely. and involuntarily. needy. We used to say food stamps was a disorderly program because the USDA does not know how to run a welfare program. After today. it is probably more accurate to say it is a disorderly program because Congress chooses to keep it that way. If we structure a program that allows. if the Kelly amendment does not pass. people voluntarily unemployed. or if the Jeffords amendment does not pass. people who exceed the income limits. to receive food stamps. we should not be surprised that the public thinks the program is lousy. Because I believe it is important that the food stamp program enjoy the confidence of the people. I support those amendments. Poll after poll has shown popular objection to food stamps for these very reasons. If these amendments do not pass. the blame for public distrust of food stamps must be laid directly on Congress.",

I have opposed consistently the elimination of the purchase requirement because it seems to me this is the only true discipline we have in this program. The food stamp program was originally enacted into law to achieve two purposes: one. to help move agricultural surpluses into consumption and. two. to help provide a nutritionally adequate diet to all Americans. Those are two commendable goals. We have seen this program grow from a $70 million program in 1964 until today it will cost an estimated $5.5 billion to $6 billion. Unless we restore the purchase requirement it would seem to me that this program would become a welfare program and would no longer belong under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Agriculture. If this amendment fails. the food stamp program ought to be removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. because clearly without the purchase requirement it takes on many aspects of an income transfer program. It is my understanding that the administration has under active consideration recommendations for reform of our welfare programs as they exist today. Perhaps this is one thing that the Administration will recommend. that is the phasing out of food stamps and making it a part of what we can reasonably anticipate will be a guaranteed annual income or a negative income tax. I hope the committee will adopt the amendment and for the time the agriculture committee has jurisdiction over food stamps I would hope we could retain the purchase requirement so that we can have some semblance of a nutrition program and not have it become an income transfer program.

This amendment would reverse the action of the Committee on Agriculture by restoring the purchase requirement for food stamps. Presently. food stamp recipients must pay at least a small amount for their stamp allotments. The bill as reported out of committee. however. would change all that. Food stamps would be provided free of charge. Elimination of the purchase requirement would lead to even greater abuse in the food stamp program. This is basic human nature. A free governmental handout is not treated with the same respect by the recipient as when the person must pay for it out of his or her own money. This point is emphasized by former Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan. an acknowledged expert in the food stamp area. According to Congresswoman Sullivan: No oneno oneshould receive food stamps free. no matter how small their income ... Otherwiseand this is now the case in some situationsthe stamps are considered a kind of \"funny money\" which are merely handed over as a gift from some mysterious source and do not have to be regarded as something you work for and buy. Anything handed over free in that fashion. whether it be food stamps or anything else. invites cheating and abuse. Elimination of the purchase requirement would likewise cause a major increase in the cost of the food stamp program. Estimates published by the Congressional Budget Office run all the way from $520 million to $2.7 billion. The $520 million figure alone is almost three times the entire cost of the food stamp program only a decade ago. Such a gigantic increase is totally unacceptable. For the sake of our Nations taxpayers. we should be working on ways to reduce the size and cost of the food stamp program. not adding millions. if not billions of dollars more onto the price tag. I urge my colleagues to adopt the position of groups such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and support reinstatement of the purchase requirement.

It is strange. coming from a Member from whom the kindest thing he has said about the food stamp program was that it is probably the best of the giveaway programs we have. But in this particular instance. in far too many cases of almost absolute poverty. people are required to raise $60. $70. $80. or $100. or whatever. in order to pay cash for the food stamps. Under the committee bill as I understand it. the recipient who is now paying $100using round figuresnow receives $200 worth of food stamps. The bill before us provides that he would now get the $100 in stamps without having to put up $100 cash which all too often the applicant does not have. I had in my office just a few weeks ago one of my black friends who was the father of 11 children who. when he can workand he is willing to work and is willing to pay for his food stamps--but the schedule he was on required that he had to raise $140 a month to get $320 worth of food stamps. Those figures are approximate. but almost correct. During the winter months after seasonal work. there is absolutely no way he could possibly raise that amount of cash. I checked with the landlord who was giving him a free house. and he verified that during inclement weather there was no work for him. So. I think that if we are going to have the food stamp program. and if it is indeed designed to feed the needy and not the greedy. I think this is a sensible approach.

The Bee Research Center employs 13 research professionals. 9 technicians. and 70 other employees who. in conjunction with the University of Arizona. engage in all aspects of bee research as it relates to agriculture. This research has resulted in many benefits including the development of a greater understanding of the vital pollination function of bees and the intricacies of honey and beeswax production. During his tenure in the Senate and throughout his 50year career in public service. Senator Hayden maintained an active interest in agriculture in general and in the bee industry in particular. He was instrumental in the creation of this center. and as a result of his efforts the Bee Research Center has made significant contributions to the bee industry and. by extension. to all crops which depend upon bees for pollination. In view of Senator Haydens longstanding concern for the bee industry. which resulted both in national recognition of its importance and in Federal programs to insure its viability. it is fitting that the USDA Bee Research Laboratory in Tucson.

Prior to the establishment of this research center in 1964. the Department of Agricultures livestock research activities were scattered throughout the country. The role this Nation plays as the largest beef producing and consuming country in the world underscored the need for a centralized location for these activities which would result in greater efficiency and coordination. Senator Hruska. who is an ardent supporter of American agriculture. served on. the Senate Appropriations Committee where he became the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations. From this position. he was instrumental in passing in 1964 legislation which established the Meat Animal Research Center and in securing as a location for the center the former naval ammunition depot at Hastings. Nebr. He also helped secure appropriations for the center sufficient to permit it to expand into a comprehensive research and development facility. The center has expanded and now occupies 35.000 acres of land in central Nebraska. It serves as the central location of Government research and development into ways of improving livestock quality. controlling livestock diseases. and developing feeding and management practices which will enhance production while minimizing pollution caused by animal wastes. In light of Senator Hruskas longstanding interest in agriculture and his monumental efforts which were instrumental in the establishing and development of the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center. renaming this Nebraska facility after Senator Hruska is fitting recognition for the great service he has provided the State of Nebraska and the Nation.

S. 2946 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture. whenever he considers it desirable. to relinquish to a State all or part of the legislative jurisdiction of the United States over lands or interests under his control in that State. The United States exerts several kinds of legislative jurisdiction over land under its controlthe broadest of which is exclusive jurisdiction. Under this type of jurisdiction. the United States has sole authority to administer the land to the exclusion of all State and local authority. Exclusive legislative jurisdiction is typically exercised over military installations where adequate Federal law enforcement personnel are available. Lands under the control of the Department of Agriculture are generally not subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United States. However. occasionally the Department acquires property. from the Department of Defense for example. over which the United States holds such jurisdiction. In such situations. unless Federal law enforcement personnel are readily available. the Department of Agriculture experiences difficulty in protecting personnel and property because State and local law enforcement officials are powerless to assist. The Meat Animal Research Center in Nebraska serves to illustrate the problem. The Department of Agriculture operates this research center on the site of a former naval munitions depot near Clay Center. Nebr.. over which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction. Adequate Federal law enforcement is unavailable at this location and the Department has at times been unable to control vandalism and other crimes perpetrated against its employees and visitors. The Secretary of Agriculture has requested the authority provided in this bill in order that he may relinquish exclusive legislative jurisdiction over any land administered by the Department. The States would then have concurrent jurisdiction over such land. and this would permit State and local law enforcement authorities to assist in controlling criminal activities. The bill does not mandate the relinquishment of exclusive legislative jurisdiction but merely authorizes the Secretary to relinquish it whenever it is considered desirable. Relinquishment can be accomplished by filing a notice of relinquishment with the Governor of the State concerned or as the laws of such State may otherwise provide.

During markup of the bill in the House Government Operations Committee I noticed. however. that one important aspect of energysaving was lacking. recycling and its resulting effect on conservation of our natural resources. Therefore. I successfully included by the amendment the word \"recycling\" in section 101 of the bill as one of the areas of major emphasis on the part of the proposed Department of Energy. along with solar. thermal. and other technologies. My esteemed colleague from California had the same thought. and as he then amended a section of the bill specifically to include recycling in the responsibilities of the assistant secretary for solar. geothermal. and other energy technologies. It is no novel observation that ours is the most wasteful Nation on Earth. The traditional approach to management of materials. with primary emphasis upon production. use and disposal. has led to the dual problems of a lack of adequate resources to meet increasing demand and an inability to cope with the huge quantities of waste materials. While not the ultimate solution to these problems. recycling has certainly been useful in easing them. For several years I have felt that a much stronger emphasis on recycling should be an important part of the Nations energy program. and have sought the same tax writeoffs for those industries installing recycling equipment as those given for antipollution equipment. The creation of a Department of Energy would seem an appropriate opportunity to reaffirm a national commitment to reusing waste. thereby conserving our precious natural resources as well as the energy expended to extract them. Therefore. I am submitting the following amendment which would require a summary of continuing cooperative and voluntary efforts that have been mobilized to promote conservation and recycling. as well as future plans and recommendations to encourage additional efforts. The House version of the bill calls for a summary of research and development efforts of those conservation and recycling activities funded by the Federal Government.

Although section 17 is clearly designed to apply to regulatorytype activities. it is made applicable to all of the activities of the Department of Energy by section 610 of the bill. The amendment would limit application of section 17 of the FEA Act to regulatory activities of the department leaving the operational activities of the department. including its research and development activities. subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. That act. like section 17 of the FEA Act. contains provisions on membership and requires open meetings. However. that act also recognizes that there are other operational needs to close advisory committee meetingi such as when trade secrets or other private business. confidential information. or other privileged information of a personal and private nature will have to be discussed. As an operational as well as regulatory agency. the Department of Energy will be involved in matters requiring the protection afforded by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The amendment would provide that protection. It does not grant the Department any authority beyond that available to other agencies under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.",

While section 616 relates to the authority of the Department of Energy to purchase patent rights and copyrights owned by other parties. it has no section involving the allocation of rights to inventions created under the Departments research. development. and demonstration efforts. As some of you will recall. the issue of Government patent policy played an important and sometimes crucial role in the development of energy research and development legislation in 1974. This patent policy was much debated. and contributed to delays in that legislative process. before an acceptable compromise was reached between the view of those that believe Government contractors should acquire title to inventions made under contracts and the view that the Government should obtain such rights. The finally agreed to provisions are contained in section 9 of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 (P.L. 93577). Section 9 was derived from the Space Act of 1958 with some modifications taken from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as well as from regulations of NASA. AEC and the principles found in the Presidential Patent Policy Statement. The purpose of my question is to clarify whether this much debated. carefully considered compromise patent policy is to be retained as the patent policy for the new Department. Mr. Chairman. my question is this: Does this really change any of the present law as it applies at this time?",

The section seems to address itself only to research. but it also speaks of testing sites and facilities. and it then goes on to give the Secretary the power to pay for private homes for employees and their dependents. and so on.

As we begin the 95th Congress. the committee is preparing to report to the Senate its findings and recommendations. We were directed to undertake this study in 1975 because it had become clear that the Federal regulatory agencies have an enormous impact on every Americans life. Moreover. there was evidence that some agencies were inefficient. fueling inflation. failing to adequately protect the public health and safety. stifling competition. or otherwise not regulating in the public interest. Of course. it was true then as it is today that not all agencies perform poorly. In fact. there is no doubt that Federal regulation viewed as a whole over the years has had a very beneficial impact on our society. Because of regulation. our products are safer. our environment cleaner and more healthful. and our economy more stable. To be sure. these have been important achievements. But the time has come to deal with the serious problems which have plagued businesses and consumers alike. In the coming weeks the Government Operations Committee will be releasing six studies on regulatory issues. Briefly these studies are: Upgrading the quality of regulatory appointments. improving congressional oversight of regulatory agencies. reducing undue delay in the regulatory process. improving the ability of the public to participate in regulatory decisionmaking. improving regulatory organization. and finally. to what extent is regulation necessary and desirable. I am hopeful that these reports will make a significant contribution to a better understanding of the problems of Federal regulation and provide a basis for congressional action in the 95th Congress. There will be much regulatory reform legislation in the 95th Congress. S. 500 which is being introduced today sets forth one approach which deserves the serious consideration of this body. Senator PERCY and the majority leader serve much credit for their efforts in this area. This is a novel idea which imposes discipline on the Congress and the President to insure that regulatory policies are reviewed periodically in a comprehensive way. Over the coming months.

I wish to reiterate that I do not support and this bill does not provide for the legalization of marihuana. and I wish to clarify the distinction between legalization and decriminalization. Legalization. as the term is used in the drug field. means that marihuana could be legally sold. under appropriate governmental controls. This could. though not necessarily would. be similar to alcohol licensing. The important concept here is that both use and sale would be legal. Decriminalization only pertains to the user. The user is taken out of the criminal justice system. although selling remains illegal. This concept is intended to continue a discouragement policy against marihuana. thus no legal market is permitted. By focusing the law enforcement attention against the commercial traffickers. rather than the user over 90 percent of the marihuana arrests can be eliminated. I oppose legalization because such action may be inconsistent with our current treaty obligations under the Single Convention of 1961. Second. legalization might institutionalize marihuana and give it the status of official approval. thus making its use more inviting and widespread. Third. there are still unanswered questions about the effects of longterm chronic use. and there is still considerable moral opposition to making marihuana available legally. It has been suggested that decriminalization is illogical since it only applies to the user. leaving penalties against the seller. This is not the case. Criminal penalties are retained against the sellers as a means of discouragement. This is consistent with the way we treat such other \"victimless crimes\" as pornography. gambling. and prostitution. It balances the right of the individual in a free society to remain free from governmental interference in his private life. with societys right to protect itself against those who would purvey something society deems potentially detrimental.

First. there has been a terrific growth in the number of libraries participating in consortiums and interlibrary programs. With the continuing explosion of information sources. publications. and periodicals libraries are increasingly hard pressed to keep pace with the field of knowledge. The only way most libraries can deal with this problem is to share resources. and in the continuing development of this type of cooperation the demands made upon the larger libraries have increased markedly. This trend will continue to accelerate. and thus for the foreseeable future we can predict more of the same. and should expect even greater demands to be made of the central resource libraries. Second. the recession has hit libraries as hard. if not harder. than other institutions on the public rolls. Their budgets have been cut. their staffs have been reduced. and their operating hours have been shortened. This may save a few dollars for the municipality in the short run. but the damage done spreads far and wide. Library consortiums in the New York area have been hurt because the city libraryone of the great collections in the Nationis closed 3 days out of the week. In many similar cases from coast to coast the viability of interlibrary associations is being seriously weakened by the decline in services from urban resource libraries.

I do not regard this division as a permanent solution. In the next few years we must have an entirely new piece of legislation concerning all library programs. As I emphasized earlier the libraryrelated legislation we now have needs revision. There are a number of measures in various acts that deal with libraries and the cumulative effect of these various pieces is limited. What is needed is a thorough redrafting of all library legislation into one piece: a National Library Act. More and more we have come to see that libraries are depending more heavily on centralized services and material sharing operations. There is already in operation a range of services offered nationally by the Library of Congress. These services range from cataloging to bibliographic information to contacts abroad. Various other major libraries are operating similar programs on a smaller scale. The growth of these networks is the hallmark of the future in library work. and we need a new piece of leg: islation. a comprehensive act and an act of national scope to continue this valuable and necessary work.

In no way would our request infringe or abridge or deny the diplomatic immunity to which he is entitled under international law. We do not seek to place him in legal jeopardy. All this resolution does is to call upon him for a voluntary appearance. not necessarily in this country. but rather. as the last of the \"whereas\" clauses on the first page makes clear. under conditions that are consonant with international comity. It asks him to do so voluntarily.",

The reason I posed the question about the Department of State is that I have been led to believe that the position taken by the Republic of Korea that its former ambassador would not have to be subject under diplomatic immunity to this questioning is that our Department of State supported that position. fearful of precedents that may haunt our former diplomats.

Farming was then as it is today a rigorous occupation. and many in the early days of Manhattan lacked the desire and stamina to be farm owners and operators.

Administrator of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and her superiors at the Department of Labor. Earlier this week. the Labor Department announced that it was dropping over 1.000 of the rules administered by OSHA. All of these regulations were trivial in nature and not significant to the agencys mission of protecting American workers against injury from industrial safety or health hazards. For the most part. the regulations in question have not been enforced or else have been considered as \"de minimis\" violations only. Nonetheless. their removal from the books makes the OSHA rules that much shorter and easier to grasp. The Labor Departments action allows employers and OSHA both to focus more attention and effort on important health and safety issues and less on minor details that are of nuisance value only. Mr. Speaker. I do think that the role assigned to OSHA. to help make the workplace a safer environment. is an important one. The policy change announced recently by the Labor Department represents a substantive step toward more effective fulfillment of its role. while at the same time minimizing the irritation felt by some employers toward OSHA regulations. Earlier this year. I joined Congressmen SARASIN and STEIGER in an effort to expand the consultative services offered by OSHA. Our goal was to make it easier for concerned employers to obtain advice. in a nonadversary fashion. from Government experts who could tell them how to go about improving the safety of their workplaces. In late April. OSHA did dramatically increase its support for Staterun consultative services. such as those offered in my home State of Ohio. I applauded OSHA for its responsiveness to our congressional initative. Now. I am acknowledging their very positive response to businessmens desire for a pruning of the thicket of OSHA regulations. This is a change in policy that I am sure will be welcomed throughout the business community. And I think that most laborers will also appreciate the added focus on key problems in the occupational safety and health area. At this point in the RECORD.

President Carter issued for comment on November 18. 1977. a proposed Executive order which commits his administration to \"assuring that Federal regulations are as effective. reasonable. and as understandable as possible.\" The resolution I am introducing today puts Congress squarely on record as urging a continued Presidential commitment to assuring that Federal regulations: First. are issued expeditiously. second. are written clearly so as to be readily understandable by those persons subject to or affected by these regulations. and third. are otherwise designed to meet efficiently the goals of those programs to which they relate. Moreover. by urging the President to submit anually a report to Congress indicating the progress made towards assuring that regulations are effective. readily understandable. and expeditiously written. this legislation affords Congress the opportunity to identify continuing impediments to effective Federal regulationmaking. and then to formulate legislative remedies. if necessary. to eliminate such impediments.

By instructing the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety to enforce this air brake standard on the drive axles of all truck tractors. and in his request that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration consider a moratorium of the air brake on truck trailers. Mr. Adams has demonstrated his continuing concern for the need of improving the safety of the Nations truck drivers. The concept behind the 121 air brake system is an admirable one. It is necessary that trucks be equipped with stronger brakes that enable them to stop more quickly. under all conditions. without wheel lockup. The need for surer brakes is particularly relevant as Congress considers new truck size and weight limits. So far. however. technical and manufacturing difficulties involving the antilock device and distribution of its components have caused the benefits accruing from this safety regulation to fall short of expectations. In light of these reliability and maintenance problems which many drivers are experiencing. I am hopeful that the efforts of NHTSA Administrator Joan Claybrook and the Administrations brake task force will be able to correct any malfunctions or inconsistencies within the system during this period. I disagree with those who argue that a possible moratorium may serve as an excuse to phase out this regulation. or signify a lack of concern for truck safety. Rather. I agree with Secretary Adams that such a moratorium will permit a more thorough and exhaustive testing of the state of the art. resulting in the eventual implementation of a more effective antilock air brake safety standard.

However. you may recall that while we did close the door to providing direct assistance to these repressive regimes. unfortunately the back door was left wide open. Through multilateral institutions. like the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program. American tax dollars are continuing to flow to these countries. As an example. from 1977 through 1981. the United Nations Development Program plans to spend $17.7 million for Laos. In addition. the International Development Association (IDA) on January 5 signed an $8.2 million soft loan with Laos. IDA is also considering a second soft loan for about $9 million for water projects in Laos. Since American tax dollars are in fact reaching Communist Laos indirectly. it is extremely important that we take a good close look at where some of our money is going and why.

Mr. Denis Hayes. a senior researcher at Worldwatch Institute. eloquently makes the case for solar energy in todays world in his onthemark article. \"We Can Use Solar Energy Now.\" which appeared in the Outlook section of the Washington Post. Sunday. February 26. 1978. As Mr. Hayes points outEvery essential technological ingredient for a commercial solar energy system has existed for more than a decade. The only other vital element in the solar brew is money. A modest financial assist could boost solar energy into direct competition with todays energy market. If we could offer the average homeowner or small businessman easily obtainable financing \"on terms at least as attractive as those available to utilities to invest in centralized energy sources.\" we could be well on the way toward successfully commercializing solar energy. Last year. I introduced a bill to do just that. As the article explains. the Solar Energy Development Bank Act would provide longterm (30 years). lowinterest (3 percent) loans for the purchase and installation of solar equipment. The Bank would be capitalized at $5 billion. Since it was introduced. the bill has attracted a broad spectrum of support. from consumer and environmental groups to business and labor organizations. It is true that solar has offered us little thus far in the way of electricity. ButAccording to Mr. Hayesa recent U.N. report concluded that solar cells would become cheaper than nuclear power if they received a total investment of $1 billionless than the cost of just one large nuclear power plant. (This is a fraction of the amount the Federal Government has spent to increase the production of oil and natural gas. A recent GAO report places that figure at over $80 billion since 1950.) I do not advocate the dismissal of nuclear energy or fossil fuels. The point Mr. Hayes makes is that solar energy should be given equivalent financial support. As fossil fuels become increasingly more expensive. solar energy will become even",

This is very interesting especially when we consider how much U.S. aid is going to India directly and indirectly. Through fiscal year 1978. it is estimated that India will have received a total of $5.8 billion in U.S. bilateral aid. In addition. during this same time period. the . multilateral institutions (World Bank. United Nations. and so forth) to which we are the largest contributor. have given a total of $7 billion in assistance to India. Very shortly the United States Agency for International Development (AID) will be asking to reprogram $60 million of fiscal year 1978 funds to begin a new bilateral development assistance program in India. AID intends to follow this up with a fiscal year 1979 program of an additional $90 million for India. These are American tax dollars supposedly being provided to India for the purpose -of helping the \"poorest of the poor.\" But wait. Now. India is turning right around and providing $33.3 million in credits to Vietnam for development of their railroads. agriculture. and livestock. Since India is able to use its resources to provide aid to Vietnam. why is it that India needs so much assistance from us? We are constantly being told that India must have our help and that our assistance is going directly to the really poor and disadvantaged. Yet India can afford to purchase military weapons from a number of nations including the Soviet Union. develop a nuclear capability. and now is going to provide aid to Communist Vietnam.

Section 208 of the act requires that photovoltaic systems acquired under the act be used only at Federal sites. and that all such applications be life cycle cost effective. However. I am informed by the Department of Energy that costeffective applications. even on a life cycle basis. are difficult to find only on Federal sites because of the high current cost of solar cells and other system components. The only likely costeffective applications are for delivery of energy in remote areas which have no access to conventional electric grids. and have high operation and maintenance costs for alternative energy sources such as gas or diesel generators or batteries. Thus. the present requirement limiting application of photovoltaic systems to Federal sites severely curtails the research and development potential of the section 208 program. My amendment would expand the potential sites at which photovoltaic systems could be used by Federal agencies to cover sites involved in programs administered by the agencies as well as federally owned sites. For example. Indian lands and U.S. trust territories over which the Department of the Interior has cognizance offer great potential for economic use. In the case of Indian lands photovoltaic systems may have favorable economic application as power sources for tribal water wells and sewer plants and for individual living units. The placement of the systems could be dovetailed with their other programs and ownership of the system conveyed to the Indians as desirable by the Department of the Interior.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a national magazine recently reported the plight of chief corporate officers whose pay increases in 1977 fell short of company profit increases. According to the .item. top executive officers of 100 major U.S. industrial firms received a 12 percent median increase in total compensation whereas the median increase in company profits over the same period totalled 14.5 percent. As a result. the median earnings for top managers rose a meager $50.000. inching upwards to $470.000 from a mere $420.000 in 1976. Second echelon executives fared worse. Their total pay increase was just 11 percent. raising them from $293.000 to $326.900. Median compensation for the third rank of high paid executives. however. reflected a 15 percent increase. jumping from $237.000 to $273.000. This news must be of comfort to millions of men and women working in mines. mills. offices. and factories for $10.000 to $20.000 a year whose earnings also lag behind company profits.

One such diversity is the difference that exists between the interests of the people who live in our urban areas and the people who live in our rural areas. While the things that unite the rural and urban people are much more and much stronger than those that separate them. it is sad but true that many times people for very selfish reasons emphasize the differences and try to build up a split between our urban citizens and our rural citizens. between our farmers and our consumers. There are. however. those who have tried to bridge that gap and have tried to bring the rural and urban people together in a general understanding of each others problems and needs. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Representative FRED RICHMOND of New York for his continuing efforts to bring together the rural and urban representatives on so many issues. Mr. RICHMOND has gained the respect of many rural congressmen through his active and forthright participation on the House Committee on Agriculture. He has also gained our respect for his understanding of the problems of rural people and farmers. In return. I and many other rural congressman have listened and learned about urban problems and urban needs from FRED RICHMOND. In particular. his advice and consultation was important to me on the legislation to aid New York City. His hard work and dedication on behalf of New York City has always been impressive. and his well reasoned arguments on behalf of this legislation to aid New York City convinced many rural congressmen of the need for this legislation. It is this kind of effort exhibited by Congressman RICHMOND that makes us the great country that we are. pulling together many different people to work toward a common goalthe good of our country.

On that day in 1918 the freedom loving people of Byelorussia threw off the yoke of Russian imperialism and declared themselves a free and sovereign people and republic. Sadly. the reemergence of this proud and ancient state after nearly 150 years of tsarist domination was short lived. The type of scourge and oppression which swept the new republic within months was far worse than any it had previously known. The infant democracy had barely taken its first exhilarating breath of freedom when the Bolshevik armies poured across its borders and stifled it under a blanket of repression. But the preserving spirit of the Byelorussian people. the driving force behind the independence movement. could not and will not be quelled. In World War 3:. the Byelorussians had to repel two invaders. the Germans and Soviets. in order to protect the borders of their homeland. For this brave defense of their democratic ideals more than 2.000.000 of them paid with their lives. Once the Germans were expelled the Soviets reverted to welltried methods to control the Byelorussian people: Execution squads. mass deportations. and many forms of political and religious repressions. Even now. the Byelorussians continue to resist vigorously. There is minimal membership in the Communist Party despite the many advantages rendered a member. The farm workers resist authority on the collective and state farms. as demonstrated by the chronic deficiencies in Soviet agricultural production. The many efforts by Moscow to destroy the national spirit and longing for independence of the Byelorussian people have met with dismal failure. To this day. they have never renounced their deep desire for the restoration of democratic government. as embodied by the Republic which the Soviets overthrew in Mr. Speaker. let us congratulate all Byelorussians and commend them for their spirit. courage. and resolve on this 59th anniversary of their independence proclamation. Let us also join them in hoping that very soon Byelorussia may truly reestablish the glorious republic whose founding we commemorate today.",

The Byelorussian Democratic Republic was proclaimed in the capital of Minsk while still under AustroGerman occupation. However. this freedom was shortlived. and ended when the Central Powers were defeated during the First World War. The nation was split between the Poles and the Russians. but soon fell under Soviet domination which continues today. The Byelorussian people have endured much since that time. During World War II. Byelorussia was ruled under German hegemony for 3 years. During that time. the Nazis tried to \"restore\" Byelorussian nationalism and destroyed everything that was Sovietinfluenced. When the Soviets regained power. they reversed this process. Several million Byelorussions were killed as the Soviets reasserted themselves. Despite this oppression. the Byelorussian people have managed to excel in many fields. Most notable is the Byelorussian folklore. among the finest and most colorful in Eastern Europe. For their daily livelihood. the Byelorussian people work the land. Despite its unsuitability for agriculture. they have produced potatoes. fodder. flax. wheat. rye. and barley. Urban industries are developing also. especially in farmrelated production. The Byelorussian people have endured a great deal under Soviet domination. and yet they have managed to maintain their hopes for eventual freedom. On this day of the 59th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of the Byelorussian Democratic Republic. we raise our voices with those of other Americans of Byelorussian descent for the future selfdetermination of their mother country. At this time. we can also implore the Soviet Union to stand by the commitments they made under the Helsinki Agreement and allow the Byelorussian people greater freedom of movement. greater access to new ideas. and renewed contacts with relatives and loved ones.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am pleased to introduce H.R. 5644. a bill designed to adapt the Federal food stamp and commodity distribution programs to the unique realities of American Indian tribal life. This bill is identical to legislation introduced in the Senate today and similar to legislation S. 3235 which passed the Senate 3 years ago. only to be deleted by this Chamber in conference. Since that time the failures of the food stamp program on Indian reservations have repeatedly required the specific extension of the commodity distribution program authority. which expires September of this year. Therefore. in the absence of legislative action such as H.R. 5644. in a few months our Indian people will be left with only the Federal food stamp program to meet their basic food subsistence needs. The problems which contribute to the failures of State operation of the current food programs include: First. the great distances Indian people must travel on poor roads to certification and issuance centers. second. the unresponsiveness of Stateadministered programs to the unique food problems of Indian people. and third. the great distances needy Indian people must travel. without the availability of public transportation. to reach food stores offering nutritious foods at affordable prices. In my home State of Minnesota. for example. the range of round trip distances which some people must travel on six Minnesota reservations to the nearest food stamp certification and issuance center is from 10 to 260 miles. There are several aspects of this bill which are intended to build flexibility into the Federal food programs available to our Indian people. First. it provides each tribe with a choice of electing which family food programs they prefer. Second. it provides for Federal payment of 100 percent of the costs necessary to administer the programs. This modest but necessary increase in Federal administrative costs shall be available to either the State or tribal administrative agencies. Third. the bill provides for tribal administration either separately or concurrently of the food stamp and commodity distribution programs with adequate support and technical assistance to assure program administration in a responsible fashion. The time is long overdue for adjusting food stamp and commodity distributior program operation in a manner geared to the special geographic and cultural circumstances existing on Indian reservations. I request your support of this bill to assist in accomplishing this end.",

The restriction imposed on overseas conventioneering in last years tax bill was a moderate and reasonable one. To overturn the present law would only hurt American jobs and tourism. If Americans find it absolutely necessary to attend more than two conventions a year. they should give our own economy a boost by spending their money in Florida. Hawaii. or the Poconos of Pennsylvania. Second. I oppose this amendment because the Canadian Government has been unwilling to reconsider a policy which has brought serious economic injury to certain businesses in this country. and yet wants us to unilaterally amend our tax laws to facilitate convention travel by U.S. citizens in Canada. I speak of bill C58. the Canadian law which denies the deductibility under Canadian income tax law of advertisements placed by Canadian firms on U.S. television stations for the purpose of reaching Canadian viewers. This measure grew out of the wave of nationalism which swept over Canada some time ago. This movement considered the influence of American culture and American television to be detrimental to Canada. The practical effect of bill C58 has been to threaten the economic stability of a number of U.S. television stations whose signals reach Canadian viewers. In Erie. Pa.. for example. one TV station has suffered an 80percent decrease in its advertising revenues from Canada since C58 was enacted last year. Such a decrease. over an extended period of time. can make the difference between life and death for small broadcasting operations. To repeat. Mr. President. until the Canadian Government demonstrates a willingness to enter into serious discussions on the question of C58. no serious consideration should be given by this Government to facilitating convention travel by Americans in Canada or any other foreign country.",

As Senators know these distinguished members of the Government of Great Britain are members of the Labor Party in England. Yet the important thing that I recall about what was said at that luncheon was that England recognizes the relationship of investing a larger proportion of the gross national product back into business than we are investing here in this country. The laborers of England. the unions there. recognize this fact. I know his excellency. Mr. Healey. observed that he was hoping that he could persuade the union movement in England to understand that productivity has to increase at a rate not less than wages increase or England would be in trouble. He made one further observation that struck me as particularly significant. and that was that the revenues that England hopes to receive. and indeed in all likelihood will. from the oil discoveries in the North Sea will be used not to go into social programs. as we seem so insistent to do in the United States. but rather to repay the loans that have been granted by the International Monetary Fund to England to pay the interest on their national debt and. in a word. to help encourage the accumulation of capital. recognizing. as England does. that that has to be the only way out of their economic difficulty. That is the way that we expand jobs. That is the way that England is expanding jobs.

I rise today in support of a similar exclusion for interest or dividend income earned by individuals on a time or demand deposit with an insured commercial savings bank. savings and loan association. or credit union. The effects of such an exclusion would comport with the purpose of this comprehensive program to decrease unemployment and to stimulate capital formation. Specific lly. this proposal would provide an additional incentive for taxpayers to save. It would encourage deposits in savings accounts. thus increasing the supply of mortgage money. In turn. the homebuilding industry would be further stimulated. Such a proposal would also help to equalize the treatment of those who save with those who invest in equity and other securities. The exclusion of a portion of Interest would help to lessen the discrimination against this type of investmpnt as compared to other investments. Dividends are subject to an exclusion. capital gains are taxed at reduced rates if longterm. and State and local bonds are exempt from Federal. and often State. income taxation. Mr. President. I think that there is an excellent opportunity before this body to eliminate many of the burdensome inequities in the tax system which trouble the American people. This exclusion of interest income is one way to take advantage of the opportunity. Accordingly. I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in full support of this measure.

By providing encouragement to savings by excluding from taxes. the first $100 of interest and dividends received each year. we do a couple of important. worthwhile things. I mention dividends because. while it is a technical point. savings and loan associations do not pay interest. they pay dividends. But I think the word \"interest\" in the amendment refers as well to dividends paid by savings and loans. This amendment would urge more people to save a little more. That would mean more funds available in the economy for business investment and that means more jobs. Second. it will encourage people to put aside more for retirement. That will mean that more people will be independent in their retirement. and in instances of financial hardship. Our Nation has one of the lowest rates of reinvestment in the world. At this time. we take less than 20 percent of our output and put it back into our productive capacity. That 20 percent must pay for depreciation and growth. It Is not enough. Nations such as Germany reinvest 28 percent of their GNP. Japan reinvests 36 percent. It is no wonder that we have some tough competition in world markets. In fact our reinvestment rate is about the sameor a little loweras the rate of Great Britain and Italy. We all know the condition of their economies.

Herlihy. has been a leader in keeping alive the proud Irish heritage which is the background of a large part of the Worcester area population. It is with great pleasure that I join in extending my very best wishes for happiness and continued good health to Dan on this occasion when his substantive contributions to the good of the overall community are recognized. A native of Cork. Dan arrived in Worcester in October 1949. He served his country in the Army during the Korean war for 2 years. and upon his return from duty he became employed with the New England Telephone Co. During this time. he enrolled in evening courses and graduated from Worcester Junior College. After several promotions. Dan secured the position of engineer with the company. which he still holds. Along with his work and schooling. Dan always found time to participate in community and political affairs. Like so many other immigrants to our shores. Dan shares a strong tradition of political independence and a love for freedom. He has been very active in the Ancient Order of Hibernians. division 36. and has been instrumental in bringing many wellknown speakers to Worcester. The year 1976. along with being our Nations Bicentennial. was also the 150th anniversary of the first permanent Irish settlers in Worcester. Dan got the idea that a fitting memorial ought to be erected. He served as chairman of the Worcester Irish Memorial Committee. and was a key figure in negotiating an acceptable agreement to the erection of a Celtic Cross on the Worcester Common. Daniel Francis Herlihy is first and foremost a fine and grateful American. a true son of Erin. a great leader. a man of integrity. a devoted husband and a proud and loving father. His outstanding character. his sense of compassion for all. and his commitment to his city and our country are of the highest quality and his vast contributions to the community serve as a reminder of the good of which each of us is capable.*",

Of course. our troops will be present until the end of the century under the treaties before us. Furthermore. I think another important consideration in judging our position is whether we will be operating in a hostile environment or a friendly environment. We ought never to lose sight of the fact that the nature of our relationship with the Republic of Panama and with the people of Panama is very important to our ability to use the canal in a peaceful and constructive way. And if we can arrive at treaty arrangements which are satisfactory to both parties. protect our interests. and develop a relationship of mutual respect and friendship between the two countries. I submit that this will be the most constructive and the most positive way to insure our continued use of this canal. which is fundamentally what we want. The canal does not have much value if you cannot use it. The value of the canal is in its use. and if we can insure and maximize our opportunity to use it under circumstances in which we have a friendly environment and a positive relationship. we should seize that opportunity.

There was a time when we all realized that only divine intervention could destroy the world. that only the divinity had the power to destroy the whole world. Unfortunately. Mr. President. we have reached the ability within ourselves. within our own lifetime. for mankind to destroy itself. We know that between the United States and the Soviet Union we have the power to destroy the world many. many times over. We also know that should we ever unleash that genie. should we ever unleash the dogs of nuclear war. then they will never be harnessed again. If we ever went to global nuclear war. none of us would be able to stand here afterward and decide who was right and who was wrong. neither our country. the Soviet Union. nor any other country would survive that. I share the concern of the Senator from Montana. that the neutron bomb itself is just one step which makes it easier and easier to lower the threshold of nuclear war. If that threshold is crossed. then neither my children nor anybody elses children will see their way into the next century. the century in which. under all other rights. they should spend the majority of their lives. Mr. President. I yield back the floor.",

The present administration seems to maintain that this is a time for concession and retreat around the globeconcession in Cuba. Panama. China. and in the SALT negotiatiofs. retreat in Africa.

This is a good amendment. We are talking here about the Board which will operate. maintain. and set tolls for the canal. Four of these individuals will be Panamanian. I cannot see how any U.S. Senator would be opposed to requiring these people to face Senate confirmation. Decisions made by this Board will determine whether or not the canal will remain selfsustaining. Nothing in this treaty requires these people to meet any standard of competence. honesty. or integrity. I think it is only right that we here in the Senate should be able to say yes or no to any individual nominated to be a member of this Board. However. I am sure the leadership will do as they have done on all previous meritorious amendments and stonewall it. It is too bad that wellmeaning people cannot improve a treaty which is so poorly negotiated. so poorly written. and so heavily favorable to Panama.

All of us who knew Jim share the terrible loss DICK BOLLING has suffered and I wish to join their many friends in expressing deep sympathy in this difficult hour. DICK BOLLING has lost at once a loving wife. a trusted adviser. devoted friend. and tireless aide. And the Congress has lost a woman whose contributions to this institution are known to us all. Although she rarely sought a headline or even notice in the House. she worked with steady dedication for many years to make the House worthy of the affection which she and her husband gave it. Few men or women elected to Congress have had the impact that Jim Bolling did. from no official capacity. in reforming Congress and bringing the organization and procedure of the House into line with the democratic concepts of our time. Mr. Speaker. all of us will miss Jim Bolling. We will miss her strength. her courage. her wisdom. and her vision. For myself and my wife. Evelyn. I express my deepest sympathy to DICK BOLLING and his family and to join the House in mourning their loss.*",

New Republic. calls some important points to our attention. TRB is quite right when he writes that we Americans have shown a rather remarkable degree of faith and confidence in our institutions which today remain strong after having been subJected to many years of abuse. But these institutions are not indestructible. At this time we are again coming to the realization that inflation is a cruel tax that plagues us by eroding purchasing power while driving us into ever higher tax brackets. Some argue that the biggest culprit is the Federal Governments inability to live within its means. another $60 billion deficit. it is said. is the prime factor behind the latest increase in the rate of inflation. But part of the deficit is attributable to what IRS Commissioner Jerome Kurtz calls the $200 billion subterranean economyincome sheltered legally and otherwise from Federal taxes. So tax reform ought to be a tool in any antiinflation program. And tax reform or better enforcement of existing laws is needed if Americans are to continue to believe in the fairness of the present system. IRS Commissioner Kurtz has indicated that he is aware of the enforcement problem. but adequate resources to conduct more thorough investigations into possible shelter abuses are lacking. Advocates of tax reform may sometimes feel that they are pursuing a willothewisp. But better enforcement of present laws ought to be obtainable in short order. As TRB concludes. this all should give us \"something to think about on April 15.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the city of New York will soon be observing Italian Culture Week during the week of April 1623. This occasion is a source of great pride for the millions of Italian Americans not only in New York City. but for those across the Nation. We stand proud of our rich heritage. for the sons and daughters of Italy have made invaluable contributions in all fields of human endeavor. including science. education. the arts. sports. and other areas too numerous to mention at this time. Their achievements have all too often been ignored by our history books. but these individuals are giants in the hearts of all Italian Americans. It cannot be denied that the news from our native land has been less than encouraging during the past few months. the most recent incident being the kidnaping of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro. We must keep in mind. however. that this increase in terrorist activity is not unique to Italy alone. These heinous attacks have sadly become a fact of life in nations throughout the world. The kidnaping of Moro is a further indication that no government or amount of protection can adequately thwart terrorism. There is no doubt in my mind that Italy will survive this tragedy. but its recovery can be hastened if the United States and other democracies throughout the world offer their support. That is why I have joined many of my colleagues in cosponsoring House Resolution 1082. which expresses Congress condemnation of the Moro kidnaping and terrorism around the globe. The political and social unrest inherent in todays Italy cannot dim the lure of that countrys art. music. landmarks. and other contributions that have enriched the history of the world for untold centuries. That nation has withstood the turbulence of numerous wars. earthquakes. and other disasters--both natural and manmadethat have destroyed weaker nations. and I remain firm in believing that todays turmoil will also be overcome. We. of Italian heritage. must rally behind our homeland during these trying times. and I again remind all Americans of the valuable contributions made by Americans of Italian descent. Having helped found and expand our United States. they continue to play a vital role in the strengthening of our country.

I would like to call to my colleagues attention a recent speech by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. \"Americas Stake in an Open Trading System.\" Some sectors of our economy are threatened by imports. In my own district. shoe companies and other industries have been hurt. I support the efforts being made by Ambassador Robert Strauss and others in the administration to insure that our trading partners are playing the game fairly. We appear to be moving well in the right direction. I also favor programs. such as economic adjustment assistance. that help workers in this country who have lost their jobs due to imports. Because of my concerns about the impact of foreign trade. I have joined the Congressional Steel Caucus and the House Informal Working Group on Textiles. I am also concerned. however. about the trend toward protectionism that appears to be evident in this country and among many Members of Congress. As Secretary Vance points out in his speech. protectionist actions by the United States would do direct harm to our own interests. Before we consider any protectionist moves. we should remember that if we restrict trade. other countries will do the same. This occurred in the 1930s with disastrous consequences. The costs to the public of such actions at this time would also be disastrous. One of every eight manufacturing jobs in this country depends on exports. and each of these jobs create another one in a supporting industry. Every third acre of American farmland produces goods for export. In my State of Illinois It is one out of two acres. Exports contribute a total of $200 billion to our gross national product. -Many of our industries depend on imported materials to produce their final goods. If we invoke protectionist policies. our consumers would suffer from rising prices and rampant inflation. As many as 10 million jobs would be jeopardized. American consumers and workers would be the losers. Secretary Vances speech is an effective antidote to protectionist pressures. and I would like to insert it. as well as a column I wrote some weeks ago on international trade. into the REcORD at this point:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am slowly becoming convinced that the doctrine of mutual assured deterrence is indeed MAD. We have now developed the neutron warhead. a weapon that destroys people with minimum property damage. and it is hailed as progress. Through the existence of such a \"selective\" weapon commands a certain perverse fascination. we must recognize that the neutron bomb can only increase the chances of nuclear war. Through adherence to the MAD doctrine. we have now created a weapon whose sole merit is that it will frighten the other side because it is so usable. This is supposed to contribute toward stability. The bomb is designed to deter a conventional attack on our NATO allies. Should Soviet troops and tanks swarm across our lines. however. these eminently practical warheads could be shot toward them from as close a range as threequarters of a mile. Having scared the other side sufficiently. we could then regain control of our allies soil and nary a farmhouse would have been damaged. Right? Wrong. Once any nuclear weapons are used in battle. the barrier barring their use is destroyed. The use of neutron warheads would blur the distinction that exists between conventional and nuclear weapons and there would be nothing to stop further escalation. Moreover. even if we did try to deter an attack by conventional means. it is doubtful that a field commander whose lines of communication have been cut and whose troops are being threatened would hesitate to use the most \"effective\" weapon at his disposal. It is my fervent hope that President Carter will be true to his first inclination and bar further funds for this dangerous weapon. We cannot allow advances in weapons technology at the cost of world peace and security. The continued development of the neutron bomb threatens both.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I voted against H.R. 11445 yesterday due to the provision in the bill to increase disaster loan interest rates to 5 percent instead of continuing the present 3percent level for loans to small business. I concur with the extension of present low interest rates for disaster loans to homeowners as well as other features within H.R. 11445 of benefit to small business. but I find the increase in disaster loan interest rates for small business to be unwarranted and prejudicial. My objections center upon title I of H.R. 11445 and concur with my opposition to S. 1306 defeated on the House floor on November 1. 1977. when a nearly identical move was attempted to increase small business disaster loan interest rates to 5 percent for loans issued during the first 9 months of this year. It was illadvised to attempt to increase these interest rates then and remains wrong today. Small businesses which would be aided by a $250.000 maximum loan at 3percent interest are primarily independently owned stores and businesses that are family operated. These \"mom and pop\" small businesses simply do not have the operating capital or economic nest egg to rebound from a severe flood or natural disaster. Many have to take out a second mortgage on their businesses or refinance their homes in order to recover. Those who need an SBA loan larger than $250.000. pay the 6/-percent interest rate to make the program selfsupporting. Thus. it is geared to benefit small business most. With last years rejection of higher interest rates for small business disaster loans. a commitment was given to thoroughly study the interest rate structure prior to any change from existing policies. I am not a member of the Small Business Committee. but information available to me shows no study has been forthcoming. In other words. the House has acted to continue low homeowner interest rates. but not those for small business without substantive justification for taking either action. I support the preservation of the existing 3percent interest rates for small business loans and action taken within H.R. 11445 of benefit to individual homeowners.*",

I would like to share the remarks of Ms. Marjorie Boehm. national president of the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom. who testified before the committee on It is too easy to think of a budget as simply a mass of figures without realizing the full human impact on the citizens of this country. Ms. Boehms testimony is directed at that human impact. This year defense spending will again be one of the largest single components of the Federal budget. While we all realize the vital importance of national defense to this country. there is considerable evidence that we pay too high a price for that security. Defense spending. with the billions of dollars in contracts that it hands out to American industry. has traditionally been considered an important stimulus to the economy. That assumption. however. is being brought into question. As these questions are raised. it becomes increasingly important to redefine what is actually the \"national security\" of this country. Ms. Boehm is a resident of Santa Clara County and is familiar with the impact of defense industries on the local community and its residents. The conclusion her testimony reaches is clear: Rather than a boon to the economy. excessive Government spending on weapons systems and military manpower can be a brutal sacrifice and a tragic underuse of our national resources. This lesson is valid throughout the country. The testimony follows: Honorable Chairman and members of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives.",

Admiral Stockdale is trying to find ways to teach the next generation of Navy officers how to withstand if necessary the tortures. beatings. and fear he resisted for 7/2 years. His theory and method are. to my mind. accurate. He knows better than any man that courage does not exist until it has been used. until there is something to fear and overcome. Courage cannot be exhibited in the classroom but only in the crucible of combat and war. Courage itself cannot be taught with lectures and class notes but perhaps the reason to be courageous can be.

It was the values of civilization. the wisdom of the great teachers which formed the bedrock of Admiral Stockdales courage and which he believes will form the bedrock of courage for his officer students.

I can attest personally to the care which the gentleman from Wisconsin and his subcommittee have taken in examining the issues presented by this legislation. Among the many people who support the legislation are individuals like former Senator Tydings. who appeared before the American Bar Association. and he was one of the original drafters of the 1968 magistrate legislation. Senator Tydings observed: Personally. I have a deep and sincere conviction with regard to the merits of this bill. I take pride in. and have received great gratification from. the fact that I helped draft the Federal Magistrates Act of 1968 and personally chaired the extensive hearings on the legislation while a U.S. Senator. This bill is a logical extension of the principle. and in keeping with the purpose and intent of. that Act when originally enacted In 1968. Mr. Chairman. my good friend and our colleague from Massachusetts mentioned at least two reasons why he will feel constrained to oppose the legislation. One is that he feels that there is no longer the need for this legislation given the imminent enactment of the omnibus judgeship bill. I would suggest to the gentleman that this might be true. and there might be some underutilized magistrates and some instances where there is clear misuse of talent. But at leastusing the State of Kentucky as an examplemy judges at home tell me that in short order there will be need for even more Federal judges even with the enactment of the omnibus judgeship bill. Which in the State of Kentucky would provide two permanent and one temporary Federal judge. even that will not be sufficient. But. the gentleman also cites constitutional arguments against the enactment of this legislation. I would directnot that he needs his attention called to itbut I would direct the attention of the Chamber to pages 10 and 11 of the committee report. which deal with the constitutional argument.

I plan to offer two amendments to see if there is not some way possible in which we can provide support or assistance to private groups which border an area where there is a privately constructed dam. We did authorize the Corps of Engineers to examine these private dams in the National Dam Inspection Act. legislation passed in 1972. and we do have such a private dam in my congressional district which the Corps of Engineers has suggested may be dangerous. Now the whole community is in some state of distress. because of the threatening condition of the dam. They have lowered the water level down 7 or 8 feet. Apparently this creates a terribly unsatisfactory situation. Therefore. I am going to suggest two amendments. one of which would provide for an indepth engineering study of the dam. and the other which might establish a revolving fund for low interest loans in order to assist this group in meeting the expenses involved as far as repairs are concerned. I will discuss these proposals in detail on Wednesday when amendments are in order. but I just wanted to alert the gentleman from Minnesota and the chairman of the committee. to whom I have already spoken about this subject. to see if we can arrive at some sort of solution. I am hopeful that I will have the sympathetic ear of the chairman and of the ranking minority member on this subject.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in reluctant support of H.R. 13059. the Water Resources Development Act of 1978. Although this bill authorizes many worthwhile projects. I am distressed to see the inclusion of funds to begin stage I of the socalled Hudson River skimming project. This proposal has been the object of a great deal of opposition in New York State. and for good reason. Not only is it unsound from the environmental and economic points of view. it also could pose a serious threat to public health. The Hudson River project. proposed by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. calls for water to be taken from the Hudson River near Poughkeepsie. treated. and then piped into the New York metropolitan area. It is claimed that the project. which would eventually cost $4.6 billion. is necessary to eliminate a projected shortage of water in the year 2000. However. the TriState Regional Planning Commission and other groups have shown that the shortage will not be nearly as severe as claimed. Inaccurate population projections and questionable per capita rates of water consumption have contributed to a greatly overstated estimate of shortage. Presently. New York City water is among the purest in the country. because its source is uncontaminated upstate rainwater. The waterskimming proposal would add to this Hudson River water. shown to be contaminated by a wide variety of toxic and cancercausing chemicals discharged into the river as industrial waste water. Chemical pollution of the river has become so serious that commercial fishing in the Hudson has been banned by the State. It is very difficult and expensive to test for and treat harmful substances and even treated water may contain dangerous levels of toxic chemicals. To subject New Yorkers to such potential hazards is unnecessary and risky. In conclusion. there are far less risky alternatives worth investigating to meet New York Citys water needs. A program of water conservation alone could save over 400 million gallons of water each day. These savings. combined with better use of existing reservoirs. would make it unnecessary to adopt this proposal.*",

Were not overproduced. were undersold. If we could only feel we had leadership. that the government would work with us to find a solution. rather than tell us what it is. We just dont see where the end of the road is. Just a little encouragement out of the system. that better days are ahead. would help. As we all should realize by now. the agricultural sector of the economy. including sugar producers. is in tough economic straits. But no encouragement is coming from the Carter administration As the Presidents position on sugar legislation illustrates. the White House continues on its dogged course. pursuing a policy which. by selling agriculture short. keeps the Nation bound to trade deficits and to a highinterest. debtridden. and inflationary economy.

I think it is extremely important that the Members of this House understand that if we were to depart from the general philosophy of this bill and go into a situation where we made direct payments out of the Treasury to the sugar growers. we would not only be adding to deficits and more inflation but. more importantly for those who represent the Corn Belt. we would be denying the development of the corn sweetener industry. We have a great deal of corn on hand right now. and Members should be advised that keeping a viable corn sweetener industry going means the use of about 300 million bushels of corn per year. Therefore. if we were to go to an alternate system. which we had in the past. where we made direct payments to the sugar growers. it would make a very. very unfair sweetener competition market.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I urge adoption of the Sugar Stabilization Act of 1978 as reported by the Committee on Agriculture. This important piece of legislation is needed to preserve and protect the domestic sugar industry. In large measure the problems faced by our sugar industry stem from foreign imports. Heavily subsidized foreign sugar is flooding into our Nation. Following a series of record crops worldwide. other countries are taking their excess stocks and exporting them to the United States. Serving as a dumping ground for foreign sugar is injuring our own domestic producers. Prices are being depressed to the point where producers are losing money on their crops. Unless we act now. the domestic sugar industry could be irreparably shattered. To help reverse this trend the bill establishes a price objective of 16 cents per pound. That figure would be adjusted semiannually based on the parity index and the wholesale price index. A system of mandatory import fees and quotas would be utilized to achieve the price objective. I think it is also important to note what the bill does not do. Most significantly. the legislation is not an income support program with taxpayerfinanced payments to producers. There are no Government payments to producers. In addition. I would point out that this is not just a bill for producers. Consumers also benefit from having a strong domestic sugar industry. Dependence on foreign sugar would leave us at the mercy of other countries when it comes to price. You can be sure that if our sugar industry collapses the price will skyrocket. The bill approved by the Committee on Agriculture is a major step toward assuring a strong domestic sugar industry. It will aid producer and consumer alike by promoting price stability and assuring that we do not become increasingly dependent on foreign supplies. I urge its adoption.",

I agree with the gentlemans statement that the price of sugar rose to 60 cents a pound in a very high market and that a great number of fortunes were being made. I would even go so far as to say the public is being ripped off. I do not think it is being ripped off by the sugar producers. I wish someone could explain to meand perhaps there are some answers availablewhy. when the sugar price went so high. all the soft drink manufacturers and all the big candy companies doubled the price of their product and cut in half the size of their product. and why today. when the price of sugar has gone down to about 10 cents a pound. the size of the soft drink and the price of the soft drink is still out of sight and the size of the candy bar is still just half of what it used to be. If there is a ripoff going on. I think perhaps we ought to consider looking at some of these industries when there is talk about fortunes being made. Did anyone ever look into the fact that when the price of sugar goes down. none of the prices of any of these corresponding products also go down? That is where we use sugar. We do not use it in raw form. We use it in consumer soft drinks and candy bars. et cetera. That is where the real ripoff is taking place.",

Likewise. it guarantees that Panamanian vessels of war and auxiliary vessels will be able to go to the head of the line whenever the Panamanian head of statebe he the President or the \"maximum leader\"-determines necessary. Furthermore. it insures that it will not be necessary for both nations to agree that a \"need\" or \"emergency\" exists. in order for ships of either nation to receive this priority passage right. It treats both nations equally and fairly. It resolves any potential problems regarding the appropriate definition or criteria for determining what a \"need\" or an \"emergency\" is. Mr. President. I strongly suggest that it is the better part of wisdom for the Senate to amend amendment No. 21 with this simple but significant phrase.

I am cosponsor of the amendment so I do not have any quarrel with the leadership amendment. I think it does help somewhat. My point in raising the Panamanian position was to point up that we had a different negotiating position up until May of 1977 and then we yielded on that position and the Panamanians were. properly so. gloating about It because. as I understand. as late as May of 1977 we were negotiating this language which said. in part: In the case of a situation of emergency to transit on a preferential basis upon the request of either the captain of the vessel or the authorities of the Government concerned. Now the only governments we are talking about are Panama and the United States of America. and that is why I suggest by adding 14 words we get back to that negotiating position. which I feel is the correct one. that if there is some need or some urgency. or some emergency somebody has to make a decision. They have to make it very quickly. We cannot wait for a meeting. We cannot wait for somebody to decide: Well. we have to talk about this and have a committee meeting and do whatever else they might want to do in the meantime. I guess you go back to the old saying: Well. just do not worry about the treaty. go on right through the locks. which would mean. as I listened to the Senator from Alabama earlier. perhaps moving in under the neutrality provision and taking over the locks. If that is going to be clarified in that way that would be a little different than doing it by language. It seems to me that would avoid the nroblem by simply adopting this rather harmless amendment. from the standpoint of damaging the treaty. and a significant amendment from the standpoint of strengthening the treaty. and I do not really believe that it would do all that much violence.

I believe this resolutionas refined by the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration under the very capable leadership of Senator CANNONis an extremely important step toward making the Senate more efficient and more responsive. As a member of the Joint Committee on the Reorganization of the Congress. which formulated the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act. I can attest to the difficulty of dealing wth committee Jurisdictions and consolidations. That joint committee. as some Senators will recall. labored mightily to bring about significant change in the committee structurethe need for such change was readily apparent even then. in the mid and late 1960sbut its accomplishments in this area were at best modest. Senators STEVENSON and former Senator Brock deserve the commendation of the entire Senate for taking on one of the Senates most thankless tasks. attempting to bring our committee jurisdictions up to date. They and their staff on the temporary select committee devoted hours and months of hard work to this effort. Their presentation before the Rules and Administration Committeein a long. complex mark upwas a remarkable performance. As a member of the temporary select committee. I believe Senate Resolution 4. as reported by the Rules and Administration Committee. will enhance the Senates ability to look at policy problems as a \"whole\" in a number of critically important areas. I am particularly pleased by the final recommendation for consolidation of energy policy in a new Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Moreover. in addition to jurisdictional consolidations. Senate Resolution 4 contains a number of long needed procedural changes that will improve the scheduling of committee meetings and reduce the number of conflicting wasteful demands on Senators. time. In short. Mr. President. the committee systems reorganization amendments are a carefully conceived series of proposals that will improve the Senates efficiency and responsiveness. These amendments should receive the support of all Senators who are concerned about the ability of the Senate to meet todays needs.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. future generations will remember the Senate of the 95th Congress for the action it is prepared to take todayreform of the Senate committee system. By adopting the select committees resolution the Senate will address the great need for reform it has not even considered in 30 years. In hearings over the last year great attention has focused on the need to change the operation of the Senate. limit its committees. create more logical jurisdictions within fewer committees and subcommittees and ultimately. provide the Senators who serve here a better opportunity to fulfill their duties. The exact way one accomplishes these improvements has been and remains to be a difficult question for us all. Reform of the institution in which many have become accustomed to working is no easy task. If one becomes knowledgeable in a certain subject area it is difficult to allow it to be moved elsewhere. Or. having attained positions on several committees it is disheartening to have them consolidated. But overall. we as Senators and the people whom we serve are better off. Let me outline the four goals which the resolution before us fulfills: First. A Senate committee system that is consistent with the Senates constitutional responsibilities but preserves those elements of its present committee structure that have served it well. Second. A significant reduction of wasteful demands on Members time resulting from the large numberof committee and subcommittee assignments now held by Senators. Third. A strengthened ability for the Senate to develop integrated legislation and perform comprehensive oversight by consolidating subject jurisdictions in fewer committees. Fourth. Better internal management of the Senates business through a systemized scheduling service. The 17 major provisions of the resolution attest well to these 4 goals. For instance. the reduction of committees from 31 to 21. and subcommittees from 174 to around 110 to 120. in conjunction with the creation of a computerized Senate scheduling service are good. firm responses to a system frought with too many fragmented assignments. Presently. the number of assignments per Senator averages 18 and runs over 30 in some cases. As we begin this historic debate today I hope that great consideration will be given to the Senate as an institution. Change in this timehonored body to which we are so closely tied in our duties representing both the Nation and our home States is obviously difficult. but exceedingly necessary.",

Because of the magnitude of the resource base that at least I believe and many of my geological colleagues believe exists. both oil and gas. the incentives. if they were there. would almost certainly start to produce an oversupply and the consumer price. as well as the price at the wellhead. would begin to decrease. at least for some period of time into the future if we made available a free market system for the production and sale of oil and gas. That is why deregulation. as the Senator has mentioned. is really a consumer policy. It is the only way. through increased supply. that we are going to drive the price down. Regulation. if we continue. is not going to drive the price down. I realize that this is not. maybe. the place to debate regulation and deregulation. nevertheless. it is important for everybody to realize that if we want a decrease in price. it is going to be through increase in supply. This particular measure that is before us is just a type of oil shale technology whose time has not yet come.",

Mr. President I urge the Senate to adopt \"The Federal Oil Shale Commercialization Test Act.\" We have been trying in Congress for almost 5 years to launch a synthetic fuels industry in this country. Time is running out. Enactment of the Presidents energy program will still leave us heavily and dangerously dependent on foreign oil. The consensus of experts is that imports will be in the range of 10 to 12 million barrels a day by the mid1980s. We have no assurance that oil imports on this scale will be available to us. We have no right to assume that we can continue to use the lions share of world oil. I submit. Mr. President. that we cannot continue to ignore the potential of a 2trillionbarrel oil shale resource. Senator HASKELLs and Senator BELLMONs bill would give us a chance to test that potential by the construction of three demonstration projects financed by the Federal Government. operated by private industry. The industry leaders I talk with believe the Federal Government must finance the first oil shale plants. In this connection. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the text of an interview with Eneas D. Kane. vice president for technology of Standard Oil of California. which appeared in Forbes Magazine last November. Mr. Kane described oil shale as the most promising of the nearterm alternatives to oil and gas. Although he recognized that the economics of shale do not justify private investment at this time. he contends that Government financing can be justified because of our dependence on importsand the vulnerability created by that dependence.",

A credit is equitable and easily administered. Unlike a GOCO. it would not require the Government to risk a penny. The credit would only be given for barrels of oil produced. rather than the unparalleled investment mandated by S. 419.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this legislation which I am introducing today has a very simple intent: It would permit American manufacturers of lottery tickets and related materials to export their products for use in lotteries conducted by foreign governments or within foreign countries. This bill is a companion to one introduced in the House by my Michigan colleague. Representative SAWYER. A provision similar to the one I am introducing is contained in the Criminal Code reform bill. S. 1437. in the version in which it passed the Senate. However. because of the uncertain State of that legislation at the present time. and the simple and. I hope. uncontroversial nature of this bill. I would hope that it could be considered more expeditiously on its own merits. Title 18 of the United States Code. prior to its revision in 1975. prohibited transportation of lottery equipment in interstate or foreign commerce. In 1975. the prohibition on interstate commerce was lifted. as lotteries began to proliferate and more States began to use them as part of their revenue raising activities. This bill would remove the final inequity in this portion of the law. namely. the prohibition on export of lottery materials. Lotteries are becoming more and more prevalent around the world. as well as in this country. yet American businesses which manufacture some of the most technologically sophisticated lottery equipment in the world. are prevented from selling it abroad. and hence from satisfying a potentially vast foreign market. I can see no logical reason to maintain this restriction on sales of lottery equipment. Moreover. in view of the current U.S. trade situation. it would seem to be incumbent upon the Congress to do everything possible to aid American businesses in developing or expanding their export activities. Current law leaves them with only one option. that of building manufacturing operations overseas. which creates no jobs for American workers and funnels little if any money into the domestic economy. I hope the Congress will act to remove this small inequity in our Nations criminal law. and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

However. the nature of the resource and the institutional arrangement controlling the harvesting of this resource made it difficult to attract capital. technology. and young fishermen. thereby relegating commercial fishing to marginal breakeven operations in yesteryear. The U.S. fleet has been characterized by old vessels which were expensive to maintain. relatively inefficient. and subject to high and rapidly increasing insurance rates. These vessels were not being replaced. The fishermen or crews on many of them received relatively low earnings for the long hours they worked. New fishermen were not being attracted to these fisheries and the average age of fishermen seemed to be rising steadily. Between the years of 1960 and 1976. the United States take of fish off its shores has remained relatively stable. even declining in certain locations. while the foreign take off the U.S. coasts increased monumentally. This situation has caused overfishing in at least 10 major commercial stocks and has caused correspondent adverse economic consequences to our fishermen. This was the picture we faced when the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 was enacted on April 13. 1976. just 15 months ago. It was my hope and the hope of my colleagues that this act would be a giant step forward in our efforts to revitalize the U.S. fishing industry. Very early reports indicate that this act may be meeting some of our expectations. I have asked the Department of Commerce to do a study on the economic benefits of the act so we can determine exactly how it is benefiting the fishing industry and what more needs to be done to assist this important industry to regain its proper place in the ranks of the worlds major fishing nations. Perhaps we have been effective! I wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues an article in the July 25. 1977.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in seeking ways to increase the ability of consumers to exercise their rights in the marketplace. this Congress is considering a number of proposals designed to give consumers a strong voice in the regulatory process and provide consumers the legal ability to fight against fraud and unfair practices. One such proposal is section 7 of H.R. 3816. the FTC Amendments Act of 1977. H.R. 3816 is scheduled to reach the House floor shortly. The bill. and especially section 7. has been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by some members of the business community. Since much of the opposition to section 7 comes from business groups who are also opposed to a bill which I have sponsored creating a Federal agency for consumer protection. and since many of the arguments made against the ACP and section 7 are similarly illogical and often inconsistent. I would like to bring those inconsistencies and contradictions to light and to urge those Members of Congress concerned with affording consumers adequate protection to support section 7 of H.R. 3816. Section 7 allows consumers who are injured by a violation of an FTC rule or order to sue individually or as a class for damages resulting from the violation. In short. this provision allows consumers to use the orders and rules of the FTC to obtain relief from fraud or unfair business practices by creating a private right of action. Contrary to the picture of massive and frivolous law suits which would result from this provision as painted by its opponents. the ability to use this section is narrowly prescribed. In order to bring a law suit under this provision. the FTC must have certified in the rule or order to be invoked that it is appropriate for use in private relief. In other words. the FTC must provide by the terms of the rules or order that it can serve as the basis for consumer suits. Section 7 spells out specifically the way in which notice shall be given to potential members of a class and the way in which damages shall be proved.",

Soviet forces marched into Czechoslovakia and overthrew the progressive regime of Alexander Dubcek. Many of us vividly remember reading about or watching films of gallant Czech youths hurling homemade Molotov cocktails at invading Soviet tanks. The reason for the Soviet invasion was brutally simple. The Dubcdk government dared to implement some liberal measures and sought to secure a semblance of civil liberties within a Soviet bloc country. Moscow was unable to tolerate any democratic reforms so close to its bordersit feared the spread of such a movement as a subverting threat to its own security system and even to its legitimacy as a government. The result was a Soviet military invasion and occupation of a defenseless nation striving to assert a modicum of national independence. The struggle for freedom of the Czechoslovakian people has been a long and hard one. In 1918. Czechoslovakia was declared an independent and sovereign country by the victorious nations at Versailles. The people enjoyed a period of political tranquillity under a parliamentary democracy until the spring of 1938. But 1938 was to bring the initial dismemberment of Czechoslovakia under Nazi pressure. It was a tragic fact that the Western democracies turned their backs on the regime of President Benes and thereby secured a new. ominous",

Bruce Llewellyn. president of Fedco Foods. one of the largest blackowned companies in America. and Mr. Adam Walinsky. a lawyer. Mr. Llewellyn writes as one whose concern for the people of New Yorks ghettos is shown by his personal commitment to the creation of a viable business employing thousands of minority citizens and providing important services for them in the hope of making a profit for his company. He is rightly critical of the way Government has responded to the needs of small businessmen like himself. Politicians pay lip service to private enterprise. but their actions belie their words. The \"employment\" programs erected by Government have only created jobs for bureaucrats and fostered a philosophy among the recipients that everyone is entitled to live well whether they work or not. and that private enterprise is a synonym for \"ripoff.\" Well. the \"ripoff\" is in the public sector programs. the high taxes to pay for them. and the attitude they foster among the people of \"something for nothing.\" Moreover. businessmen and property owners did not receive the police protection to which they had a right. Police made little effort to protect businesses from looting in order to avoid hurting any of the looters. But this is a double standard. because everyone knows that if the rioting had spread into white areas downtown. all possible force would have been used. As long as the violence was confined to small ghetto businesses. any-: thing was tolerated. I believe that this situation is deplorable.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. section 701 of H.R. 8444. the National Energy Act. was to authorize establishment of a voluntary and selfsustaining Federal van pooling program for employees of Federal agencies. In view of some inaccurate statements opposing section 701. let us clear the air with a few facts. Section 701 permits two types of programs. The first enables Federal agencies to work through the private sector. Agencies are given express authority to encourage and cooperate with su:h nonFederal sponsors. To facilitate this. the section lifts several legal and institutional barriers. The second type involves Federal purchasing or leasingrepeat leasing--of a limited number of vansup to 6.000. However. as the Government Operations Committee report declares. in general van pooling arrangements not involving Federal lease or purchase should be favored. With Federal leasing or purchasing of vans goes the requirement that virtually all expenses must be recovered through rider charges. Only an insignificant amount of administrative costs would not be returned. Section 701 and the Government Operations Committee report make this clear. Of course. special costs for a few vans to handle handicapped employees would be underwritten. GSA calculates the monthly charge for a Governmentpurchased van as $31.53 for a 50mile daily round tripa reasonable figure. Where the van is leased. the rider charge would be about $2 a month morestill reasonable. GSA estimates that each year the same number of private vans as federally leased or owned vans would enter the overall program. This program would start on a solid base of years of research and actual experience with ridesharing in the Department of Transportation. the Department of Energy. and GSA. GSA would start slow. with not more than 300 vans leased or purchased for the first year. This would require an appropriation of $3.345.000 for that year. all recoverable. Figures for subsequent years are shown in the GSA cost estimate below. Congressional budget and appropriation processes naturally would govern all funding. This is a modest program. and the General Accounting Office testified that its administrative burden need not be great. Section 701 would mean that Federal agencies could do what Congress for years has urged nonFederal employers and organizations to do: Use van pooling to save fuel. cut traffic. and reduce parking.",

But most important was the issue which caused the voters to unseat their school board. The issue was permissiveness. The school board had fired a principal who had had the audacity to enforce discipline in a school plagued by drugs and violence. He searched the students for drugs and confiscated them. When a student got out of line. he put him back into line. by force if necessary. With a comment that these methods were \"30 years behind the times.\" the board removed this hardliner. They would apparently rather have drugs and violence in their schools than defy fashionable social theories. As so often happens today. it was the public officials who were looking to the past. while voters had their eye on the future. Liberal education policy is as out of date as beatniks and pegged pants. The school board claimed tha. the principal was 30 years behind the times. He claimed he was 30 years ahead. They were both right. The social experiment of permissiveness which ruled education over the past two decades has failed. We have to return in the future to the solid values of the past. Thirty years ago there were things Americans simply would not stand for. Drugs in school was one of those things. Rowdiness in school was another. LaCrosse has shown us once again that the voters are often far wiser than their officials. If firm discipline and concern for our young people is behind the times. elected representatives had better start getting oldfashioned fast. or they will follow the LaCrosse school board in an abrupt return to private life. Voters are demanding basic education combined with oldfashioned. firm discipline. and I. for one. could not be more delighted.",

An important part of this bill provides for continued and increased participation of Native Hawaiians in CETA. I think it of significant importance for Members of the Senate and others to be aware of the progress made by Native Hawaiians under the CETA program. The current fiscal year funding provides $2.5 million for the training and employment of Native Hawaiians. The funds are provided through a nonprofit corporation named Alu Like. which literally means \"working together\" in the Hawaiian language. A recent news article in the Honolulu Advertiser describes Alu Like and a particular project it funds. Camp Kaala. in which the youth of the Waianae Coast on Oahu are cultivating nearly 100 different varieties of the taro plant. once the staple crop of Hawaiians. and also maintaining a honey bee farm. This project. while providing worthwhile employment and training for Native Hawaii youthwho suffer from the highest unemployment rate of any ethnic group in the Islands- -is also turning this remote and unused valley into valuable. productive. and beautiful acreage.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I agree with the statement just made by the gentleman from Missouri. I would like to point out that this bill appropriates a total of $7.046.454.000. which is an increase of $1.449.957.000 over the amount appropriated last year. To put this amount in perspective. Mr. Speaker. this Is the largest foreign aid bill since 1952. when post war reconstruction was under way following World War II. Not only is this the largest bill in over 25 years. Mr. Speaker. but the largest part of the increase over 1977 is for international financial institutions. This bill appropriates $2.123.000.000 for these international financial institutions. I hasten to point out when Congress makes these contributions to such institutions. we practically lose control of how the money is spent. For example. one of these lending institutions. IDA. has in the past committed 40 percent of its loans to India. This money has been used for domestic programs. while they have been using their own money to buy weapons from the Soviet Union and to develop a nuclear capability. Many of the countries we provide bilateral aid to will receive tremendous increases. For example.. the Dominican Republic will get 16 times the fiscal year 1977 level. How will they be able to administer such an increase in these countries? While our bilateral program--over which we exercise some controlis being increased by onefifth over fiscal year 1975. our contributions to the multilateral banks--over which we have no controlwill have doubled during the same period of time. This years budget request of $7.6 billion is the first step in plans to double our foreign aid program over the next 5 years. In the meantime. we are supposed to balance the budget. Mr. Speaker. As a member of the Budget Committee. I ask how we are going to balance the budget. if we are going to increase our \"giveaway\" bill alone by $1.5 billion in one single year. As I indicated the other day. that promise by the President to balance the budget by fiscal year 1981 is one promise I hope to help him keep. and certainly today I am going to be voting against this legislation on final passage as a move in that direction.",

I just say to the gentleman that I think It is a confession of the bankruptcy of the budget system when the gentleman from Alissouri was able to stand here a moment ago and say that this is a routine rule. The fact of the matter is that all year long we have been passing rules that waive the rule against having appropriations without authorization bills. We have before us a piece of legislation that should require prior legislative action on fundamental foreign policy questions before we address the dollar amounts. This is such a bill. I just point to one example. The bill restores a number of programs and a great deal of money for international organizations that the House cut out a few weeks ago in the Lott amendment. I must confess. reading as I have every page of the report. that there is little justification for a number of programs that are unauthorized in law. In fact. one is the $100 million for the Southern Africa Fund. Procedurally I believe we certainly have a right to expect the authorizing committees in both Houses to act before we address a multibillion dollar bill such as this. While the gentleman from Missouri is correct. it has now become routine. that does not make it right. and I would suspect that we ought to probably put this bill off until such time as we have acted finally on the authorizing legislation.",

Mr. Chairman. let me point out that one of the major concerns was not shipping too much nuclear technology to various underdeveloped countries throughout the world. but it is the fear of a nuclear arms race. Because once they have nuclear technology for energy. they are most of the way. maybe 90 percent of the way. toward developing a nuclear explosive. It has been pointed out by experts that once you have a little equipment for nuclear power. it is not too hard to develop a nuclear explosive. And once one country gets a nuclear capacity. the country next door is forced to develop the same capacity for aggressive actions. Of course. that is a great fear we have. and one of the reasons we are trying to control the spread of nuclear technology around the world. Let me point outand I think this is where the gentlemans remarks come inthat nuclear proliferation around the world would be wrong even if weapons were not involved. even if there were no hope of proper weaponry. because this is fantastically expensive from the standpoint of capital requirements. It is really too expensive in the United States. because we see one company after another withdrawing from the nuclear power business because they found it too expensive. even with heavy Government subsidies. U.S. companies are losing money right and left on it. Imagine putting nuclear power in poor countries around the world. There is only so much foreign aid to go around. If we do it. it is going to be done at the expense of education. roads. and health. development in these countries. So they pay a very heavy price for this nuclear technology. This is the opposite pole from the light capital technology which we are trying to promote. which consists really of trying to get little farmers on little plots of land a $70 or a $90 spreader or plow. or something like that. with which he can work his own piece of land and is not thrown off into the big cities.",

This country is putting billions of dollars into ERDA for nuclear research. and comparatively speaking. it is putting pennies into solar energy development and other alternative energy development projects. such as coal and getting more oil out of oil wells. Because twothirds of all the oil that was ever in Texas is still there. but it is just too hard and too expensive to get it out. These are areas where we should be conducting our research. but instead we are doing more in the nuclear area. I want to point out also that this starves the other areas of research. because when we pay our smart people and universities around the country $350 or $500 a day for their expertise and their contributions in the nuclear area. we are taking the best brains in the country away from alternative energy sources. So the consequence is that the stress in the nuclear area has starved our efforts to search for other types of energy sources. not only in this country but abroad. I think we should begin moving toward light capital technology so we can use more of the funds to finance development projects for the poor. The real hope of development is in light capital. and I would hope that we do not put too much money in these areas because I think foreign aid money corrupts. As soon as we put large sums of money in foreign aid. we attract large groups of people who are in there trying to get the money. and this distorts the whole development program.

As we discovered during subcommittee hearings. the Comptroller General is the only official of GAO who does not have a costofliving adjustment in the retirement annuity. This bill remedies that shortcoming. It also brings the Comptroller Generals retirement annuity in line with the retirement and survivorship benefits of Federal judges.

Federal judges. however. receive the benefit of subsequent increases in the salary of the office after they retire. The Comptroller General does not.

The result was that there was a sudden rush for this 75 percent money. and it became necessary for the Congress to put a ceiling on the amount of Federal money which could be expanded for social services. This was done in 1972. The ceiling was placed at $21/2 billion. substantially below the requests for that particular year. There has been some stabilizing in social services since that time. but in October 1976 we started giving an additional $200 million for day care as a social service that we felt at that time and in that environment required some special available funds. The result of all this. Mr. Speaker. is that we have had a very restricting limit on the amount of money available for social services for some time. and this bill represents a modest beginning of. in effect. costofliving increases on the very expensive part of the States budgets. I think it is a reasonable adjustment. I think it is due at this time since we have had a very rigid lid on social services for some time. I urge the enactment of the measure. I would like now to yield to my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from Ohio . who is a member of the subcommittee.",

I. however. do wish to take some issue with the figures the gentleman mentioned about the magnitude of the increase that is involved. and I am not familiar with the comments of the Republican conference report on it. The entitlement increase. actually the net cost of which would be somewhat less than the ceiling figure. is $200 million for 1979. $650 million for 1980. $950 million for 1981. $950 million for 1982. and $950 million for 1983. In other words. I suspect what the gentleman is talking about when he is talking about a $10 billion additional cost is he is adding the total entitlements for the next 3 years. which. however. in the past have been $2.500.000.000 and. therefore. would be in any event $7.5 billion for those 3 years.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 12973. a measure which will provide a 3year increase in the ceiling of title XX of the Social Security Act and provide funding for social services at the State and local levels. The present title XX ceiling was established in 1972 and has not been increased. except for $200 million earmarked for day care in 1976. Because of continuing inflation. the $2.5 billion provided in 1972 is now worth $1.7 billion in 1978 dollars. In the State of New York. the ceiling has been exceeded every year since 1973. These excess expenditures were made out of State and county funds so that the erosion caused by inflation would not cut to the bone the vital programs serving the poor. the elderly. the mentally retarded. the abused and neglected children. However. despite these expenditures of strictly State and local funds. it has been necessary for New York to reduce all essential social services to some extent. For example: Day care was virtually eliminated fcr persons enrolled in nonWIN training programs throughout much of the State. Homemaker/housekeeper services have been curtailed. Preventive services. too. were curtailed. In New York. the ceiling on title XX. coupled with the State and local fiscal crisis. has resulted in social services planning focused too much on costcontainment and reduction of services. instead of realistic planning for the provision of innovation and essential services. For my State. the increase in the title XX ceiling we are considering today will mean an additional $63.75 million dollars over the 3year period of the bill: $17 million in fiscal year 1979. $21.25 million in fiscal year 1980. and $25.5 million in fiscal year 1981. This bill provides significant increases for all other States and territories for critically important social services programs such as: child care. health services for alcoholics and drug addicts. emergency shelter for adults. homemaker chore services. and transportation and training for the handicapped. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and vote overwhelmingly for its passage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to express my strong support for the bill H.R. 12973. the Social Services Amendments of 1978. Some States. including the State of Michigan. have reached their Federal spending ceiling for title XX. It is imperative that the ceiling be raised so that services to those with a greater need are not reduced. The increases provided by this bill are essential for the States if they are to maintain an effective program of services under their title XX program for lowincome people. The ceiling on title XX funds was increased temporarily from its $2.5 billion level to $2.7 billion. but the effects of inflation have meant that even at the temporary $2.7 billion level. States can only purchase threefourths of what they could purchase in 1972 when the program was implemented. Several States have been required to cut back their services or reduce their eligible population because of insufficient funds. It is intended that the increases provided by this legislation will go toward the expansion of services or offsetting cost increases resulting from inflation. Some of the services offered under title XX include: First. Day care for children: This program would receive $200 million in Federal funds to encourage continued expansion of day care services in the States. Second. Emergency shelter: This program is to aid persons who have been physically or mentally abused. It also would assist in reuniting broken families. Third. Services for the elderly: Many services are offered to the elderly including hot meals. counseling. senior citizen centers and many others. Without these services. many senior citizens may find it very difficult to live independently which may result in their being admitted to institutions which would be very costly to their families or to the Government. This bill would also provide the States with the option of establishing a 2year title XX program period rather than just 1 year. This would enable States to plan longerterm social service programs. I would like to congratulate my colleagues Mr. FRASER and Ms. KEYS for introducing this bill. It is my hope that the House of Representatives will pass this muchneeded bill by a large vote.",

I specifically want to call attention to one aspect of the bill that I think is a very important step in terms of our Governments efforts to stem the tide against child abuse and spouse abuse in this country. and that is in connection with section 6. which would allow the title XX funds to be used to provide emergency shelter for adults. I think it is important to remember that what has happened in the past is that when trauma and crisis has struck a family in terms of child abuse or in those cases where the abuse has been rained both upon the child and upon the spouse. because of the existing law. we took the child to one shelter and we forced the adult to either stay home or to be with friends because title XX would not allow shelter in that situation to be funded. Under the provision of this law. if it is adopted. we can be sure that the mother and child or the father and child will stay together. and for the first time we can use the Federal Government to reduce the trauma surrounding the crisis in a family that comes about as a result of abuse rather than to increase the trauma suffered by the child or by the family. The many thousands of women who are victimized every year by their spouses will for the first time have the ability to know that they can seek shelter. they can bring their children with them. and they can hold on to what little is left of the integrated family. I think this is an important step forward. and I certainly want to commend the gentlewoman from Kansas for the leadership she has shown. as well as the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California in this effort. This has been a discriminatory policy that has existed far too long in the law. and hopefully it will be rectified with the passage of this legislation.

Puerto Ricos participation in this program is limited to making use of those funds which are not used by the rest of the States.

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. the oldest and largest civil rights organization in America. made a brilliant speech to the Edison Electric Institute on the relationship between economic growth and jobs. particularly in the area of energy. The point of Mrs. Wilsons address was that black Americans have begun to realize that their greatest hope for full equality is to have a vigorously growing economy. She notes that despite all the Government programs for the poor and for minorities. blacks are no better off than they were 10 years ago. The reason is that these same Government policies have led to a slowdown in the economy which has undone minority gainsfor the fact remains that blacks are the last hired and first fired. Thus Mrs. Wilson argues that what black Americans need most is jobs. jobs. and more jobs. and not Government makework jobs. but productive. meaningful jobs in private industry. The Carter administrations policies. rather than fostering this goal. is inimical to it. The energy program. she says. is the worst example of this. by emphasizing conservation instead of new supplies. Since economic growth is associated with high energy consumption. she continues. a policy designed to reduce energy use must reduce economic growth. jobs. and hurt blacks most of all. I could not possibly agree with Mrs. Wilson more and congratulate her for making such an important and courageous statement. She has certainly helped to open my eyes to another dimension of this whole issue of economic growth.

The concept of using general revenues in the financing of social security is an idea whose time has come. Indeed. the substantial April 6 vote of the Democratic Caucus of 150 to 57. instructing the Ways and Means Committee to explore alternatives to the Presidents tax package through a rollback in the social security taxes. is further evidence of the support this year for a meaningful tax reform package. The Joint Economic Committee has made the dire prediction that the logical results of raising social security taxes will be slower economic growth. higher unemployment and a faster inflationary spiral. The committees analysis ties the social security tax hike to the loss of 1.300.000 jobs for American workers. I hasten to remind my colleagues that 1.3 million jobs averages out to approximately 3.000 jobs per district.

Today marks another step forwardaerosols emitting halocarbons will no longer be sold or used in Oregon. Most of us in Congress are well aware of the dangers posed by ozone depletion. Numerous Federal reports. scientific studies. and actual measurements have shown with reasonable certainty that the ozone layer is being depleted by halocarbons. Oregon recognized this over 2 years ago when it proposed a ban on aerosols. The general feeling of Oregonians was that the risk or potential danger of ozone depletion was not worth the time scientists would spend absolutely corroborating the ozone depletion theory. Since the evidence has grown. a judgment tempered -with caution has become one of the hallmarks of public policy for the environment and human health and welfare. The Federal Government Is moving to phase out the nonessential aerosols which emit halocarbons within 1 to 2 years. That is obviously a sufficient time to cease the manufacture of these projects. There are currently available substitutes. The aerosol manufacturers are producing them in an increasing degree recognizing that America is concerned about the ozone layer. I only hope that there will be no opposition to the gears that have now been set in motion to control the emission of these chemicals. The National Academy of Sciences. the National Aeronautic and Space Administration. the Environmental Protection Agency. the Consumer Product Safety Commission. and the Federal Food and Drug Administration have added to the growing evidence of ozone depletion.

From now on. the Nation can rest assured that first. its fishermen will have the first opportunity to bring in the catches of our commercial fisheries. and second. that our marine fishery resources will not become depleted in the coming years due to overfishing by foreign nations. During my 8 years in the Senate I have worked hard with my colleagues for the protection of our fisheries and the priority for Americas fishermen that begins today. No one who is familiar with the fishing industry will say this solves our problems. Admittedly there are other issues to be addressed. other legislative refinements and facts that should be considered. but today marks the greatest stride we have made for Americas fishermen in a long time. The thanks for enactment of the Nations 200mile fishing zone rests with many individuals. The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Senator MAGNUSON. began the fight for a 200mile fishing bill many years ago. Through his leadership and that of the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee. Mr. PEARSON. there has been a continual effort to set a firm date at which the 200mile zone would be an effective priority area for U.S. fishermen. Thanks should also be given to many of my colleagues in both the Senate and House who worked on this legislation over the past few years. Senator STEVENS of Alaska. Senator HOLLINGS of South Carolina. Senator WEICKER of Connecticut. and Senator MUSIIE of Maine. are but a few of my colleagues who have worked on this issue through the Senate Commerce Committee. As a new member of the Senate Commerce Committee. I am eager to fulfill the necessary oversight of the 200mile fishing bill and dig into the litany of remaining projects which are of concern to the U.S. fishermen. Certainly the leadership shown in passing a 200mile fishing bill is a shining light for the attention that will be focused on the other work Congress must do to create a secure and wellestablished fishing industry in this country.",

The first of these bills would increase the limits on the amount of flood insurance which families and businesses are allowed to purchase. The residential limits would be increased from $35.000 to $100.000 and the coverage ceiling for small businesses would be rai3ed from $100.000 to $500.000. In many communities whose :en~ral business district may be subject to flooding. such as Frederick. Md.. in my district. the restrictions on the amount of flood insurance protection a business is allowed to purchase may discourage businesses from locating. expanding. or remaining in these areas. My bill would alleviate that problem by raising the limits sufficiently to enable businesses to protect themselves adequately. The second bill I am introducing would amend the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 to make the terms of disaster relief loans more favorable to the victims .of the disasters. Prior to 1974. SBA disaster loans were extended at a 1percent interest rate and a $5.000 forgiveness on the loan. The 1974 law eliminated the forgiveness provisions and raised the interest rate to what it is today6% percent. The bill I am introducing today would provide two options. either a 3percent interest rate on the loan with a $2.500 forgiveness or a 1percent interest rate with no forgiveness. This bill is identical to S. 570. which was introduced by Senators MATHIAS and SARBANES. Since the changes in the disaster relief program in 1974. each of the 50 States has suffered at least one natural disaster. The 1974 changes have reduced the benefits of SBA disaster loans greatly. since the interest rate is now so high. and participation in the program by those who are eligible has been reduced. Mr. Speaker. the victims of disasters suffer in many ways and I hope that Congress will act favorably on this legislation in order to extend Federal assistance to them in a much more helpful way. I am also hopeful of positive action on the bill to increase flood insurance limits in order to enable families and businesses to adequately prepare themselves for floods by purchasing sufficient amounts of flood insurance.

The regular program takes 2 years for a casebycase review. We are suggesting that those who fit within the six criteria will be automatically upgraded and that the others. who do not fall within that regular criteria. are looked at on a casebycase review.

He leaves a record that will be difficult to equal and which will remain in the memory of those he served for many. many years. The Dayton newspapers published comprehensive accounts of Benos career.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. while the House votes daily on major issues which directly impact our economy. I am not sure that we are always cognizant of the indirect effects of our actions. An example of this is the impact which the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. soon to be voted upon by the House. will have upon various segments of the transportation industry. I was recently contacted by representatives of one segment of the transportation industry. the Truck Renting and Leasing Association (TRALA). TRALA is the national trade association comprised of businesses engaged in the renting and leasing of trucks throughout the United States. Their membership ranges in size from small companies with fewer than 10 vehicles to the large. nationally known firms. It is clear that an industry such as this depends upon a firm national commitment to preservation of the integrity of our roads and highways. The highway trust fund. one portion of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. was intended to provide such a commitment. Now that much of the Interstate Highway System has been completed. there are some Members of Congress who would abandon the trust fund concept. This would have the effect of endangering completion of our Interstate Highway System and threatening funding for highway maintenance and system expansion. Diluting the trust fund would be detrimental not only to the truck renting and leasing industry and to commerce in general. but also to the millions of American motorists who depend on the use of our Nations highways. The Truck Renting and Leasing Association suports passage of H.R. 11733 for two reasons: To allow the Federal Government to complete the Interstate Highway System as planned and to insure a source of funds for the maintenance and improvement of our national highway system. TRALAs members do not believe that the initial intent of establishing the highway trust fund should be abandoned. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 represents the type of commitment to our Nations transportation system which related businesses need. The truck renting and leasing industry may be but one segment of those depending on a viable highway system. but. while considering the merits of the Surface Transportation Act. I urge Members to consider the extent to which our national economy depends on a viable interstate transportation network.O",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a situation recently has been brought to my attention which is of considerable concern to the commercial fishermen in the central coast region of California. Because of a provision in the 1976 Tax Reform Act. fishermen working on a boat with fewer than 10 members in the crew are considered to be selfemployed for Federal tax purposes. if they are paid by receiving a share of the boats catch of fish or other forms of aquatic animal life. I have been informed that this provision was originally designed for the benefit of a small number of shrimp fishermen located in the Gulf of Mexico. who apparently favored such a revision of the previous law. However. this provision has proven to be very unfavorable to the commercial fishermen in my area and throughout the State of California for several reasons. Under the 1976 act. only those fishermen who work on boats with crews of 10 or fewer men must pay selfemployment taxes on a quarterly basis and large income taxes at the end of the year. since no taxes are withheld from their checks. This arrangement is not only unfair to this small group of fishermen. but it actually works as an incentive for a boatowner to lower the number of crew members he employs in order to avoid contributing to social security and processing withholding taxes. In addition. this situation often results in treating the same fishermen in two different ways. depending on whether he works on a boat with fewer or more than 10 members. It appears obvious to me that the withholding provision in the 1976 Tax Reform Act has led to increased confusion and inconsistency in the tax treatment of fishermen. It is for this reason that I am introducing a bill which will strike this language from the statutes and restore the more equitable policy of treating all fishermen as employees. Mr. Speaker. I wish to include the text of my bill at this point in the RECORD: H.R. 14071 A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to treat certain fishermen as employees for purooses of the income tax and social security taxes Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.",

Repayment will be made in two schedules of 20 semiannual installments each. beginning October 5. 1980. and April 5. 1981.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on August 14 a significant event occurred which could have great bearing on the future of the Irish question. On that date. the second largest daily newspaper in Great Britain. the Daily Mirror called for complete British withdrawal from Ireland in 5 years. This newspaper which has over 4 million readers based its position on its fear that democracy has stopped in Northern Ireland under the direct rule of Great Britain. As the editorial states \"It is not only people who are dying in Northern Ireland. Democracy is nearly dead too.\" As chairman of the 114 Member Ad Hoc Congressional Committee for Irish Affairs. I firmly endorse this position. The fact is I have sponsored legislation in this and previous Congresses advocating a British withdrawal from Ireland without specifying a time period. I consider this to be a basic prerequisite to any meaningful progress toward peace. At the same time that this dramatic position was being taken by the Daily Mirror. Great Britain announced that it was increasing its troop strength in the North to 1.400. This contradicts not only the sentiments of the Daily Mirror but also of a rapidly growing segment of the British population which want Britain to remove itself from Northern Ireland. I hope the position taken by the Daily Mirror will serve as a catalyst for positive actions by Great Britain to withdraw from the North. Obviously an immediate pull out of troops would present more hazards than benefits but a declaration of intent to withdraw should be taken as soon as possible. It will be viewed as a positive development and will greatly improve the climate for peace. For the benefit of my colleagues I insert a number of press clips related to the Daily Mirror editorial: [From the Christian Science Monitor. Aug. 17. 1978]",

I do so mindful that both the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Massachusetts are esteemed members of my Subcommittee on Courts. Civil Liberties. and the Administration of Justice. I believe that the Select Committee on Intelligence has worked out a necessary formula for the court structure to handle these applications. and I am aware of the fact that they have come to learn that one of their witnesses. Carl Imlay. General Counsel of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. stated that constitutional problems existed with respect togranting nationwide jurisdiction to individual judges. Drawing on the example of the temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. it is suggested that a special court be created and vested with the jurisdiction in Federal judges assigned to it. and that is what they have done. It also should be pointed out that in the Keith case it is not just contemplated by the committee itself. The Supreme Court said that a warrant in intelligence cases need not be based on the same type of standards and procedures required for law enforcement. In doing so the Court stated the request for prior court authorization could in sensitive cases be made to any member of a specially designated court. That is what has been provided here. But the question of forum shopping. finding a secure U.S. District court judge throughout the United States of 4 or 500and after the judgeship bill there will be far more than 500 of themmay be possible. but if we are concerned about the people affected by this. such forum shopping would be the last thing on the Earth that we would want done in terms of the Government. On the other hand. the Government has an interest in a secure court. This court can be provided in the District of Columbia. Just as the White House itself and the CIA are secure presumably. so this court will be made secure. I think the formula provided by the bill is a reasonable one and should be supported.

I see no reason why the Government could not find at least one secure and dependable judge within a district of the United States.

The Chief Justice of the United States shall publicly designate at least one judge from each of the judicial circuits. nominated by the chief judges of the respective circuits. who shall be members of the Special Court and one of whom the Chief Justice shall publicly designate as the chief judge. The Special Court shall sit continuously in the District of Columbia. Now. there is nothing in that language that says that these judges will continue with their duties elsewhere.

This important amendment which I am sponsoring would put constitutional safeguards on the use of executive agreements in conducting foreign policy. As you may have read. the Carter administration is considering the possibility of submitting the SALT accord as an executive agreement requiring only a simple majority vote in Congress. This would get around the twothirds vote needed for passage of a treaty. The goal. of course. would be to avoid a difficult battle for ratification such as occurred during the recent Panama Canal debate. That the Carter administration would even consider this tactic is incredible. It is a thinly disguised attempt to evade the normal treatymaking process. Call it what you will. the SALT agreement should require a twothirds vote for ratification. It is too important an issue to be handled in a cavalier manner by President Carter. We should call a halt to this game of words. Congress must not abdicate its responsibility on a matter as crucial as the security of our Nation. The Bricker amendment which I have introduced for the past several Congresses would erect a safeguard for this type of problem. An executive agreement would be handled like a treaty. The name. whether the President calls it a treaty or an executive agreement. would not change the necessity of receiving a twothirds vote. The Bricker amendment would prevent unnecessary delegation of power by Congress to the President. It would help restore a proper congressional role in foreign affairs.

To date. the Federal Reserve has utterly failed to demonstrate the need for any authority beyond that which is provided by the committee amendment. The committee amendment would give the Federal Reserve 2 years to make its case for an additional grant of authority. and this is more than fair in view of the failure of the Fed to prove its point CXXIV---573Part 7 over the years during which it has sought full regulatory authority over domestic banks as well before it lowered its sights to obtaining authority over Statechartered foreign banks.

Although I support the rule presently before us. I can do so only with grave reservations. Specifically. this rule provides no opportunity for the House to express its will on section 2071 of H.R. 8444. This section provides a permanent exemption from the minimum tax for a small group of privileged taxpayers. Under present law. independent producers of oil and natural gas are exempt from the minimum tax for 1977. This provision was adopted in the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977 to provide the industry and the taxwriting committees of the Congress with an opportunity to review the impact of the minimum tax on oil drilling activity. The present energy bill. H.R. 8444. removes the special 1 year limitation and provides a permanent exemption of intangible drilling costs from the minimum tax. This provision represents a shocking attack on the tax code by a select group of individuals. 5.000 in number. For 1977. this special exemption for drillers will cost the Treasury $19 million. but this revenue loss will grow to $74 million in 1985. Between now and 1985. the revenue loss from this provision is estimated at $373 million. but I believe it will be closer to half a billion dollars. There is no justification for making this exemption a permanent figure in the Tax Code. The arguments that this tax provision is needed to stimulate domestic oil production are simply misguided. The tax reform legislation currently being prepared by the Carter administration can have no pretense of reform if this special faVoritism is not removed from the Tax Code.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as has been pointed out by the very able gentleman from Florida. this rule provides for 1 hour of general debate for consideration of H.R. 3744. the fair labor standards amendments. more commonly known as the minimum wage bill. As has been noted. the rule makes the committee substitute in order as an original bill for the purpose of amendment. The rule also waives points of order against the committee substitute for failure to comply with the germaneness rule. This waiver is necessary because the committee substitute amends several sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. which were not amended by the introduced version of the bill. H.R. 3744 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage from the current $2.30 to $2.65 in 1978 and provides for automatic annual adjustments by \"indexing\" to $2.89 in 1979 and $3.15 in 1980. The bill also reduces the allowable \"tip credit\" against the minimum wage from 50 percent of the minimum wage to a $1 constant in 1981 and falls to address the youth unemployment situation. Mr. Speaker. in listening to the presentation of this bill before the Committee on Rules. I began to wonder who is really going to benefit and who is going to suffer. I feel the lowincome people this is designed to benefit will suffer increased unemployment. Perhaps big labor will benefit. Every time we pass this kind of bill. big labor comes along and gets higher wages and benefits. so I can see the reason why big labor is always for these minimum wage bills. In the last several days the newspaper stated that the Secretary of Labor opposed the change in the tip credit. which is different from the earlier position of the administration. Apparently. they are still making up their minds downtown what they are for and what they are against in this bill. Hopefully. during the recess the people back home. especially in small business. who will be adversely affected by the change in the tip credit. will speak out and let Members of Congress know where they stand on this bill. Mr. Speaker. with that. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois .",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. twice in the past 2 years. the U.S. International Trade Commission has found that the domestic mushroom industry is being injured by imports of mushrooms. primarily from Taiwan and South Korea. The administration has attempted to deal with the problem by obtaining Pledges from those two countries to restrain the shipments of mushrooms to the United States. Recently. at the request of Representatives RAYMOND F. LEDERER and RICHARD T. SCHULZE. Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee members met with representatives of the domestic mushroom industry which is largely composed of small farmers and businessmen from eastern Pennsylvania. The domestic producers and canners explained that the relief provided by the administration was not proving effective. Therefore. on May 31. 1977. the subcommittees ranking minority member. Representative WILLIAM STEIGER and I wrote to Ambassador Robert Strauss. the Special Trade Representative. asking what the administration was doing to insure that the relief proposed for the domestic industry was indeed being implemented. We have just received a letter from the Ambassador detailing the present situation and explaining what is being done to assist the domestic industry. In reviewing Ambassador Strauss letter. I am concerned about the relative failure during the past year on the part of the Republic of Korea to abide by its assurances to our Government. Specifically. in September 1976. the Deputy Special Trade Representative received oral assurances from Korea that its exports of mushrooms to the United States would not exceed 18.5 million poundsdrained weightduring the 197677 marketing year. In fact. during that period of July 1. 1976. to June 30. 1977. Korea exported some 21.3 million pounds of mushrooms to the United States. It seems to me that it would be hard to lose track of 2.8 million pounds of mushrooms. and I cannot help but feel that the Korean Government failed to implement effectively its word with. the United States. Ambassador Strauss letter explains what steps are being taken during the new marketing year of 197778 and I hope that the Korean Government will indeed help insure that there are no further disruptive increases in the volume of exports to the United States. The Trade Subcommittee intends to monitor this situation very closely. Following is Ambassador Strauss letter:",

Faced with the challenge of a period of retrenchment in todays growth of our educational system. it seems that President Sliger is entering his new office with a very innovative. highly constructive outlook which seeks to combine the two aims of academe: reflection and practical fitness. Of special importance in the modem age. of course. will be the ability of a university to reach those who can already look back upon a substantial career. but who see a need to do something more. and who wish to be retrained. as well as those who have already worked in a fast developing field. and who wish to step back and satisfy their curiosity about recent work in that field in the hypothetical. ordered context of a college class or laboratory.

I will join Senator BAKER in offering an amendment to the DOE authorization bill and will work as a member of the Appropriations Conmittee to insure that these funds are provided once they are authorized. Oak Ridge and her sister cities in New Mexico and Washington occupy unique positions in our countrys history. They were vital to the Nation during the war effort. and they continue to direct a tremendous resource. our national laboratories. toward one of todays most pressing issuesthe solution of the energy shortage. Oak Ridge has relied on these funds over the years to supplement what might otherwise have come to them in industrial taxes. were it not for the fact that the city is so heavily dominated by the DOE facilities. The residents of Oak Ridge already pay one of the highest tax rates in the State. and it would be harmful to the future health of the community if an increase were required to accommodate declining Federal support. The city of Oak Ridge has made a genuine effort in recent years to expand its tax base. The most recent blow to these efforts was the decision of Exxon to back off from the reprocessing plant which was planned for Oak Ridge. This illusrates a continuing problem for the citythe policies of the Federal Government conflict with the communitys ability to grow and expand its tax base as other towns of its size do. Again. I second Senator BAKER in my willingness to discuss this matter with any of my colleagues and in emphasizing the need for permanent legislation detailing the Federal Governments responsibility to these communities.",

They were informed this past fall through the Department of Commerce they would be recipients of this award. The Specialty Paperboard Division has demonstrated their worthiness in receiving such an award. In 1973. their exports were 9.4 percent of their total sales. This increased to 24.1 percent in 1976. This is certainly a noteworthy contribution and a positive step in aiding our economy during this time of a declining balance of trade. In order to receive this award. it is necessary for a company to demonstrate an outstanding and creative ability in developing export markets. The Specialty Paperboard Division worked closely with the Department of Commerces export promotion plan. They have sales organizations in three countries. They have sales representatives who are fluent in various languages enabling them to adequately promote their exports in several areas around the world. To expedite their product delivery. the Specialty Paperboard Division have plans for establishing a warehousing facility in Western Europe. During the award ceremony. the employees were continuously congratulated for their hard work which led toward such recognition. They were quite enthusiastic knowing this award was received in large part because of their contributions. I have known John Wasserlein. the general manager of this division. for a number of years.

In spite of much debate. much rhetoric. and some useful legislation. such as the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. and the Public Works Employment Act. we have still not come to grips with the heart of the problem. the fact that the supply of jobs in the private sector of the economy has simply not grown as fast as the number of individuals seeking jobs. A great deal of time and attention in the 94th Congress was devoted to proposed solutions which did not really address this root problem. but would have masked it with the creation of massive numbers of public sector jobs at tremendous cost to the taxpayers and longterm danger to the entire economy. In recent weeks there has been a significant change in the approach being suggested by spokesmen identified with the incoming administration of President Carter and even by some key members of the majority in this Chamber. While these economic themes have been general in nature and have shown considerable variation.

For we all know that true national security is not limited to diplomatic activities or possible military threats. that such security also includes domestic wellbeing. Surely economic problems incident to this aspect of national security deserve the attention of members of the National Security Council. In fact. the 1947 statute calls for consideration of domestic problems along with those having to do with diplomacy and the military. We all know how intimately our domestic economy is related to foreign developmentsthe Mideast oil boycott and the sales of agricultural products to foreign countries are but two examples. Indeed it would appear that economic issues will loom ever larger as a factor which affects our security. These issues will increasingly determine not only our domestic policy but also our relationships to the rest of the world. The presence of the Secretary of the Treasury on this Council is predicated upon the need for our vital economic interests to be represented in the formulation of national security.

Legislation similar to this measure was the subject of hearings by committees in both Houses of Congress last year and had reached the floor of the Senate prior to adjournment. I am hopeful. therefore. of early action in the new Congress. The bill provides for a mandatory congressional review of each Federal agency at least once every 10 years. Unless an agency. after review. is explicitly approved and extended by law. it would be abolished. In my view. this statute is necessary to provide an effective check on the uncontrolled expansion of the size and the power of the Federal bureaucracy. In the past 15 years. approximately 250 new Federal agencies. bureaus. departments. and commissions have been created. while only 21 such entities have been terminated. A recent Brookings Institution study found that of 175 governmental organizations existing in 1923. 85 percent were still around in 1974. and 62 percent still existed in virtually the same form.

First introduced by retired Representative Alphonzo Bell this bill affects 18 miles of beach. and 125.000 acres of oak tree lined canyons. three mountain chains and several lakes and streams. Mr. Speaker. I want to emphasize that this legislation is not a \"witch hunt\" aimed at the Marines. I believe Camp Pendleton has been and must continue to be a vital training base for our Marine forces. Beach and inland areas must be kept intact for their purposes. However. close to Pendleton is Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base with 932 square miles of land. With 932 square miles at Twentynine Palms. and 195 square miles at Camp Pendleton. we are asking the question: Does the Marine Corps need this space. or could some beach and inland property be used for recreation by the taxpayers. With Yosemite National Park already overcrowded. this idea for a national park within easy driving distance from the Los AngelesSan Diego megalopolis is a good one. The new park would be named the Santa Margarita National Recreation Area. Originally named Rancho Santa Margarita by the early Spanish settlers. shortly after Pearl Harbor the Marines bought the land. and it was dedicated by President Roosevelt in September 1942. We are recommending that 13 miles of the beach on the military base be transferred to the national park. The Marines 5 miles of beach would be contiguous with the 25.000 acres inland where the headquarters. supply depot. and main barracks are. located. This would constitute the new Camp Pendleton. Mr. Speaker. I see this proposal as a logical extension of President Fords proposal to double the size of the national park system. In his August 31. 1976. statement at Yellowstone National Park in California. the President called for a rapid expansion of the national parks to alleviate overcrowding problems in recreation areas. More than 11.5 million people now live within 2 hours driving time of Camp 1 Pendleton. We believe this idea will alleviate some of that overcrowding.",

Commitment of private sector development prior to the actual release of appropriated funds for the Civic Center. The development is to be sufficient to generate tax revenues to pay 100 percent of the annual net fixed costs associated with the Civic Center following 3 years of operation of the Civic Center. Now. before the $27 million is released. before any move is made. we will have to have more than just a statement that the business community intends to participate in the construction of the civic center. so that as far as the first 3 years are concerned under the tax bill I mentioned a few minutes ago. we will have enough to operate the civic center during the early years of operation. and not just on the word of some individual as far as participation.

This bill deals with the mechanism for creating executive level positions in Federal agencies. Executive level jobs are those positions above the career civil service. All are political appointments and most require Senate confirmation. Currently. there are between 800 and 900 executive level positions. The startling fact is that no one is certain of the precise number. Here is what the bill does: First. It directs the Civil Service Commission to precisely determine the number of executive level positions in the executive branch and to publish that number in the Federal Register within 90 days of enactment of the bill. Second. It freezes the number of executive level positions at this number effective upon publication. Third. It directs the President to present to Congress by January 1. 1979. a comprehensive plan for the number of executive level personnel in the executive branch. together with appropriate justification. Authority to implement the plan would come from Congress. Fourth. It terminates the current authority for all executive level positions on July 1. 1980. a \"sunset\" provision. Fifth. It requires referral of all bills and provisions of bills creating executive level jobs to the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. Thus. under this legislation. we will stop the hodgepodge process of creating top positions and place the initial responsibility for establishing these positions in the House committee best able to plan. create. and establish salary levels for jobs in the context of Government personnel needs and public policy. The bill will enable the executive branch and the Congress to find out how many positions there are. at what levels and salaries. and bring some order and coherrence to the management at the top levels of Government in a systematic way.",

President Carter. HEW Secretary Califano. U.S. Education Commissioner Boyer have all pledged to take action to reduce unnecessary Federal paperwork and redtape. Congress. too. must focus its attention on the everincreasing complexities of Federal education program requirements as it begins its work on the extension of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

Mr. President. I do have some reservations about the Optional Education Funding Simplification Act. As has already been discussed by the sponsors of the bill. it would allow States to choose between using Federal grants for purposes specified by Ccngress--categorical aidor far greater State decisionmaking within broad consolidat2d categories of programs. It may be instructive to look back at the consolidation enacted by Congress in the Education Amendments of 1974. At that time. three programsschool library. guidance and counseling. and supplementary education centers programswere consolidated into a new title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Although this action was clearly an effort to simplify administration of the three programs. the Office of Education. In promulgating regulations to implement the new consolidated program. managed to thwart that intent. It did not develop a new set of regulations applicable to the new program. but rather. it retained virtually all of the old regulations promulgated under the three separate authorities. adding new regulations to the existing plethora. Rather than simplification. the school districts were faced with additional administrative burdens. Despite my reservations. I do believe that it is important to fully explore the provisions proposed In the Optional Educational Funding Simplification Act. and I will await with interest the response of the administration and the education community throughout the States.

    "speech": "Mr. President. once again I ask the Senate to ratify the Genocide Convention. The convention was drafted with care and circumspection. Every precaution was taken to safeguard the contracting parties from becoming entangled in political disputes or from forfeiting vital elements of their sovereignty. The convention gives contemporary relevance to traditional American ideals. It is an expression of opposition toward those people and philosophies which have little regard for human rights. Our failure to ratify the convention is utterly without justification in either domestic law or policy and makes possible the association of our country with such other nonratifiers as South Africa and Yemen. whose regard for the rights of individuals is hardly the cause for envy. Concern for the welfare of all peoples has been a principle feature of our foreign policy. Throughout our history. the United States has considered human rights in other countries to be a matter of our deepest interest and consistent with the profound commitment to the heritage of freedom which has fortified us. Indicative of our national commitment to human rights was President Tafts abrogation of a trade treaty with czarist Russia in 1911 because of that countrys discriminatory practices directed against Jews. The United States also intervened on behalf of oppressed religious minorities of the Ottoman Empire in 1840. in Morocco in 1863. in Romania in 1872. and in Poland in 1918. Americas historic commitment to the protection of human rights foundfurther expression in the efforts of President Taft In 1913 to obtain guarantees for minority rights in the peace treaties that followed the Balkan Wars. President Woodrow Wilson urged a similar course in the peace treaties of 1919 involving Central and East European countries. No doubt it was this distinctive humanitarian character of American tradition in foreign affairs that enabled American statesmen to be the first to recognize during World War II that the ultimate consequence of international suppression of freedom was external aggression and. therefore. that peace and human rights are necessarily and inextricably linked together. Mr. President. human rights are indeed a traditional American concern. There is no reason for the Senates failure to ratify the Genocide Convention. We must change the unfortunate route chosen by this body 28 years ago. We must ratify. and reassert our concern for all peoples.",

Federal Power Commission. and Federal Communications Commission. In the consideration of those bills. an amendment offered on behalf of Senator EASTLAND was adopted concerning agency representation in civil actions. This amendment deleted provisions of the bills providing for the agencies to represent themselves. The amendment was the result of discussions between the Department of Justice and the committee staff concerning a method for resolution of the problems which agencies have had in representation by the Department of Justice. The solution. as set forth in a letter from the Associate Attorney General. is for the Department and the agencies to enter into memorandums of understanding which delineate the responsibilities of each party involved in litigation involving the agency. This method has been adopted by the Department for its relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency and may well prove to be the best solution. rather than a legislative solution.

    "speech": "Mr. President. it seems obvious that the Federal Government has quietly abandoned the notion that farmers deserve a \"parity\" price for the commodities they produce. Instead. the new catch phrase seems to be \"cost of production.\" This relatively new standard is not as favorable to farmers because cost of production is less precise than parity. We already know what parity is. because no matter what year is chosen as the parity year. there is a fixed standard against which to measure current farm prices. The cost of production is more elusive. Economists. farmers. Congressmen. and others disagree on what it costs to produce a bushel of wheat or a bushel of corn. What bothers me about the administrations farm program is that not only has it abandoned the parity concept. but it does not even pretend. at least for 1977 and 1978. to fix support prices on wheat and feed grains equal to the cost of production. That is why the Senate last week passed Senate Resolution 193 urging the Secretary of Agriculture to raise the loan price of wheat and feed grains. as the law permits the Secretary to do at his discretion as long as he does not exceed the parity price. The resolution passed by unanimous consent. The administration. however. has said that it will not consider what the Senate recommends. In other words. loan prices for wheat and feed grains will remain where they areat paLifully inadequate levelsunless President Carter can be persuaded to permit the Department of Agriculture to change its mind. For this reason. the distinguished senior Senator from Colorado. Mr. HASKELL and I sent a strongly worded note to President Carter questioning the administrations decision to ignore last weeks Senate resolution. It is our hope that the President will reconsider the position taken by the USDA and give our farmers a fighting chance to recover their cost of production come harvest time.

I know that he is. as am I. most interested in the potential benefits that these amendments will have for the future of anadromous fisheries in Lake Champlain. The Anadromous Fisheries Act has been interpreted in the past not to apply to most of the species of fish in Lake Champlain which ascend its tributary streams to spawn. This amendment rectifles this situation and will enable those States located on the borders of Lake Champlain to utilize funds under the act to intensify research and meanagement of these impotrant fisheries resources. The amendments will also enable the States involved to follow through in their efforts to implement a FederalState comprehensive fisheries plan for the Lake. The implementation of this plan should be of great benefit to existing sport fisheries in Lake Champlain. It has been estimated that if implementation is successful it will provide the sport fisherman of both New York and Vermont with thousands of days of fishing for trout and other important sportfish. Mr. President. I would also like to note that passage of this legislation will result in no additional cost to the Federal Government. It is estimated that the plan mentioned above which is to be developed and implemented by the States of New York and Vermont may in future years result in a cost of approximately $5 million. but this cost could be easily absorbed under the acts present $20 million level of authorization. since only $6 million is being appropriated at present.

It is an article detailing a dramatic display of courage by Miss Alice Brickach. of Pawtucket. since an automobile struck her down on October 30. 1977. Miss Brickach was hospitalized following the accidenta victim of severe brain damage. She was forced to relearn everything in life usually taken for granted. From that point on she began the long fight toward a return to good health and a normal life. Only a month ago did Miss Brickach become able to distinguish colors again. Just a few days ago. however. Alice participated in a Hikers Club 10mile walk along Newports Cliff Walkan example of the fortitude which has sustained her throughout the trying. difficult days since last October. It is heartening to me to claim as a constituent a woman who has shown such tenacity and relentless spirit in the face of an overwhelming challenge and I congratulate Miss Brickach on her victory in this battle and extend to her my best wishes for the future. Mr. President. I ask at this time that the article be printed in full in the RECORD. for the benefit of my colleagues in the Senate.",

I can understand the plight of the borrowers in the State of Arkansas and the State of Tennessee. I can certainly understand the plight of the banks. It is very. very difficult for them. But. Mr. President. it is impossible for me to accept this amendment. and I shall tell the Senator from Arkansas why. Both the State of Arkansas and the State of Tennessee. as I understand it. have written into their constitutions a usury limitation. I frankly think that kind of limitation is economically foolish. but that is a decision made by the State. The State of Tennessee. as the Senator knows. has a constitutional convention under way. They expect to be able to act within a matter of a very few months. The State of Arkansas. as the Senator from Arkansas has indicated. will begin to act in the beginning of this coming year. begin the process of changing the State constitution. It seems to me that for the Federal Government to act and overrule. in effect. either the constitutions or the people of the States of Tennessee and Arkansas is wrong. If they want to change their law. they are free to do so and can do so. They are engaged in the process of considering whether or not to make that change. As the Senator from Arkansas has properly pointed out. the discount rate now is around 5 or 51/2 percent. The amendment he proposes would simply permit loans at a little over 10 percent. Ten percent is the constitutional limitation now. as I understand it. on such loans. so the relief would not be significant now. It might be 2 or 3 years from now. By that time. it would seem to me. there should be plenty of time for the States of Arkansas and Tennessee to act. If they do not want to act. that is their business and they should be free to make their own decision.",

Mr. President. that Congress has. time and time again. overridden State lawfor example PCAs. Federal credit unions. the Federal Land Bankall those loans in the billions of dollars in my State are not limited by the State constitution. While I have never known any of those institutions to charge any more than the 10 percent usury rate in my State. they are eligible to and entitled to if they want to. Mr. President. in light of the chairmans opposition to the amendment. of course I feel that I have no choice but to withdraw the amendment. because I know that the Senate will not override his feelings on this. I did feel strongly inclined not to even offer the amendment with the knowledge he might oppose it. But. by the same token. I feel so strongly. if many banks in our State get in the same kind of trouble again they got into in 1973 and 1974. I would have no choice. if it occurred between now and the time the Arkansas Constitutional Convention had a chance to meet. but to come back to the Senate and put this amendment on the first vehicle I could get it on because otherwise there could be a massive outflow of capital from my State. Banks lost money for about two or three quarters in that period of time. and we were put at a severe disadvantage. The constitutional convention is the first chance we have had. But in light of the chairmans opposition. I know he labored over this. talked to bankers in my State and in the State of Tennessee. I know he has reached what he thinks is the right decision for himself. his committee. and the Senate. and in light of his opposition. Mr. President. I will withdraw the amendment.",

There must be a way for an individual to find out what information about him is in a record and how it is used. There must be a way for an individual to prevent information about him that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without his consent.

The apparent torture and murder of Anglican Archbishop Janani Luwum following his alleged \"plot\" to \"overthrow\" the government recently runs counter to the most basic concepts of justice and human decency. The specter of a new wave of religious assassinations. mass murders. and disappearance. is equally ominous. The continuing juggling of the few Americans who remain in Uganda is disturbing at the very least. Added to the expulsion of 40.000 Asians in 1972. the murder of the editor of a critical Catholic journal in 1973. the disappearance of a British airline passenger in 1976. and countless other outrages. these most recent events demonstrate the power of fear and persecution when used as an instrument of governmental control. Dissent has been virtually nonexistent. For years. religious groups in Uganda have remained silent in the face of unrelenting attacks by the government against individuals. Maintaining a policy of noninvolvement in \"internal affairs.\" the Organization of African Unity refuses to recognize its own embarrassment when one of its member nations is ruled by a cruel tyrant. Amins claims of internal sovereignty echo those of other totalitarian leaders throughout the world who seek to muffle the growing outcry against the systematic degradation of human rights. Speaking out against that oppression. however. is an international cause. one whose borders have no limits. Recent appeals by a few courageous individuals in Ugandaindeed. by the late Mr. Luwum himselfcry out for support. Such cries need answers.

Fox. and the full text follows: Tex Martin was stranded at TriCounty High School with 275 other travelers on January 28. 1977. He is an Emergency Medical Technician and immediately took charge of our clinic area and administered first aid. He organized several people to assist him and worked over 8 hours checking each person who came into the school. Through his efforts there were no serious aftereffects from the many frostbite cases we had. Mr. Martins immediate response to this emergency is typical of the personal concern and courage which built America. He didnt stay in the background or worry about lawsuits which could arise from his efforts. His organization and tireless effort helped each traveler to feel relaxed and comfortable.",

Its purpose is to prohibit Federal court orders forcing children to attend a particular school. such as orders to bus children to specified schools because of their race. Its means is to employ the authority granted to Congress by article III of the Constitution to restrict the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to issue such orders. Frankly. it is surprising there are still proponents of school busing for the purpose of achieving racial balance. It is costly. it is driving down the quality of education. and it is apparently resulting in greater segregation. the very opposite of its alleged purpose. Even Sociology Prof. James Coleman. the author of the influential 1966 study used as a basis of many busing orders. now says courtordered school integration is a failure. A new study by Coleman shows that courtordered integration results in a \"general resegregation in all regions of the country.\" In an interview published in the National Observer. Coleman called the courts \"the worst of all possible instruments for carrying out a very sensible activity like integrating schools.\"",

I reported to my colleagues about my efforts to obtain continued funding of a program to check a mountain pine beetle epidemic that is ravaging the foothills of Colorado. The mountain pine beetle is a small insect that normally occurs in low numbers in western forests. In recent years. however. the number of beetles has grown to an epidemic level. The beetles have killed hundreds of thousands of trees along the Front Range in Colorado. hurting tourism. recreation. private property. and aesthetic values. For the past 3 years. the U.S. Forest Service. the Colorado State Forester. and private landowners have cooperated in a limited. but effective. program to check the spread of the beetles in key areas. Last year. however. the Forest Service indicated that it was going to stop funding the beetle control program. When I last spoke about this matter before the House. I inserted in the CoNCRESSIONAL RECORD correspondence between myself and the Forest Service on this subject. in which I pointed out the grave mistake that would be made by termination of Federal funding for this project. Eventually. the Forest Service reversed its position and recommended that the funding be continued.

Recently. the Sunday New York Times in its \"The Week In Review\" section had a several paragraph article entitled \"The Murderous General Amin.\" The title is. if anything. an understatement. but that is not the problem with the article. Few will disagree with the statement that the New York Times is a politically liberal newspaper. Such liberal newspapers push the idea through news stories and other ways that the United States should cut aid. trade. et cetera. to such countries as Chile.

Let us then take a look at how the New York Times in its article handles Uganda on these same issues. First. the New York Times article states \"Diplomatic action has also had no positive result. in the past. if anything it has reduced foreign leverage.\" So much for that kind of pressure. The issue of cutting off arms to a country is always popular for the liberals. The Soviet Union is the major supplier of arms to Uganda. therefore. you might think the New York Times would show its bias in its news columns by urging the Soviets to cut back its weapons to Uganda. But no. the Times does not urge that. Rather. \"the Soviet Union. a major supplier of weapons to Uganda. could cut back supplies. but Uganda could obtain arms in other markets.\" Is it not funny how the liberals only urge such cutoffs on our friends and those who want to be our friends. but not on the Soviets or a black dictator in Africa.

When the act was passed in 1921. the thenexisting 71 terminal stockyards were. in effect. monopolies and. as such. properly amenable to regulation as public utilities. Congress therefore. appropriately gave the Secretary of Agriculture extensive jurisdiction over their rates and charges. However. by 1958 livestock marketing patterns had changed and a great volume of livestock was marketed through smaller stock-",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was disturbed to read in Wednesdays Washington Post that over 70 high ranking police and fire officials of the District of Columbia were retiring. The Post noted that the retirements were prompted by a quirk in the police and fire retirement rules that make it profitable for employees to retire immediately before a pay increase is granted. Under these congressionally enacted rules. a retirees annuity is computed by averaging his highest years pay and multiplying this base by various factors derived from length of service and disability. This annuity is then increased each time a pay raise is granted. Thus. a policeman or a fireman retiring on September 30 would have his annuity increased by 7.05 percent on October 1. If the same policeman or fireman retired after October 1. his annuity would not be increased by the 7.05 percent. If the other body passes the District of Columbia Retirement Reform Act. H.R. 6536. which passed the House on September 26 of this year. then this problem will be corrected. This bill. which I sponsored. \"decouples\" retirement increases from current pay. and provides for annuity adjustments to be given based on increases in the consumer price index. Also. as in civil service. the increase in annuity will be given to those who retire immediately after an adjustment as well as to those who retire immediately before an adjustment. This quirk is one of many bad practices and anachronisms in the current law that will be corrected by enactment of H.R. 6536. In view of these improvements. as well as the badly needed pension funding provisions of the bill. I hope the other body acts quickly on this measure. I would like to insert the Washington Post article for my colleagues information:",

Many Members of the Senate have worked for several years to bring about the passage of this important legislation. Particular credit is due to the untiring leadership and dedication of Senator KENNEDY and Senator BAYH representing the work of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. Their judgment and patience have prevailed over a long period of time and have advanced the protection of civil liberties for all Americans. Many other Members. however. played vital roles in the development of these procedural safeguards including the late Senator Philip Hart of Michigan. Senator GAYLORD NELSON of Wisconsin. former Senator Sam J. Ervin. Jr.. Senator JAMES ABOUREZK of South Dakota. and former Senator John Tunney of California. In a democratic society citizens must be ever vigilant to protect against government infringement of their liberties. As we have seen all too clearly in recent years. democracy is a fragile system which can be endangered as surely by citizen neglect as by government despotism. Lord Actons maxim that \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\" should serve as a constant warning against the common tendency of those who govern to justify the use of ignoble means to achieve noble objectives. The means by which government officials seek to achieve objectives. whether it be the protection of the nation from foreign attack or the distribution of the Nations health. will in the long run determine the success or failure of our experiment in selfgovernment. I applaud the work of the Senators who have brought forth this major victory for it is yet another affirmation of success this country has had in protecting the liberties of its citizens.*",

It also acts as an incentive for employers to remain or to locate in cities experiencing sustained high unemployment. My bill provides an employer a 3year tax deduction of 25 percent of the cost of wages paid to new workers who had previously been unemployed. This deduction applies to businesses located in cities of 100.000 population or more which have had an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent or greater for any 3 out of the 12 months preceding enactment of this legislation. Those employers eligible to take a deduction for onefourth of the wages paid include those engaged in: Manufacturing. retailing. provision of personal. physical. or social services. basic or applied research. and building construction. Such employers may deduct 25 percent of their wage costs for employees who: Have resided in the eligible city for 6 months or more. and were unemployed for a minimum of 30 days out of the 6 months preceding their employment. Lastly. such employment must be new employmentin other words. the employer must create new jobs that did not exist prior to enactment of this legislation. Mr. President.

This legislation is of utmost importance both to our farmers and to the Nation. This much needed legislation will help reverse our serious balanceofpayments difficulties by encouraging the exnansion of food and fiber exports by Americas farmers. This body has deliberated. in recent weeks. various bills designed to enhance farm income. These bills deal with the economic problems of farmers in the short run. This legislation takes a much longer look. Hence. it is a welcome complement to an overall effort geared to update our Nations agricultural policies. In recent years. our farmers have become more dependent on export markets for strength in farm income. Currently. 1 of 3 acres in grain production is devoted to export markets. Given this fact. it is easy to understand why exports are so important to the economic vitality of American agriculture. I want to commend Senator CLARKS leadership in offering this very significant legislation. It is my understanding that the Senate Committee on Agriculture. Nutrition. and Forestry will hold hearings on this legislation late this month. I will testify at these hearings to further expand on my reasons for supporting this legislation. Mr. President. this bill will be very valuable to North Carolina agriculture. In particular. this bill will help North Carolina producers engaged ir tobacco. soybean. feed grain. and poultry production. While it is difficult to project the immediate impact of this bill on farm income. it is clear to me that this legislation will have significant influence on the market development policies of this Nation. policies that will play a vital role in the size of farm income at the end of this decade.O By Mr. CHURCH (for himself.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the drafting of lobbying disclosure legislation which is both fair and effective. is a difficult task. It is an intricate problem of how to collect enough information without discouraging free communication between Congress and the public. The difficulty of this task was evidenced by the inability of the House and the Senate to come to a compromise on a lobbying disclosure bill in 1976. In this Congress. two bills (S. 1785 and S. 2026) have already been introduced in the Senate. The purpose of both of these bills is to provide for the disclosure of information which Congress and the public need to evaluate efforts to influence the course of legislation. The Governmental Affairs Committee has held several days of hearings on lobbying legislation. and we have heard from a myriad of witnesses representing fields as diverse as industry. education. conservation. public interest. the press. and labor. All of our witnesses have agreed on one pointlobbying disclosure legislation must not inadvertently restrict lobbying activity by placing undue burdens on the basic constitutional rights of free speech. association. and redress of grievances. nor an undue burden from that and point of disclosure requirerpents. For this reason. I congratulate Senator RIBICOFF on this legislation of which he is the principal sponsor. The refinements made by this bill reflect the close attention we have all paid to the need for costeffective legislationlegislation which can serve a useful purpose without creating too great a cost. This legislation will undoubtedly be further refined in committee markup. on the Senate floor and in conference. and we will continue to work closely with all interested parties to insure that the final product is a truly workable and effective piece of legislation.

The spending figures discussed here cover spending for Soviet Frontal Aviation and Ground Forces units stationed within these East European countries. These data reflect Soviet efforts to improve forces positioned in Eastern Europe. but do not reflect improvements to other Soviet forces which have been assigned missions against NATO. During the period. spending for Soviet forces within the NGA constituted less than 10 percent of Soviet defense spending but grew at approximately twice the rate of total defense spending. Growth was particularly high after 1973 when the Soviets introduced large numbers of new tactical aircraft into Frontal Aviation units within the NGA. Between 1967 and 1977 the Soviets increased the number of tactical aircraft within the NGA by 20 percent. In 1977 over 80 percent of the Soviet tactical aircraft inventory in the NGA consisted of modern aircraft produced since 1969. These improvements to Frontal Aviation in the NGA enchanced the Soviets capabilities to wage conventional and theater nuclear war in Central Europe. Spending for Ground Forces units In the NGA grew at a slower pace than spending for Frontal Aviation but reflected Soviet efforts to increase the size and combat ability of these forces. The deployment of five Soviet divisions to Czechoslovakia in 1968 and 1969. and increases in the number of men assigned to divisions. increased the total of Ground Forces personnel in the NGA by about onethird between 1967 and 1977. At the same time. Ground Forces units In the NGA were modernized with additional artillery pieces. rocket launchers. tanks. and mobile air defense weapons.

(Most of these aircraft were older models.) The buildup of forces opposite China proceeded at a slower pace after 1972.

Prohibiting diplomatic. trade. or aid relations with certain countries and mandating the severance of relations with others are foreign policy acts of great magnitude with major consequences for our entire foreign policy. For example. how can we demand that the President end all relations with Cuba. including the withdrawal of our interest sections when no hearings at all were held on this question? Is our Government not best served by its ability to pursue directly with the Castro government matters such as the reunification of families. protests over Cuban action in Africa. the freeing of American crews that stray into Cuban air and sea space. and the like?

Mr. George H. Spencer. in an editorial published in the June 28 edition of the Washington Post. has brought to light a completely unacceptable situation in this regard. I think the article illustrates the results of the lack of continued vigilance in this important area. The editorial describes the conviction for murder of an accused felon. Prior to the sentencing hearing. and in the privacy of his own prison cell. the convict solicited the murder of his own wife from a man who he thought was an attorney. Only at the sentencing hearing did the felon learn that the man in whom he had confided was not a lawyer. but a deliberately placed disguised police officer.

Vladimir Slepak. a chemical engineer. and his wife. Maria. had waited longer8 yearsthan any other Soviet citizens to emigrate. Ida Nudels application had been pending for 7 years. Maria. who is seriously ill with bleeding ulcers. will be placed on trial in the very near future. There is little doubt that she. too. will be sentenced to several years in internal exile in Siberia. The Slepaks and Ida Nudel were arrested on June 1 when. out of desperation after having been refused permission to leave for so many years. they hung banners out of their windows demanding the right to emigrate. For this they were charged with \"malicious hooliganism.\" As with the trial of Yuri Orlov. the Slepak and Nudel trials were travesties of justice. They were conducted in complete secrecy. The courtrooms were closed to relatives and friends. Ida Nudel had to be forcibly carried inside. Vladimir Slepak was not permitted to either testify or present witnesses in his defense. The authorities turned a firehose on associates gathered outside. The sentences were unbelievably harsh: 5 years in Siberia for Slepak. 4 for Nudel. The message from the courtrooms could not be clearer for those in the Soviet Union who wish to emigrate. The state is saying: \"Your cause is hopeless. we will smash you.\" The Soviet Government must not be permitted to act with impunity. Every fiber of our Government. all citizens who are concerned about freedom. must let the Soviets know that their conduct is barbarous and intolerable. that we view it with revulsion. and that we condemn it completely.

Philadelphias experience. together with that of Atlanta and Phoenix. will be used as a basis to determine the value of prepurchase counseling in other cities. according to Ms. Goodwin. The program will provide important information to firsttime homeseekers on topics that will better prepare them for successful homeownership. Covered in the materials and counseling that participants will receive are such topics as: How much you can afford to pay for a house. things to consider in choosing a neighborhood. how to use the services of real estate brokers. how to inspect a house and be sure youre getting what you paid for. what steps are involved in actually buying a house. how to go about getting a mortgage. what you need to know about home maintenance and repair. and where to get help if you run into problems.",

The Committee on Governmental Affairs. pursuant to its mandate under Senate Resolution 71 (94th Congress. 1st session). last December completed an indepth study of the structure of Federal banking regulation. In volume 5 of its Study on Federal Regulation. the committee found that Federal banking regulatory functions are duplicative. confusing. and inconsistent and should be consolidated into a single Federal Bank Commission. The committee found that the structure of commercial banking regulation is unique. A bank can choose the Comptroller of the Currency to be its regulator by seeking a national bank charter. A bank can choose the Federal Depositor Insurance Corporation as its primary regulator by seeking a State charter. And a State bank which wishes the Federal Reserve Board to act as its primary regulator needs only to join the Federal Reserve System. Nowhere else does a regulated industry have this type of latitude. This ability to forumshop has led to an unhealthy competition for membership among the agencies. Confusion and inconsistency are most prevalent in the areas of examination standards. merger policy. and bank holding company policy. The solution to this problem is consolidation of the three agencies as designed by S. 2750. I believe this bill represents very care1ul balancing of the goals of Federal banking regulation. and I hope it will receive early and favorable consideration by Congress and the administration.",

Human rights is a topic of great concern to each and every Senator. and President Carter has chosen to make the human rights issue a major concern of his administration. From time to time in the past. issues of such great importance have arisen that nations have joined together under treaty to deal with them. In 1884. there was an international agreement calling for the protection of submarine cables. In 1911. the United States was a party to a treaty calling -for the preservation and protection of fur seals in the North Pacific. This country has also joined in international treaties seeking to stifle drug abuse and to abolish the slave trade. Surely. an international agreement which seeks to protect the most basic of all human rights. the right to live. merits the participation of the United States. Genocide is certainly abhorrent to everything for which the United States stands. President Truman welcomed the opportunity of associating the United States with the Genocide Convention. He signed the treaty in 1948. The Senate. however. has yet to vote on the Genocide Convention. In my view. this is a very serious oversight on the part of this body. Genocide certainly is a serious international concern. Dean Rusk. who spoke in favor of ratification of the Convention in 1950. pointed out that \"crimes like genocide so inflame the international situation as to bring us to the brink of war and are real threats to the peace.\" I feel strongly that ratification of the Genocide Convention is long overdue.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recent action by the Internal Revenue Service threatens to jeopardize plans Florida and many other States have been developing to assist State. county. and municipal employees to better provide for their retirement. Relying on an existing IRS ruling. the Florida Legislature. in 1976. passed a law calling for the creation of a deferred compensation plan. Under this plan. State employees would be permitted to make voluntary contributions to a fund for their retirement. This program would not interfere with any other employee retirement plan and no State or Federal tax dollars would be involved. Counties and municipalities were permitted. under provisions of the law. to establish similar programs. One stipulation was that the IRS must agree not to tax the contributions until received by the employee in retirement. The State treasurer of Florida. and a former colleague of ours in the House of Representatives. Bill Gunter. initiated development of such a plan. Prior to implementation. however. the IRS stated its intention to tax such programs at the time the money is paid into the fund by the employee rather than when actually received. This IRS position is irresponsible and would deny these public servants the opportunity to provide for their retirement in a way not available through present retirement programs. The costs to the employees could potentially reach into the billions of dollars and such IRS action is very demoralizing. Deferred compensation programs encourage State employees to continue in public service and also provide benefits to the general public not generally recognized. The time to act is now and I believe Congress has a duty to take affirmative action on the matter. What we need is swift enactment of the deferred compensation legislation that will insure that the IRS lives up to its commitment not to tax these voluntary contributions until such time as the money is actually received by the employee.",

Throughout our State and region. including my district in Milwaukee. there is a rising interest in enjoying outdoor recreation. The Nicolet National Forest. comprising over 600.000 acres of Wisconsin timberland. offers recreational opportunities for thousands of visitors. as well as supplying timber for the Nations expanding needs. Nowhere in the Nicolet Forest. however. can our citizens be assured of partaking in the unique experience of a wilderness area. where nature is left undisturbed and man himself is but a visitor. This legislation proposes two small areas where such an experience is possible. Both of these areas have unusual scenic and natural attributes. and contain wilderness qualities far in excess of the general character of the Nicolet National Forest. Both are also unusual in the degree to which Federal ownership exists in a solid block. so that wilderness can be designated with only a very minor amount of acquisitions of private lands. Indeed. both have been recognized by the Forest Service. which has fnr some years managed the core portions of each area as de facto wilderness. prohibiting. to the extent possible. uses that conflict with preservation of wilderness values. Mr. Speaker. the desire to preserve some of earths blessings to hand down to future generations to cherish and enjoy has always been strong in Wisconsin. and it is strong among my constituents in Milwaukees Fifth District. I ask that my colleagues join in supporting the passage of H.R. 12264.0",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was pleased to join my colleague from Wisconsin in sponsoring this bill. and I am pleased to join my distinguished friend in urging passage of it today. The State of Wisconsin is fortunate In having two large and beautiful national foreststhe Chequamegon National Forest and the Nicolet National Forest. Despite the thousands of acres of Wisconsin forest devoted to multiple uselumbering. snowmobiling. camping. motorboating. and so forththere are only two small wilderness areas in our State. one of them being a few rocky islands in Lake Michigan. The great Nicolet National Forest. covering a large part of eastern Wisconsin. contains no wilderness areas at all. Passage of this bill will preserve two small areas of unique beauty in the Nicolet Forest for the enjoyment of everyone. The wilderness designation would not affect timber production in this area in any significant way. but would allow thousands of visitors the chance to enjoy the wilderness experience. Blackjack Springs and Whisker Lakes are conveniently accessible to the large population areas of our region. such as Milwaukee. Chicago. Minneapolis. Green Bay. and Madison. I know that many of my constituents in western Wisconsin will take advantage of the quiet solitude and pristine beauty of these two lakes. Mr. Speaker. given the limitations of our time. I will keep my remarks short. I ask my colleagues in this Chamber to join the Wisconsin delegation in supporting H.R. 12264 to designate two small wilderness areas in our State. Thank you.O",

This legislation includes funding for Federal efforts to find alternatives to ocean dumping of waste and for various marine sanctuaries programs. Additionally. this legislation includes an amendment offered by my good friend and colleague. Mr. FORSYTHE. to require the termination of ocean dumping of all harmful industrial wastes on or before December 31. 1981. As the House knows. last years bill included an amendment. which I strongly supported. which had the effect of banning the dumping of harmful sewage sludge by 1981. I am pleased to see that the committee has extended this phaseout requirement to harmful industrial wastes as well. In 1977. 1.843.800 tons of industrial wastes were dumped in the ocean of which 1.783.600 or nearly 97 percent was dumped in the Atlantic Ocean. Although this level is a substantial reduction from the over 5 million tons which were dumped in 1973. industrial wastes still pose a serious problem to the ocean environment. The ocean is not a garbage pit. We must stop the continuing abuse of the marine ecosystem. The Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. by placing a date certain in the law for both sewage sludge and industrial wastes. has taken a giant step forward in our efforts to clean up the oceans. As a Representative of a State with precious natural resources. and one which depends on the ocean for recreation. scenic beauty and tourism. I strongly urge the House to give its overwhelming support to this measure.",

I. and members of my subcommittee. share the same deep and abiding concern of the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Louisiana and the members of their committee over the adverse environmental effects of ocean dumping. Our committee held hearings and determined that both the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are turning more and more frequently to the authorizations contained within the Marine Protection. Research and Sanctuaries Act. We believe this to be a healthy step. In the past too many environmental efforts have been fragmented and thus diluted. The oceans are seen by many as the last great unconquered frontier and we believe that it is essential that all possible steps be taken to mitigate the damage caused by \"the heavy hand of man upon the waves.\" H.R. 10661 was reported by a unanimous vote of the Committee on Science and Technology on May 2. 1978. One week later. on May 10. the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries reported a slightly amended version of the same legislation. Today. in the spirit of friendly cooperation and coordination. we are offering a joint committee amendment in the nature of a committee substitute which incorporates the best of both versions. As proposed by our committee the bill extends the funding authorization for the Marine Protection. Research and Sanctuaries Act as follows: (In millions] Fiscal Fiscal Program 1979 1980 Title I.

Licensed deck officer or firstclass pilot status. including authorization for navigation on the lakes and graded for specified routes in accordance with experience. are still prerequisites. Aspirant or applicant \"U.S. registered pilots\" must also satisfy minimum specified Great Lakes service or experience requirements and such additional experience or training requirements as the Secretary of Transportation may deem necessary. Thus. a sincere effort has been made to insure the continued availability of a skilled pool of qualified and federally mandated \"U.S. registered\" pilots to guide the movements of both foreign and registered U.S. oceangoing vessels within the confines of our Nations fifth sea the pilotage system for which begins at Montreals entrance to the St. Lawrence Seaway. extends for a distance of some 1.340 miles to the head of Lake Superior at Duluth.

The Anadromous Fish Conservation Act of 1956 provides for the conservation. development. and enhancement of the anadromous fishery resources of the Nation. as well as the fish in the Great Lakes that ascend streams to spawn. In order to carry out this purpose. the act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce to enter into cooperative agreements with the participating States in order that the necessary actions can be taken on a costsharing basis. Such actions include investigations. engineering. and biological surveys. research. stream clearance. construction. maintenance. and operation of hatcheries and devices and structures for improving movement. feeding. and spawning conditions. Presently. only certain coastal waters and the waters of the Great Lakes are eligible for these programs. By including Lake Champlain under the coverage of the act. the States of Vermont and New York would become eligible for Federal financial assistance for those fish in the lake that ascend streams to snawn. Lake Champlain is the 10th largest freshwater lake in the country but cannot receive Federal financial assistance because its anadromous fish populations are landlocked. As my distinguished colleague from Vermont. JIM JEFFORDS. testified before our subcommittee. there have been ongoing programs since 1973 to develon a salmonid fishery in Lake Champlain but the work has been slow because of inadequate funding. insufficient basic research on the lake. and the lack of nrourams and facilities for beginininz and then managing an expanded fishery. He nointed out that if the funds were available to implement the plan for a salmonid fishery. thousands of anglers in the Northeast United States would benefit. Mr. Speaker. the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act has proven to he successful. There are presently 29 nonFederal participants in the program and the expenditure of about .t25 million since the act was passed in 1965 has resulted in an economic benefit of approximately $441 million to the States. I want to urge my colleagues to Join me In supporting H.R. 13392 in order that Lake Champlain can also enjoy the benefits under the act. Mr. Speaker.

After serving in Chino. he moved into the fire chief position in the city of La Habra. He improved that citys fire defenses greatly and during his tenure two fire stations were built. training facilities were constructed. and needed fire equipment was purchased. In 1964. the city of La Habra appointed Mr. Schroyer as city administrator after a year as assistant city administrator. During his tenure as city administrator a 10year program of work was produced. implemented. and annually upgraded. This program detailed estimates and objectives for public services and public facilities together with financial planning. On July 1. 1970.

A case in point is the minimum wage law. In trying to make certain that all our Nations workers are paid wages which will assure a basic standard of living they have passed legislation which has resulted in many not being paid at all. Moreover. they have repeatedly raised the minimum wage and have only exacerbated the situation. particularly where the young. the underskilled. and the untrained are concerned. They have made these groups virtually unemployable. Has Congress learned a lesson? Apparently not. because once again we are back in business giving serious consideration to yet another proposal to hike the minimum wage and tie to it an automatic costofliving increaseall the while complaining about a stubborn rate of unemployment. In its March 2. 1977 edition. the Rapid City. S.Dak.. Journal editorialized on this increasingly serious problem. Their comments bear heeding by my colleagues.",

There is no provision of enforcement. no penalty section in the entire bill. Nowhere does it specify what happens if someone dies not comply. Moreover. in regard to financial matters. the foggily written restrictions and numerous loopholes would seem to actively encourage unethical behavior.

As I announced yesterday. there is growing public concern. amongst both laymen and the scientific community. with respect to the potential dangers of recombinant DNA research. and the consensus of all concerned parties is that a legislative response is necessary. Congressman OTTINGER. a member of the subcommittee. has already introduced legislation which addresses the questions of mandatory licensure of recombinant DNA research. patent restrictions. civil liability for damage ca used by DNA research. and other issues. The legislation which I have introduced today is intended to supplement Mr. OTTINGERS bill for purposes of public discussion and to broaden the scope of next weeks hearings. Briefly. the Recombinant DNA Research Act of 1977 would do the following: First. Require Federal licensure of all recombinant DNA research projects. whether or not they are federally funded. Licenses would be valid for 2year periods. Second. Require the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to establish requirements for licensure including requirements for physical and biological containment which are at least as stringent as the existing NIH guidelines. requirements with respect to personnel safety techniques. review by institutional review committees. and reporting requirements. Third. Limit research which requires P4high risk levelcontainment to 10 centers designated by the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. Fourth. Authorize the Secretary of Health.

Traditionally. the Government has provided opportunities aimed toward alleviating the economic hardships caused by the disability or death of the veteran. Perhaps the most significant contribution the Government can give to these families is in the form of education assistance. In 1958. the Congress committed itself to aiding families of the deceased or disabled veteran \"in attaining the educational status which they might normally have aspired to and obtained but for the disability or death of a parent.\" Toward this goal. we should strive to provide the widest possible range of educational opportunities for widows and dependents. Correspondence courses have proven to be viable alternatives to institutional training. Under chapter 43 of the GI bill. which permitted veterans to enroll in correspondence schools.. many veterans successfully completed courses by correspondence and. as a result. were able to makeup for educational deficiencies and command better salaries. Six years ago Congress recognized the value of these courses by extending their unique benefits to wives and widows of disabled or deceased veterans. For those eligible people who have children or lack transportation. correspondence courses provide a means toward educational betterment which would otherwise be impossible. Yet. dependents of disabled or deceased veteransto whom Congress promised a broad scope of educational optionsdo not presently have the same opportunity. Though dependents can receive full benefits for attendance at a regularly university. they are prohibited from taking any courses of correspondence. The distinction seems to be an arbitrary one. This bill wouldrectify this situation by permitting eligible dependents to pursue a program of education through correspondence. thereby making available the same educational opportunities now offered to widows and veterans.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to propose an amendment to S. 2057 which would amend the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. As presently written. this act requires that manufacturers affix labels on automobiles indicating the fuel economy and estimated annual fuel cost of each model. and the range of fuel economy of comparable automobiles. Under this law. \"automobile\" is defined as a four wheel vehicle rated at 6.000 pounds gross vehicle weightcombined vehicle and load. In addition to this mandatory section. discretion is given to the Secretary of Transportation to require labeling on automobiles between 6.000 and 10.000 pounds gross vehicle weight if he determines that average fuel economy standards are feasible and that energy conservation will result. Mr. President. my amendment would require fuel efficiency disclosure on vehicles of 8.500 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. thus raising the mandatory cap contained in present law. The major reason for this proposal is the noticeable upswing in the purchases of recreational vehicles. parcel delivery vans and light duty trucksa great majority of which are 8.500 pounds or less vehicle weightby the American consumer in recent years. In addition. I have studied title III of part A of S. 2057. and notice that under the Federal van pooling program. if passed. authority would exist for the purchase or lease by the Federal Government of up to 6.000 vans for van pooling arrangements. It therefore seems appropriate. Mr. President. to insert this amendment in order to provide members of both the public and private sectors with as much information as possible on fuel economy before they make their purchase choice. I have been in contact with the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency concerning their ability to absorb this requirement. The Department of Transportation acknowledged that the Secretary was considering the possibility of a rule raising the limit to 8.500 pounds some time in the future. and sources at the EPA have confimed that that agency will have test resources available in model year 1979 for this new requirement. Therefore. Mr. President. I ask for the favorable consideration of this amendment by the distinguished floor managers. I send my amendment to the desk and ask it be reported.",
