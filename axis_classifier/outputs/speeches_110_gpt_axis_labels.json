With the huge bipartisan. bicameral support that had before. there should be no difficulty with that. and people have been working on it since the very time that we passed it. House leadership. by cherrypicking certain technical corrections intended for certain special interest groups. is not the way to legislate. and I would contend that they are not technical corrections. Chairman KENNEDY and I. together with Chairman BAUCUS and Senator GRASSLEY. have worked extremely well on making sure that everyone has a voice at the table and that the process is transparent. Generally. these provisions undo. in a piecemeal fashion. what was accomplished in the Pension Protection Act as far as strengthening funding requirements. It permits some plans to choose to have reduced funding obligations and reduced pension benefit guarantee premiums. In fact. it means that the Pension Benefit Guatanty Corporation must refund some premiums to some employers. Again. I want to provide our troops with the funding and the resources they need to be successful in all their tasks. Unfortunately. this conference does not make our troops the priority of congressional business. The men and women of our armed services deserve better than this spending bill. The people of the United States deserve better. I yield the floor.",

I set the record straight for the Senate and the American people regarding the practice of including unrequested emergency funding in war supplementals. The emergency supplemental bills approved by Republican Congresses in 2003. 2004 2005. and 2006 included emergency funding for many of the same issues that are in the emergency Supplemental. such as: agriculture disaster assistancefiscal year 2006 war supplemental $500 million. border securityfiscal year 2006 war supplemental $1.9 billion. pandemic flufiscal year 2006 war supplemental-$2.3 billion: wildland fire suppressionfiscal year 2005 Defense Appropriations Act. which carried $25.8 billion war supplemental$500 million: airline securityfiscal year 2003 war supplemental-$2.396 billion. and fisheries assistancefiscal year 2006 war supplemental $112 million. The White House has complained about Democrats including agricultural disaster assistance in the war supplemental. Not only did the Republican Congress approve a targeted agriculture disaster package in 2006. but there is also precedent for including assistance to a sector in the economy that has been hard hit by a disaster. In 2003. Congress approved $515 million of relief for the aviation industry. The White House has also complained about Democrats including other mat53. Pt. 10 13909 ter in a war supplemental. such as the minimum wage increase. Yet under Republican control. war supplemental laws included such unrelated matters as the REAL ID Act. fiscal year 2005. a temporary worker program. fiscal year 2005. and budget process provisions. fiscal year 2006.

He might be interested to know I met with the Secretary General of the United Nations on Monday in his office. 1 indicated I wanted to know what he was prepared to propose. As you know. there are three phases to the process whereby the Sudanese have agreed to the implementation of ultimately 21.000 troops made up of the African Union as well as United Nations forces. He indicated he would have an answer as to what he thought might be able to be done probably by the end of Memorial Day. My point to him was similar to my friend from Illinois. If. in fact. the Sudanese Government refuses to allow. on the basis of their sovereignty. the placement of U.N. forces on the ground. that it violates their sovereignty. 1 indicated I believedand others believe as wellthat the country forfeits its sovereignty when it participates and engages in genocide and that we. the United States. should push the Security Council to implement the placement of those troops on the ground regardless of what Khartoum says. Further. if they dont. it is my view the United States unilaterally should engage through a nofly zone as well as the placement of 2.500 troops on the ground to take out the Janjaweed. That is not a political settlement. but the point I made to the Secretary General was. as we talk about the ultimate problem. the need for a political settlement. it is like talking about a patient who has cancer and on the way to the operating room falls off the gurney and slits his jugular vein and is bleeding to death. Everybody says: We have to take care of the cancer. But they are going to bleed to death. I have been in those camps in Darfur. actually on the border of Darfur. I have visited them in Chad.

Adlesperger of Albuquerque. In late 2004. Lance Corporal Adlesperger. and his unit were deployed in Fallujah and involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. On one particular mission. Adlesperger and his squad were ordered to storm an insurgentoccupied building. While moving forward Adlespergers squad began to receive heavy insurgent fire and several members of his squad were wounded and the rest were pinned down. Adlesperger took action and secured a path for the injured marines to be evacuated. Despite the fact that he was also wounded. Adlesperger continued the assault on the building. Adlesperger is credited with eliminating several insurgents and playing a pivotal role in the successful assault. Tragically. 1 month later. 20 yearold Christopher Adlesperger. was fatally shot while on patrol in the Anbar province west of Bahgdad. This brave young soldier was one of the first New Mexicans to give his life in the Iraq war and on April 13. 2007. Adlesperger was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for valor.

During this time. the CPSC staff dwindled from nearly 1.000 to 420. We must increase funding and staff to the CPSC. We need to increase coordination between the CPSC and Customs officials. We must give the CPSC the authority to examine and approve other nations regulatory systems before Imports from those countries show up in our childrens bedrooms. We need a leader at the CPSC who supports these goals. It is clear that Chairwoman Nord does not. She has been given the responsibility of doing everything in her power to keep our families safe and our children safe. Instead. Chairwoman Nord supports an abysmal agency budget request. is actively working against efforts to strengthen her agency. and takes trips funded by manufacturers. Chairwoman Nancy Nord should step down. It is time to put a chairperson in place who is not satisfied with: We are doing the best we can.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the struggle to protect the civil rights of all Americans remains an unfinished project. but we have come a long way. I am proud of our countrys progress. and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act. which marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most significant civil rights victories in American history. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided affirmation to Americans who knew this country could do better. This legislation outlawed discrimination based on sex. national origin. color. race. and religion. Access to offices. schools. housing. the voting booth. and public spaces would no longer depend on the color of ones skin or the country of ones birth. Heeding President Kennedys call for \"the kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\" this historic legislation affirmed that all Americans were equal under before law. Years passed before the Civil Rights Act was enforced fully. but its passage represented a necessary step in the advancement of civil rights. Passage of the Civil Rights Act was possible because of the persistent. nonviolent efforts of countless Americans. Heroes like Dr. Martin Luther King. Rosa Parks. and JOHN LEWIS inspired a generation. and the marches. sitins. freedom rides. and individual acts of civil disobedience reminded our countrys leaders that the time to act had arrived. All Americans are indebted to these patriots for their courage and success. and we honor them with this legislation. In addition to marking the Civil Rights Act in word. this bill also commemorates the act in deed. Proceeds from the sale of these coins will go to the United Negro College Fund. UNCF. an organization that embodies the spirit of the Civil Rights Act. The United Negro College Fund works to uproot the core causes of discrimination by providing minorities with opportunities that discrimination stole from them. Education provides students the opportunity to fulfill their potential and overcome stereotypes and. indeed. discrimination. Frederick Douglass described education as \"the pathway from slavery to freedom.\" The days of slavery have passed. but education still enables young people to take advantage of their faculties and their freedom. The United Negro College Fund achieves this aim by providing support to more minority students and higher institutions than any other organization in the country. Since its founding in 1944. UNCF has helped hundreds of",

Ken has served as the director of the West Virginia Japan Office in Nagoya. which sits in the Aichi Prefecture of Japan. West Virginia has opened trade offices throughout the world in order to encourage economic relationships with our State. The Japan Office has helped draw a number of Japanese businesses to open new locations in West Virginia. as well as helped the businesses already in West Virginia export their products to Japan. In addition to the economic benefits of this relationship. the Japan office has facilitated a number of cultural and educational exchangesall under Kens leadership. In Kens years as director of the West Virginia Japan Office. our State and Japan have seen a dramatic. if not astronomical. rise in their economic relations.

I rise to announce the reintroduction of the Security and Financial Empowerment Act. or as it is better known. the SAFE Act. Domestic violence is a personal and social tragedy that negatively impacts all of our society. On average. every day in our country. more than three women are murdered by their husband or boyfriend. and nearly onethird of American women report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives. The physical and psychological consequences of domestic violence are exacerbated by the less obvious economic consequences. For example. one of the key reasons survivors stay in or return to an abusive environment is because they are financially dependent upon their abuser to provide for them and their children. As a result of the abuse. employed women often lose their jobs due to frequent tardiness or absenteeism or because their abuser stalks and harasses them at work. To help break this cycle of violence.

To receive a scholarship. a student has to be a junior or a senior at a 4year public institution. have at least a 3.0 grade point average. come from a family with an income of $75.000 or less. and be a citizen or a permanent resident alien with no felony conviction. Generally. I am supportive of merit scholarships. and while this particular concept sounds good. it is. duplicative. An almost identical program already exists at the Department of Education. It is called the Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant and is part of the Presidents American Competitiveness Initiative. O] 1800 Therefore. our 2008 budget request for this scholarship program is $1.2 billion. We dont need to add another $281 million scholarship program at another agency that achieves essentially the exact same thing. The other main reason I oppose this amendment is its effect on the bill we just debated. H.R. 362. The driving force between H.R. 362 is to expand the Noyce Scholarship Program for undergraduates to entice them to enter the STEM K12 teaching profession. A requirement for this scholarship is that they give back to society by obligating to teach 2 years for every year of scholarship money they receive. This amendment includes no commitment of any kind from these proposed awardees. What kind of a message are we sending if we require Noyce scholarship recipients to give back to society with a teacher service obligation. when the recipients of scholarships under this amendment have nothing to repay? In addition to the two bills before us today. the Science Committee is also working on NSFs reauthorization. which also includes quite a bit of undergraduate STEM education improvements. I just think the amendment currently before us is not only recreating a scholarship program that is already in existence. but its entirely inappropriate for this legislation we are considering today. I encourage my colleagues to vote against it. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Today we stand at the cusp of new breakthroughs in fields ranging from medicine. to computer technology and renewable energy. Unfortunately. too few of our undergraduates are choosing to enter sciencerelated fields. In order to continue our remarkable record of achievement. we must do a better job of encouraging students to pursue careers in science. mathematics and engineering. This amendment will provide scholarships for science students from low- and moderateincome families. and will help young Americans realize their potential. We have a chance today to open new doors for our children. and we should seize this opportunity. This amendment will benefit students and our Nation.

I also rise in opposition to this amendment. although I would say I would be delighted to support it if we could also be guaranteed that the budget of the National Science Foundation would be increased by another $1 billion. I say that because the National Science Foundation has not been treated well in its budgets over the last 12 or 13 years. It has increased very slowly. We even had a decrease 2 years ago for the first time in many. many years. Its a shame that we have not treated the National Science Foundation adequately. It has hurt our Nation. it has hurt our economy. and we certainly have to improve that situation. We are in a catchup mode. I am reminded of former Speaker Newt Gingrich. who was instrumental in getting the doubling of the National Institutes of Health. who today has told me. and I have heard him tell audiences in speeches a number of times. that he regards one of his great mistakes. perhaps the greatest. the failure to double the National Science Foundation at the same time that we doubled the NIH. Nevertheless. that didnt happen. so we are in a period of poverty for the National Science Foundation. Therefore. I oppose adding a new program. Even though at this point its only $281 million. I am sure it will be a popular program and end up costing well over $1 billion. We simply cannot afford it at this time. I would be happy to consider this proposal at some time in the future if we. in fact. do double the NSF as we hope. But even that will leave us with a skimpy budget there. The other factor is that this program does already exist in the Department of Education. Its a very good program. It has been in operation for several years. I hope that we will keep that in mind. that we will turn down this amendment at this point. and perhaps consider it sometime in the future when we are bound to have an abundance of money at the National Science Foundation.",

Pt. 14 18987 It is my understanding that the underlying Defense Authorization Act has several provisions that are necessary to address shortcomings in the legal process for individuals detained on the battlefield. One of these provisions limits the use of coerced testimony obtained through cruel. inhumane. or degrading treatment. Such testimony is Immoral. and this provision is necessary if we are to obtain and use accurate information. Another provision provides for reasonable counsel and the ability to present relevant information to detainees who have been held for 2 or more years. This is necessary in a war of undetermined duration. Finally. the bill does not provide classified information to a detainee. It provides for a summary that is intended to be unclassified to the counsel for detainees.

The Senator from Virginia may remember that after 9/11. within days. the President came to the Senate and asked us to declare war on alQaida and those responsible for 9/11. The vote was unanimous.

I do recall that very vividly and conducted many hearings in the Armed Services Committee. AlQaida was not high on the scope. There was mention of it. We have to deal with the facts that exist now. and it is clear. for whatever reason. they are now in that area in significant numbers larger than when we went in. I. personally. feel it is not as a consequence of our military action thus far. They simply see the terrific divisions between the Sunni culture and the culture of the Shia. and they are trying to foment among those two venerable religious cultures as much fighting as they possibly can. I think we both have to agree. to that extent. they have been successful. Clearly. alQaida has as its main goal. at such time as possible. to bring about further harm to the United States of America. There is no doubt in my mind. and I am sure there is no doubt in the mind of the Senator from Illinois.

William Penn established the first courts in the county. holding an orphans and common pleas court in Falls Township. Pennsylvania. Twenty five years later. in 1708. Bucks County appointed its first Deputy Attorney General. In 1812 the first \"old\" courthouse was built. followed by the second \"old\" courthouse in 1877. This second courthouse was demolished in 1960 to construct the courthouse we still use today. In 1853. seventeen attorneys formed an organization of legal practitioners. creating the Association of the Bar of Bucks County. The organization was incorporated in 1883 and had grown to 40 members. They worked then. as they do now. to improve the welfare of the judicial system. the courts. the administration of justice and service to the public. Now with more than 700 members. the Bucks County Bar Association has made huge advancements. It now has its own legal journal. the Bucks County Law Report. They also have established a lawyer referral program. Legal Aid Society. and mock trial and law day programs. What once consisted of just 40 members now has 30 committees within the organization. The Bar Association of Bucks County has come a long way since it was incorporated over 100 years ago. Madam Speaker. please join me in celebrating the 125th Anniversary of the Bucks County Bar Association and its service and dedication to the residents and legal professionals of Bucks County.",

The SCMA will celebrate its 150th anniversary on November 11. 2008. Recently discovered documents place the first call to organize the forerunner to the SCMA on April 10. 1858. with the creation of a constitution and bylaws. The group went through at least 2 subsequent reorganizations. the latter being in 1888. which had long been considered by medical historians to be the original founding date of the organization. From 1888 to 1910 the Sonoma County Medical Society. as it was then called. held monthly meetings around such topics as The Emotions in Their Relationship to Disease\" and \"Bubonic Plague: Keeping it Out of Sonoma County.\" In 1906. the association elected its first woman president. Dr. Anabel Stuart. During both World Wars. 29 percent of the medical societys membership served our country in uniform. Since 1951. the SCMA has had only 5 fulltime administrators or executive directors. Josephine Quayle served as \"general helper\" until her retirement in 1963. She was succeeded by Norman Brown. who served from 1960 to 1982. Roger Brown served from 1983 to 1989. followed by Torn Wagner from 1989 to 2000 and Cynthia Melody from 2000 to the present. Over the years. the SCMA has made numerous contributions to the health of Sonoma County. In 1962. the SCMA coordinated a \"Knock Out Polio\" campaign that resulted in 92.3 percent of the countys population being immunized. From the mid1970s to the late 1990s. the SCMA created several other affiliated companies that helped increase medical services to county residents. including the Specialty Physicians Association and the Childrens Health Network. And. in 2000. the SCMA returned to its roots as a selfsustaining. nonprofit county medical association supporting physicians and their efforts to enhance the health of the community. Madam Speaker. the SMCA has a long history of assisting physicians practicing in Sonoma County and of preserving the well being of county residents. It is appropriate that we honor this distinguished organization and its members for their past accomplishments and wish them well as they continue to work on behalf of the physicians and residents of Sonoma County.",

I am pleased that the House recently considered and passed H.R. 6646. a bill that would require the Secretary of State to provide Congress with detailed briefings on any recent discussions conducted between the United States Government and the Government of Taiwan and any potential transfer of defense articles or defense services to the Government of Taiwan. I was proud to cosponsor this legislation. which I hope will end a reported freeze on arms sales to Taiwan. The U.S. and Taiwan have enjoyed a positive economic and political relationship for several decades and it is our duty to make defense articles available to our allies. especially in the Asia Pacific region. The U.S. Taiwan Relations Act states in Section 2(b)(5) that \"it is the policy of the United States to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character.\" The same Act specifies in Section 3(b) that Congress has a role in determining the defensive needs of Taiwan. Furthermore. Section 3(b) also states that any determination \"shall include review by United States military authorities in connection with recommendations to the President and the Congress.\" Yet the administration has not reported any recommendations to Congress nor explained why arms sales to Taiwan have been delayed. Since Taiwans legislature passed its arms budget last year. further inaction by the administration is unnecessary. As twentyfour Members and I wrote in a letter to President Bush on July 31. \"A secure and prosperous Taiwan requires the means to provide for its own self defense and the ability to engage its neighbors without fear of military intimidation.\" If we are serious about Taiwans security. we must continue to permit the judicious sale of defesive weapons to our key ally. H. Res. 6646 provides a framework for maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait by requiring the administration to consult with Congress regarding its arms transfer policy. I applaud the passage of this muchneeded legislation.",

Pt. 17 and individuals. the trip is absolutely free of charge and serves as an excellent tribute to veterans who sacrificed. some paying the ultimate price. in the name of freedom. Started in 2005 by Earl Morse. Honor Right has grown from a small operation. flying a dozen veterans at a time in small private planes. to a network of affiliates that spans 30 States and transports hundreds of veterans to Washington on commercial airliners to see their memorial. On October 8. 2008. the local Honor Flight Affiliate in my hometown of La Crosse. Wisconsin. will be flying some 180 veterans. many of whom reside in my district. to Washington. DC. to visit the World War II memorial. I would like to personally thank Neil Duresky. Chuck Hanson. and Randy Eddy for all their hard work to make this dream a reality for Wisconsin veterans. who served their country so admirably and with such courage. Without Honor Flight. many veterans would never have the opportunity to travel to Washington to see the memorial that was constructed in their honor. Given the enormity of the sacrifice made by those who have served and continue to serve our country with the highest degree of honor and bravery. there is nothing we can do to fully repay them for their efforts. Thanks to Honor Flight. however. we can offer them the chance to visit the memorial dedicated to their service. It is my sincere hope that the actions of Honor Flight inspire others to pause and reflect upon the sacrifices made and effort expended by our men and women in uniform. who are the best in the world. I will continue to honor and pay tribute to those who serve our country for their sense of duty and extraordinary courage.",

Matthew and Melissaall of Old Hickory. Tennesseehave devoted almost 15 years of their lives to the love. care. and support of numerous children from Tennessees foster care system. I greatly admire their service to help provide a home to some of the neediest children in our society. The DePriests stand out as foster parents because of their commitment to medically fragile childrenmany of whom had a very short life expectancy. The devotion and sacrifice this family has made to these special children has been truly above and beyond their call of duty. Due to the specific needs of these children. the family is often required to be specially trained in a variety of medical procedures. Though the level of care needed for these special children has frequently made it difficult for the DePreists to participate in family activities outside the home. they have still remained both willing and passionate about continuing to provide homes and care for many children in Tennessee. The DePriest family has adopted four of the children that they cared for over the years. These children are Zachary. 12. Angel. 5. Heaven. 4. and Savannah. 2. I appreciate all that the DePriest family has done. and thank them for their service. I hope that the DePriest family will continue to love and care for Tennessees children for many years to come.",

At this incredibly low rate of reimbursement. the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC) agrees that a CNM simply cannot afford to provide services to Medicare patients and has supported increasing reimbursement for CNMs. In fact. the Commission recommended in 2002 that CNMs reimbursement be increased and acknowledged that the care provided by these individuals is at least comparable to similar providers. My legislation would make several changes to improve the ability of CNMs and certified midwives (CMs) to effectively serve the Medicareeligible population. First. and most importantly. my bill recognizes the need to increase Medicare reimbursement for CNMs by raising the reimbursement level from 65 percent to 100 percent of the physician fee schedule. CNMs provide the same care as physicians. therefore. it is only fair to reimburse CNMs at the same level. Several states have recognized this in their Medicaid programsapproximately 29 States reimburse at 100 percent of the physician fee schedule for outofhospital services. In addition. the MCARE Act would establish recognition for a certified midwife (CM) to provide services under Medicare. Despite the fact that CNMs and CMs provide the same services. Medicare has yet to recognize CMs as eligible providers. My bill would change this. This bill will enhance access to \"well woman\" care for thousands of women in underserved communities and make several needed changes to improve access to midwives. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. By Mr. GRASSLEY:",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to reintroduce the Congressional Whistieblower Protection Act of 2007. which will extend whistleblower protections currently available to certain executive branch employees to legislative branch employees. Presently. executive branch employees are shielded from retaliation for exposing waste. fraud. or abuse by the Whistleblower Protection Act. The bill Im introducing today simply extends those same protections to legislative branch employees. A theme that has dominated this new Congress. as well as the elections this past November. is accountability and responsibility in Washington. I have fought hard for whistleblowers over the years because they are key in our efforts to ensure government accountability to the people we are sent here to serve. In most instances. the only reason we discover waste or fraud is because employees are brave enough to stand up to the wrongdoers and expose their offenses. Without these whistleblowers. the American taxpayer would continue to foot the bill. The Office of Compliance has called for these changes on numerous occasions in recent years. and they are very supportive of this bill. We have already taken the steps to protect whistleblowers in the executive branch. It doesnt make sense not to extend these same protections to whistleblowers in our own backyard. My bill will. very simply. give congressional employees the same protections that workers in the other branches of government already possess. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill to ensure that those who help us in the fight to hold government accountable are not punished for their efforts. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed In the RECORD.",

February 6. 2007what would be Ronald Reagans 96th birthdayas Ronald Reagan Day. President Ronald Wilson Reagan. a man of humble background. worked throughout his life serving freedom and advancing the public good. having been employed as an entertainer. union leader. corporate spokesman. Governor of California and President of the United States. In 1981. when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated President. he inherited a disillusioned Nation shackled by rampant inflation and high unemployment. During Mr. Reagans presidency he worked in a bipartisan manner to enact his bold agenda of restoring accountability and common sense to government. which led to an unprecedented economic expansion and opportunity for millions of Americans. Mr. Reagans commitment to an active social policy agenda for the Nations children helped lower crime and drug use in our neighborhoods. President Reagans commitment to our armed forces contributed to the restoration of pride in America. in her values and in those cherished by the free world. and prepared Americas Armed Forces to meet 21st Century challenges. President Reagans vision of \"peace through strength\" led to the end of the Cold War and the ultimate demise of the Soviet Union. guaranteeing basic human rights for millions of people. It is entirely appropriate that on February 6. 2007. which will be the 96th anniversary of Ronald Reagans birth. and the third since his passing. we declare February 6th. 2007. to be Ronald Reagan Day and urge all citizens to take cognizance of this event and participate fittingly in its observance.",

I had been urging President Bush and the Senate to adopt the Iraq Study Group recommendations. In my view. what General Petraeus has done since that time has been to adopt the Iraq Study Group recommendations with some amendments. We are acknowledging that it is time to shift the mission from combat to support. province by province. We are acknowledging that there will be a longterm presence of the United States in Iraq. but as General Petraeus said. it is steadily diminishing. We are acknowledging that this is an important stepup in diplomatic and political efforts. As General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker speak today. the questions we should ask are: What progress are we making down this new path to bring this war to a successful conclusion? Second. now that there is widespread agreement that there has been success since last summer with an Americanled military surge. what are the prospects for an Iraqiled political and diplomatic surge. letting the Iraqis invite their neighbors to embassies in Baghdad. reconciling their differences among themselves. and paying for more of their own bills?

This is a very important amendment which would give relief to homeowners with variable rate mortgages where there is foreclosure action. where they suddenly find the monthly payments increased unexpectedly from as much as $1.400 to $1.900. which they cannot afford and then their house goes into foreclosure. The borrowers do not understand that. and frequently there is misrepresentation. fraud. This amendment differs markedly from the Durbin amendment. which was defeated. which would have had a serious impact on the availability of lenders to put up money if there is undue interference with the contractual rights. This amendment protects the homeowners. It does little harm to the fluidity of the availability to get loans.

So the idea was Senator SHELBY and myself were designated by our respective leaders to try to come up with a consensus package of ideas. one Republicans and Democrats. by and large. could support to come out with as a core. and from that other amendments would be offered and added along the way. and if there was consensus. we would try to add those.

These are some very solid ideas. 154. Pt. 4 5323 There are some provisions in the bill. I will be the first to admit. frankly. had I written this all by myself without having to deal with other people who care about some of these issues. I would not have included. This is far more than a crumb in terms of trying to deal with this issue. More needs to be done. but the suggestion somehow that the community development block grants. counseling. disclosure. and modernization of the FHA and raising loan limits and the like are insignificant is to fail to understand what is in this bill. More can be done. I do not disagree. But the suggestion that what we have done falls into that category is a vast exaggeration in terms of what we have been trying to accomplish. and more will be done with this issue as well.",

I think. unanimously of our committee. having had a hearing on itwas probably the right decision. given the alternative of bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and what could have happened on that Monday had the action not been taken by the Fed. the Treasury. and the New York Fed. That is one separate issue. It is a legitimate point to say. shouldnt we do something where we can help out communities and Individuals and to get this economy moving in the right direction. I made that case for a year now. not just in the wake of Bear Stearns. We had our first meetings on this matter in March of last year trying to get something done.

They ought not come to the taxpayers for a bailout. I do recognize the situation with Bear Stearns could have had a domino effect. which could have been devastating. So I dont disagree with that action. I am not going to retreat from my crumb metaphor. but let the record show that on the question to the chairman as to whether there was not substantial imbalance between what has happened with the Fed and what is happening with proposals in the Congress. substantial Imbalance between Wall Street and the Main Street. the chairman did not deny that. did not deal with it.

The Seniors at Deer Park High School and I discussed the skyrocketing costs associated with getting a college education and the ways in which many middle class families on Long Island are put at a critical disadvantagebeing tco rich to qualify for student aid but too poor to pay for college. They shared their personal thoughts and concerns about how theyll pay for college. And they advised me on legislation Im drafting to make college more affordable. Higher education is so importantbut so many parents and students simply cannot afford to pay for college. And many parents and students who find a way to struggle through end up thousands of dollars in debt. Total expenses for public universities (including tuition and fees. room and board. books and supplies. transportation and other expenses) now average $12.796 per year. Total expenses for private universities now average $30.367 per year. And New York has the highest number of subsidized student borrowers in the country. How can the United States compete in the global economy if our young people cannot afford a college education? Weve made a start. In the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress. we passed the College Student Relief Act of 2007. This legislation will make college more affordable and accessible by cutting the interest rate on subsidized student loans for undergraduates in halft over the next five yearsfrom the current 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. In closing. Id like to commend the students at Deer Park High School for all of the hard work and preparation they put into our college affordability hearing and I want to thank them for all of their wonderful suggestions.

That action resulted in a firm water supply for the Arkansas River Basin. providing muchneeded supplemental water to communities which are home to the wonderful people of this region. The Arkansas River Basin includes communities whose livelihoods have always depended on water: farming. ranching. steel manufacturing. small businesses. The economic tide in this region has ebbed and flowed during that 50year period. but its riches lie not in dollars but in its people. The Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District has served the region and people honorably and with diligence. The district works hard to help the Arkansas Valley realize the importance and value of a wellmanaged water supply. Currently. the district is spearheading a plan to at last construct the Arkansas Valley Conduit. originally authorized as part of the FryingpanArkansas Project. The conduit was deemed necessary five decades ago. and the need for clean and safe water supplies for the people of the valley has only increased as water quality is threatened and federally acceptable standards have increased. But the Lower Arkansas Valley. which this project will serve. needs assistance in providing that safe water supply and in meeting those standards. This Arkansas Valley Conduit is a top priority to me as I near the end of my tenure in the Senate. As one of the final components of the FryingpanArkansas Project and as a major goal of the now 50yearold Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District. I congratulate the district on their hard work to make this project feature a reality. and thank them for all they have accomplished in their half century of commitment to the Arkansas Valley.*",

Leigh Anne Gilbert. who recently returned to her hometown of Orlando. has spent the past 3 years establishing the Rainbow Primary Neighborhood School in Masthan Nagar. Hyderabad. India. After her husbands job relocated the couple to an undeveloped part of India. Leigh Anne recognized the need to serve her new community and began work on a school to serve the areas children. Through the support of charitable organizations. Leigh Anne raised the funds necessary to charter and construct the Rainbow Primary Neighborhood School. which now serves more than 300 impoverished children living in the small Indian village. Leigh Anne was responsible for bringing together all those involved in building and operating the schoolthe designers. construction workers. local government. teachers. and staff. She even recruited the services of the Naandi Foundationa worldwide charitable organization fighting poverty and malnourishmen twhich delivers meals to the school and provides the students health care. Work on the school began in early 2007 and it was completed in March of this year. The effort tested Leigh Annes physical and mental fortitude as she worked tirelessly for the past 3 years to bring all the partners to the table. The project required patience. persistence. and cooperation from government officials. community leaders. and charity organizations. On Web posts. Leigh Anne reflected on the project and offered words of advice to those pursuing similar ventures: \"The number one lesson learned: Get partnersrugged. goto. and knowledgeable partnersthen leverage the partnerships to meet needs. None of us can go it alone.\" On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States. I would like to honor Leigh Anne Gilbert for the tremendous example she has set and the good work she has accomplished.*",

I am also pleased to be joined by my good friend. Senator TIM JOHNSON. in this effort. Competitive bidding. while wellintentioned. does not work well for items that must be customized for individuals with complex and specialized needs. Unlike some of the items being considered by CMS for competitive bidding. complex rehab technologies are not the sort of products that are easily interchangeable. For example. individuals with neuromuscular diseasessuch as multiple sclerosis. ALS. cerebral palsy. or Parkinsons diseaseor conditions such as spinal cord injuries may require specialized services because of the profound and sometimes progressive nature of these conditions. Patients access to assistive technology products for their unique needs could be in jeopardy. I am pleased that our legislation has the support of numerous patient advocacy organizations. As cochair of the Senate Parkinsons Caucus. I have seen firsthand how assistive technology can make a difference in helping a loved one achieve independence over a disease or disability.

Speaker PELOSI promised the American people a \"commonsense\" plan to lower gasoline prices. Were still trying to figure out what that plan is. House Democrats have not only failed to offer any meaningful solutions. theyve pushed policies that will have precisely the opposite effect. This $1.33 Pelosi premium is putting tremendous pressure on the budgets of the hardworking people of North Carolina. As gas prices soar to $3.50 and beyond. I pose this question: How much will the Pelosi premium end up costing average Americans? If this is part of the \"commonsense plan\" to lower gas prices. Im afraid it isnt working. Middle class families and their increasingly tight budgets need relief. not more broken promises.

Senator BAUCUS. for including language in H.R. 3221. which this body passed on July 26. to clarify the \"general public use\" requirement relating to the LowIncome Housing Tax Credit Program. That clarification responds to recent Internal Revenue Service guidance to State and local housing credit agencies that has cast a cloud on existing properties and future development targeted to special populations. Since enactment of the Housing Credit Program in 1986. and prior to the recent IRS activity. the general public use requirement was understood to prohibit projects from being (1) rented In a manner inconsistent with HUD housing policies regarding nondiscrimination. (2) rented to members of a social organization or to employees of specific employers. or (3) part of a hospital. nursing home. sanitarium. lifecare facility. trailer park. or intermediate care facility for the mentally or physically disabled. This understanding has resulted in numerous section 42 housing projects being developed nationwide that target certain populations. including. for example. veterans. farm workers. first responders. teachers. artists. lowincome parents attending college. pregnant or parenting teens. and domestic abuse victims. In my home State of New Mexico. the Housing Credit Program has been essential to the construction of housing for many lowincome individuals. including housing that is specifically targeted toward farm workers. Among our great success stories is the Franklin Vista development in Anthony. NM. Units already in service at Franklin Vista are targeted specifically for farm worker housing. The current phase 7. now underway. would create an additional 24 units of farm worker housing.",

The IRS action has been particularly problematic for State efforts to deal with the critical need increase the supply of safe. decent. and affordable housing for migrant and seasonal farm workers. About 10 years ago. Washington established a Farm Worker Housing Program that has led to the creation and preservation of over 1.065 units of permanent housing for farm workers. The IRSs recent position has not only threatened future development of such housing but could potentially result in the recapture of lowincome housing tax credits for such units currently in existence. potentially bringing financial ruin to the nonprofit housing providers which have developed and operate this housing. The language in the bill that this body passed on July 26 on general public use reflects Congresss comfort with the historical application of the general public use requirement prior to the IRSs recent activities. and Congresss intent to remove the uncertainty and risk that the IRSs recent activities have created for the section 42 program.",

Dels fascination with agriculture began as a small boy. He spent his summers helping ranchers in the community of Guernsey. WY. As the director of the Wyoming Office of USDA Rural Development. Dels enthusiasm for agriculture has become a lifelong career dedicated to Wyomings farmers and ranchers. Dels boyhood summers on the ranch soon developed into a successful tenure selling advertising for the Wyoming StockmanFarmer. In 1990. Del went to work building the newly established Wyoming Livestock Roundup from a little known publication to the musthave newspaper for every major implement dealer and livestock auction in the State. As director of the Rural Development office of the USDA. Del has successfully encouraged renewable energy development and business diversification within Wyomings agricultural industry. Over the years. Del has been a voice of wisdom for Wyomings farming and ranching communities. I am pleased to honor Mr. Del Tinsley on the Senate floor today. Del is a true steward of the land. Del continues to uphold the Wyoming heritage of farming and ranching.",

The city of Albany. formerly known as Ocean View. was incorporated as Ocean View in September 1908. In 1909. voters changed the name of the city to Albany in honor of the birthplace of the citys first mayor. Frank Roberts. This year. we celebrate its centennial anniversary. Wellrecognized for its prominent landmark. Albany Hill. the city of Albany has charmed residents and visitors alike for decades. Situated on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay in northern Alameda County. Albanys waterfront has undergone significant changes over the last 100 years. From the renovation of the Albany Bulb to the citys involvement In Eastshore State Park. the city of Albany has taken dramatic steps to promote a greener. more sustainable city. These efforts were rewarded in 2008 when Albany was named one of Californias greenest cities. Solano Avenue. the principal shopping street in Albany. traverses the city from east to west. while San Pablo Avenue. its other major commercial street. runs north to south. These two streets account for the majority of commerce in the city. Solano Avenue Is also host to the annual Solano Stroll. which is held on the second Sunday of every September. This event began in 1974 and has since been designated by the Library of Congress as a National Local Legacy. Another local landmark to be found in Albany is Golden Gate Fields. the only horse racing track in the San Francisco Bay Area. I congratulate the city of Albany on this special occasion of its 100th birthday and salute its wonderful community spirit.*",

The story about the city of Kingsburg. like many other communities throughout the San Joaquin Valley. can be traced to its fertile soils. Mediterranean climate. and industrious population. In the early 1870s. the lure of a better and more stable life prompted two Swedish natives to settle in a Central Pacific Railroad town called Kings River Switch. In 1874. the site for the presentday town site was drawn up and the name was changed to Kingsbury. Two years later. the name was changed to Kingsburgh to reflect the Swedish heritage of many of the towns residents. In 1894. the citys name took on its current spelling. Kingsburg. On May 19. 1908. the city of Kingsburg officially became an incorporated city in Fresno County. The city of Kingsburg has grown from a sleepy railroad town. at its founding. to a vibrant community of nearly 10.000 that rests in the middle of one of the most dynamic regions of California. Kingsburg is where Olympic legend Rafer Johnson and his brother. Pro Football Hall of Famer. Jimmy Johnson. spent their formative years and honed their athletic skills. Today the city of Kingsburg proudly embraces it Swedish heritage and its status as the \"Swedish Village.\" The citys landscape features distinctive Swedish architecture and brightly painted Dala horses. traditional wooden statuettes of horses and a national symbol of Sweden. If its first century is any indication. it is clear that the city of Kingsburg will continue to grow and reach new heights in the years to come. The story of the citys first one hundred years is a testament to the value of community. As the residents of Kingsburg gather to celebrate this auspicious occasion. I congratulate them on their centennial anniversary and wish them continued good fortune and success.*",

Chairman GORDON and Chairman WU for their hard work on this timely legislation. Madam Chairman. in many cities and towns across the country. business incubators provide a valuable service. They help young businesses survive and grow. They provide guidance. business tools. space. contacts. and the knowhow to run a company. Incubators can dramatically increase the success of new companies. Across the United States. incubators have already nurtured tens of thousands of new companies to great success. Their efforts have helped grow our economy and create both jobs and profit. In these challenging economic times. a good idea is often not enough to guarantee success. Many young companies need further business expertise in order to avoid failing. In my hometown of Sacramento. the CleanStart incubator is helping grow a whole suite of clean energy companies. These businesses are developing the cuttingedge technologies that will power our economy and protect our environment in the future. However. many businesses receiving SBIR grants devote most of their capital to research. This leaves little left over for business development. These are the type of businesses that can benefit most from the services provided by incubators. My amendment ensures that SBIR dollars will continue to work with incubators across the country to drive economic development. It will allow incubators to do what they do best. translate good research conducted by small businesses into commercial technologies that create jobs and economic growth.

This amendment would require agencies that administer Small Business Innovation Research Programs to give special consideration to pressing transportation and infrastructure research activities when reviewing grant applications. The devastating state of this Nations crumbling infrastructure was demonstrated in dramatic fashion last August when the 135 bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River. And it is also demonstrated every day as people drive over potholes in their neighborhoods and sit in traffic jams on our crowded highways as they travel to and from work. Tackling the repair of our Nations infrastructure is not a glamorous task. but it is absolutely essential to our Nations longterm success. Investments in infrastructure are critical for public safety and boost local economies by providing more Americans with goodpaying jobs. Building our Nations infrastructure for a new economy and a new century is vital to revamping our work force and revitalizing our communities. It is also crucial that as we rebuild our roads and mass transit systems. we act as stewards of the environment and seek greener and cleaner technologies for fueling our economy. Americas working families deserve creative and innovative thinking and policies from us as their representatives.

Madam Chairman. 3 million veteran business owners responded to the 2002 survey of business owners administered through the U.S. Census Bureau.

NCIS. is an international notforprofit organization representing the interests of more than 60 crop insurance companies. Representatives of NCIS recently shared the results of an independent study of the Federal crop insurance program compared to the Property & Casualty. P&C. insurance industry for the period of 19922006. Key findings include: The Federal crop insurance program is not as profitable as the P&C industry and writing Federal crop insurance entails greater risk. under the current standard reinsurance agreement. SRA. which is the contractual agreement between USDA and approved insurance providers for delivering the program. A&O reimbursements continue to be below actual Federal crop insurance expenses incurred by private insurers. Although the latter finding indicates crop insurance companies costs are not fully covered by the Federal Government. the committeeapproved bill contains an A&O reduction of 2 percentage points below the rates currently in effect for policies except in a State in a year in which the loss ratio is above 1.2. The policy basis for this was to answer criticisms concerning costs of A&O reimbursements while providing an exception in cases where loss adjustments and claims processing will be much greater. We believe this is a balanced approach to reducing A&O expenditures. The crop insurance industry and the crop insurance program make a significant financial contribution in the committeeapproved bill. but not to the detriment of the delivery system as under Senator LUGARS amendment. While there are parallels between conservation provisions in this bill and those in the committee bill. there are important differences. The committee bill is more comprehensive and incorporates important new emphases on forestry. specialty and organic production. wildlife. and pollinators. among others.

The need for onthefarm drought management has become increasingly evident as farmers and the goverment struggle to keep ahead of the effects of Mother Nature. The drought conditions for the 2005 and 2006 crop years underscored the devastating toll natural disasters have on our Nations farmers and ranchers. The current approach ot providing ad hoc disaster assistance is inadequate and does not give farmers the certainty they need. The Farm Reservoir Act would provide costshare assistance to agricultural producers for the construction of small reservoirs on their farms. By combining sound planning with the right resources. agricultural producers can reduce the impact droughts have on their operations. Small onfarm storage reservoirs are an economical way to save water for summer use. The collection and storage of surface water during the offseason. when rainfall and stream levels are typically high. can make irrigation possible in areas where direct pumping from streams. lakes. or wells during the growing season is not feasible. Because these reservoirs are small. the engineering and Construction cost per acrefoot are less than big onstream reservoirs. Additionally. they are more acceptable from an environmental perspective. because they are ottstream and do not block streams or disturb riverine habitats. In addition to protecting our Nations farmers from the costly effects of drought. enhancing their irrigation capacity will allow our farmers to expand production to more acres and increase the productivity of existing acres. Costshare assistance to construct small. environmentallyfriendly. reservoirs located on the farm will provide us with the tools necessary to grow additional biofuel crops. which will allow us to wean ourselves from foreign oil. This will reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the availability of the cleaner burning fuels these crops produce.",

Sr.. who was recently honored with the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service and sacrifice in defense of our great country during Worid War II. Sgt. Speed and the entire B24 crew: 1st Lt. James E. Jatho. 1st Lt. Edward L. McNally. 2nd Lt. George N. Croft. 2nd Lt. Theodore D. Bell. Technical Sgt. Jay T. Fish. Technical Sgt. William A. Magill. Staff Sgt. Frank G. Celuck. Staff Sgt. William F. Maxson. Jr.. and Staff Sgt. Daniel P. Toomey distinguished themselves by extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial combat on July 15. 1944. The B24 crew in the 779th Bomb Squadron. 464th Bomber Group. 15th Air Force took off from Pantanella. Italy. to take part in what was to become the heaviest day of bombing the oil refineries near Ploesti. Romania. The crew encountered heavy antiaircraft fi reseverely damaging the plane--nd causing the loss of one engine. Sgt. Speed. a gunner on the B24 Liberator. courageously manned his gun position and remained at his station throughout the remainder of the flight. which went deep into enemy territory. The mission was successfulthe Uniera Sperantza oil refinery and enemy refining capacity were heavily damaged. The day following this mission. the crew continued to demonstrate courage and devotion to duty when it took part in a raid on Weiner Neusdorf. Austria. During this mission. their plane was shot down. and Sgt. Magill was killed in action. The surviving crew members were captured and taken as prisoners of war and held for the remainder of the war. Almost 63 years later. the nine surviving members of the crew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Madam Speaker. the life and actions of Sgt. Speed personify the very best America has to offer. I feel certain his many friends and family. as well as his comrades in the United States Army. are taking this opportunity to remember his many accomplishments. I urge my colleagues to take a moment and pay tribute to Sgt. Robert Speed and his selfless devotion to our country and the freedom we enjoy. Make no mistake. Robert Speed is a true American hero.",

A 13yearold gets off a school bus near his home in rural Missouri but never makes it home. The local sheriffs office works frantically to locate the missing boy but has few leads. That was the real life saga for Ben Ownbys family last week near Beaufort. Missouri. in my congressional district. Last Monday. January 8. after a normal day at school William Ben Ownby rode the bus to school. He got off and disappeared. The wrenching news energized the local community. Volunteers turned out in droves to assist law enforcement and to search the nearby woods. Friends and neighbors began prayer chains and offered moral support to Bens family. Police officers and sheriffs deputies from surrounding counties lent their assistance. Fortunately the single lead provided by 14yearold Mitchell Hults was a good one. Mitchell had gotten off the school bus with Ben and described having seen a beatup white Nissan pickup truck with a camper shell. even describing the trailer hitch to a T.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. the President began talking about going to war with Iraq. In the fall of 2002. with the midterm elections heating up. the President increasingly talked about the threat Iraq poses to the United States and its allies. On October 10. 2002. the House voted on H.J. Res. 114. the Authorization For Use of Military Force Against Iraq resolution. It passed the House by a vote of 296133: 215 Republicans voted for the resolution. 6 voted against it. 81 Democrats voted for it. and 126 voted against it. Madam Speaker. in light of what many of our Members know today. they perhaps would not have voted for that resolution. As a matter of fact. day in and day out as I talk with my colleagues. they recount all of that which was told to us by the President of the United States and others on the opposite side of the aisle. for the most part. about why it was so important to go to war with Iraq. They told us there were weapons of mass destruction. They told us that the troop levels that they were sending were necessary. They told us about the cost of the war. They told us that oil revenues would be paying for the reconstruction. They told us we would be greeted as liberators. They told us we would be able to contain sectarian violence. . Well. Madam Speaker. I have colleagues that are here this evening who will recount perhaps some of what they were being told and the way they trusted the Commander in Chief. they trusted our President. They were concerned about the safety and the security of our Nation. So we have with us tonight some of the brightest. most hardworking. most respected Members of the Congress of the United States. They are going to remind us of what we were being told and how they came to their decision and what they are thinking now. Leading that discussion will be my dear friend from Missouri. that is my hometown. my birthplace. who I have gotten to know very well.

What we are doing is recapping much of what took place in the Energy Act of 2005. and in that act. the $8 billion that was set aside and designated for alternative fuels development. the reason that was done was because the Republican House leadership knew and the Senate agreed and the President agreed that beginning some alternative fuels development was very. very important. It was something that needed to be done. Great ideas needed to be brought to the table. I think what the gentleman is saying is so very significant. and I want to highlight it because I appreciate so much the fact that you are bringing it forward. that whether you are looking at the blended fuels and ethanol and biodiesel. all of that is coming on line.

We make promises to our young men and women who serve in the military that we will watch out for them. that we will take care of them. But like the gentleman says. we also make written contracts and written agreements. In this bill today. we have undermined the contracting process.

This is such a very serious step. It is a step that other Nations take very easily and yet is so significant. and yet this major step. this change in American policy was done without one single committee hearing. This bill that was in front of us today. H.R. 6. should have gone to four different committees. Instead. it went to none. not one committee hearing. and there were new provisions in this bill. There were new people on the floor who were elected just this year who have not heard the old provisions. I do not disagree with my colleagues who wanted to make us energy independent. but they failed in that task. and in the process. they have begun to undermine the confidence of this great Nation and the great reputation it has for treating fairly those people who invest and those people who trust the government. Who else will be undercut by actions from the floor of this House and the Democrat majority that is willing to take any step to try to enforce a new standard while declaring it to be a new way? Instead. it is an old. tried way that many other Nations have tried in the past. It is unfortunate to see now this Congress and this majority taking steps that Russia or Bolivia might have taken.

The program was created to ensure that all students start the school day with a nutritious breakfast and enter the classroom ready to learn. Over the last five decades. the National School Breakfast Program has continued to grow. It now operates in nearly 84.000 public and nonprofit schools and residential care institutions nationwide.

We must ensure that schools have the resources necessary to provide each student the nourishment necessary to get them through their day. With over 8.1 million students participating in the school breakfast program. schools recognize the benefits of making sure that all children have a healthy breakfast to start their day. however. there are still many students not at the table and their academic progress may be suffering. It has been shown that school breakfast programs have led to a drastic reduction in school tardiness and provide students with the vital nutrients they need for remaining attentive in class and processing the information. They receive. We can simultaneously improve the physical wellbeing of our students while also improving their performance in the classroom. The National School Breakfast Program provides students with the healthy start to the day that they need to succeed.

Res. 1013 Expressing the sense of the Congress that providing breakfast in schools through the National School Breakfast Program has a positive impact on classroom performance. Research shows that eating breakfast affects a childs overall performance during school. A nutritious breakfast provides students with the energy needed to start the day. Students who eat breakfast before school do not face hunger symptoms such as headache. fatigue. sleepiness and restlessness. In turn eating breakfast helps students to think faster when doing school. work and respond more clearly to teacher questions. A good balanced breakfast has been linked to causing an increase in mental performance. helping to keep students from \"drifting\" during class. causing them to be calmer and less anxious. Those are things that are important for success in class. Studies also show that eating a solid breakfast is a major way to fight child obesity. Because this is an easy way to fight obesity breakfast helps not only in the area of health but in academics as well. It is hard for our children to have their minds on school when their stomachs are empty.

    "speech": "I thank the gentlelady from Florida for making this time available. My father was a physician. After being a pediatrician for many years. he chose to change his specialty and go into psychiatry. and then child adolescent psychiatry. As a result of that. I was exposed to mental health issues and mental health treatment and the need for mental health professionals throughout this country. There has been a misconception In this country about people needing mental health treatment and their being adequately covered by insurance. In the same way that a physical Illness affects people. mental illnesses do. And mental health treatment has been woefully undercovered and underserved. people who suffer from that in our country. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill and to join with the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from Rhode Island who brought the bill and other cosponsors. because I think it shows that this Congress understands that mental health treatment needs to be covered. that diseases of the mind are similar to diseases of the body. the effect they can have on a persons overall wellbeing. but that their mental health and their physical health are also intertwined. and if mental health is not treated. physical health Is affected. We need to be concerned about all of our fellow citizens. our brothers and sisters who might suffer from any illness. And its time that we came out from the cloak of an ancient time when we looked upon mental health treatment as something to be shunned. to be embarrassed about if it was somebody in our families. our friends. or even ourselves. And so I wholeheartedly endorse this bill and feel that the passage of this bill will be a great day for Americans and for science.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in addition to the concerns that I raised earlier regarding the provisions of the mental health parity bill. that it will actually decrease mental health coverage and increase health insurance costs. let me share several additional concerns I have with the Genetic Information NonDiscrimination Act that was inserted late last night. Title I of the GINA legislation imposes Federal mandates on health plans regarding insurance coverage. while title II imposes mandates on employers regarding employment and related hiring decisions. However. there is no explicit language in this legislation clarifying that group health insurance plan sponsors may not be subjected to the more expansive remedies provided by title II. Why is that a problem? Because title II provides for rulemaking by the EEOC. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. and remedies before the EEOC and. ultimately. Federal courts. During floor debate on H.R. 493. Congressman ROB ANDREWS suggested that \"employers. including to the extent employers control or direct benefit plans. are subject to the requirements of title II of this bill.\" including the much broader definition of genetic testing and tougher penalties associated with that title. I believe that this lack of clarity could and will lead to additional lawsuits through the use of broader remedies available in title II that are intended to be reserved for employers who violate their employees civil rights. not for employees seeking to litigate group health plan disputes. Further. section 502 of ERISA says that all lawsuits must go through Federal court. which is not addressed in the mental health parity legislation. Nothing in this bill states that section 502 is preserved. so lawsuits can and will be brought in State court. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to go through just a list of some things that this bill will do. Its going to increase health care costs. CBO estimates that H.R. 1424 would impose mandates on private insurance companies. a total of $3 billion annually by 2012. These costs will ultimately be borne by employers offering health insurance and employees seeking to obtain coverage. Number two. it will increase the cost of business due to private sector mandates. The bill contains multiple new Federal mandates on the private sector. affecting the design and structure of health insurance plans. The bill also increases the threshold level at which employees suffering Increased claim costs as a result of implementing the new Federal mandates can claim an exemption from the provisions of H.R. 1424. Number three. I think this will decrease the mental health coverage. While the bill imposes several new Federal mandates on those employers who choose to offer mental health coverage. there is nothing in H.R. 1424 that would require plans to cover these conditions. Thus H.R. 1424 could have the perverse effect of actually decreasing mental health coverage by encouraging an employee who Is frustrated with the bills onerous burdens to drop mental health insurance altogether. Four. I think it will increase the number of uninsured. It will erode the Federal preemption for employers. This codification of treatment mandate for health plans. they are going to use DSMIV to codify that. And this book. DSMIV. was generated for physicians to use just to be able to classify mental health. It has a whole lot of things in here that most employers would not want to cover. It will increase an intergovernmental mandate. It is a violation of UMRA. It has a lack of conscience clause. and it has a lack of medical management tools.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. She makes the point that this physician selfreferral provision in the bill actually serves two purposes. On the one hand. it is about half of the payfor for the cost of the legislation. The physicians selfreferral basically generates about $2.4 billion over 10 years. which is about half of the payfor in this bill. But beyond that. in addressing the gentleman from Washingtons concerns. it is actually a good thing. It is a good government proposal. And what it does. it ends the ability of physicians to selfrefer to a hospital in which they have ownership. This change Is consistent with the original intent of the physicians selfreferral laws. The loophole for whole hospital ownership was only there because of tiny rural hospitals that were then owned by one doctor who practiced there. Now that structure is no longer commonplace and that is why the hospital associations all endorse our bill. The bill does provide a grandfather for hospitals that currently have physician ownership and had a provider agreement with Medicare as of July 2007. the. date of introduction of the bill. Within 18 months of enactment. they need to meet a standard that no physician owned more than 2 percent of the facility individually and that aggregate physician ownership was 40 percent or less. So it is possible for the hospital in the State of Washington to reconfigure and meet this provision. But I just want to understand why we are doing this. These physicianowned hospitals essentially are a problem because they are being overutilized. There is overutilization. In other words. physicians are referring patients to these hospitals in many cases for unnecessary procedures. The reason why CBO scores this and uses it as a payfor Is because we know that these unnecessary procedures or overutilization takes place and is not basically a good thing. So we are trying to end this practice of selfreferral. We are not completely precluding a hospital from reconfiguring itself and staying open. but. generally speaking. we need to end the practice.",

I strongly believe that we must continue creating positive and effective support systems for our children so that they will become healthy. productive citizens. To do this. we must ensure that all of our children have access to quality education and healthcare. We must also give quality time to our children. Mr. Speaker. National Children and Families Day encourages parents to spend time with their children and to spend time together around the dinner table. Our young children are increasingly facing monumental challenges such as drug and alcohol addiction. pregnancy. depression. and obesity. We must invest the time and money in the necessary resources needed to help our children combat these challenges. I recently hosted a briefing. \"Childhood Obesity: Factors that are Impacting the Disproportionate Prevalence in LowIncome and Minority Communities.\" to discuss the causes of. and search for solutions to the childhood obesity epidemic. Eating dinner at the dinner table with parents is one of the suggested ways children may develop healthier eating habits. According to research by The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University. the more often children eat dinner with their families. the less likely they are to smoke. drink or use drugs. The research suggested that the conversations that go handinhand with dinner will help parents leam more about their childrens lives and better understand the challenges they face. Mr. Speaker.

Leo McCarthy certainly was at the top rank of those leaders. I first met Leo McCarthy when he and I were elected to the State legislature together. We were classmates and colleagues and friends. A supervisor and assemblyman. became Speaker of the House. Lieutenant Governor of our State. a magnificent leader who absolutely wallowed in the business of public policy. He cared about making a difference on a number of issues across the spectrum of those issues that impact peoples lives.

Leo McCarthy was Speaker when I was first elected to the State Assembly in 1978. Those were heady days in California. and Speaker McCarthy had a contentious caucus that he had to work with among younger members who thought that they oftentimes knew better. But I can tell you that from the lessons I learned firsthand from Speaker McCarthy. later to be our Lieutenant Governor. was that of being a quintessential legislator. He believed in process. he believed in transparency. he believed in accountability. and he believed in working in bipartisan fashions to solve problems for people of California. And because of those facts. Leo McCarthys speakership was successful. I was part of a group that ended up in what often happens within political families. a difficult speakership fight. and I chose for various reasons not to support Speaker McCarthy. Nonetheless. we travailed for over a year. During that entire time. Leo maintained class and maintained dignity and attempted to still reach out and bring the caucus back together.

I came to Sacramento as a State assemblyman. elected in 1972. began my service in 1973. and had never known Leo McCarthy or met him before that time. Already in the California Assembly. a speakership fight was brewing between Leo McCarthy and sort of the favored candidate over the vacancy which would occur when the Speaker at that time was planning to run for Governor and would be giving up his seat. In the course of the year and a half between the time I came to Sacramento and the time that I voted for Speaker. I got to know someone who was particularly unique in terms of public office and public service. I would say three words characterize the service of Leo McCarthy In all aspects of his public career and. I think. of his personal life: probity. energy. and a tremendous level of integrity. This was a very unusual public servant. He cared deeply about the public interest. about policy. about learning what needed to be known to be effective and advocating for policies. about building legislative consensus. and about making things happen. During the 5 years that he was Speaker in the State Assembly. I had the honor of being for 4 of those 5 years his majority floor leader. The end of our legislative careers wasnt quite as good as the start of it because we ended up in a speakership fight that got rather out of control and 11 months of battle. I think of speakership fights in California as war by other means. and that is what we had during that time. And. unfortunately. after that time while our relationship was civil and friendly. it was never as close as it was before. I have never met anybody who made his fundamental decisions on what legislation to prioritize. what to push based on a focus on the public interest without regard to what a particular lobbyist or a particular specialist might push. with a level of integrity and with a level of energy. it has already been referenced in terms of his career. that was really unique in public office.

The shock of Leo McCarthy dying is that he never looked old. never seemed old. He always had the energy of youth. looked young. and just was a remarkable person. He twice ran for the United States Senate.

Leo was born in Auckland. New Zealand. and I remember going on a trip to Auckland. New Zealand with him. He was welcomed home as a town hero.

Sweig entitled \"Fidels Final Victory.\" Dr. Sweigs article analyzes the reality of the current relationship between the U.S. and Cuba and advocates the lifting of the embargo as a means to a more eiective advance U.S. interest in establishing an economic relationship with Cuba. I have long opposed U.S. policy towards Fidel Castro and Cuba. specifically the embargo. as I strongly believe that restricting travel and trade is a failed policy that hinders the American People from competing in the Cuban market and works against the promotion of democracy on the island. It also denies citizens of the United States the fundamental right and freedom to travel where they want and denies Cuban Americans to visit their relatives living in Cuba. Current United States policy toward Cuba is markedly out of touch with current world realities. Almost every nation has normal trade and diplomatic relations with Cuba. especially many of our allies such as Israel. Spain. China and other European nations. Instead of collapsing. the Cuban economy is growing at a rate of 8 percent a year. and the govemment has new and profitable relationship involving crude oil drilling operations off of the Cuban coast with China in conjunction with India. Norway and Spain. It is evident that continuing the current course and making threats about what kind of change is and is not acceptable after Fidel. the Bush administration will only slow the pace of liberalization and political reform in Cuba. guaranteeing many more years of hostility between the two countries. The best approach to dealing with postFidel Cuba is by immediately proposing bilateral crisis management and confidencebuilding measures. ending economic sanctions. and by stepping out of the way of Cuban Americans and other Americans who wish to travel freely to Cuba. Further. lifting the embargo now will prevent American businesses from falling even further behind as foreign competitors in this market. I urge you to consider H.R. 624. a bill to lift the trade embargo on Cuba and for other purposes. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 153. Pt. 3",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to call attention to a gathering storm in our own backyard. Last week. Venezuelas selfproclaimed Communist President Hugo Chavez was granted free rein to accelerate changes in all areas of society by presidential decree. This action. granted to him by the National Assembly. which is completely under his control. is putting Venezuela on a rapid path toward dictatorship. Venezuelan lawmakers unanimously gave President Chavez sweeping powers to legislate by decree and impose his radical vision of a socialist state in the mold of Castros Cuba. The new law gives Chavez more power than he has ever had in 8 years as president. And. based upon his own words and statements. he plans to use this power to nationalize many privately held companies. snuff out political dissent. and remove term limits. thereby allowing him to serve indefinitely as president. Madam Speaker. some of my colleagues on both the left and the right argue that Chavez was democratically elected and that he and his quest for his Bolivarian Revolution are no threat to the Westem Hemisphere. For example. last week in response to the new law. Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Tom Shannon said. and I quote from an interview with the Associated Press. \"the enabling law isnt anything new in Venezuela. Its something valid under the constitution. As with any tool of democracy. it depends how it is used. At the end of the day. its not a question for the United States or for other countries. but for Venezuela.\" But I vehemently disagree with this statement and the handsoffapproachtoChavez sentiment. The mere holding of elections is not enough. Venezuela with Chavez at the helm is on a glidepath towards a dictatorship disguised as a democracy. Madam Speaker. we should all be concerned about the direction President Chavez is taking his country. Any leader who tries to tighten his grip on power by destroying the institutions of democracy. curtailing press freedom. and using his office to intimidate prodemocracy opponents is setting in motion a dangerous process with potentially ominous consequences. During almost every speech Chavez gives. he says it is \"socialism or death.\" Madam Speaker. it is time to realize Chavez must be taken seriously. We must refocus our efforts in Latin America and defeat this gathering storm.",

Herman would continue his efforts to improve and reform education policy after leaving the U.S. Department of Education. In 1985.

The Presque Isle Light Station Act requires the return of the historic third order Fresnel lens to the lighthouse in Presque Isle. MI. The lens was removed four years ago for restoration work. but now it is time to replace it and preserve the historic integrity of the beautiful Presque Isle lighthouse. Michigan has more lighthouses than any other State. Not only are these historic structures symbolic of our maritime heritage. they are the heart of Michigans coastal communities. Lighthouses are a key part of the tourist economy of many small Michigan towns. and the historic character of our lighthouses brings tourists from all over the country. So it is imperative that we protect. restore. and preserve the Presque Isle lighthouse and all of Michigans 120 lighthouses. I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator LEVIN. In the House of Representatives. Congressman STUPAK is the sponsor of a companion bill. So the Michigan delegation is united in our resolve to restore the Fresnel lens to the Presque Isle lighthouse for the enjoyment and education of future generations. Finally. I want to say a word about the man for whom we have named this bill: Lester Nichols. Without Les Nichols dedication we would never have been able to restore Presque Isles Fresnel lens. Last fall. Les lost his courageous battle against cancer. He was a pillar of his community. He was passionate about the Presque Isle lighthouse and he will be truly missed. Naming this bill for him Is the least we can do to show our gratitude for all of his work. And I hope that we will soon be able to put the Fresnel lens back in the lighthouse and give Les the victory that he so wanted to see. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.",

We need to combine these two values. selfreliance on the one hand and community on the other. by rewarding work and making work pay. We send a message every day to our citizens and our workers that we value work and that government has a role to play in ensuring opportunity to everyone willing to contribute. It is time we matched that message with our own leadership. It is no accident that in Vermont and more than 20 States around the country. Republicans and Democrats. working together. have led in the effort to reward work with a reasonable minimum wage above our national minimum last set nearly a decade ago. There are few more important tasks before us than addressing the growing economic gap between Americas wealthiest citizens and low income workers. Last year. millionaires were given tax breaks that put an average of $40.000 in their pockets. and yet middle class workers who earn less than $20.000 received just two dollars. Two dollarsfor the whole year. That is rewarding wealth rather than work. Today a fulltime minimum wage worker earns just $10.712 annuallymore than $2.000 below the poverty line for a family of two.

Mr. Speaker. today the House will vote for bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing the minimum wage and making an important change for the families of nearly 13 million American workers.

Energy. health care and education costs have all risen. while my constituents have seen their real incomes drop. It is wrong that millions of Americans work full time and year around and still live in poverty. I am voting to give them a raise. a raise that is long overdue.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the minimum wage increase. Not only is this legislation detrimental to small business growth and job creation. but it has been brought to the floor outside the normal committee review process without the ability to consider an alternative. I have long stood against minimum wage hikes. which increase government interference in the labor market. Economists agree that when the cost of labor increases. it becomes more difficult for employers to hire new workers. Unfortunately. the burden of wage increases falls on small businesses which produce an estimated twothirds of all new jobs in the United States. Minimum wage job seekers. often firsttime employees looking to get their foot in the door. are most harmed by such increases. It is troubling that this bill gives no thought to softening the financial impact of our engines of new job growth when we could easily combine a wage increase with tax relief to help small businesses stay competitive and keep our economy growing. One provision not included in the minimum wage bill would extend small businesses expensing. Over the last few years. Congress has increased the expensing limit which allows firms to write off equipment purchases immediately. This allows small businesses to expand faster and hire new workers. I continue to support a permanent extension of this provision. Without extension. expensing will soon revert from its current $100.000 back to $25.000. Other relief not permitted in this is the elimination of the unnecessary 2 percent unemployment surtax. 1 joined my friend Jim MCCRERY in the 109th Congress to end the surtax and stimulate job creation and higher wages for those same workers who might lose jobs due to a minimum wage hike. Finally. discounting relief from the 41 percent minimum wage increase. the bill ignores other side effects. such as impacts on the workfare participants. Current law determines how long welfare beneficiaries may participate in workfare. which helps recipients develop good work habits. As the minimum wage rises. recipients have access to less work. even if that is what they most need to prepare for a new job. Mr. Speaker. by dismissing alternatives. the majority has generated a bill whose benefits to the American workers will be negligible. side effects real. and impacts on job creation palpable. I urge my colleagues to reject this measure.",

Mr. Speaker. the majority of these Americans are women and most of them have children. They put in a full 40hour work week. They still live below the poverty line. This is absolutely unacceptable. because in a prosperous Nation like ours it should be a violation of a persons civil rights not to provide adequate compensation for their work.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise to oppose this political effort to fix prices. Dr. Milton Friedman spoke on this issue 31 years ago. He noted that the proponents of increasing the minimum wage are wellmeaning dogooders. but they are playing politics with peoples futures. These ideas always have two groups of sponsors. the wellmeaning dogooders and the special interests who are using the dogooders as front men. Since there is absolutely no positive objective achieved by a minimum wage other than costing beginning workers their jobs. the real purpose is to reduce competition for unions so that it is easier to maintain the wages of their privileged members higher than the others. The minimum wage says that employers must discriminate against those with low skills. If you have a job that is worth $5 an hour. you may not employ that person. It is illegal. So who pays? The 1981 Minimum Wage Study Commission concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduced teenage employment by 1 to 3 percent. From 1981 to 1990. the minimum wage did not rise. and teen unemployment fell from 25 percent to 15 percent. After the 1990 increase. teen unemployment rose to more than 20 percent. The 46 percent rise between 1977 and 1981 cost 644.000 jobs among teens alone. Who else pays? Small business. A small business with five minimum wage positions would face more than $21.000 in additional wage costs. That does not include increases in payroll and unemployment taxes nor wage demands from other employees looking to stay ahead of the minimum wage. For many businesses. small businesses. a higher minimum wage simply equates to a major tax hike. That is what this is.",

For the past 9 years. Americas working families have not received a pay raise. Today. minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week. 52 weeks a year. earn $5.000 below the poverty level for a family of three. How can we allow so many hardworking families to live in poverty? Increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour will give our working families an additional $4.400 a year. This will help them meet critical needs such as rent. health care. child care. and food. I urge all Members to please support this legislation. In this 110th Congress. we must reaffirm the American Dream that rewards hard work with good pay and the opportunity to support strong and healthy families.

As 53. Pt. 1 757 someone who worked 10 years ago for the last increase for the minimum wage. working very closely with my then colleague Mr. Quinn of Buffalo. we were able to achieve that. Today. we have an opportunity to raise the minimum wage. but because of the procedural restrictions we face on the floor some are going to be left behind and that Is particularly disappointing. While H.R. 2 will provide a $2.10 raise for American workers. sadly. it fails to take into account many Americans with disabilities who are in our workforce. These are disabled Americans who receive SSI disability benefits who are active participants in the workforce and maintaining jobs that give them great satisfaction. Unfortunately. they are left behind because. currently. SSI beneficiaries are limited to $900 per month in order to remain eligible to receive benefits. If the wage hike under consideration today goes into law without raising an earnings limit for people on SSI. Americans with disabilities engaged in fulltime employment would either potentially lose their benefits or have to cut back on their hours. That is a decision they shouldnt have to make. Mr. Speaker. this is not only a disincentive to work. it is a woefully shortsighted policy. which hopefully we will be able to correct before this law goes into effect. I introduced H.R. 290 which would ensure that workers with disabilities would not lose their payments through raising the earnings limitation on SSI. I wasnt able to offer that provision today because no amendments are being allowed. The result. unfortunately. is. having barred Republicans from having offered this change as an amendment. the majority has created as real Victims not House Republicans but Americans with disabilities. And that Is a shame. Although an increase in the minimum wage is critical. and I strongly support this bill.

The numerous accolades and awards he received over the years are a testament to his deep conviction of community service and civic responsibility. Tom Ed Hays will be remembered for his outstanding service to Hempstead County. southwest Arkansas. and to the entire State of Arkansas. Above all. he will be sorely missed as a friend. I extend my deepest condolences to his wife. Betty Jo Fite Hays. his three sons. Thomas Hays III of Cambridge. England. Daniel Fite Hays of Hope. and John Julian Hays of Hope. his sister. Nancy Hays Gottwald of Richmond. Virginia. and to his eight grandchildren and countless friends. Tom Ed Hays will be greatly missed and I am truly saddened by this loss.",

This accomplishment is long overdue. Israel. as a fully democratic and sovereign state. should be entitled to all of the privileges and opportunities of any member state of the United Nations. Unfortunately. the antiSemitism and antiIsrael bias that pervades the United Nations has long prevented Israel from fully participating in that body. To this day. Israel remains only a temporary member of the U.N.s Western European and Others Group and is excluded from many consultations. discussions and leadership posts within the group and the U.N. itself. The antiSemitic. antiIsrael attitude shown by some members of the 3. Pt. 19 27129 U.N. is unacceptable. It shames the principles of the United Nations. The United Nations has slowly begun to make progress in addressing this problem in restoring Israel to its rightful place at the U.N. However. there is much to be done. and this resolution calls upon U.N. Secretary General Ban KiMoon to resolve this disgraceful problem. Until this happens. the United Nations will not live up to its own charter where the preamble states that the U.N. was founded \"To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights. in the dignity and worth of the human person. in the equal rights of men and women and nations large and small.\" In addition.

Hezbollah. Syrian and Iranian interference in Lebanon must be condemned by the international community in the strongest possible terms and it must immediately end. The resolution before the House chronicles the tragic toll exacted on Lebanon and its people by its neighbors. It is a tale of a peaceful people seeking a better future who again and again have seen their hopes dashed due to the cruel and opportunistic machinations of Iran and Syria. I recently met for the second time this year with Sheikh Saad Harii. the leader of the majority in the Lebanese parliament. whose family has given so much for the freedom of the Lebanese people. Mr. Hariri made an eloquent appeal for help from the Congress of the United States and other parliamentary bodies to expose the interference of nonLebanese groups in the selection of Lebanons next president. I commend the bipartisan leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for acting quickly so the House could go on record against these tactics before the next meeting of the Lebanese parliament later this month. The politicallymotivated violence that has been so much a part of Lebanons recent history has not dampened the desire of the Lebanese people for selfdetermination.

Rape and sexual violence are often used as weapons of war. It is estimated that between 20.000 and 50.000 women and girls were raped during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s. between 250.000 and 500.000 were raped during the genocide in Rwanda. and today. there are reports of wide and systematic rape and sexual assault of women and girls in the Darfur region. The United States was the first government to refer to the killing in Darfur as genocide. but this has had little impact on ending the suffering. The suffering continues because the Sudanese government resists the efforts of the international community at every step and the Chinese government refuses to use its unique influence to force the Sudanese government to change its actions. In fact. China may even have prolonged the crisis by shielding Sudan against the collective efforts of the United Nations. The crisis is now in its 4th year with no end in sight and the suffering of men. women and children continues. That is why I am encouraging passage today of H. Res. 726. H. Res. 726 requires the U.S. State Department and USAID to develop a women and girls Darfur initiative for the purpose of providing victims and potential victims of rape in Darfur. eastern Chad and the Central African Republic with much needed comprehensive and quality medical supplies and health services.

The entire world is currently watching in horror the atrocities being committed in Darfur. Many people have been called to action to try to stop this genocide. This includes hordes of humanitarian workers and peacekeeping forces. The most prominent peacekeeping mission in Sudan has been the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). which is carried out by African Union (AU) forces. Since July of 2004. AU forces have been on the ground in Sudan working as peacekeepers. Sadly. their peacekeeping mission has made these AU personnel targets for attack by rebel forces. The worst of these attacks occurred in Haskanita. Darfur. Sudan. on September 29. 2007. This attack on the AU base left 10 brutally murdered and 50 soldiers missing. In the aftermath of the attacks Haskanita has been burned to the ground. displacing 15.000 citizens. This horrendous situation is made only worse by the government of Sudans silence in not speaking out and condemning these attacks.

The Armed Forces of Sudan (SAF) moved into the village on October 6. reportedly to \"secure\" the area and facilitate the evacuation of the AU peacekeepers. Three days later the village was burned to the ground and 15.000 people were displaced. Although there has been no official statement as to who is responsible for the destruction of the village. U.N. officials have quietly pointed the finger at the SAF. Although diplomatic activity on Sudan has intensified in recent weeks. and talks on the Darfur conflict began in Libya on October 27th. there is little reason for optimism that a peaceful solution to the Darfur tragedy is anywhere in sight. Several of the rebel groups are refusing to participate in the Libya talks. The U.N. Special Envoy for Darfur. Jan Eliasson. and his African Union counterpart. Salim A. Salim. who are leading this negotiation effort. have a Herculean task ahead of them. They will need all the help that we can provide them. and it is critical that this Congress continue to highlight the tragedy of what is occurring in Darfur and seek every means to bring about a just and enduring peace. I therefore thank my colleague Ms. JACKSONLEE for introducing this resolution. which also expresses the readiness of the House of Representatives to support efforts to bring those individuals responsible for the attacks to justice and to dismantle the networks that carry out such attacks. I strongly urge my colleagues in the House to support this resolution.",

Its healthy for America to see two different views on how we should help dislocated workers. Democrats want to help more workers who lose their jobs because of trade. especially workers providing services. The Republican substitute says no to helping those workers. Democrats want to assure more dislocated workers have an opportunity to receive training. The Republican substitute would. Instead. cap the amount of training any worker can receive. not to go on and finish a program. Democrats want to assure health care coverage is affordable for workers losing their jobs by paying 85 percent of their premium. The Republican substitute said. well. 65 wasnt enough. but well give you 70. So again. they cut the workers short. Democrats want a better wage insurance program to help tradeaffected workers who are reemployed in jobs that pay less than their prior employment. The Republican substitute guts the program as it presently exists and instead only provides a benefit to those at the very lowest wage jobs. Republicans dont care if workers have a chance to get a livingwage job. they want to force people back to minimumwage jobs. Democrats want to help States improve unemployment insurance for all workers who are denied unfairly their benefits. especially women. The Republican substitute goes in the opposite direction by allowing the administration to approve waivers from States that could deny more jobless workers unemployment insurance. In short. the Democrats want to help workers navigate the global economy. The Republican substitute. on the other hand. tells workers. well. youre still. more or less. on your own.

New Hampshire. a small paper mill town. heard over the radio and by newspaper the devastating news that Wausau Paper was closing the mill at the end of the year. On Friday. I sent a letter to Labor Secretary Chao asking for expedited help under the existing TAA. and on Monday I traveled to Groveton and met with a number of the affected workers. It is difficult to describe how devastating this closure is to the town of Groveton. to the families of the workers and to the region. Many of the proud workers of that mill are third and fourth generation. They have got no other skills. This is the life they know. As I explained on Monday to the workers what kind of help is available in the current TAA. the thought that was going through my mind was that this was not enough. We need to do more. These folks. their family. this community need more and deserve more help from the Federal Government. The ripple effects of this closure are huge. It goes out into the community. to other businesses and vendors. That is why the H.R. 3920 provisions to redevelop communities hit by the loss of manufacturing jobs through the designation of manufacturing redevelopment zones is so important. Weve got more workers who need help. They face harder times and higher costs. especially for health care. We need to expand the TAA. Now Is not the time to go backwards.

The Republican amendment would eviscerate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and its very purpose. Under the Republican amendment. it would preclude service workers from receiving benefits. Unlike H.R. 3920. the Republican amendment does not cover service workers. Yet according to one study by a leading technology consulting firm. 3.3 million service workers will lose their jobs by 2015. The Republican amendment would prohibit manufacturing workers whose jobs are offshored to China or India from receiving benefits.

Earlier this year. I joined other members of the North Carolina delegation and introduced a similar bill. H.R. 1729. the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act. whose essential language is mirrored in this bill. The provisions in our original bill were based on the recommendations made by the North Carolina Dislocated Worker Advisory Committee. a group convened by the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Center that included. among others. leaders from the community college system. the Employment Security Commission and the Workforce Development Division of the North Carolina Department of Commerce. 3. Pt. 21 October 31. 2007 Mr. Speaker. North Carolinas involvement in the TAA debate is important. Why? Because our State has had the most workers covered by TAA certifications. the most workers benefiting from the health coverage tax credit. and one of the highest number of workers enrolled in TAAsponsored worker training. In fact. as of August 10 of this year. there were 12.693 TAA participants in North Carolina. including over 9.800 enrolled in training. That is why I am very pleased to support the underlying bill and oppose this Republican amendment. This bill also expands TAA eligibility to include dislocated workers affected by a shift in production in which the workers jobs are moved to nations with no preferential trade agreements. such as China. It also gives our States the flexibility and increased funding to meet the Increasing demand for services and increases the health coverage tax credit to 85 percent of the dislocated workers health care premiums. It makes changes to simplify the application process for dislocated workers so that they can get help in a timely manner. In the last 5 years. Mr. Speaker.

As we continue to expand and open our markets to new competition. we have an economic and a moral responsibility to ensure that our domestic workers are equipped with the necessary skills and tools to compete in a global market. I support free trade. which is all the more reason to support the reforms and expansion of a program that will help our workers adversely affected by trade and the globalization of our economy. It is estimated that more than 3 million service workers jobs will go overseas by 2015. so the expansion of coverage to the service workers section is especially important and appropriate. But the McCrery substitute will limit trade assistance adjustment by not offering any support to service or public sector workers. The substitute will also set a cap on available training funds. denying many workers the tools and resources to be more competitive in the global economy. And as I read the language of the substitute. for the first time of the 70year history of the unemployment insurance system. the substitute would allow States to deny unemployment insurance benefits to dislocated workers. The underlying bill provides American workers with the support and tools needed to expand job training opportunities and transition workers into 21st century jobs. This bill. H.R. 2930. triples the current job training cap to $660 million by 2010 and increases the health care premium subsidy to 85 percent.

I would point out that service workers today are entitled to unemployment insurance benefits. and that is the primary form of income support under TAA. But to expand to service workers all of the other array of benefits under the TAA may be premature. In a bill that passed this Congress and was signed by the President earlier this year. there was a mandate for a study to look at service workers and the impact of trade on service workers. We dont yet have. obviously. the results of that study. so it may be premature to just willynilly offer all these benefits to service workers. And while Mr. MORAN spoke about some projection of losses of service worker jobs over the next 10 or so years. in an April 2007 paper. the Peterson Institute for International Economics evaluated data on the extent of the impact of offshoring on service sector labor markets in the United States. and their review of the data concluded that just under 1 million American service workers lost their jobs from 2004 to 2005 due to mass layoffs of 50 or more employees. while 8 million service sector jobs were created during that time. And of those 1 million jobs lost. only about 4 percent could be attributed to offshoring or offshore outsourcing. So I think the question of the impact of trade on the service sector is certainly an open one. and the House may be well advised to wait for the results of the study that we mandated in previous legislation that passed this year.

I would point out that using Bureau of Labor statistics. the average cost of training under current law is only $3.000. So the $8.000 New Economy Scholarship in our substitute more than doubles the amount available. In the case of remedial education. the scholarship amounts to an extra $1.000. nearly tripling the average cost of training. The most common provider of occupational training is the local community or technical college. The limit of $8.000 over 2 years is significantly greater than the average cost of a 2year program at a community college. and is similar to limits that apply to other Federal postsecondary assistance. Under current law. Mr. Speaker. while there is no specific monetary limit. as there is in our substitute. the cost of training must be reasonable and that reasonableness is decided by the various States. So the amount that is available is subject to judgment and to uncertainty. Our substitute removes that uncertainty so that a person knows going in how much he is going to have to spend on training. Our substitute significantly enhances access to training by removing additional eligibility criteria and allowing people who do get new jobs to use the training benefit unlike current law. So we expand current law in that regard with respect to training benefits. Mr. Speaker. I hope the gentleman from Washington has listened to my rebuttal and is convinced now that we dont gut the training benefits in TAA. If he is not. though. if he will vote for the substitute.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution and believe strongly that the Chinese government must be pressed on these points. The China of today is not progressing. Madam Speaker. it is regressing. It is becoming more violent. more repressive. and more resistant to basic values of human rights and religious freedom.

Falun Gong followers. and Buddhist monks and nuns just because of their faith and systematically destroys churches and confiscates Bibles. It persecutes the Uyghur people. cutting them off from the outside world as it pursues a policy of cultural liquidation. Rebiya Kadeer is a brave soul who has stood up to this violence and repression. She has suffered so much at the hands of the Chinese Government. and yet does not recoil in fear. For her bravery. the Chinese Government has retaliated by capturing and imprisoning her children who remained behind in China. They have been held at unknown locations. interrogated. and very possibly tortured. A couple of years ago. the FBI identified Chinese secret police following Rebiya Kadeer and spying on her at her Fairfax home. The Chinese Government will stop at nothing to silence those who oppose its brutal tactics against its own citizens.

A toxic brew of lead. dioxin. asbestos. mercury. benzene. and other hazardous contaminants swirled around the site of the disaster as rescue workers labored furiously in the wreckage. many without adequate protective gear. Thousands of first responders. residents. area workers. students. and others from around the country inhaled this poisonous dust as it settled onto and into countless homes. shops. and office buildings. Now. 6 years later. there is no doubt that thousands of people are sick from World Trade Center contamination. A study released in September 2006 by Mt. Sinai Hospital found that 70 percent of the more than 9.000 first responders studied suffer health problems related to their work at Ground Zero. This number does not include the Stuyvesant High School students whose school sat near piles of debris from the towers. the nearby residents whose apartments still contain poisonous dust. or the thousands of people who work in offices that were never properly cleaned.

Congressman Fred Schwengel. Senator Hubert Humphrey. and a group of fifteen other Members of Congress. historians and civic and business leaders organized the United States Capitol Historical Society on July 17. 1962. Fortyfive years later. the USCHS continues to fulfill its mission by teaching the public about the founding. growth and significance of the Capitol of the United States as a tangible symbol of its representative form of government. Convinced that an understanding of history was inextricably linked with responsible citizenship. the founders of the United States Capitol Historical Society adopted a mission statement committing the nonprofit. nonpartisan. educational organization o the role of \"history teacher to the nation.\" More than fortyfive years after its founding. the Society continues to develop new and creative ways to bring the fascinating story of the Capitol to the publics attention. Among its tools are educational tours. scholarly symposia. observances of historic events. enhancement and preservation of the Capitols collection of art and artifacts. sponsorship of research. the sale of publications and mementos of an historical nature. and assistance to Congressional and other Capitol offices. The recent partnership of the USCHS with the National Archives and Old Town Trolley is particularly innovative. The Society has committed to working toward seeing every eighth grade student in the Washington. DC public schools tour \"monumental\" Washington to learn about the U.S. Constitution. This educational tours sole purpose is to help students understand their place in American history and their role in the process of government. Madam Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a great organization dedicated to preserving the history of the most recognizable symbol of representative government in the world. the United States Capitol.",

I rise today in support of House Resolution 1013. expressing the sense of the Congress that providing breakfast in schools through the National School Breakfast Program has a positive impact on classroom performance. The National School Breakfast Program was created in 1966 to help schools serving breakfast to \"nutritionally needy\" children. Made permanent in 1975. the program focuses on those schools where assistance is needed to provide adequate nutrition for students. The School Breakfast Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agricultures Food and Nutrition Service through State education agencies. in agreement with local school food authorities. in nearly 84.000 schools and institutions. In fiscal year 2006. over 9.7 million children participated in the School Breakfast Program daily. Of those. 7.9 million received their meals for free or at a reduced price. In my home State of Illinois. more than 223.000 students received free and reducedprice breakfasts daily. Public or nonprofit private schools serving K12 and public or nonprofit private residential child care institutions may participate in the School Breakfast Program. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part in the breakfast program receive cash subsidies from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for each meal they serve. In return. they must serve breakfasts that meet Federal requirements. and they must offer free or reduced breakfasts to eligible children. Many States that have implemented school breakfast programs have seen encouraging outcomes. Maryland has seen an increase in standardized test scores 17 percent above the State average. an 8 percent reduction in tardiness. and a reduction in referrals to the office for discipline by 20 percent. Unfortunately. the problem persists that millions of children go to school hungry each day. even though breakfast is the most important meal of the day. The Federal child nutrition programs can offer a great deal in the promotion of nutrition and wellness. especially in terms of assisting those children most in need. That is why I stand in support of this resolution. encouraging every child to start the school day with a nutritious breakfast in order to learn. grow. and develop to their fullest potential.

The School Breakfast Program began as a pilot program in 1966 and has grown to serve over 10 million children nationwide. In New Jersey. almost 145.000 students ate a school breakfast during the 2007 school year. yet there are many students who cannot participate because their school does not offer this program. This is important because research has shown how vital a good breakfast is for learning. Children who eat a healthy breakfast have higher standardized test scores. do much better in math. reading. and vocabulary tests. and attend school more regularly compared with children who do not eat breakfast. Congress should act to increase funding for this program so that many more students can be served. It is a smart investment In our future.

I have served on the Banking Committee since my first day in the Senate 26 years ago. During my tenure on the committee. and now as its chairman. preserving and strengthening Americas preeminent position as the worlds leading financial center has been among my primary objectives. Based on that experience. I would like to share what I believe are three important considerations that should guide us in any discussion of how to make Americas capital markets more competitive. First. we must remain mindful that our markets remain the largest. most liquid. and most transparent on the planet. Second. the current and continued success of those markets depends on the presence of effective. efficient legal rules that protect investors. as such. we should resist the temptation to engage in a regulatory race to the bottom as a rationale to stay on top. Members of the Senate resisted that temptation yesterday when they voted. overwhelmingly. to defeat an amendment that would have significantly weakened a critical investor protection provision of the SarbanesOxley Act. I want to thank the sponsors of this amendment. Senator ScHUMER and Senator CRAPO. for their vote opposing yesterdays amendment. In doing so. they affirmed their support for an efficient and effective regulatory structure and ongoing efforts at the Securities and Exchange Commission to lower the cost of compliance for small businesses. Third the success of our markets also depends on our Nations ability to educate. train. and recruit the kind of talented and driven people who can compete and win in the global economy. We should do all we can to promote the ongoing competitiveness of Americas capital markets. Our Nations ability to strengthen security. create opportunity. and expand prosperity for every citizen depends in large part on the success of our capital markets and of our financial services sector generally. Maintaining the preeminence of capital markets will not be easy. It will require honest and thoughtful leadership. As chairman of the Banking Committee. I look forward to furthering the dialogue on this important issue. Mr. President. I ask for unanimous consent that the following remarks on competitiveness that I recently delivered to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in March be inserted into the RECORD immediately following my statement.",

Sitting around the table. we had business owners. higher education officials and public school educators. The big question was this--who is responsible for making sure our students get the skills they need? Businesses didnt want to hire somebody and then have to train them in the basics. Higher education leaders wanted to be able to focus on collegelevel material. not remediation. And high school leaders were working as hard as they could just to deal with the demands on their plate. So whose responsibility is it to make sure our students get the skills they need? It is all of our responsibility. and that is what this bill finally recognizes. It ensures that our Federal agenciesfrom Commerce to Education to Energy to the National Science Foundationtake aggressive steps to keep American workers ahead of the curve.

But more importantly. what we have seen is conflicts of interest in terms of the board that manages the program and the ownership of the companies that are given the grant money. I wont go into the details. Senator MIKULSKI is in agreement that they should be oversighted and looked at and conflict of interest should be eliminated. This amendment is very simple. It just says that ought to happen and there ought to be a review. there ought to be a prohibition of use of NOAA funds for meetings. There is $46.000 yearly going out for a meeting out of this grant money with no real concern. There is no conflict of interest requirement in the grant authoritymaking process at NOAA. So this amendment simply sets out that we ought to have basic conflict of interest rules of engagement in the grantmaking process with NOAA. I reserve the remainder of my time.",

The energy parts of this bill were fully considered by the Energy Committee when it was chaired by Senator DoMENICI last year. and it was then reported to the Senate in March. The Commerce Committee parts of it were fully considered by the Commerce Committee in May or June and reported to the full Senate then. The only parts of the legislation that didnt go through the regular committee process were from the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions. That was the decision of that committee to do that. They had a series of roundtables and a series of meetings and made recommendations to the working group. The working group then had meetings with the administration officials. and Senator DoMENICI presided over most of themwe called them homework sessions--and then Senator Frist and Senator REID introduced this legislation last October. It has been public all that time. Then Senator REID and Senator MCCONNELL introduced the legislation in January of this year. and it has been public all that time.

I see the Senator from Michigan is here. and I am sure she will mount a rigorous defense in regard to it. There are some things people should be aware of. We had an oversight hearing on this program in my Federal Financial Management Subcommittee. We showed it to be ineffective. Between 1990 and 2004. 35 percent of the $2 billion of this program went to Fortune 500 companiesFortune 500 companieswith 65 percent of the grants under this program never being asked to be funded outside of the program. In other words. they never went to the private sector. Almost twothirds never attempted to get funding in the private sector. This was a program that was designed to help with technology. It wasnt designed to be a corporate welfare program. In fact. what has happened is that five companies since 1990 have consumed $376 million of this money. Let me tell you who the companies were. They were: General Motors. hardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research. IBM. hardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research. General Electric. hardly in need of taxpayer money to fund research. Minnesota Mining. 3M. and Motorola. Their combined revenues yearly are in excess of $50 billion. We are going to see a large defense of this program. because there have been some instances where it has done some good. I dont deny that. But for the $2 billion we have spent on it. what have we gotten? The House has eliminated this program. by the way. We decreased it over the last 2 years.

Beyond that. it says that Iraq and Afghanistan and our global war against Islamic extremists is the largest single waste of U.S. taxpayer money. That is coming from their budget.

This budget is a direct answer to the demands of the American people and steers us in a new direction. With this budget we can usher in a new era of fiscal responsibility that this current administration has failed to adhere to. The budget is morally sound. as it redirects funding to domestic spending programs that benefit the American middle class. the backbone of our great Nation. Most importantly this budget meets our moral obligation to all of our veterans. This budget ends the war and brings our troops home and moves this country toward an agenda of peace and security. The news of the horrible living conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center raised our national consciousness regarding the need to do moremuch morefor wounded and injured service members and to upgrade the administrative systems that support them. Simply put. this budget treats the heroic young men and women who sacrifice life and limb with the respect and dignity they deserve. This budget guarantees full funding for health care (including mental health care) for all veterans. The Progressive Caucus budget makes veterans health care a new federal entitlement. It will require the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to make mandatory appropriations for VA health care based upon the following formula: the amount of funds available for VA medical care in FY2008 would equal 130 percent of the total obligations made by the VA for medical care programs in FY2005.

I strongly support the tax provisions included in the Ryan Amendment. Republican tax relief has led to unprecedented economic growth and dropped the unemployment rate. More importantly. tax relief gives back to Americans their own money. The robust economic growth in this Nation over the past few years is proof that individual Americans use and invest their dollars much more wisely than the Federal Govemment does. I am pleased that the Ryan Amendment makes the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 permanent and recognizes the reality of our Nations fiscal situation by addressing the outofcontrol growth of entitlement spending. However. I want to make clear my views regarding certain budget process reforms included in the Ryan amendment. I am strongly opposed to giving any U.S. President the power to use a line item veto. Our Founding Fathers wisely attempted to curtail the power of each branch of the Federal Government by instituting a system of checks and balances. Granting the President additional power to veto specific portions of a bill instead of the bill as a whole cedes too much authority to the executive branch and could lead to unfair and unilateral power. I am very disappointed that the Ryan Amendment includes a provision granting the President this unconstitutional power. While I strongly oppose the lineitem veto provision and other attempts to reduce Congresss constitutional power of the purse included in the Ryan Amendment. it is clear to me that this proposal is preferable to an alternative that raises taxes by an average of $2.597 for each of my constituents.",

This House budget provides immediate relief for 23 million middleincome families who would otherwise be subjected to the alternative minimum tax and provides for a permanent fix.

JOHN SPRArr has made wise decisions on Function 300. Last month. I testified before the Budget Committee. urging increased spending on these important programs. The chairman said he would consider my request. and he is a man of his word. I am pleased to say that the programs included in Function 300 will be funded at a level $2.6 billion. or 9 percent above what the President requested in his budget. and $15.7 billion between 2008 and 2012. This budget resolution rejects the Presidents proposal to further cut the Land and Water Conservation Fund. the Fish and Wildlife Service Refuge Program. and EPAs Clean Water Assistance Program. In addition. the budget resolution accepts the best idea in the Presidents budget. and that is to increase funding for the national parks. The Ryan amendment in 2008 would cut $1.5 billion below current services and $4.6 billion between 2008 and 2012. Many of the numbers contained in the Presidents budget were bleak. The President proposed a budget for these programs which was $2.8 billion less than what is required to maintain current levels of service. For example. funding for EPA faced a reduction of $508 million. the Forest Service down $343 million. The funding for the Park Service would have been reduced by $237 million. And. worse. the Presidents proposed cuts after 7 years of steady decline are severe. The Interior Department has been cut by 16 percent. EPA by 29 percent. the Forest Service by a whopping 35 percent. These cuts have evidently led to declines in services for visitors to our parks. refuges. and forests and to dramatic reductions in assistance to State and local communities for environmental and conservation activities.

This chart here gives us an idea of the difference in the scenarios between the Republican budget. this line for tax revenues. and the Democratic budget. this top line for revenues. If you look at it in terms of the percentage of GDP consumed by Federal revenues. you should know that this year Federal revenues constitute about 18.6 percent of GDP. Under the Republican budget alternative. the bottom line. that stays about the same. About 10 years from now. it is approximately the same percent of GDP. But the Democratic budget. this top line. that figure is going to go up to over 20 percent of GDP. over 20 percent.

And the worst will be yet to come. because the Democrats budget ignores demographic reality and offers no reform of entitlements. no savings from entitlements. In 2009. the Social Security surplus will begin to decline. In 2017. we will have to pay out more money in Social Security benefits than we take in in taxes.

For over 30 years. Phil Ingegneri served his country as a special investigator for the Internal Revenue Service. His work in special investigations took him to cities across the eastern seaboard and even to postwar Europe. where he was stationed in Paris. France. When the opportunity arose in the 1950s. Phil jumped at the chance to move his beloved wife. Roslyn. and two young children. Philip and Lois. to Bangor. Maine. where they quickly integrated into that vibrant community. After a long and distinguished career serving his country. Phil Ingegneri was elected to the Maine House of Representatives. where he dedicated his efforts to improving public education for all of Maines citizens. I am sad to announce Philip Ingegneri passed away this Saturday evening at the age of 97. However. it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives his service and contributions to our Nation and the great State of Maine. His dedication and love for his family. community. and country is a fine example for all of us.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to speak on behalf of Victor Yunier Fernandez Martinez. a prisoner of conscience in totalitarian Cuba. Mr. Fernandez Martinez. a young man of only 24 years of age and a member of the Popular Republican Party. was not even charged with committing any crime. even by the Orwellian standards and whims that make up the \"legal system\" in that enslaved island. Instead. he was hauled away to the gulag simply under the pretext of being a \"precriminal social danger.\" Agents of the tyrannys secret police said that they suspected Mr. Fernandez Martinez was involved in a graffiti campaign in Havana to promote freedom of expression. In fact. there was no link between Mr. Fernandez Martinez and these actions. but that did not stop the oppressive forces from detaining him and testing him for paint residue. which they did not find. This incident was cited 2 years later when he was sentenced to 3 years in the gulag because of the paranoiac perception of the dictatorship that Mr. Fernandez Martinez. a peaceful dissident. is a \"dangerous man.\" Madam Speaker. Mr. Fernandez Martinezs mother has visited him in prison and has reported that even though conscious of the profound injustice of his incarceration he was in good spirits. a true testament of the spirit and drive of the heroes who are confined in the Cuban totalitarian gulag. It is unconscionable that the world simply stands by. in the 21st century. and silently acquiesces to the torture. oppression and denigration of a noble people only 90 miles from the United States of America. Madam Speaker. Victor Fernandez represents the best of the new generation in Cuba. a generation that has known only oppression and misery but that will play a central role in the transformation of Cuba from a totalitarian nightmare to a representative democracy with the rule of law for all of its citizens. We must demand the release of all those who are persecuted for their democratic ideals. My colleagues. we must demand the immediate and unconditional release of Victor Yunier Fernandez Martinez and every political prisoner in totalitarian Cuba.",

He is a very sincere. thoughtful guy who tries to personalize issues that affect people throughout this country. I know he is motivated by all the right reasons. but somebody needs to talk about the politics. This legislation has been placed on the Defense authorization bill in the past. It never made it out of conference because we knew. with the makeup of the conference. the amendment would fall. Given the makeup of this conference. the amendment will be part of the bill and it is going to be vetoed. That is the politics. Whether one agrees with President Bush. he said he is going to veto this bill. and if I were him. I would as Commander in Chief. I would not buy into this way of legislating. Another reason for this amendment. if you think there is a gap in military law that without this kind of amendment the military is not going to prosecute people who act on their prejudices. you are wrong. If someone in uniform commits a crime against a civilian or another person in uniform. I dont care why they did it. if they beat somebody up. hurt somebody. they are going to get prosecuted. That is the way the military law works. We are not doing the military a favor by passing this legislation because there is no problem in the military in terms of how justice is administered. Whatever motivates you to hurt someone or to take the law in your own hands or act on your prejudices. you are going to be dealt with because we cannot have good order and discipline in the military when people can hurt someone based on their individual prejudice because the whole unit falls apart. This is nothing the military needs. They are going to take care of violence in the ranks based on the law they already have.

This amendment. which is identical to that legislation. for the first time will expand the definition of a hate crime to include gender. gender identity. disability. and sexual orientation. It gives the Justice Department jurisdiction over crimes of violence committed because of a persons actual or perceived race. color. religion. national origin. gender. sexual orientation. or disability. Existing law only covers race. color. religion. or national originbased hate crimes. where the victim was engaging in one of six specified activities.

A vote for Senator KENNEDYS hate crime amendment regretfully puts this whole bill in jeopardy. The only way to ensure we have a Defense authorization bill this year is to vote against the Kennedy amendment. There are too many important Defense provisions in the bill that are at risk because of a controversial. nongermane amendment dealing with social policy. Among the items at risk. the Wounded Warriors provision. the pay raise. acquisition reform. and many other important Defense provisions. all are put at risk by the adoption of the Kennedy amendment. We have now gone through a long exercise debating Iraq amendments and nongermane amendments related to the social agenda of the other side. But what are we trying to accomplish here? Do we want to protect the defense policy matters in this bill that actually matter to our forces in the field. or do we want to debate political and social issues on this measure? The Senate has been on record all year that we will not cut off funding for our troops in the field and that we need to do more to help our wounded warriors returning from the war.

He said we should have universal coverage of health care in America. I think most Americans think we should have universal coverage. What does that mean?

I think we should have universal coverage with an appropriate mix of public and private coverage so that every American has coverage. So I think for the Senator from Kentucky to make a charge that we are for universal coverage. I am. as is our President. Most Americans want universal coverage. My point is. what form and what way?

This bill is more restrictive than current lawmore restrictive than current law. Essentially. eligibility is. under current law. determined by States and the Federal Government. States determine eligibilitythat is current lawand the administration either does or does not grant a waiver. This Republican administration has granted several waivers. In fact. one was to the Republican Governor of New Jersey. Christine Todd Whitman. when a major waiver was granted. So this bill does not change current law. Basically. it provides and uses the purse to discourage States from going to higher coverage by lowering the match rate. Nothing in this bill expands eligibilitynothing. So the charge that this is increasing eligibility to people other than children is just not accurate. Madam President. I yield the floor. I see the Senator from West Virginia is seeking recognition.",

But I wish to take the opportunity. nevertheless. to discuss my amendment which is filed which is at the desk. It Is very straightforward. It simply says American citizens only are eligible for SCHIP and that no funds will be used to expand health care benefits in SCHIP to illegal immigrants and others. The legislation we are considering. as written. will do just that. It will expand the program enormously without any regard for focusing on American citizens. and it is very clear that in that expansion. the benefit would go to many illegal aliens because of glaring loopholes that exist in present law and in this legislation.

I want to thank SUE MYRICK who has worked on this for such a long time. along with the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for sponsoring this bill. It really is so important for people to be screened early. I do not think there is a family in the United States that has not been touched by some form of cancer. and if you catch it early. the life expectancy can be extended a great deal of time. and in many cases. it can be cured. We had a personal experience in my family. In fact. I lost my first wife to cancer. and I think in part it was because there was not early detection of that cancer. So one of the things that I think is most important is that women and men get screened for various forms of cancer. There is prostate cancer in men. There is cervical cancer for women. There is ovarian cancer. There is breast cancer. There needs to be early screening. That is one of the reasons why DARRELL ISSA and I cosponsored JoAnnas Law to make doctors and patients aware of the signs of cervical cancer very. very early so that women can be saved from terminally being ill. It is so important that they learn about these things before they get out of hand. I cannot express enough and I think SUE will tell you this. I cannot express enough the pain that a family goes through when they find out that one of their loved ones is terminally ill and it could have been prevented if you had found out about it early enough. That is why I think this is such a great program. I am glad this reauthorization is taking place. and I thank SUE once again for working so hard on this. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for working so hard on this. I thank you for yielding the time. and I would just urge anybody who is paying attention to this discussion tonight. and a lot of people are not. get detection early. Get screened early.

The financial costs of cancer on our society are also enormous. and it has been estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that. in 2006 alone. the cost of cancer was an astonishing $206 billion dollars. This Congress must do more to accelerate the pace of cancer research. and to help alleviate the immense suffering of so many of our citizens.

Every year. too many women fail to receive crucial preventative screenings because they do not have the means to see a doctor. Along with a good knowledge of their familys medical history. these screenings are the best indicators by which many women can determine whether they are at risk for common cancers. By providing easy access to these screenings. this bill would allow women to determine whether they are at risk for cancer. allow them to detect any problems early. and prevent any cancer from spreading. if it has already developed.

Access to early detection medical services is an important step in baffling breast and cervical cancers. As the Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Health Task Force.

I am also all too aware of the disparities that exist for and the challenges that must be overcome by women from minority communities in order to gain access to screening and diagnostic services for breast and cervical cancer. The CDC reports that the number of new breast cancer diagnoses over the last ten years has remained stable or decreased significantly within ethnic groups other than Asian and Pacific Islander American. The prevalence of breast cancer diagnoses in the Asian and Pacific Islander American. however. has increased during the last 10 years. On Guam. we have a shortage of oncologyrelated services.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women and the leading cause of cancer death among women under the age of 40. Early detection and education are key to winning this battle. It is imperative that we reauthorize the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Act. H.R. 1132. so that all women are given access to free and lowcost breast and cervical screenings. No woman should be denied these lifesaving screenings simply because they cannot afford them. Further. all women should be made aware of the benefits of each screening and the risks of these cancers through public education programs. This issue is very important within my District of Marin and Sonoma Counties in California. and especially so in Marin County because it has the highest rate of breast cancer in the country. Among white women. aged 45 to 64. the breast cancer rate in Marin has increased 72 percent in the last decade. Marin Countys rates are approximately 40 percent higher than the national average and about 30 percent higher than the rest of the Bay Area. This is why early detection and education in women of all ages is so important. In addition to this important legislation. we need to do more to prevent breast cancer deaths in women under the age of 40. Approximately 11.000 women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. of which nearly 1.300 will die. Thats why I introduced the Annie Fox Act. H.R. 715. named after a young woman in my district who was diagnosed with breast cancer and died at the age of 35. This bill will authorize research into the causes of breast cancer in younger woman and educate them about the risks of breast cancer.

LEP. students have more time to learn English before being tested. Currently. when a student with disabilities does not graduate in the standard number of years (3 or 4 years). they are misrepresented as a dropout against that schools graduation rate even though the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. IDEA. allows students with disabilities to stay in school until their 22nd birthday. Adding the provision outlined in my bill to ESEA would align it with IDEA. standardizing the statutes. Current law allows limited English proficient. LEP. students to wait until they have been in the United States for 3 years before being tested for English fluency. This bill simply extends that period of time to 5 years. By doing so. LEP students will have more time to become proficient in English before being tested and therefore reflected in the schools annual assessment. Education is the basis for success and \"No Child Left Behind\" is focused on ensuring that our children receive a quality educationthe necessary foundation for a successful life. My bill offers two minor but substantive changes to current law that will help our schools. students. faculty and staff to better our education system. I ask for your support and the support of my colleagues to pass this important legislation.",

I rise to announce that yesterday I introduced H.R. 7071. the Federal Agency Program Realignment and Closure Act of 2008. legislation that will change the way Washington does business once and for all. It is clear that the Federal Government is bogged down with rampant spending. continually growing entitlement programs. an ever increasing annual budget and a Federal deficit that economists predict will hit $500 billion by 2010. When the U.S. Military needed reform and more efficient spending. Congress and the Department of Defense employed the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. BRAC. to evaluate military needs and spendENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 154. Pt. 16 ing saving taxpayers untold billions of dollars. If it is good enough to reform our Nations military. it is good enough to be applied to the entire Federal Government. I introduced this bill to apply the proven BRAC model to all Federal agencies and programs. This commission will consist of 17 bipartisan members. including both public and private sector officials. providing an objective. nonpartisan. and independent review and analysis of all Federal agencies and programs. The commission will target agencies and programs that perform a duplicative function. would perform better at the State level or in the private sector and create a list of recommended realignments and closures. Congress will then have an up or down vote on the commissions recommendations. All saved funds will be used solely for deficit reduction meaning it cannot be used to fund new government programs. Spending in Washington. DC. is completely out of control. I believe that if we are going to keep putting new spending and programs on the table. then we absolutely must have a mechanism to take old things off of the table. The American people understand that if you spend too much of your budget this month you cut back the next month and they expect their government to work the same way. My legislation will help drain the swamp in Washington and put the Federal Government back to work for the people.",

My concern with the wording of the amendment stems from the fact that the Iraqi Sunnis did not participate fully in the drafting of the constitution of Iraq and the Sunni community voted overwhelmingly against it but were unable to prevent its adoption in a referendum. As a result of their dissatisfaction with the constitution. an agreement was made to convene a Constitutional Review Commission to review the constitution and to make recommendations for changes to the Iraqi Council of Representatives for submission to the Iraqi people. One of the benchmarks that the Iraqi political leaders agreed among themselves called for the Constitutional Review Commission to be formed by September 2006. for the Commission to complete its work by January 2007. and for a constitutional amendments referendum to be held. if required. in The Constitutional Review Commission has not completed its work despite several extensions of time. the most recent extension being until the end of this year. In recognition of the agreement to have a Constitutional Review Committee. the legislation establishing procedures for the creation of new federal regions in Iraq will not go into effect until 18 months after enactment of the legislation. which is April Accordingly. I appreciate the modifications that Senator BIDEN is making to his amendment to reflect that the political settlement regarding federalism referred to in his amendment should be based upon the \"final\" provisions of the Iraq constitution. This will allow for the possibility of changes being made as a result of the work of the Constitutional Review Commission. I also appreciate Senator BIDENS modifying the amendment to note that whatever the political settlement is. be it pursuant to the current or revised constitutional provisions. it should be based on the \"wishes of the Iraqi people and their elected leaders\" as we dont want to suggest that we are trying to impose anything on the Iraqis.",

I agree with him that. at. the time of adoption of the constitution. the Sunnis were opposed to many aspects of it including those provisions relating to federalism among others. But in my last visit to Iraq. my conversations with key Sunni leaders reveals a sea change in thinking. There is a growing recognition by the Sunni leadership that Sunnis will not get a fair shake if they are at the mercy of a strong central government controlled by their rivals in the Islamist Shiacamp. One key leader told me that he now understands that federalism is the best option for the Sunnis. Nonetheless. it is not my intention to forego the possibility that the Iraqi Constitutional Review Commission may recommend changes to their constitution nor that the United States should seek to impose a settlement on the Iraqis. I would note. however. at in the last draft proposed by the commission on May 23. 2007. none of the proposed changes would revoke any of the provisions of the constitution which permit the creation of federal regions.

What is at stake here? Running this center means we will not have enough DEA agents--and we do not. Running this center continues to spend $30 to $40 million a year that could do great things for our military. Why would we not want to redirect or at least prohibit the continued funding through this Defense authorization bill? Now. there are going to be some claims: Why are you doing this here? Why arent you doing it on an appropriations bill when it comes through? We cannot have it both ways. We heard in the debate on WRDA that authorizations matter. and it is important for us to have priorities. So the claim is you should not be doing this here on the Defense authorization but. rather. on the appropriations bill. The authorization is the place to do this. to limit the expenditure of funds on something that does not pass muster by anybodys standard. So it is my hope that consideration will be given to this amendment. and that we will truly have the courage to make a vote to spend money wisely. To continue to spend money on this center means we are going to continue to throw $40 million away. according to the Department of Justice. which runs this center. in something that will not give them any benefit. I cannot think of a greater thing we could do than to start doing this and look at every program such as this that is not accomplishing any goals. There are no metrics to measure it. other than what the Department of Justice says. There will be claims saying it has programs that work. They have some programs. but they are highly expensive.

His neighbors. family. coaches. and even competitors have all helped forge him into the man he has become and we will all be watching in rapt attention when he steps into the blocks. If I could remind Leonel of just two virtues that bring success. it would be to always fulfill your God given talents and never forget to be gracious under pressure. If he can manage these two feats. as he has done so well in the past. he will return home an Olympic hero. It is my honor to represent Leonel. as well as his parents.

Flood damage to schools alone is expected to reach nearly $100 million. and as a result some schools will not open in the fall. Those schools able to open their doors are desperately trying to get ready for the upcoming school year. but repairs and cleanup are ongoing. Moreover. many schools will see an influx of flooddisplaced students. while others will face financial challenges due to the loss of students and property values where the schools are located. I have heard from several regional superintendents in my district. particularly Mr. Ralph Grimm of West Central Community Unit School District No. 235 in Henderson County. with concerns that this situation will make it difficult for them to make ends meet in the coming school year.

As such. I proudly introduce the Midwest Schools Disaster Relief Act. ENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 154. Pt. 13 Similarly to the assistance Congress approved after Hurricane Katrina. this bill would: Authorize funds to restart school operations. These monies could be used on transportation assistance. to replace damaged textbooks and computers. rent temporary classroom sites. hire additional staff for counseling services. clean up school buildings. and other services and activities. Authorize funds for schools to accommodate any displaced students they enroll. Prohibit the loss of students due to displacement to count against schools when Federal funding is calculated for the next academic year. Waive the Federal requirement that schools maintain their share of financial responsibility in providing education services. Ensure the needs of homeless students displaced by flooding are met through the Education for Homeless Youth program. The natural disasters of May and June 2008 have adversely affected the economy. agriculture. critical infrastructure. and school districts of the Midwest. As weatherdamaged schools prepare to welcome students back in just a few short weeks. we simply cannot stand by and watch our children receive a lowerquality education solely because they live in an area where flooding or storms occurred.

The Department of Defense. in response to calls to reinstate the draft. has confirmed that conscription serves no military need. In his December confirmation hearings. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated his opposition to a military draft. Secretary Gates immediate predecessor. Donald Rumsfield. also publicly opposed reinstating the draft. The opposition of the two most recent Defense Secretaries is only the most recent confirmation that the draft serves no military purpose. Obviously. if there is no military need for the draft. then there is no need for Selective Service registration. Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. Selective Service registration is an outdated and outmoded system. which has been made obsolete by technological advances. In fact. in 1993. the Department of Defense issued a report stating that registration could be stopped \"with no effect on military mobilization and no measurable effect on the time it would take to I mobilize. and no measurable effect on military recruitment.\" Yet the American taxpayer has been forced to spend over $500 million dollars on an outdated system \"with no measurable effect on military mobilization\"! Shutting down Selective Service will give taxpayers a break without adversely affecting military efforts. Shutting down Selective Service will also end a program that violates the very principals of individual liberty our Nation was founded upon. The moral case against the draft was eloquently expressed by former President Ronald Regan in the publication Human Events in 1979: \". . . it [conscription] rests on the assumption that your kids belong to the state. It we buy that assumption then it is for the statenot for parents. the community. the religious institutions or teachersto decide who shall have what values and who shall do what work. when. where and how in our society. That assumption isnt a new one.

There are 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States today. and hundreds of thousands are arriving each year. In America today. unscrupulous employers hire undocumented immigrants because they can pay them less than American workers and force them to work in conditions that Americans would not tolerate. Employers can do this with impunity because our Government doesnt enforce immigration laws that prohibit hiring undocumented immigrants. Immigration is a complicated issue that ignites strong passions. Some would rather avoid this issue because it is so sensitive. But Congress has an obligation to fix our broken immigration system. We need a comprehensive approach. one that is tough but fair. We need. first. to improve border security by increasing manpower and deploying new technology. We need to enforce the law against employers who are hiring millions of undocumented workers. We need a realistic approach to the 12 million undocumented workers who live and work in our country. I commend our majority leader. Senator REID of Nevada. He is not afraid of tackling tough issues. including immigration reform. He knows it is an important national priority. Last week.

Such proposals are aimed at limiting future carbon output into the atmosphere. Discussion and debate is not enough. We need action now. One resource often overlooked is coal. Despite the recent pace in developing clean coal technologies. America cannot afford to simply give up on this challenge. Coal is an abundant. affordable. reliable. and secure energy source.

A series of racially charged episodes involving offcampus violence soon followed the noose incident. In one instance. black student Robert Bailey would be attacked in a white part of town at gunpoint. The white student who attacked Bailey would face only simple battery and probation. The white man who pulled the gun on Bailey. however. would face no consequence. Ultimately. Bailey would be charged with theft of a firearm for wrestling the gun away. Later. racial taunting directed at black students in the high school cafeteria would lead to a fight in which a white student would be injured and sent to the hospital.

Today. since the Federal Government continues to run a deficit. although under our Presidents leadership with more tax revenue from economic growth. it is falling. But right now. the money for a earmark can only come from one of three sources. number one. by raiding the Social Security trust fund. Is the earmark worth taking money away from our seniors? Under the Democrats. we now have a plan for the single largest tax increase in history. almost $3.000 per family. More earmarks lead to more taxes. Is it worth putting a $3.000 tax burden on a family of four to pay for the Charlie Rangel Museum to himself? Or debt to our children and grandchildren? Is the Charlie Rangel Museum to himself. is that worth passing on $2 million of debt to our children and grandchildren? It is not worth passing on that debt to my children. and It is not worth passing on that debt to the children of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Texas. much less the children of the people of America.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to recognize the 25th anniversary of Sherwood Oaks. a nonprofit continuing care retirement community located in Cranberry Township. Pennsylvania. This Silver Anniversary is not only noteworthy in itself. but the story behind Sherwood Oaks is quite extraordinary. Sherwood Oaks was created by a handful of unpaid \"ordinary\" Pittsburgharea seniors who. in seeking a community in which they themselves wanted to live. turned a farmers field into what has since evolved into a vibrant senior living community of some 400 residents. These determined and ambitious dreamers--Sally Dewees. Martha Leonard. Jane T. Locke and Margaret McCoydid their homework by researching communities in the area and around the country. and. in order to make their vision a reality. enthusiastically spread their ideas within the community. On September 1. 1982. the founders and the construction board--Norman and Sally Dewees. Frank and Betty Hess. Jean and Craig Stockdale. Dorothy Van der Vort. and Richard McCoyrealized the fruits of their labor when Sherwood Oaks officially opened its doors to its original 53 residents. I want to thank Paul Winkler. the president and CEO of Presbyterian SeniorCare for bringing this story to my attention. Paul serves as the board chair of PANPHA. an association of some 360 nonprofit senior service providers throughout Pennsylvania. and I have asked him to convey my best wishes to the Sherwood Oaks community when he represents PANPHA at a celebratory event scheduled for Friday. September 28.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor the memory of one of our former colleagues. Congressman Charlie Vanik. For 26 years. he was an admirable spokesman not only for the people of his district. but for the Nation. During his time in office. Congressman Vanik was one of Congresss most vocal advocates for human rights. In 1974. he coauthored an amendment to a trade law that required the United States to assess the human rights records of foreign countries before granting them special privileges. This law put pressure on the Soviet Union to allow freer emigration. and as a result. more than 2 million people were able to leave the Soviet Union in search of a better life. While he was a Member of Congress. he never forgot where he came from or the people he represented. During his time in office he helped to pass several Federal programs. including the Federal school lunch program. that would help the people in his district and throughout the country improve their livelihoods. In addition. he is remembered by his former colleagues as a savvy. gifted speaker who had the ability to make every person in a room smile. Madam Speaker and colleagues. please join me in remembering the life of Congressman Charlie Vanik. May he rest in peace. and may his service to his country and to this body always be remembered honorably. He is survived by his wife. Betty. his son. Jon. his daughter. Phyllis. and two grandchildren.",

The legislation also directs the Secretary of Education to convene a summit of higher education experts to showcase best practices in the field of sustainability. Hundreds of U.S. cities and companies as well as international agencies. including the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 153. Pt. 18 United Nations and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. are advancing sustainable practices in all arenas. As population growth. urban development and extreme weather incidents place greater stress on ecosystems around the globe. the need for developing innovative approaches to sustainable development becomes critical to our economic competitiveness. environmental health. and the strength of our communities. The \"Higher Education Sustainability Act\" would facilitate the development of programs that keep American students on the cutting edge of technology and global competition while benefiting our communities. The legislation also provides funds to establish rigorous benchmarks for evaluating programs. ensuring that sustainability graduates meet industry standards for best practices. With the threat of global warming looming larger every day. we must invest now in the research and human capital needed to address its impacts and sustain our economy and our communities.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. for too many people in this country. love comes with bruises. broken bones. and black eyes. Twenty years ago. the first Domestic Violence Awareness Month was observed. In the past 20 years. there are programs. education. and funding dedicated to preventing domestic violence. but domestic violence is still a dangerous reality for too many Americans. One in every four women will be a victim of domestic violence during her lifetime. But domestic violence doesnt discriminateit affects everyonemen. women. and children of every race. ethnicity. religion. and economic status. It affects the workplace. increases health care costs. and spurs even more violence among children who witness it at home. The cost of domestic violence is staggeringover $5.8 billion each year. Domestic violence happens during dating and in marriages. Children who witness domestic violence at home do poorly in school. use drugs and alcohol at an early age. and are more likely to engage in violent behavior themselves. Boys who witness domestic violence are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults. As a former prosecutor and judge. I founded the Congressional Victim Rights Caucus to advocate for crime victims. I sponsored H. Res. 590 to declare October 2007 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. October EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 153. Pt. 18 will raise awareness of the increasing number of abusers who murder their victims and then take their own lives. in addition to the financial strain experienced by domestic violence victims. including loss of employment and loss of housing. In October. thousands of victim advocacy organizations. State coalitions. and community groups will hold events to bring awareness to the violence that affects men. women. and children every single year. Community awareness about domestic violence allows victims to seek helpit creates shelters for domestic violence victims to seek refuge in. holds abusers accountable. and helps children live in nonviolent homes. In the past. Congresss support of this month has led to an increasing number of local community groups. religious organizations. health care provides. corporations. and media addressing domestic violence in communities. Congress has been instrumental in increasing the funding for programs located under the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA. but there is still a need for further awareness of domestic violence. Lets send a message to domestic violence victims that Congress is their voice. And thats just the way it is.",

I find it unconscionable that the socalled death tax. or. in a more technical sense. the estate tax. would go back up to 55 percent. and that a subsequent generation on a farm or ranch would have to come up with cash to inherit that farm or ranch. That is sad. That is unAmerican. I think it is insensitive to taxpayers. and I think it has an immense disregard for the future and economic impact that that would have. I think too many people think that only certain departments of the grocery store really come from agriculture. as we would think of it.

Born in Salt Lake City. Utah. on June 3. 1922. she moved to Carmel. California with her family when she was 10. She attended Reed College in Oregon and was married for awhile to jazz critic Grover Sales. Enid operated a vineyard in Calistoga for 10 years. In 1962. she became the first woman in California to hold a state general contractors license. In the mid1970s she served as the head of the rehabilitation department of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. One of her most memorable accomplishments was organizing and moving 12 Victorian homes in a single night. She shut down the transit system and traffic lights and completed the entire job in time for the next mornings commute. Enid moved back to Carmel in 1986. She was the first chairwoman of the citys Historic Resources Board and founded her own Carmel Preservation Foundation. She was also on the board of the Alliance of Monterey Area Preservationists. Her \"roll up her sleeves and take no prisoners\" approach is credited with saving Carmels Sunset Center and the George Marsh Building in Monterey. as well as many of the original cottages that define Carmels charm. Enids legacy is to be seen in the recent upswing of interest in \"heritage tourism.\" It was her vision that preserving our historic buildings would make good economic sense. and not be done just for esthetic or sentimental reasons. Enid was a giant in the world of historic preservation. Few people can maintain such fierce tenacity to fight through to the end against all odds. Enid Sales had that fighting spirit. and she will be greatly missed. Madam Speaker. I rise to honor Enid Sales for her dedication to preserving history. She is survived by her daughter Rachel Lopez. her grandchildren Esther and Valley. her sisterinlaw Barbara Thompson. and her nephews Peter. Matthew. and John Thompson. We will all miss her dearly.",

This is urgent legislation. and I thank the leadership in both the House and the Senate for ensuring its swift passage. We are all united in our commitment to provide every assurance to students and families that there will be no disruption in the Federal student loan programs. regardless of what is happening in the financial markets in our country. As of today. no student has been unable to find a lender for a Federal student loan. However. we are not going to wait until students and families are denied loans before putting safeguards in place. Today is the day that many incoming freshman students must decide which college they will attend in the fall. Financial aid is a critical consideration for that decision process. We can leave no doubt in the minds of students. families or campuses about the availability of that aid. That is why we must send this legislation to the President for his signature without delay. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will provide muchneeded liquidity to the student loan marketplace by authorizing the Secretary of Education on a temporary basis to purchase student loans so that lenders have the funds to make new loans.

Pt. 6 May 1. 2008 hearing on the question of student loan availability. And at that time. Secretary Spellings from the Department of Education came in and said that the administration was merely \"monitoring the situation.\" and expressed some diffidence and confusion about whether or not in fact the Federal Government really had a role to play in terms of being lender of last resort. During the last 6 weeks. what we have seen is the collapse of Bear Stearns. we have seen lenders withdrawing from the student loan market. and a clear signal that the subprime mortgage crisis Is in fact extending to the student loan market. In Connecticut. the Connecticut Commissioner of Higher Education Mike Meotti and the Director of Financial Aid at University of Connecticut. who I met with. confirmed the fact that they were seeing some withdrawal from the market and a need to step up their activity in terms of giving students more help as they enter a very challenging year. again. because of what is happening in the financial markets. This legislation. which now the administration has come around in support of. will in fact strengthen the Direct Student Loan program and will confirm that the Federal Government will in fact be a lender of last resort so that it will make sure that. in August and September. students and families will not be running into difficulty and will in fact be able to go to college in the fall. The Federal Government acted swiftly to help Bear Stearns. an investment bank which frankly morally and ethically didnt deserve the help. Millions of students. however. do. And this legislation. which will clearly confirm that the Federal Government has a role to play going into the summer months as students reach out to get financial assistance. that in fact the doors of colleges and universities will remain open.

This bill Is a model for bipartisan cooperation.

It is very badly needed. and the passage of it will allow us to expand upon the gains that this Congress has made in the dual goals of access and affordability. And let me just quickly reflect on those. We have significantly reduced student loan Interest rates. We have significantly increased the Pell Grant maximum. We have overridden the administrations recommendation to eliminate the SCOG program. We have overridden the administrations recommendation to eliminate the Perkins Loan program. We have done all of this on a bipartisan basis. and we have done all of this with a focus on keeping student need and student interests uppermost in our mind. There are several very positive features of this bill. Let me talk just about three of them. The first is seeing to it that we maintain liquidity in the student loan market. a situation that is forced upon us by factors that have nothing to do with the Student Loan program. The second is the increase in loan limits on an annual basis. The most important element of this is that it will reduce student reliance on private lending. and that certainly is a goal of ours. to see to it that students have access to government regulated loans as opposed to private loans. And. lastly. the easing of the repayment requirements for the parent loan will be enormously helpful to needy families and the students of those families. So I again want to commend leadership on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol for working so quickly on this.

This important legislation will make it illegal to transport an animal across State or international borders for the purpose of fighting. prohibits use of the mail system to promote animal fighting. and criminalizes interstate buying. selling. or transportation of knives or gaffs used for animal fighting. Animal fighting is a deplorable activity with a purely negative impact on society. In cockfights. when two birds fight with blades or gaffs attached to their feet. at least one. and sometimes both of the birds are killed. Dogs who are made to fight often sustain severe injuries such as deep wounds and broken bones. Subsequent to fights. many dogs die of blood loss. exhaustion. or shock. Fighting animals are usually subject to inhumane living conditions intended to make them more aggressive. sometimes denied adequate nutrition. and made to exercise until they are physically exhausted. In addition to the inexcusable harm inflicted on the animals. the fights also have negative effects on humans. Illegal gambling and drug trafficking are often closely tied to animal fighting operations. Also. animals bred to fight are abnormally aggressive. and pose a danger to the communities they live in if they were to get loose.

It says. \"Equal justice under law.\" But we have witnessed now in the last few weeks the unpeeling of a scandal where the executive branch fired eight wellperforming U.S. Attorneys because they would not do the political dirty work of the White House. And it is apparent now. as much as it has ever been. that we have to have a check and balance on the executive branch with Senate confirmation. I want to know why this is so viscerally important. In my district in western Washington. we had a gentleman named John McKay who was doing. by all rights. a good job as a U.S. Attorney for western Washington. But then there was this contentious election out there for Governor in 2004. and a bunch of Republicans were leaning on him to start a grand jury investigation alleging voter fraud because the vote came out in favor of the Democrat. He refused to do so because he said he didnt see any evidence of voter fraud. A little later what happens is he goes to the White House for a meeting about a prospective judgeship. and what do they ask him about? They say: How come Republicans are mad at you. at the White House. And he knows what they are mad about. is because they wouldnt go after this case where there was no evidence of voter fraud. It was apparent they were leaning on him. and. when he did not collapse. he was fired. Now. this is a situation where it is clear that we need Senate confirmation. And. by the way. I have written a letter to the President today saying the President should reinstate that U.S. Attorney while this matter is investigated.

This is purely a technical corrections bill. It adds nothing. it takes nothing away. Again. we passed a good piece of legislation 2 years ago. It has been implemented. but it will be implemented in a better way with these corrections. I have talked with the gentleman from Oregon and all he has to say is \"yes\" or \"no.\" Regarding Providence Hospital of Anchorage. we are looking for a solution to a problem.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1195 makes technical corrections to the Safe. Accountable. Flexible. Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users. or SAFETEALU. This is the third time we have worked to finalize these technical corrections to SAFETEALU. During the 109th Congress. the House passed H.R. 5689. a bill to make technical corrections to SAFETEALU in June During the summer and fall of 2006. we worked with the Senate to create H.R. 6233. which is a very similar product to the bill we are considering today. Now. we are trying again. As my colleagues have just said. H.R. 1195 makes numerous technical corrections to Federal surface transportation programs authorized by SAFETEALU. The technical corrections included in this bill have been identified by the Department of Transportation and are mostly of a conforming nature. or to correct drafting errors. The most important correction we are making is to strengthen the Federal Highway research program by ensuring the continuation of the legacy research programs carried out by the Department of Transportation. The majority of this bill is section 105. which makes changes to over 200 of the high priority projects in sec. 1702 of SAFETEALU. These changes address \"broken\" surface transportation projects. clarifying recipients and increasing certain project funding levels and decreasing others to achieve budget neutrality. There is one purely technical correction that is not included in this package. SAFETEALU inadvertently changed certain regulations for trucks with a gross vehicle weight oi less than 10.000 pounds. One of the implications of this error is that operators of these trucks no longer have to register or file insurance with DOT. Consequently. DOT can not regulate them for safety purposes. When Congress passed SAFETEALU. this change was not a policy change Congress knew about or intended to make. If Congress wanted to make this change. we would have debated and discussed it. Rather. this was something we were not aware of and has had very serious unintended consequencesespecially for small businesses. 153. Pt. 6 March 26. 2007 I hope the Chairman. along with our colleagues in the Senate. will work with me to correct this technical problem. Despite the omission of this important correction.

Created by the Iowa General Assembly in 1858. the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm was designated the first landgrant college when Iowa became the first state to accept the terms of the Federal Morrill Act in 1864. The act allowed Iowa to sell Federal land to finance a new college open to all. regardless of wealth. race or sex. offering a practical education in engineering. agriculture. and military science as well as classical studies. and sharing research knowledge with all Iowans. Iowa State University officially opened in 1869 and was the first coeducational landgrant school. Today. we are proudly celebrating the 150th anniversary of Iowa State University. Iowa State University has been a leader in science in technology throughout its long history. The worlds first electronic digital computer was developed at Iowa State by math and physics professor John V. Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry. in the late 1930s. Their invention. the ABC computer. has been called the most important technological innovation of the 20th century.

Iowa State is one of the top three U.S. universities in the development of patentable biotechnology. Last February. the Iowa Board of Regents approved a $32 million budget and conceptual design for a new biorenewables research laboratory at Iowa State University.

Cleveland Heights. and Shaker Heights. They have seen an increase in section 8 housing and are beginning to see a clash in culture between owners and renters. between those who have long time been owners and those who are new at renting property. It is very important that when we start to look at some of the urban centers. some of the older housing. we start looking at the interring suburbs with older housing. and even the newer suburban municipalities. that we have an opportunity to reform how we have section 8 housing and how it is used. The reform provisions in this bill will not only open access to lowincome Americans to rent and even buy. it will provide incentives so that the program can truly serve its purpose of empowering people to become selfsufficient. Certainly. as we have gone through this whole year or past 2 or 3 years where we have had predatory lenders preying upon our communities. we want to be able to give those new homeowners an opportunity to understand what homeownership means. to understand what kind of situation they could put themselves in without the necessary education.

Mr. FRANK. and our subcommittee chairwoman. Congresswoman WATERS. for their leadership and for their hard work in crafting this bill. As a former member of the Financial Services Committee. actually a member of Congresswoman WATERS Subcommittee on Housing. I had the opportunity to work with my colleagues on earlier versions of this bill. and this end product contains many important updated provisions. For example. this bill permits families to use housing vouchers as a down payment on a firsttime home purchase. The goal of home ownership is necessary to help stabilize family units. promote gainful employment. and restore pride and dignity to many lowincome families. It is the primary path to wealth accumulation in America for ordinary folks who dont have stock accounts and who cant play in the stock market and on Wall Street. Its the way to achieve the American Dream for most folks in America. And so home ownership is extremely important. and this bill offers that opportunity. It also offers a number of changes that protect and benefit tenants. Examples include the portability provisions that preserve voucher families ability to move to other areas as they determine. They deserve that right and should be able to do that. It provides for more accurate and fair market rent calculation. And it also protects voucher holders in units that are in need of repairs. Section 8 housing vouchers provide the security of affordable housing to many lowincome families. the elderly. people with disabilities. and others who need this type of rental assistance. This leads to stronger families and safer communities. and it does prevent homelessness. There is a housing crisis in America. This bill is a major step forward in addressing it.",

Today is the due date for Americans to file their tax returns. On this day. It is wise for the House to consider a bill to increase taxpayer protection and expand outreach efforts to millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker. this is an important bill. this is a timely bill. The Taxpayer Protection Act is a result of a hearing held by the Oversight Subcommittee that I chair. H.R. 1677 is an important first step in standing up. really standing up for the American taxpayer. It is a shame that people use fraudulent tax schemes to steal Social Security numbers and financial information from Americans. This legislation protects taxpayers from misleading Web sites and identity theft. H.R. 1677 provides higher penalties for persons who use either Web site names that may be confused with the official IRS Web site or mass emails that appear to be from the IRS. This bill requires the IRS to notify you if your identity is stolen in a tax scam. You should not become more vulnerable for being a responsible citizen. The Taxpayer Protection Act prohibits the IRS from providing certain information to businesses that the IRS believes make predatory loans based on tax refunds. These shortterm loans often charge interest rates sometimes above 100 percent that victimize lowincome workers. H.R. 1677 will also assist with efforts to reach millions of working Americans who are eligible to claim the earned Income tax credit. These taxpayers often do not take advantage of the EITC. They have a right to know of all benefits available to them. Under this bill. the IRS will expand its current outreach program to help more lowincome Americans receive this tax credit. a credit which lifts millions of families out of poverty each year. This bipartisan legislation moves us in the right direction to make tax issues simpler and clearer for the average person. We must fight poverty. fight fraud. and provide these basic protections for all Americans. Mr. Speaker. I fully support the Taxpayer Protection Act. and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote \"yes\" for H.R. 1677. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

It requires the IRS to notify those who would be eligible for a tax break.

Mr. Speaker. when a husband and wife owns a business together. they are really collecting only one paycheck. They should only have to pay taxes once.",

Today being tax day. it is appropriate that we speak about this issue. and it is mostly good work. I would commend the individuals who worked on this. It is mostly good work. but I would suggest. Mr. Speaker. that real protection requires real reform. and the real solution to the challenges that we face as Americans. all of us in our tax system. is that we need fundamental reform. This is an appropriate bill and kind of tinkers with the margins of our tax system. and I think those modifications are. as I mentioned. appropriate and a step in the right direction. but our current system is extremely regressive and extremely unfair. So. to talk about the earned income tax credit. its an appropriate thing to notify people who dont know that they are eligible for that. However. there are embedded taxes in everything that we purchase that make our system right now much more regressive than it ought be. There is legislation available that would. in fact. promote fundamental reform. It would capture all of the underground economy that is fully a third of our current economy. nearly $1 trillion. It would reward those kinds of things that we say that we want. like hard work and success and entrepreneurship and vision and all those wonderful American ideals. That bill is H.R. 25. It is the fair tax. the national retail sales tax. It would bring about true fundamental reform and would bring about true protection for the American taxpayer. So I commend the individuals who brought forward H.R. 1677. and I would suggest. Mr. Speaker. that this is a 53. Pt. 6 9017 small step in the right direction. However. real reform requires real change. Fundamental reform to our tax system is what is needed. and I am hopeful that in relatively short order we will be able to embrace each other with real fundamental reform to our entire tax system on the floor of this House.",

Too often. middleclass taxpayers find themselves confused and frustrated by the complexity of the tax code. Over 60 percent of taxpayers now use a paid preparer to file their tax retum. costing them hundreds or thousands of dollars that they could have used for college. health care. or retirement. This legislation provides overdue relief for taxpayers that will protect them from fraud. require the IRS to do a better job of communicating which tax credits a taxpayer can qualify for. and hold tax cheats accountable for their actions. Today is Tax Day. and this legislation sends a message to taxpayers that help is on the way. Hearings held by Chairman JOHN LEWIS provided ample evidence that taxpayers are too often exposed to identify theft or unaware of potential benefits. The Taxpayer Protection Act will require the IRS to notify taxpayers involved in tax fraud investigations that there may have been an unauthorized use of their identities. will provide filers with a longer period of time to seek restitution from the IRS for a wrongful penalty. punish predatory lenders. and require the IRS to promote the Earned Income Tax Credit so that more Americans can take care of a tax benefit they have earned but have not been notified. Madam Speaker. Tax Day can be a difficult day for many Americans. Let us do our part to make commonsense reforms that put the government back on the side of the average taxpayer. I thank Mr. RANGEL. the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. for his leadership on this issue. and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1677. the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007.",

I would note that its consideration today is particularly timely as millions of hardworking Americans file their tax returns. Those workers and families deserve to know that their government is taking every step to protect the sensitive data contained in those returns and to enhance taxpayer rights. Identity theft is a large and growing problem in our society. and unfortunately. a lack of vigilance on the part of the IRS has contributed to that problem. One criminal who testified before the Senate Finance Committee last week detailed how he stole $1.1 million from the Treasury by using stolen identities to claim fraudulent refunds. While this individual is rightly serving time in prison. we must act to prevent such crimes in the future. This legislation contains a number of common sense provisions to accomplish just that. including a requirement that the IRS notify a taxpayer if it discovers that there may have been an unauthorized use of the taxpayers identity during the course of a tax fraud investigation and the authority for the IRS to notify taxpayers on the Intemet about unclaimed tax refunds. It also increases penalties on misleading websites that use government names and symbols to engage in the fraudulent practice known as \"phishing. \" I am also pleased that it enhances Earned Income Tax Credit outreach so that every taxpayer who is eligible for this credit realizes its benefits.

I introduced this bill with the Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. ToM DAVIS. I want to thank Ranking Member DAVIS for working with me to move this bill. I also want to thank Chairman REYES and Representative HARMAN for their cooperation on this bill and for their leadership on this issue. In addition. I want to recognize Representative CLAY for his work on this issue. The 9/11 Commission recommended providing incentives for information sharing. \"to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge.\" But unfortunately. that advice has not been heeded. We continue to see the Federal Government fostering secrecy using the tool of overclassification. As the 9/11 Commission pointed out in its report. \"(c]urrent security requirements nurture overclassification and excessive compartmentalization of information among agencies. Each agencys incentive structure opposes sharing. with risks . . . but few rewards for sharing information. No one has to pay the longterm costs of overclassifying information. though these costseven in literal financial termsare substantial.\" H.R. 6575 would require the Archivist to promulgate regulations to prevent the overclassification of information. This bill would increase accountability by allowing individuals to challenge decisions to classify information and requiring that successful challenges be rewarded. The bill improves oversight of classification decisions by requiring the Inspector General of each affected agency to randomly audit classified information to determine whether the appropriate procedures were followed and to provide recommendations for improvements. It also requires training for employees to proactively prevent overclassification. The problem of overclassification is governmentwide and it demands a govemmentwide solution. In order to improve information sharing. every agency that has employees with the authority to classify documents must be held accountable. This bill does that. I urge support for H.R. 6575.",

Certainly when a member is deployed. but throughout a military members career. the strength and support of a wife or husband can make the difference between success or failure for that individual and that family. Military spouses endure the hardship of separation from loved ones. frequently take on the role of a single parent. and move more often than most civilians throughout the course of a military career. They receive no commendation medals and few accolades. save the gratitude of an exhausted spouse who comes home to a warm embrace and nurturing bond after a long deployment or simply another late night at work.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation. cosponsored by Ms. SNOWE and Mr. BINGAMAN. to better educate Americans about climate change. We are today introducing the Climate Change Education Act. to broaden Americans understanding of global warming. There may still be disputes about exactly how much humans contribute to the warming of our atmosphere. But there is near certainty that the air we breathe is being changed by ever increased levels of greenhouse gases. with effects on climate. resources. and habitats. Last week. I attended a hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee. where the issue of climate change was shown to also affect our national security. A report issued by a panel of distinguished military leaders concluded that climate change will be globally destabilizing. leading to diminished access to fresh water. reduced food production as India and subSaharan Africa become hotter and drier. increased health crises as vectorborne diseases spread. and displacement of large populations as sea levels rise and coastal lands flood. As scarcities increase. conflicts over diminishing resources will also increase. Governments in resourcestressed countries may collapse. Environmental stresses may lead to human migration and refugees. I mention this to emphasize that climate change has surprising ramifications. and that there is still much that we can all learn about this issue. with effects that go well beyond traditional environmental concerns. It is important that we all become better informed. that we analyze the information about climate change. so that we can learn how to more rationally respond. We believe it is important to educate our Nation about the causes and effects of climate change and about how we might effectively respond. Reaching a solution to the challenge of climate change will require changes in both national policy and in our use of energy and resources. All of this will require a thoughtful understanding of the issue. The Climate Change Education Act would create a program at the National Science Foundation. which would provide opportunities for students and citizens to learn more about global warming. The program would include a national information campaign to promote new approaches to addressing climate change and would also establish a competitive program to provide grants to develop education materials. Earlier this month. the House of Representatives passed the campanion. H.R. 1728. to this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

I want to first say thank you to all the volunteers and service workers everywhere. They take time out of their lives to help their fellow Americans in their time of need. and they do it out of the goodness of their hearts. I love AmeniCorps. I love what they do for communities. I love what they do for America. AmeniCorps is stronger than ever. Since its creation in 1994. 500.000 people nationwide have joined the program and taken the AmeniCorps pledge to \"get things done for America.\" AmeniCorps members have served more than 630 million hours nationwide. To date. 9.310 Maryland residents have earned education awards totaling over $30 million. These awards help volunteers pay for college. graduate school. vocational training. or to pay back student loans. The NCO program. which has a campus in Perry Point. MD. is a fulltime residential program for 18- to 24yearolds designed to strengthen communities and develop leaders through teambased service projects. Each year. approximately 1.100 participants reside in its 5 campuses nationwide. The Perry Point campus houses 200 AmeniCorps members every year. and since 1994 its residents have logged more than 400.000 service hours. AmeniCorps is the embodiment of the spirit of volunteerism and service to our country. They tackle the toughest problems in our communities: tutoring teens. starting neighborhood crime watches. turning vacant lots into neighborhoods. and helping communities clean up and rebuild after natural disasters. AmeniCorps volunteers are unflagging. unflinching and determined to make a difference. I know how important AmeniCorps is to communities across the country and to the young people who want to serve. We are so grateful for all the hard work that they do. I fought to create AmeniCorps and I will continue to fight to strengthen AmeniCorps so it can continue to help local communities meet local needs.

H.R. 1124. the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999. will reauthorize funding for the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant. the DCTAG program. which will help promote higher education for high school graduates in the District of Columbia. DCTAG provides grants for District high school students to attend public colleges and universities nationwide at Instate tuition rates. Additionally. the bill provides smaller grants for District students to attend private institutions in the D.C. metropolitan area and to attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities nationwide. The impact of this legislation on the community and in the lives of the students who receive the grants cannot be minimized. DCTAG reaches students and communities where there is no hope of being able to obtain a college education. This is particularly true for many of the students that participate in DCTAG. Fiftyeight percent of the students who participate in the program come from lowincome households. Furthermore. students that participate are attending educational institutions that are known to nurture students of color. Five of the top 10 schools these students attend are HBCUs: Hampton University. Morehouse College. Virginia Union University. St. Augustines College. and Bennett College. While students from all races participate in the program and attend over 270 institutions in 47 States. including nationally recognized public institutions like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. the University of Illinois. the University of CaliforniaBerkeley. and Ohio State University. this program serves a community that is lacking resources for students of color from lowincome households.

This bill will have a major beneficial impact on the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay and many of its 150 tributary streams and rivers. We invite and encourage you to join us as original cosponsors. Like many of Americas natural resources. the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers continue to be plagued by pollution. Unfortunately. agriculture accounts for a significant part of the nitrogen. phosphorus and sediment running to the Bay. The House will soon take up the 2007 farm bill which will provide billions of dollars a year for farm conservation programs and therefore. provides an unparalleled opportunity for our region to address its critical conservation needs CHESSEA would bring significant new federal technical and financial assistance to farmers and landowners in the Bay watershed states to help them in their efforts to reduce nitrogen. phosphorus. and sediment runoff into the streams and rivers that run to the Chesapeake Bay. It would also provide additional incentives for the regions farmers to produce new sources of renewable energy that will simultaneously improve water quality and reduce the impact of fossil fuel consumption on the atmosphere. Over the past five years. several Chesapeake Bay states have committed significant new funding to try to reach the goals of the federalstate Chesapeake 2000 agreement. which set specific pollution reduction goals for 2010. In spite of those commitments. we are far from meeting the 2010 goals. The experts have estimated that in order to meet our clean up pledge. the Federal Government will have to provide $200 million a year. This legislation would help to fulfill the Federal Governments Chesapeake 2000 commitment to reduce nitrogen. phosphorus. and sediment pollution to the Bay while at the same time helping the regions agriculture and rural areas. The Chesapeake Bay and several of the major rivers that feed it. including the Susquehanna. the Potomac. and the James. are among Americas most stunning natural teatures. Approximately 400 years ago. Captain John Smith and the Jamestown settlers sailed into a Chesapeake Bay that was healthy. balanced. and among the worlds most biologically productive places. Today. the Bay and its rivers are sadly diminished.

I could not have been more proud. The fuel. which is made from vegetable oil. methanol. and lye. will be used to make tractors and buses run cleaner. more efficiently. and in a cost effective manner. Additionally. everything in the process is 100 percent biodegradable. The idea for the project began after a seminar at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. Tennessee that called upon area schools to research altemative fuels. Not only did these inventive students and educators take it upon themselves to develop their own biodiesel. the Family and Consumer Science class is looking at ways to make soap from the glycerin that settles to the bottom of the mixture as it develops. There are plans to market the soap as a fundraiser for the school if efforts to make it are successful. I applaud the actions of these students and the encouragement they are getting from their teachers. These students are receiving life lessons and skills they will be able to keep with them forever. They will not only be passing along these lessons to family and mends. these students are poised to go on to great things in the field of alternative/renewable energies. There is no quick solution to the rising cost of fuel due to current demands and the lack of infrastructure to support renewable and alternative fuels. The long term solution will be in our ability to commit and invest in the development of these fuels.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today I am introducing the CSRS Retirement Repayment Technical Correction Act of 2007. This bill would correct an unintended consequence that followed the enactment of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101508) on November 5. 1990. and provide relief for Federal employees who were adversely affected by that enactment. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 made retroactive changes to the rules related to separating Federal employees. While the rules were made retroactive to October 1. 1990. the implementing regulations were not promulgated until February 1991. This four month period between the enactment of the law and the promulgation of the implementing regulations has adversely affected any Federal employee who withdrew their retirement contributions during this period. This matter was brought to my attention by Sandra Schatz Landis. my constituent who was on maternity leave from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). a former bureau of the Department of Justice at the time in question. On November 5. 1990. Ms. Landis withdrew $24.439.00 in retirement contributions and was advised that if she later reentered federal service. she could redeposit the withdrawal without paying interest and not sufier any adverse consequences. Unbeknownst to Ms. Landis and the personnel specialists at INS who were advising her. because of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that occurred on that very same day. November 5. 1990. employees who withdrew their retirement contributions as far back as October 1. 1990 were suddenly required to repay their withdrawn contributions with interest in order to have the prior service included in their annuity calculation. What is unfair about this is that employees had no warning that the rules under which they were making major financial decisions were changing. If Ms. Landis were to make this repayment today. she would have to refund over $58.000 of which $34.000 is interest. This is just one example of an unintended injustice that must be corrected.",

I am pleased today to introduce legislation to provide that Federal employees stationed in American Samoa be paid the same nonforeign area costofliving allowance as stationed in Guam or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. To date. American Samoa is the only nonforeign area in which Federal employees do not receive a costofliving allowance. Given that American Samoa faces many of the same issues driving higher prices for goods. services. and travel that face other territories in similar situations. it seems discriminatory that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has chosen not to provide COLA to Federal employees in American Samoa. Further exacerbating this problem is the fact that \"post differential\" compensation is paid to Federal employees who are working here who have come in from other areas of the country. As a result. the only nonforeign area Federal employees who do not receive any additional compensation are those Federal employees from American Samoa. working in American Samoa. This legislation would remedy that inequity by providing COLA for our Federal employees at the same rate as has been determined by OPM to apply in Guam and CNMI. I urge my colleagues to join me in resolving this issue by supporting this legislation that would provide fair compensation to American Samoas Federal employees.",

These are acres the oil companies and gas companies. themselves. purchased. Nobody forced them into it. Nobody twisted their arms. They sought these acres because they knew there was oil and gas underneath them. Theyre not randomly chosen. There are 44 million acres where we know theres oil and gas. Thats why the oil and gas companies made a conscious decision to purchase the leases. so that they could have them because they know theres oil and gas underneath. These are not lands and parts of the Outer Continental Shelf where there is no oil or gas. That is simply incorrect.",

Do Congressional Democrats really trust the Chinese that much more than Americans?\" That was from June 11 of this year. Minority Whip ROY BLUNT: \"Even China recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores. thanks to Fidel Castro. theyve been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the Florida Keys. U.S. energy producers cant go there. and thats because our Congress wont let them.\" That was also on June 11. But then. as you stated earlier. Congressional Research Service says. facts. thirdparty validator. nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: \"While there has been some concern about Chinas potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects. to date its involvement in Cubas oil sector has been focused on onshore extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its staterun China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec).\" From the Miami Herald. they had a quote from Jorge Pinon. an energy expert at the University of Miami: \"China is not drilling in Cubas Gulf of Mexico waters. period.\" This gentleman. from Miamis Center for Hemispheric Policy. who supports oil and gas exploration. said he met with several congressional offices Wednesday about the ChinaCuba connection.

Mr. KING. had to say regarding biofuels. I think that there are ways in which various biofuels. including corn. but especially cellulosic biofuels and nonfood crops can and should be used to extend the liquid fuels capacity of this country. But the main reason that Im here tonight is because Ive heard in the last several days a nonstop drum beat. a chorus singing from the same choir book and the same hymn book at every committee meeting I have been at. at every press conference I have heard. at every chance I see a Republican representative on television blaming the Democrats for the high price of gasoline and claiming. erroneously. that Democrats have been stopping drilling. that Democrats are opposed to drilling. and therefore were responsible for the price of gas. This is not only false but ridiculous on the face of it. And I challenge it as a falsehood. Specifically. I would say that over the last 8 years. the number of drilling permits issued by the government has gone up by 361 percent. So the lands are open. The oil companies own 9.700 plus leases that they have bid on and received the leases for. And as you say.",

Bush said. when oil was going for $50 a barrel. that that was all the incentive the oil companies need. They dont need any more tax breaks or incentives. Fifty dollars a barrel is enough incentive to make them drill anywhere. As this chart will show you. the total Federal acres leased and in production in 2007 were 91.5 million acres leased but producing only 23.7 million acres. There is a huge discrepancy between land that has been leased by the oil companies and that which they are using to actually drill and produce oil. Why is this?

This new farm bill continues agricultural policies which have allowed Americas farmers to help feed the world. I believe that the farm bill promotes agricultural stability and diversification. agriculturebased renewable energy production. and good conservation and land stewardship practices. As with any complicated piece of legislation. there are tradeoffs and concerns. For instance. payment limitation reform progressed. but did not go far enough in my view. Even though Im going to vote to override the Presidents veto. I do commend the administration for its considerable efforts to highlight the need for reform. particularly in the area of payment limitations. Im also pleased that the farm bill conference report includes three of my initiatives. First. a new rural energy selfsufficiency initiative that would provide grants to rural communities seeking to become energy selfsufficient through the use of renewable sources such as wind and solar and biofuels and biomass. Additionally. there is a new provision allowing school systems and other governmental institutions to purchase local foods from local farmers. promoting agricultural sustainability and diversification. And there is a change to the valueadded producer grants program that would help target assistance to farmers with small or midsized farms who develop new uses and creative marketing strategies for their product. Mr. Speaker. the development of this important legislation has taken several years. This ground has been plowed long enough. I believe this bill deserves merit. I wish to thank our ranking member.

Sixteen percent of this bill provides a responsible safety net for farmers when the market turns south. And lets make no mistake. Farmers dont want to farm for a government check. Farmers want to farm for the market. And what is the cost to the American taxpayer? Six cents a day. In my mind. six cents a day is not too much to pay to ensure that we continue to have the safest. most abundant food supply at the lowest cost. Now. we have seen what happens when we offshore or energy production. What will happen when we offshore our food production? Thank the Lord above. literally. thank the Lord above that we can put three square meals a day on our tables from the bounty of our countrys own farmers. This bill is not perfect.

Mr. Speaker. a lot has been said here today about the bipartisan nature of this legislation. but when it passed the House last week. a majority on both sides of the aisle voted for this farm bill. and threequarters of all of the Members here did so. But we did so because there are provisions in this bill that are of interest to each side of the aisle. and sometimes there are very clear partisan differences. But nonetheless. the Republican side of the aisle received a number of concessions in the final negotiations of this bill: a provision that would have prohibited all 50 State food stamp programs to be able to reach out to technology companies and others to modernize and improve their food stamp program. something they have done many times in the recent past. A prohibition on that was removed from the bill. A provision in the bill that would have rolled back the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and provided increased food stamps for ablebodied adults without dependent children was removed from the bill. Provisions related to the DavisBacon legislation that many Members on my side of the aisle. including myself. were concerned about were removed from the bill. So this is a bipartisan bill because it was compromise and giveandtake on both sides of the aisle. I have also heard Members complain that this bill is not fiscally responsible. Its less than the last farm bill. It is less than either the Housepassed version of the bill or the Senatepassed version of the bill: $4 billion less than the House. $5 billion less than the Senate version. I ask any Member here in the House. when was the last time they recall that a bill came back from a conference between the House and the Senate and spent less money than either the House or Senate spent? And I would give you this overall picture. Americans spend about $1.2 trillion a year on food. The provisions in this bill related to the commodity title. the safety net for Americas farmers and ranchers. is about $7 billion or slightly less than onehalf of 1 percent of what Americans spend on food.",

The unfortunate situation is that apparentlyand again I just learned about this about an hour and a half ago when Mr. PETERSON. the chairman of the committee. told me he and Mr. GOODLATTE were discussing this problem and how to proceed. Apparently what happened is title III. which I understand is not very controversial. but in any event. title III came up on the screen for the printing on the parchment that is sent to the President. but. unfortunately. for whatever reasons. it was not printed out and it was not caught in the proofing of that. Apparently. as well. the White House did not catch the fact that the bill was not inclusive of title III. Frankly. I have not looked at the bill to see whether theres a title I. II. and then goes to IV. which would have been selfevident that there was a missing title. In any event. without having researched it or talked to anybody about precedents. what has happened is that the House and the Senate passed in exactly the same form that which was vetoed by the President. Now. we passed more than that. but that which we have just voted on was passed in both Houses in exactly the form we just voted on. The vote. therefore. superficially. off the top of my head. without having researched this. is that what we have done is we have passed that which we originally passed through the House and the Senate and sent to the President. notwithstanding the Presidents veto. and something that we did also pass. which was incorporated in that bill. was neither vetoed nor signed by the President because. unfortunately. as a result of a clerical error. it was not included in the bill. I. in discussions with Mr. PETERSON. understand that he and Mr. GOODLATTE were in discussion on this issue when they first learned of it. and I dont know how long they knew about it before I found out about it. that. as I thought. their agreement would be that we would pass. subsequent to passing the initial bill. the title III either by unanimous consent or under the suspension calendar.

The Federal Govemment has an obligation and moral responsibility to prevent this type of violence. including mandatory background checks at gun stores and gun shows and requiring safety devices that prevent guns from being used by someone other than the owner. Congress must reinstate the ban on assault style weapons and broaden it to include enhanced restrictions on many different assaultstyle guns that were not previously covered. A new ban should also direct the Attomey General to maintain a weapon database system of guns that have been used in violent crimes and submit the record to Congress each year.

I rise today in support of this resolution urging the designation of a National Glanzmanns Thrombasthenia Awareness Day. Discovered in Switzerland in 1918. Glanzmanns thrombasthenia. otherwise known as GT. is a rare and serious blood disorder that affects men. women. and children of all ages across the globe. The disease affects the ability of blood platelets to form. or clot. around the site of a broken blood vessel due to a deficiency of a specific protein on the surface of the platelet. Since the blood is unable to clot normally. those who suffer from GT are faced with uncontrollable. potentially lifethreatening blood loss and severe bruising. A very rare and little known hereditary disease. GT has severe emotional and physical effects on those who suffer from it. Children with GT often find themselves socially isolated as they are unable to participate in normal childhood activities such as sports or physically active play. There is no cure for this disease. and because it is so rare. there is little information on the symptoms and treatments. It is important that we support valuable organizations such as the Glanzmanns Thrombasthenia Research Foundation. founded by Helen P. Smith in 2001. in their effort to educate the public. promote awareness. and fund research of this serious disease.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today Congress is yet again faced with the choice of approving the Bush administrations unconstitutional expansion of executive branch authority in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. FISA. or defending the Constitution and protecting the civil liberties of Americans. The choice could not be more clear and consequences more grave. Passing this legislation today will be the enduring legacy of the Bush administration. It will provide the Congressional seal of approval for years of the White Houses stonewalling on Congressional oversight. eroding Congresss authority. and violating the Constitution. A vote in favor of H.R. 6304. the FISA Amendments Act. is a vote for the Bush administrations expansive interpretation of executive power and against the Constitution. Thats why I must oppose this legislation. H.R. 6304 permits mass. untargeted surveillance of all phone and email conversations entering or leaving the U.S. without basic. let alone adequate. protections for Americans civil liberties. Communications of millions of Americans will be swept up because of reduced reverse targeting protections and minimized court oversight. This bill enables the Government to walk through an enormous loophole by suspending prior court review of intelligence surveillance applications at their discretion. Additionally. there are no safeguards to protect Americans whose information is unintentionally obtained. H.R. 6304 dispenses with real oversight by the court. a requirement fundamental to upholding the Constitution. Furthermore. this legislation provides nothing less than de facto immunity for telecommunications companies that broke the law. District courts will be forced to dismiss pending cases if they receive a certification from the Attorney General that telecommunication companies were asked to turn over their customers records. There is no determination if the request was legal. No due process. No penalty. No accountability. Exactly what the Bush administration wanted all along. We should never sacrifice commitment to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances for broad. unbridled power to suspend Americans civil liberties at will. Unfortunately. this new FISA bill does just that. Elected officials have a solemn responsibility to defend our country. and. like my colleagues. I support a modernization of our intelligence laws. But being asked to support either our intelligence community or protecting civil liberties is a false and dangerous dichotomy. Benjamin Franklin once wrote that. \"those who would trade liberty for some temporary security. deserve neither liberty nor security.\" With this bill. I believe we have proven him right.",

This administration has expanded the powers of the government to monitor the actions of American citizens with. unfortunately. too little oversight from Congress or the courts. While I appreciate the efforts to reach a compromise on this legislation. H.R. 6304 does not go far enough to protect the rights of the American people. The legislation allows for retroactive immunity for telecommunication companies that participated in the Bush administrations warrantless wiretapping program. I also am concerned that most Members of Congress will not have access to important reports issued by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. this bill provides mechanisms to ensure that FISAs longstanding exclusivity is crystal clear. It states that only a new statute directly addressing the Executive branchs foreign intelligence surveillance authority can modify FISA. It provides clarity for the public and for telecommunications carriers by requiring requests for assistance to cite the statutory authority uuder which they are issued. In a January 19. 2006 White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities. the Justice Department made public a legal justification for the Presidents Terrorist Surveillance Program. TSP. It claimed that the President had an extrastatutory legal basis for foreign intelligence surveillance outside of FISA. both implicitly through an Authorization for the Use of Military Force or through a broad reading of Article II of the Constitution. Those arguments fly in the face of the longstanding doctrine of FISA exclusivity and are contrary to the plain language of the FISA statute. To be clear. the inclusion of these additional exclusivity mechanisms in this measure does not ratify the Administrations arguments with respect to the TSP. Nor does the bills treatment of liability issues in Title II stand for a Congressional ratification of the Administrations actions under the TSP. In conclusion. I would like to extend my thanks to a few additional staff who worked tirelessly over the past few months on this FISA compromise. including Margaret Cantrell of the Whips staff. Ted Kalo and Mark Dubester of the Judiciary Committee. Wyndee Parker of the Intelligence Committee. and Chris Healey of Senator ROCKEFELLERS Intelligence Committee staff.",

I would like to congratulate my friend on the great work he did on the legislation we passed both yesterday and today. Particularly the legislation today took a tremendous amount of effort on the majority leaders part to get that legislation to the floor. Im hopeful that the Senate. before we leave for the Fourth of July. will pass this and get it to the Presidents desk. Im convinced that the country will be significantly safer because of the tools weve given the intelligence community. But Im also convinced that we have done a lot to structure this process in a way that not only protects individual rights. but also requires the government to be more forthcoming with its rules and regulations. And both the leader and his staff did a great job on this. And I know personally because weve worked together on it. and spent days. hours and weeks trying to get to a bill that would come to the floor that would have a significant vote from the majority side. And virtually every Republican at the end of the day was able to be there. as we have been on these bills generally. But I am grateful to you. and I will just point out that while we almost got a majority of the majority voting for this. there wasnt a majority of the majority. And that makes it harder for a leader. And that can be easily overlooked. But this is something where you had to work hard to do what you thought was the right thing for the country. And Im grateful to you for it.",

We passed that. of course. as you know. approximately. maybe. a little over a year ago. The Senate did not include it in the SCHIP bill. of which the SCHIP was a part of the CHAMP bill. The only thing they passed was SCHIP. and they indicated to us at that point in time that they would certainly pass the Medicare reimbursement. That has not yet happened. Unfortunately. the failure of that to happen has now put us in a position where we are facing the June 30 expiration date of the authorization and. therefore. the 10 percent reduction.

This amendment ensures that national laboratory infrastructure changes will not interrupt security programs needed by DHS. When DRS was established. it inherited facilities around the Nation and from other agencies. some of which were aging and in need of repair. These capital facilities include critical components involving radiological and nuclear countermeasures. threat vulnerabilities and threat assessments. as well as work on biological and chemical countermeasures. In order for DHS to carry out its mission to protect our Nation. it is critical that the Department have the facilities that it needs. At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. PNNL. in Washington State. critical DHS research and development will be transferred to new facilities as existing labs are torn down for environmental cleanup activities at the 300 Area of the Hanford Federal nuclear site in my district. In 2006. the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology signed an MOU with the Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration that established funding commitments for the agencies involved in the transition of PNNLs facilities from the 300 Area to new lab space. This MOU underscores DHSs critical role in making sure national security related work at PNNL will not be Interrupted by this transition. This amendment I have introduced is not only important to the State of Washington and my constituents but also to our overall national security.

Ive seen the power of hope and the harms caused by those who give misinformation and false hope to patients and families. Too often. proponents of embryonic stem cell research promise an immediate cure to dying patients and their families. From a medical standpoint. embryonic stem cells have yet to produce a single human treatment. Embryonic cells also produce tumors and cause transplant rejection. Such techniques also raise grave ethical problems. The claim that most human embryos in fertility clinics \"will be discarded anyway\" is disingenuous. Research shows that \"the vast majority of stored embryos (88.2 percent) are being held for family building.\" Fortunately. science continues to discover more promising lines of stem cell research. Adult stem cells have already been used to treat a growing number of human diseases. Scientists at Harvard and Wake Forest University recently reported their success using stem cells in amniotic fluid and the placenta. They explained that these stem cells \"remain stable for years without forming tumors.\" All Americans depend on medical breakthroughs. Federal funding for all types of stem cell research rose above $609 million last year. Its disappointing that the Speaker would not permit a vote today to increase funding ior the most productive stem cell research. Last year. the Bartlett bill passed the Senate unanimously. I would have increased funding for embryonic stem cell research that doesnt destroy an embryo. including embryo biopsy. The current House leadership defeated it to score political points against the President. Its irresponsible for Congress to spend scarce federal tax dollars on lines of scientific research that have proven least effective. Evidence proves its possible to advance stem cell research without paying biomedical firms to destroy human embryos. Conclusion: For these reasons. I oppose H.R. 3 and urge my colleagues to oppose this bill as well.",

We as a country excel in so much. Let us push forward on important research rather than regressing.

In fact. the latest poll that was taken just last spring shows that only 39 percent support Federal funding of the approach found in this bill when they are informed that it requires the destruction of embryos. The CBS poll taken a year ago shows that only 37 percent of the American people support more Federal funds for more stem cell lines. Another number that is important is 700. That is the score of the diseases that have been successfully treated by the use of stem cells from adult and blood cord stem cells. zero of the number that have been treated successfully by embryonic stem cells. But more importantly. it seems to me as we deal with this issue. we should recall the words of Dr. Nigel Cameron. the founder of the journal called \"Ethics and Medicine.\" when he said in his testimony: \"Our membership in the human species is enough to distinguish the human embryo from all other laboratory artifacts.\" It is important for us to understand that human dignity is not reserved for adult human beings. And for us to say here at this time that human dignity is contingent upon arbitrary criteria such as size or location is a profound judgment that we make. It is for that reason that President Clintons National Bioethics Advisory Commission decided not to permit stem cell research using IVF embryos after finding that \"the derivation of stem cells from embryos remaining following fertility treatments is justifiable. only.\" it said. \"only if no less problematic alternatives are available for advancing the research.\" We have seen the evidence compounding. even since we were here on this floor. just last year. that there are morally appropriate alternatives.

It is evident that we will pass this bill today. but we know that hurdles remain before the measure is signed into law. Along the way. opponents of this legislation have been spreading mistruths about what embryonic stem cell research entails and what its promises are. How many times have we heard here on the floor today the claim that this research involves the creation of life in order to destroy it? So I reiterate again. the bill explicitly states that only embryos created for in vitro fertilization that would otherwise be discarded and are being discarded every day can be used for this type of research and only with the explicit consent. permission given explicitly by the donors. and also that no Federal dollars are used in the extraction process. It is important above all that we enact this Federal legislation even for a State like mine. California. which does have stem cell research. because we need in this Nation the highest ethical standards which is what the Federal legislation can do. By allowing research to make use of embryonic stem cells slated to be thrown out. we are in fact giving purpose to this. And of course through this research lives will be saved for millions now suffering from debilitating illnesses. Today. we have also been hearing the argument that adult or amniotic stem cell research alone will be enough. but this is not the case. The worlds leading scientists concur that all stem cell research should be conducted together in order to maximize the benefits. Our President himself has stated his desire to put the United States at the forefront of science and innovation. Getting him to sign this bill is one way to make that happen. A vote against H.R. 3 would be setting us back even further and would let other countries get much further ahead of us in the effort to cure the worlds most chronic and devastating diseases.

We all support advancing science to fight disease. particularly those diseases that may have already affected our loved ones or might affect them sometime in the future. Like so many other areas within science and technology. discoveries in stem cell research are occurring every day. Just this week. news reports highlighted a significant breakthrough made by researchers from Wake Forest University in the use of amniotic stem cells to treat diseases and other conditions. This discovery. coupled with the advances made in the therapeutic use of cord blood. bone marrow. and other stem cells. demonstrates that effective and ethical research are not mutually exclusive. In fact. Congress came together last May to support ethical stem cell research. By an overwhelming majority. Congress passed the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005. which made cord blood units collected by cord blood banks available for stem cell transplantation or peerreviewed research. Since its passage. cord blood banks from around the country have collected and stored approximately 150.000 new units of cord blood which will allow the pleuripotent stem cells within the cord blood to be used to 53. Pt. 1 January 11. 2007 treat one of a number of diseases and conditions such as heart disease. nerve damage. and certain cancers. as well as to be used for research. These important advances illustrate that science can and should be advanced in an ethically minded manner. On Tuesday. the distinguished gentleman from Maryland reintroduced H.R. 322. the alternative Pleuripotent Stem Cell Therapeutic Enhancement Act. I urge my colleagues to support and invest taxpayer dollars in stem cell research that is comprehensive. ethical. and effective.

Alzheimers disease and. even more. diabetes. And as one who chairs the Hispanic task force on health. I know how very important it is that research be done on diabetes treatment because Latinos have a disproportionate large number in our community that suffer from this illness. Puerto Rican Americans and Mexican Americans are nearly twice as likely to have diabetes. The promising potential of stem cell research for those with diabetes provides a real opportunity to eliminate one of the most blatant health disparities for Latinos and African Americans.

As a country. we have a moral obligation to support life. especially those who are ill and who need this treatment and cures.

For a variety of reasons. People may divorce. Perhaps they have children. Who knows what the reasons may be. but they are disposed of. How are they disposed of? How are those 8.000 disposed of? A decision is made by the original creators of that particular embryo and by the physician running the in vitro fertilization clinic that they will be disposed of. and then they are put in as hospital waste. so they are not going to be life. It is only those embryos that would be used in this situation to develop the stem cell lines that we are talking about.

Madam Speaker. what no one can understand. because there is no rational explanation for it. is why the Medicare program has been prohibited from negotiating for lower drug prices. Of course there is an explanation: a deal was struck to benefit the insurance and pharmaceutical industries at the expense of our seniors. Madam Speaker. the legislation before us today will repeal this prohibition and empower the Secretary to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. H.R. 4 makes common sense. and it does right by our seniors. I look forward to bipartisan passage of this important legislation.",

This violent predator that had assaulted at least two prior girlfriends moved in with Katherine Jiminez and her 3yearold son. Anthony. in 1998. He continued his demonic trait of abuse and began beating her up. She ordered him to leave. Carlos exploded. He attacked her. stabbing her over 30 times. slit her throat. and killed the baby she was pregnant with. The last words Katherine heard her 3yearold son. Anthony. scream in horror were. \"Dont kill me. I dont want to die. Dont kill me.\" Carlos stabbed Anthony in the heart. Katherine lay helplessly in a pool of her own blood for over a day until she was rescued. but she survived. On Wednesday. the State of Texas put Carlos Granados in the ground. He was executed for his crimes against women and children. Katherines story is not a rare occurrence in the United States. One in four women will become victims of domestic violence in their lifetimes. their children will be likely victims as well. Love never comes with black eyes. bruises and battery.

When the Medicare drug bill was being assembled. the pharmaceutical lobby convinced its authors to write rules into the bill that would forbid ever negotiating for lowercost prescription drugs. These drug companies charged American consumers far more than anyone else in the world. This bill today would allow the Secretary to negotiate for lowercost prescription drugs. This is a commonsense solution that could have enormous cost savings for seniors and the government. The VA Administration already does this effectively. so does every other industrialized country in the world. My own State of Maine has led the way in implementing this approach at the State level.

My amendment would remove the provision in the bill that allows for a reverse mortgage if the lease term is for 10 years beyond the maturity of the mortgage and replace it with language that both clarifies and expands eligibility.

It is so important home buyers know what they are getting into. and I think that counseling is very important. I think that if we have an educated home buyer. we might not see so many of these foreclosures or near foreclosures or bankruptcy with the counseling. My concern is the mandatory counseling for FHA. and only because of something that has happened in Illinois. that happened in Chicago when this mandatory counseling was put in for FHA mortgages. What happened was that the lenders withdrew from the area. It was put in first by a ZIP Code in the city of Chicago and then put in for all of Cook County. The lenders withdrew from the area so there were no mortgages or very few available for those in that area because they werent able to get the counseling that was needed in time to get the mortgages. It takes time for counseling. and I know that you put in. and I think this would help. Is that people could get counseling on the Internet. I think it is a very important thing. I just worry about when it is mandatory that we are going to have less availability of FHA involvement than when it is discretionary as in the bill. I think that it makes FHA less attractive.

I know that in the discussion that we had In committee when this came up about no down payment. there are people that cant afford a mortgage with no down payment and can meet the monthly payments. but there was no risk with those people. no premium for FHA to ensure that kind of mortgage. That isnt fair for other people that based on their credit scores are having to pay a premium. I would just disagree.

What the bill does that the gentlewoman has is to say if you are someone with a lower credit score and get a loan with a down payment. you get charged more even if you make your payments. By the way. the bill that she would replace with last years bill would also knock out several protections we have in this bill against FHA fees being raised. The FHA doesnt want to raise fees. OMB has ordered FHA to try to raise fees. Congress has had to intervene. There are in our version. unlike the version the gentlewoman is offering. protections against fee increases. We have an amendment that was advocated by the gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. GINNY BROWNWAITE. and the gentleman from Georgia.

Premium rates may vary over loan term if basis for change is determined at origination. Under your bill. the same: requires annual report on riskbased premiums and how they were determined. authorizes premiums based on product risk. The maximum upfront premium amounts. H.R. 1752: 3 percent. or 1.5 percent if annual premium is at its maximum. Under your bill. 2.25 percent for standardrisk and higherrisk mortgages. 3.0 for zero and lower down mortgages for firsttime buyers. And then the maximum annual premium amounts in H.R. 1752. 2.0. or 1.0 if upfront premium is at its maximum. Under yours. 0.55 percent for standard and highrisk mortgages. 0.75 for zero down mortgages. And then the limit on premium charged for certain mortgages. If a borrower has 3 percent cash contribution and a score of 560 or more. the upfront premium is limited to 2.25 percent and the annual 0.55 percent. And then. under your bill it is included by creation of the standardrisk and higherrisk mortgage categories. I guess we disagree on this. but I think I want the same thing. I want FHA to be used.

There are a couple of points that I do want to make and believe the record needs to make clear. First. under the last farm bill. we havent added billions. Weve reduced billions from the baseline for agriculture. Because we stopped the ad hoc disaster response when prices collapsed. we had a provision in the farm bill to respond when prices collapsed. Guess what? Prices did not collapse. and the farm bill did not need to extend itself to help farmers. The market took care of the farmers. That saved. over the last farm bill. $18 billion off of the baseline in commodity payments. Now. what happens as we try to build the farm bill this year? It means we have $18 billion less to do it. We have come up with a farm bill that has additional spending. every dollar of it paid for without raising taxes. And so this farm bill is a very tightly constructed. paidfor farm bill in contrast to the last farm bill where $73 billion was added to the baseline. none of it paid for. under the Republican majority that previously ruled this Congress. The final point I would make is that we are going to have disasters. They will threaten the very continuation of family farms across this country. It depends who happens to be afflicted with the disaster at a certain point in time. The option before this Congress is were either going to prefund. pay for. and budget a disaster response anticipating these losses. or were going to continue to rely on ad hoc. offthebudget responses. which we believe is a less responsible way to proceed.

But I should note that even though there have been high prices. were still having disasters seemingly everywhere with very loose definitions of what a disaster is. and I would suggest that we will have those again. whether or not we include a permanent disaster title. Thats what experience tells us. Thats what weve learned just over the past few years. It doesnt matter if you include a permanent disaster title or you include this under the baseline. you will have disaster payments go out. And my plea would be lets stand for the taxpayer here. We dont often do that in the Congress. Lets say that enough is enough. that we cant continue to pay out money on top of money that we said we werent going to pay out. Again. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I know we went a little longer than we thought. I would urge support for this motion to instruct.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am proud to commemorate Cinco de Mayo. the historic celebration of Mexican heritage and pride. On May 5th. 1862. Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin led 4.000 Mexican troops into battle against the French in the Battle of Puebla. just 100 miles from Mexico City. General Seguin led his brave troops to a spirited victory in spite of being badly outnumbered and lacking the modern weaponry possessed by the French. The Mexican effort in the Battle of Puebla epitomized courage. as the outmanned troops survived three bloody French assaults and finally achieved resounding success. Numerous Mexicans gave their lives not solely for their country. but also for the timeless values of freedom and justice. The tremendous fight put up by the Mexican troops at the Battle of Puebla also had a substantial impact on the United States history. as the French defeat provided President Lincoln with crucial support as the Civil War descended into chaos. There can be no doubting the bravery. spirit or patriotism of the thousands of Mexican troops who fought and. all too frequently. gave their lives at the Battle of Puebla. In the spirit of remembering the sacrifices of those troops. Cinco de Mayo provides us with a perfect opportunity to recognize the sacrifice for sovereignty. the importance of courage and. above all. the universal yearning for freedom. Cinco de Mayo is celebrated throughout Mexico and the United States with a joyous mixture of food. music and dancing. It has also taken on great significance in the United States as a day to celebrate broadly the culture and ancestry of Americans of Mexican heritage. The Mexican forces who won the Battle of Puebla should not and will not ever be forgotten. nor will the values for which they fought. I commend those forces for their spirit and courage and I wish all those celebrating the holiday across Mexico and the United States a happy Cinco de Mayo.",

But it was also a century of unprecedented oppression. camage and bloodshed. Millions of families were exiled. tortured and executed because of their faiths. their beliefs. and their ancestries. Countless innocents were marched to camps. slaughtered in streets. and had their blood spilled as though it were nothing more than water. This religious and ethnic genocide is a permanent stain on the history of man. From 1915 to 1923. Armenians were expelled from their 2.500year homeland by the Ottoman Empire. To achieve this travesty. the Ottomans murdered 1.5 million innocent adults and children. and raped and brutalized many more. Yet to this day. this act of genocide has been widely overlooked. In fact. it is officially denied by todays Turkish government. This is unacceptable. As we pledge ourselves to fighting evil and preventing genocide in our modern world. we must keep the past alive. For if we allow ourselves to forget the unthinkable crimes of the 20th century. mankind will be condemned to bear witness to many more. As we dedicate ourselves today to ending the cycle of genocide. its important to realize that education is a crucial step in preventing future horror. Groups like the Armenian National Committee of America and others work hard to raise this critical awareness. and I pray that the monstrous horrors of yesterday and today are all the lesson we ever need to end the cycle of death and suffering.",

This managers amendment will significantly weaken legislation that gained bipartisan support in Committee on Homeland Security and passed 260. As the chairman of the Emergency Preparedness Subcommittee last Congress. we were able to pass into law comprehensive interoperability legislation. This legislation. titled the 21st Century Communications Act. created the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications and elevated the importance of emergency communications within the Department of Homeland Security. In addition. this legislation accelerated the development of national standards for emergency communication equipment. Unfortunately. the Rules Committee has approved an amendment that would remove many key provisions and severely weaken this legislation. This amendment removes language that allows interoperability funds to be used by State and local agencies to develop standard operating procedures. training. and exercises. It is important for our first responders to have this equipment. but it is also equally important that they have the training to know how to use the equipment. Allowing this amendment on the floor that removes this provision will reduce the first responders effectiveness due to a lack of training and planning. We saw what happened during Hurricane Katrina when there was a lack of training. a lack of planning and a lack of communication. It was disastrous. It cost lives. Next week is National Police Week.

Illegal immigration is a serious problem in Eastern Oklahoma and securing a 287(g) designation is a top priority of mine. I am working diligently to see ICE officials and the Tulsa County Sherriffs office partnered in this program. 287(g) would provide them with the resources they need to deal with the ever growing criminal alien population in Tulsa. I am pleased with the progress we have made. and recently leamned from ICE officials that we are in the final stages of making 287(g) a reality for Eastern Oklahoma. The 287(g) program is working to stop the catch and release practice that allows dangerous criminal illegal aliens to remain free in communities across our Nation. It would be foolish for the House not to allow for reimbursement of 287(g) training related expenses. I urge my colleagues to reject this illconsidered rule. The material previously referred to by Mr. LINCOLN DIAzBALART of Florida is as follows: At the end of the resolution. add the following: SEC. 3.

This amendment before us today would reduce the increase in the spending in this portion of the appropriations bills by $750 million a year. or $7.5 billion over 10 years. Mr. Chairman. I would ask that you remember that number. $7.5 billion over 10 years. because its there for a reason. But before I get into the specific reasons of that. I want to talk a little bit about the process and the disappointment that so many of us on this side of the aisle have in this process. and so the disappointment that many folks who have to be muted on the other side have in the process. There were grand promises of bipartisanship as we began this session of Congress earlier this year. And bipartisanship is the least that we have had on virtually every single issue.

Only half of the people in my congressional district got a tax cut. Only half. And the ones that got it only got a couple hundred dollars. So when you look at the big tax cuts that supposedly went to people who live in Youngstown and Akron. Ohio. that was a couple hundred dollars. and you compare that with what we are doing with the Pell Grants. an increase of $500 or $600. that is going to people in my district. So we are already $400 ahead of the tax cut that the Republicans were so generous to give. When you look at cutting student loan interest rates in half. saving $4.000 over the course of a loan. that is money in the pockets of people who live in most of our congressional districts. And I am thankful for the concern for the American families. but I wish our friends on the other side. at least most of them. were around when we tried to give them a pay raise and increase the minimum wage. They are talking about taking money out of their pockets. We are trying to put money in their pockets. That is what we are trying to do here. And as the gentleman from New York made the point a few minutes ago. we are funding 2.800 cops. We cant pass police and fire levies in my district because the cities just dont have the money. and we dont have the local economy. The Federal Government does have a responsibility to make our streets safer. That is what this bill does. That is what the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee have done.

I think if my good friend from Georgias amendment was approved. and I voted for his cutting amendment on each of these bills. if that amendment was approved. we would still have an increase in this bill of a little over 5 percent. Now. I dont know how that calculates out to not an increase. but I am continuing to try to figure out how that is not an increase. I do know that that increase of 5 percent anywhere that I talk to Americans is an increase. And I know. more importantly. in the course of today and tomorrow that what my friend from Georgia is suggesting is that if we let this one appropriations bill grow by 5 percent. as we move on later into the discussion of the farm bill. we would have saved enough money in this 1.4 percent cut not to have a tax increase that puts the farm bill in jeopardy. The farm bill is a bill that I voted for in the past and hope to vote for this year. but it is a bill that doesnt have to include a tax increase. But the $7.5 billion over 10 years that the farm bill needs could be gained right here if we would save $750 million of the increase in this bill. I just urge my colleagues to look at what we are doing here. realize that we are jeopardizing important things by moving forward in a way that spends more money than we have to spend this year. Most of these programs are good programs. I was a college president for 4 years. I believe in college education. in everybody having one. I dont believe that the reality is as stark as our friends on the other side would suggest. I believe a 5 percent increase used wisely would make all of these programs work effectively and for the American people. and we would be making the decisions we need to make for the other things we need to do.

He was a judge guided by a sense of fairness and perpetual desire for nothing but justice for all who were in his courts. His accomplishments were without bounds. Judge Duberstein practiced bankruptcy law for over six decades. and when he died in his 90s. he was the oldest surviving bankruptcy judge In the country. Designating the courthouse in his honor is a most fitting tribute to the extraordinary life and work of Judge Conrad B. Duberstein. I support H.R. 430 and urge its passage. Mr. Speaker.

He received his undergraduate training at the University of Missouri and Syracuse University. In 1950. he received his law degree from Drake University. Neal Smith is one of Iowas most respected and distinguished elected officials. His interests while serving in Congress were varied. but he especially focused on agriculture. small business. and the environment. He became a champion for those issue areas and authored legislation establishing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. the Federal Meat. Poultry and Egg Inspection Acts. and Small Business Development Centers. Congressman Smith also sponsored legislation to authorize construction of the Big Creek and Rathbun Dams. Further. he was instrumental in creating the Red Rock Watershed Conservation District and a National Wildlife Refuge that was named in his honor. In the 1980s. he was especially active in helping to jump start Iowas stagnant economy. In 1996. Smith published his autobiography. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington: From Eisenhower to Clinton.

I rise to join in the strong bipartisan support for this legislation which is critical to our need to continue working to reduce poverty. to create jobs and to strengthen democracy. Today this House has an opportunity to continue moving forward by extending the Andean trade preferences for Peru. Colombia. Ecuador and Bolivia. Its only a shortterm extension. 8 months. but it moves forward. Just like the Caribbean Basin Initiative. these preferences create jobs. reduce poverty and also build capacity in nations that previously were left out. The Andean preferences offer many who have been previously left out of the opportunity to participate in free enterprise as well as the export marketplace. I think of examples of communities who benefit. I think of the GatazoZambrano community in Chimborazo. Ecuador. 400 indigenous families now being lifted out of poverty because they are now exporting broccoli and produce to the U.S. export market. I think of the thousands of women engaged in flower production. as well as the processing of flowers in Colombia. involved in that industry. dependent on these preferences. And if they went out of business. China would take over the flower business. Theres almost 2 million jobs dependent in the Andean region on these Andean preferences which we created to lift people out of poverty. If you care about democracy in Latin America. you should vote \"yes.\" If you want to increase and expand markets for U.S. products. you should also vote \"yes\" because we in the United States benefit from the Andean trade preferences. U.S. workers and businesses benefit. farmers. U.S. cotton exports to Peru and Colombia totaled $110 million in 2006. almost double that of 2001. U.S. yarn and fabric exports to Peru and Colombia more than doubled between 2002 and 2006. And I would note that when we import garments from the Andean region benefiting from the Andean trade preferences. the components are largely from inputs manufactured in the United States. The Andean trade preferences are win/win for both. Its important to remember theyre temporary. We have good trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. We also need to move forward on them.

The generalized system of preferences is also a vital tool we use to fight global poverty and better engage with developing countries. As you know. the dutyfree treatment GSP provides to imports coming from developing nations like India and Brazil is at risk of being eliminated by the Bush administration. In the case of India. the tariffs the Bush administration will propose on Indian jewelry will cause the loss of 300.000 jobs. and that would weaken our strategic alliance with an important ally.

We have a very serious immigration problem right now. In 1986 we tried to solve it. It didnt work. We gave amnesty then. It wont work now.

I believe that positive engagement with the Andean region can both improve our image abroad and help us to more effectively engage our neighbors. Many of our neighbors in the hemisphere feel a huge sense of neglect from the United States. The extension of the Andean preferences is a great way to show our neighbors that we are engaged and do indeed care. I believe that the preference program has been enormously successful. having created hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Andean region. Every job created in the Andean region is another potential illegal immigrant remaining in their home country. Without the extension of these preferences. these jobs. which are in sectors that do not directly compete with U.S. jobs. will be eliminated. I am also in possession of a letter from the AFLCIO which gives its approval of these agreements. Moreover. I feel that without the extension of ATPA. many of the unemployed in the Andean region would turn to drug cultivation after they lose their jobs. The Andean preference program was originally created not only to support economic development in the region but also to divert illegal coca manufacturing toward legitimate industries. Using these trade preferences as a tool in the drug war is still very important today. Mr. Speaker. let me conclude by mentioning that President Bush recently traveled to five countries in the Americas in an effort to reinvigorate our partnership with our friends in the region. Prior to his trip. President Bush said that \"The working poor of Latin America need change. and the United States of America is committed to that change.\" I believe that the extension of ATPA can help bring this wellneeded change to our friends in the Andean region. I want to emphasize that in my travels in the region. the region feels that the United States is looking elsewhere and is not engaged. The worst thing we could do would be not to pass this because it would prove their fears. We need to pass this. We need to do it quickly. and I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support this.",

I rise. as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. in strong support of this 8month extension of the Andean Trade Preference Act. It is the right thing to do at the right time. Mr. Speaker. There is no question. as my friend from New York just referenced previously. that our image has been tattered and beaten abroad. That is no less true here in the Western Hemisphere. especially with our neighbors to the south. through Central and South America. And I have always believed that our trade policies are more than just the exchange of products and goods between our Nation and others but also an important tool in our diplomatic arsenal. An arsenal that needs to be rebuilt now even in our own Western Hemisphere. But I also want to remind my colleagues that this is not a free pass for these four Andean nations to get this trade preference. They have certain strict criteria that they have to meet first to gain eligibility for these preferences. Criteria such as respecting internationally recognized worker rights. treating the United States investors fairly. providing market access to U.S. goods. demonstrating a commitment to implement its WTO obligations. and. finally. to meet the U.S. counternarcotics criteria. And on that last point. it is not insignificant that there has been substantial progress. according to our own State Department and USTR office. of the drug eradication efforts and partnership that we have established with these four Andean nations. They have also met the criteria. again. through reference of our own State Department. but ATPA is perhaps the single most effective alternative development program we have going in the region. By providing these local citizens with longterm alternatives to narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration. ATPA has helped the governments. especially in Colombia and Peru. to isolate violent extremist groups. to revise their economies. and increase their investments in their education. health care. and infrastructure system. And I submit that if we are not trying to actively engage these nations to help them build their economy and expand economic opportunities. they are going to come to the United States to realize those opportunities that they are not receiving in their own countries.

I have always supported the Andean trade program designed to help create alternative jobs and economies to those in the drug trade and to offer hope to these nations. And it has worked. Millions of jobs have developed in the region in the flower industry. In agriculture. all that contribute to stabilization and economic growth. all of which are in Americas interest. But preferences which are oneway trade Into America arent permanent. They arent designed that way because they matter. The impact on American asparagus farmers. which has shrunk by a third as a result of these preferences is a good example. And thats why its imperative that we work with our Andean neighbors to transition to twoway free trade agreements that balance and strengthen our relationships. Not only is twoway trade fair. but it benefits all parties by encouraging more permanent investment in nations where rule of law. property rights. democracy and higher labor environmental standards are insisted upon. This helps create even more jobs in the legitimate market. more so than the preferences do today. As an example. Perus legislature today voted to amend our agreement that incorporates Important labor and environmental provisions negotiated by Chairman RANGEL. Ranking Member McCRERY and others. Approving the pending free trade agreements with partners Peru and Colombia have significant security and foreign policy implications as well by strengthening our hand against President Chavez in Venezuela and his corrosive influence in the region. Mr. Speaker. I support the preference extension. We shouldnt disrupt current trade flows or hurt our friends in the region whose livelihoods depend upon this program. but we need to move forward in a timely manner with agreements with Peru and Colombia.

Their tireless efforts throughout the years have facilitated the placement of numerous foster children into permanent homes. It is especially fitting to highlight the success of the Solano County Child Welfare Division during our celebration of National Adoption Month. Throughout the United States there are more than half a million children in foster care. with more than a fifth of those children looking for permanent homes. In the foster care system. far too often it becomes difficult to keep brothers and sisters in the same home. In addition. many of these children face difficult physical. emotional. and behavioral challenges. These stressors compound developmental concerns and make the necessity of a permanent home even more critical. In response. the Solano County Child Welfare Division chooses to live by this simple creed. \"Every child deserves a permanent. loving family and a home in which they can develop to their fullest potential.\" This creed is exemplified by the dedication and commitment that we see every day in Solano County. As we celebrate the 17th annual National Adoption Month. the Solano County Child Welfare Division continues to find new and effective ways to match foster children with \"forever families.\" Building on its success from previous years. and the ability to place 57 children into permanent homes in 2007. the Solano County Child Welfare Division is unveiling the Solano Heart Gallery. This gallery will feature many of the 190 children in Solano County who are currently seeking stable and loving homes. This Heart Gallery will travel throughout Solano visiting every city in the county during the 2008 calendar year. We are proud to represent a county that places such a high priority on the future of our children. It is because of dedicated public servants in our community that we can all expect great things from this next generation of children.

I would also like to congratulate the many people and companies in history who helped build and occupy the Courthouse. Angus P. McDonald began construction on the Wailuku Courthouse on October 18. 1907. His work was completed in late 1908 and the building opened in February 1909. The Wailuku Courthouse was occupied by the Honorable Judge Aluwae Noa Kepoikai. from 1892 to 1894 and again from 1904 to 1909. the Honorable Judge Seldon B. Kindgsbury from 1909 to 1913. the Honorable Judge William S. Edings from 1914 to 1918. the Honorable Judge Leslie L. Burr from 1918 through 1922. the Honorable Judge Daniel H.

As the population of Maui County grew and the demands on county services increased. the Wailuku Courthouse was eventually vacated by the Court in 1988. In October 1992. the GW Murphy Construction Company began renovating and restoring the Wailuku Courthouse to allow for its continued use by the County of Maui. In October 1993. the offices of the Maui County Department of the Prosecuting Attorney were moved into the Wailuku Courthouse and the Department continues to occupy the building to this day. The Wailuku Courthouse has since been home to the following Prosecuting Attorneys: Larry L. Butrick from October 1993 through July 1995. Richard T. Bissen Jr. from August 1995 through January 2003. Davelynn M. Tengan from January 2003 through January 2007. and currently Benjamin M. Acob. who was appointed on January 2. 2007. I extend a sincere mahalo (thank you) to all of the past and current residents of the Wailuku Courthouse. The building stands as a symbol of your shared commitment to justice and equality for all the residents of Maui. Congratulations on this historic centennial.",

Now how is it that a bill of this import. a bill that will spend over the next 10 years about $300 billion. is not important enough to allow those who are opposed to the bill to claim time in opposition to it?

I think. serious concern that many of us who have been advocating reform under the commodity title. the socalled commodity subsidy programs. and that is what was done with the two subsidy programs now where funding currently isnt going out. And the reason it is not going out under the loan deficiency program and the counter cyclical program is because market prices are high. Thats a good thing. because farm income is good. debt to asset ratio has never been better in farm country. But what this bill proposes to do. instead of holding those programs constant. they are actually increasing the loan rate under the loan deficiency program and the target price under the countercyclical program. which means that if things do turn south in farm country. if prices do dropand we know how cyclical agriculture can be. and these are safety net programsthose programs will trigger much sooner and at a much greater expense than what I fear is being accounted for right now in this bill. That. I think. speaks to the unfunded mandate concern that the gentleman from Arizona and myself. and others included. have in regards to the socalled reforms that we are just not seeing under the commodity title. not when they go in the opposite direction with the LDP and the countercyclical programs by dialing up the loan rate and the target prices of those two programs and triggering them at a much earlier time and at a much greater expense for the taxpayers of this country. There Is a whole lot of other reform that we felt were justifiable and reasonable under the commodity title. Quite frankly. we dont get there.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this is an important and urgent and critical bill. All across this Nation. families are struggling and suffering. In my own district of Georgia and in one of my major counties. which is Clayton County. which is one of the leading counties that has had over a 200 percent increase in foreclosures of homes. they have lost over $158 million in terms of their home equity. Now. Mr. Chairman. the speaker just spoke a moment ago about one of the major features of this bill. and that is trying to grapple with assigning liability. I want to just make sure that everybody understands what we are talking about. because we are going to have that debate. Just what is an assignee? An assignee is a mortgage broker or lender. any loan originator that makes these loans but they dont keep them. They repackage these loans. They often are loans that are delivered to the secondary market to a group of investors and these are parties that own an interest in the loan as it flows through the investment process. and they are known as assignees. Since these loan originators dont keep the loans they make. they often deliver what the secondary market will buy. with little regard for whether the homeowners can make their payments or afford these loans. Unfortunately. many of them get into these loans on what is known as \"teaser rates.\" They put forward a loan at a very low rate but. unbeknownst to the homeowner. in a short period of time the payment balloons out of kilter and the homeowner cannot afford it. Some people say this is not by design. But in so many cases. they are by design. So what does that consumer have? He must have some recourse by which to have an ability to stop the foreclosure on his home. That victim has to hire legal counsel to bring separate action against the loan originator. This bill attempts to address that. An assignee liability is an important feature of this measure.",

I also believe they can best determine how to borrow money. just as lenders can best determine who should be lent money. In other words. I trust free choice in the free market. Businesses should be able to take risks just as consumers should be able to. With these risks. come consequences. However. I understand we have a major problem on our hands. a problem that has spread far beyond the housing market to the heart of the American economy. Some homeowners are struggling to make mortgages they cant afford and financial institutions are stuck holding mortgages that probably will not be repaid. But to say all subprime mortgages are bad is an incorrect conclusion. Unfortunately. this legislation. Mr. Chairman. will not help those who today are in danger of losing their homes. and it will certainly not help the availability of credit for those purchasing homes in the future. This legislation will not add confidence to the credit market and will not help our housing market find its footing. I was a small business owner in another life. and I understand when we make certain types of loans costprohibitive by adding burdensome regulation or liability. all those loans will simply stop being made. When we ban compensation for certain types of loans. the originators have no reason to make them. especially when they are now subject again to these new regulations and liabilities. Rather than ensuring this market works smoothly through increased oversight and transparency. we are effectively legislating these loans out of existence and further tightening our credit markets. It is not a good thing for our housing market. our economy. or the free choice of our homeowners. Unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. I must oppose H.R. 3915. and I urge my colleagues to do the same.",

No doubt. the American Dream has always been homeownership and yet. with exploding ARMs. with prepayment penalty and other such exotic products. that dream of homeownership has become an American nightmare. Mr. Chairman. Id love to be able to take every Member of this body through a tour of north Minneapolis. There are blocks on my community where every other house is boarded and vacant. The fact is that for the people who have made every single mortgage payment. and never late. they suffer because of this crisis because their home values have been dropping and plummeting. We have seen our cities suffer. we have seen communities become unattractive nuisances. which were once vibrant places where people owned their own homes and did well. Its not because the market worked right. its because it worked wrong. Its because of defective financial products. defective financial products which are addressed in this bill. Its important to understand that this bill is not designed to harm the subprime market. Its designed to reform and correct it and make it work properly. Mr. Chairman. The fact is that it does not help any homeowner who gets into a 227 with a prepayment penalty. who eventually cant pay the mortgage after it explodes in their face and then lose their home. We are not better off because of something that happens like that. That is what this bill is here to stop. So. Mr. Chairman. let me say that this is an important part of making the American Dream come true for middleclass Americans. making sure that when they buy a home. they can actually keep that home and that it will be a product that can enhance themselves and their families and the communities they come from.",

I commend Chairman FRANK and Ranking Member BACHUS for how they have drafted and brought this bill to the floor. It reflects highly on the deliberative and bipartisan nature of the Financial Services Committee I serve on. This is one of the most important and balanced bills we have worked on this year. because Americans homes are central to their lives. Families save and sacrifice to come up with a down payment towards the most significant and personal investment they will ever make. They raise their families. they dream their American Dreams. and they look forward to a retirement secured by the equity they have established. When house prices fall. when access to credit tightens. those dreams are threatened. and. for some. those dreams are destroyed by foreclosure. When talking with constituents in my district about the current mortgage market. some are having difficulty making their monthly payments. Most are concerned with being able to sell their home when looking to move. All agree that we need better consumer protections. simpler disclosures. and greater market certainty. This bill does that. I am pleased that the bill before us includes provisions from my bill. H.R. 3894. the Negative Amortization Mortgage Loan Transparency Act. which will make sure that all borrowers are aware of the impact a loan with negative amortization has by. number one. making sure that it is indicated that it is in the loan. two. a description of what that means. in that it can increase the outstanding principal balance and reduce the borrowers equity in their home. and. third. for firsttime subprime borrowers who select this type of loan. they will be required to meet with a HUDcertified credit counselor. This bill balances access to credit with necessary oversight and industry accountability to ensure renewed investor confidence and make sure that more Americans have access to the American Dream. but they have access to it for the long term.

During the third quarter of 2007. each of Ohios six largest cities were among the top 30 nationally for foreclosure rates. In Cleveland alone. one of 57 households filed for foreclosure during this quarter. So while our economy may be recovering from the impact of both the housing slump and the resulting credit crisis. and some places faster than others. it is imperative that we dont impede this recovery. that in our efforts to help the countless consumers and homeowners who have been hit hardest. we dont place the prospects of homeownership and refinancing out of the reach of families financially capable of managing it. This bill balances that difficult task. and it has happened in an open. bipartisan process of negotiation. Along with the bill offered by Mr. KANJORSKI. this bill adds regulation to the unregulated and restricts predatory products from the marketplace: adjustable rate mortgages with high prepayment penalties. nodoc or lowdoc loans. teaser rates that reset only months after initialization. loans without escrows for the most likely to need them. This bill not only helps do away with these predatory products. but it empowers consumers with the most important tool of all. information. It is stunning to think that more than three in 10 homeowners dont even know what kind of mortgage they have. This bill improves disclosure at the point of sale. and the managers amendment requires disclosure on periodic billing statements. It is important that people understand what they are getting into and are reminded of it on a regular basis. On the floor today. we will hear countless stories of heartache and heartbreak of families devastated by the rising foreclosure rates. of Americans losing their claim to the American Dream.

I rise in opposition to this legislation. legislation that prompted the Wall Street Journal to say that this bill is essentially a \"SarbanesOxley for housing. an attempt to punish business in general for the excesses of an unscrupulous few.\" Now. while the chairman and ranking member and other members of the staff have done really remarkable work to address some of the most problematic provisions. this legislation still raises serious concerns about the future access to credit. I believe that this bill will lower homeownership. It will harm the American Dream. A good number of the new duties and requirements which this legislation imposes on loan originators are both vague and highly subject. Words like \"reasonable ability to pay\" and \"net tangible benefit.\" these are required of lenders. This is greater regulation. and. as my friend from Texas said. greater regulation means less liquidity. That means not as much money in the market. That means fewer individuals able to buy homes. Dr. Ronald Utt with the Heritage Foundation says. \"This provision effectively deputizes the mortgage industry as a quality of life police force by requiring them to pass judgment upon what it exactly is that a borrower intends to do with any additional moneys required by the way of loan refinancing.\" This creates increased litigation. In fact. when H.R. 3915 was being marked up in committee. I asked him. the chairman himself. if there was a disagreement between the lender and the borrower about whether something achieved a net tangible benefit. where would that disagreement be settled. and he said. \"Like any disagreements in this country. they go to court.\" The legislation also creates a new civil action for rescission. the ability to get all of ones money back. Clearly the result of this will be less availability of money to buy a house for all. but mostly for those at the lower end of the economic spectrum. Now. there are alternatives. There are positive alternatives: Increasing financial literacy. greater flexibility in refinancing. and greater penalties for fraud. And I hope as this process moves forward that we will be able to incorporate those things in a standalone bill that increases the ability to achieve the American Dream.",

I very much appreciate the tone and the effort of the chairman and the ranking member to come to terms with a very difficult problem that is facing our country. and that is the subprime mortgage crisis and the ripple effect. the profound ripple effect it is having throughout the economy. My sense. though. is that while there are some very good elements in the bill. I appreciate the fact that it is prospective. I appreciate the fact that it is not a bailout. and I appreciate the fact that its focus is limited to subprime mortgages and not prime mortgages. there is an element that is of enough concern to me to come to the floor and bring it to the Houses attention. I am not unique in bringing it to the Houses attention. but I urge a real sense of caution. and I think we can do slightly better. and that is the ambiguity of some of the phrases and definitions in the bill. The gentleman from Georgia referenced these in his remarks. But when regulatory language. as this is. has words like \"appropriate\" without further definition. \"ability to repay\" without further definition. and \"net tangible benefit\" without further definition. I think it is a weakness in the bill. and I think it is a fatal flaw in the bill. My hope is that these ambiguities will be cleaned up. I am not one that says we necessarily need to yield this turf to the regulators. I think we as Members of Congress have that ability and that responsibility to define these terms. Because if we dont. I think what will happen is that capital that is currently available to subprime borrowers will become unavailable to some subprime borrowers. There is language that creates the purported safe harbor in the bill. but it is a safe harbor that does not end with a period at the end of the sentence. essentially. It is a safe harbor that has a comma at the end and Is simply a rebuttable presumption. So safe harbors are mostly safe. but not entirely safe.

I want to draw attention to one provision of the bill and underscore the importance of the provisions here that prohibit steering of borrowers into highercost mortgages than they would otherwise qualify for. This mirrors legislation that I introduced earlier this year. H.R. 3813. the Mortgage Kickback Prevention Act. The bill before us prevents mortgage originators from inappropriately steering consumers into highercost loans than they would otherwise qualify for. This is a commonsense measure. and it is made more reasonable by the restriction to apply this only to subprime loans. To me and my constituents. it is pretty simple. Brokers and mortgage originators shouldnt have an incentive to put borrowers into more expensive loans than they would otherwise qualify for. Frankly. as we move forward. I think it is important to understand that disclosure doesnt do the entire trick here. Most borrowers have no idea what it means when their broker discloses that they are going to pay a yieldspread premium amidst the mountains of paperwork that you are required to fill out for a residential mortgage. For these borrowers who have the least amount of leverage in the process. we need to have some clear lines. This bill does that. That is why it makes sense to simply say the brokers and originators cannot inappropriately put borrowers into loans they otherwise would not qualify for.

This is simply a matter of fairness and of equity. Puerto Rico is currently ineligible for Weatherization Assistance. and only receives a small set aside from the LIHEAP program. To include Puerto Rico in the weatherization program would cost less than 1 percent of the programs funds but would make a huge impact. Though Puerto Rico is blessed with warm weather. the Weatherization Assistance Program is desperately needed there. Because it is an island that must import the fuels it needs. energy costs are extraordinarily high. The average cost of electricity in the U.S. is under 10 cents a kilowatthour. but in Puerto Rico. electricity costs almost twice that at 18 cents per kilowatthour. And these high energy costs have a devastating impact on the Commonwealths lowincome population. Approximately 45 percent of the population is under the U.S. poverty line. Many homes rely on old. inefficient air conditioners to cool their homes and much of the lowincome housing has not been built or maintained with energy efficiency in mind. Puerto Rico already has an active program to educate people about the importance of energy efficiency and to increase the energy efficiency of government buildings. But the weatherization program would help Puerto Rico offer weatherization assistance to lowincome households and incentives for energy efficient appliance purchases. solar water heaters. lighting replacement. and other energysaving measuires.",

How could anything make less sense when we are trying to pass an energy bill that will do two things: make America less dependent on foreign oil for our energy needs. and bring the price of gasoline down at the pump. This bill. with the tax part. is not going to do either of those things. In the past 2/2 years. the average price of a gallon of gas has risen about 68 percent due to increased demand in America and around the world.

Yet what we have seen consistently over the last 22 years. while we have not had a national fuel economy standard. is that the cars and trucks being sold on average are getting less mileage.

Today he adds a third. and once more. he is standing against hope for thousands of Americans afflicted with deadly diseases. His veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is a grave moral error. Embryonic stem cell research may one day provide relief to more than 100 million Americans suffering from Parkinsons. diabetes. spinal cord injury. Lou Gehrigs disease. cancer. and many other devastating conditions for which there is still no cure. Today. Federal funds are only allowed for work on 21 stem cell lines that existed as of August 9. 2001. all of which are contaminated. Scientists understand that access to more stem cell lines would significantly expand the scope and possibility of their research. That is why the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act expanded the number of embryonic stem cell lines available for federally funded research by allowing the use of stem cells derived through emrbryos from in vitro fertilization clinics. Stem cell research turns embryos that would otherwise be discarded into the seeds of lifegiving science. Of course. the decision to dedicate embryos to research is a heavy one. We have never argued otherwise. That is why the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act contained strict ethical requirements. Under this legislation. the only embryonic stem cells that can be used for federally funded research are those that were derived through embryos created for fertility treatment purposes and donated for research with the written. informed consent of the individuals seeking that treatment. Any financial or other inducements to make this donation are prohibited under this legislation. These ethical standards are stronger than current lawpossibly stronger. in fact. than the standards attending the creation of the 21 approved lines. Stem cells from embryos have a unique potential to reduce human sufferingand for precisely that reason. embryonic stem cell research is sumported by a strong majority of Americans. Today. President Bush set himself against that potential. and against that majority. he set himself in the way of our scientists. and our suffering patients.

I had often looked at bills which celebrate groups in two ways. because I noticed that only insurgent groups have such days named for them or groups most in need. and so they become days of celebration. I have warmed to them only because I have recognized why such groups have their own day. International Womens Day for example. It is because having such a day provides an opportunity for a call to action. I wish I could come to the floor to celebrate women internationally. It is hard for me to do that when I see the progress in the global economy and look at what has happened and is happening internationally to women who are still chattel in most places in the world. who essentially would qualify as an oppressed group. not as a group seeking equality. So I think we ought to use International Womens Day to speak out for women who cannot speak for themselves. What is to me perhaps most tragic is that the experience that most women in this country welcome is one that women across the world. particularly in developing countries. may dread. and that is the experience of pregnancy. Where pregnancy cannot be controlled by a woman. it is not the extraordinarily wonderful and welcome state that it is in our country. There will never be equality for women until women can control their own fertility. As long as women are subject to men. as long as they have no control over their own fertility. then you will see women with as much HIV and AIDS as men. Where saying \"no\" to a man isnt something you do as a woman. but something you cant do as a woman. you are not equal. So today I call attention to the world that our country has done very little to help women across the world control their fertility and understand what equality means. We would not have women marching for equality and toward equality today if each and every woman who chose was not able to control her fertility. May we help obtain the same for our good sisters around the world.",

Recognizing the contributions American women have made to our Nations progress over the course of history is so very important because their contributions have too frequently taken place out of the limelight. It is truly remarkable when one takes note of the expansive list of contributions women have made to our country throughout its history. From my own State of Iowa. Lilia Abron became the first AfricanAmerican woman in the Nation to obtain a doctoral degree in chemical engineering at the University of Iowa. Phyllis Propp Fowle. a native of Iowa. became the first female Judge Advocate General Officer in the U.S. Army. Arabella Mansfield became the first female lawyer in the United States after being admitted to practice law in Iowa. And I constantly remind myself I would not be here today had it not been for my own mother. She went back to school to obtain her four year teaching degree so she could help my family make ends meet after my father was injured in a grain elevator accident. Using a single calendar day of the year to honor the barriers these women and countless others broke and the sacrifices they made is the least we can do to thank them for their contributions to our society. I only hope that their stories inspire other womenand mento work hard to achieve the promise this Nation was founded on: a place where all people are created equal.",

I rise today in support of House Resolution 29. which celebrates mentors who are positively impacting the lives of young people and highlights the need for additional mentors to make themselves available to Americas youth. I applaud Representative SUSAN DAVIS continued efforts to draw attention and support to this very important issue. and I appreciate her dedicated leadership in this area. Mentors give their time and energy to improve the lives of American young people who increasingly spend less time with concerned adult role models. According to the National Mentoring Institute. young people with mentors are roughly half as likely as those without mentors to begin using illegal drugs. 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol. and 50 percent less prone to absenteeism from school. The positive effects of mentoring also include the Improvement of academic achievement. a reduction in violent behavior. and a higher selfesteem. In December 2006. President Bush proclaimed January 2007 as National Mentoring Month. giving public recognition to mentors who serve as role models and provide quality involvement and interaction in the lives of Americas youth. As the President said. \"Through friendship and encouragement. mentors can help prepare young Americans for a hopeful future.\" By honoring mentors and mentoring programs. we recognize the importance of mentoring programs implemented in our local schools and communities. We also draw attention to the components of a quality program. including appropriate screening of potential mentors and careful matching of youth with adults who have a genuine interest in providing guidance and being exemplary role models. Mentoring programs are varied and unique. They can be schoolbased or faithbased. and they may be established through community organizations or corporate initiatives. I encourage people across the country to take the time to discover what mentoring programs exist in their communities and see what they can do to help. Many volunteers are needed to meet the growing demand for mentors. Again. I am pleased to recognize the important work of mentors and the quality mentoring programs. and I urge Members to support this resolution. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

We take this opportunity today through consideration of this resolution to honor those mentors who unselfishly give of their time to encourage and support students across our country. Mentors provide important guidance and friendship to students and they serve as positive role models in our community. Mentors listen and above all. they care. Mentors leave an indelible imprint on our minds and hearts. I. as well as many of my colleagues. had mentors that helped us shape our aspirations and achieve our goals. The confidence and support that they provide is something that every young person deserves. Unfortunately. there are not enough mentors for the millions ot children who want or need them. Currently. as this resolution notes. approximately 15 million young people are in need of mentors across our country. As we celebrate National Mentoring Month. let us commit ourselves to raising awareness and to promoting the rewards of mentoring for mentors. our children. our communities and our country. I also take this opportunity today to commend the young people who participate in mentoring programs.

The list of vulnerabilities children face is long. The worst circumstances. however. will bring out the best in humanity. When a need exists. society often leans in to help shoulder the load. Today we are celebrating the uncanny ability of Americans to lend a helping hand. Today on the House floor and this month across America. we honor those people who sacrifice their time and energy to provide a friendly face. a supportive shoulder. a patient ear. and a model for leadership and success in the form of mentoring relationships. According to Big Brothers. Big Sisters of America. young people touched by mentors are more confident in their schoolwork performance. able to get along better with their families. 46 percent less likely to begin using illegal drugs. 27 percent less likely to begin using alcohol. and 52 percent less likely to skip school. In my district of El Paso. Texas. I have seen the positive impact of mentoring firsthand through my involvement with Big Brothers. Big Sisters of El Paso. The hundreds of individuals who step up either as big brothers and sisters or in support of the organization not only make a difference in the life of a child but also provide a model for civic involvement that can be emulated by the community at large.

This resolution increases the awareness of Catholic education while honoring the contributions of Americas Catholic schools. They are dedicated to not only educating their students academically. but to developing their moral. intellectual. physical and social values. January 28 through February 3. 2007. is Catholic Schools Week. an annual tradition in its 33rd year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The purpose of this resolution and Catholic Schools Week is to celebrate the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools play in providing a valuesadded education with high standards of quality and excellence to millions of children in America. As President George W. Bush has noted. Catholic educators share the basic conviction that every child can learn. which is the grounding principle behind the No Child Left Behind Act. Catholic schools have also played a vital role in the gulf coasts path to recovery after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They worked as quickly as possible to reenroll their students. while also opening their doors to thousands of public school students displaced by the storm. Catholic schools continue to demonstrate their faith in every student and commitment to excellence with overwhelming results. According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Catholic schools have a greater than 99 percent graduation rate. and about 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to postsecondary training at 4year colleges. community colleges. or technical schools. I know firsthand of the significance of Catholic schools in that my new daughterinlaw. Jennifer Miskewicz Wilson of Fairfield. New Jersey. was influenced by a Catholic education. I appreciate the great work being done by Catholic schools. their administrators and teachers. as well as their parents and volunteers. Catholic schools carry out their servant mission by building the academic achievement. character and values of their students.

Education is a very important value that should be emphasized to American young people. This bill congratulates Catholic schools. students. parents. and teachers for their role in ensuring that American students remain competitive in a global marketplace while emphasizing their character development. I commend Congressman LIPINSKI for sponsoring this bill which promotes and encourages education. Education is the pathway to a better future and an American ideal is for students of every background and race to have the opportunity to access equal education. Catholic schools have strived to maintain diversity with more than 27 percent of school children enrolled in Catholic schools from minority backgrounds. Supporting this bill sends a message that we care about the education of American students. Not only do Catholic schools educate Catholic youth. but 14 percent of those children who attend Catholic schools are nonCatholic. We must keep in mind that Catholic schools educate Americas young people and ensure that they have a brighter future. Catholic schools have ensured that they are well equipped to face the rigorous challenges after graduation while contributing to their character development and helping to raise responsible citizens who give back to our communities and the world.

As we get ready to celebrate Catholic Schools week. its important to highlight and celebrate the contributions of the nearly 8.000 Catholic schools that exist in our Nation. Catholic education has long been characterized by a commitment to high and appropriate standards in all aspects of its educational mission. The history of Catholic schooling embodies a constant effort to promote academic excellence for a diverse group of students in an environment permeated by religious values and beliefs. Aside from Americas Catholic schools being intemationally acclaimed for their academic excellence. catholic school students also learn responsibility. and how to become persons of character and integrity. Father William Davis of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said. \"High achievement rates. high retention rates. high moral values and high student and parent satisfaction are the distinctive marks of a Catholic school.\" In my district and the surrounding areas. Catholic education is rather prevalent. The San Bernardino diocese contains at least 32 Elementary schools and 2 High schools. A new Preparatory high school is also in the works for the Coachella Valley area. Catholic schools foster a sense of community. They encourage their students to be loving family members. and to be responsible adults within the workplace. as leaders of the world and as inhibitors of their communities. I commend Catholic schools for holding high educational standards. instilling good moral values. and community sentiments. Let us recognize and honor the valuable traits Catholic schools possess.

I know that I would not be here today without the guidance of Sister McFadden. the assistance of Ms. Erwin. or the countless other teachers. priests and nuns who helped shaped me into the man I am today.

I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Catholic Schools not only in my Home Congressional District of Staten Island and Brooklyn. but also the entire nation as we honored Catholic Schools Week from January 28February 3. 2007. Americas Catholic schools educate nearly 2.5 million students a year. providing the nations young men and women with a broad academic background emphasizing the lifelong development of moral. intellectual physical and social values. Catholic school initiatives that reach out to disadvantaged young people have touched a diverse group of students who sometimes find themselves trapped in underachieving schools. It is not surprising to me that more than 27 percent of Catholic school students are from minority groups and nearly 14 percent are nonCatholics. Parents recognize the importance of a quality education and are willing to sacrifice to ensure their children have every opportunity to succeed in the world. Catholic Schools Week pays tribute to the dedication. character. compassion. and values that embody Catholic education in this country.

The Senate has a very difficult challenge. I know that Mr. REID is trying to work with Mr. McCONNELL to figure out how they can do it. What we are really trying to do is trying to see if we can have a Senate and House agreement so that we can meet that February 15 deadline with this CR. which would not necessitate going back to a subsequent CR. in other words. making this a CR through September 30 of this year and take care of the 2007 funding cycle. As Mr. OBEY has indicated. the reason for that is we are now proceeding on the 2008 cycle. and until we put the 2007 cycle behind us. it is difficult to focus on that.

We are hopeful that whatever this bill is. it is as narrow as it can be and also that we get it out of the way as quickly as we can so that we can get on with the appropriations work for the next year.

And rather than seizing an opportunity to level with the American people and set the new course they rightly demand. the administration. once again. chose to cling to its delusions and insist that its failing policies be enacted. In 2003. the administration requested and received from Congress authority to invade Iraq on the basis of the claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and presented an imminent threat to our national security. Senior administration officials claimed that the Iraqi Government was connected with the al Qaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks of September 11. 2001. And we now know that neither the premise for the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq nor the claim of a connection to 9/11 was true.

He said: \"Just sending more troops to Baghdad is like pouring more water in the sands of Al Anbar.

Yet there are other dangers closer to home. in our own medicine cabinets and a click of the mouse away. Common household products. such as cough syrup. contain ingredients that can provide a high if taken in large enough doses. The Partnership for a Drug Free America estimates that 1 in 10 teenagers or approximately 2.4 million young people have intentionally abused cough medicine in order to get high. The primary active ingredient in most cough medicines is dextromethorphan. also known as DXM. While medicines containing DXM are used safely by millions of Americans each year. some teenagers are taking excessive amounts of overthecounter cough medications in order to get high. Moreover. many teens are abusing the unfinished. pure form of DXM which under current law can be obtained legally over the Internet. Pure DXM is extremely dangerous when taken in large amounts. and can cause hallucinations. seizures. brain damage. and even death. In 2005. two teenagers in my district died from overdosing on unfinished DXM. which they had obtained from a company over the Internet. In the same year three boys from Virginia and Florida died as a result of abusing unfinished DXM. which they had acquired through the same means. The loss of these children is a tragedy that will forever be felt by their families and their communities. There is no need to risk the reoccurrence of these tragic events in the future. H.R. 970. the Dextromethorphan Distribution Act. will prohibit the distribution of unfinished DXM to anyone not registered to possess it. It will cut off the supply of unfinished DXM to those looking to use it to get high or sell it as a street drug. This commonsense legislation will eliminate the abuse of unfinished DXM. while still allowing drug manufacturers and registered pharmacists to use the substance as it was intended. I would like to thank my friend and colleague FRED UPTON for his leadership on this issue. and I applaud the House leadership for sending this bill to the House floor.

A small but significant portion of children have visual impairments. It is estimated that vision impairment affects approximately 1.2 out of every 1.000 8yearolds. When detected early. many childhood vision abnormalities are treatable. but the potential for correction and normal visual development diminishes with age. Vision problems can occur at any point during a lifetime. but tend to be particularly damaging to schoolage children. Impaired vision can result in adverse physical. emotional. and social consequences. For instance. a child may miss learning opportunities by failing to explore his or her environment. Additionally. if a child is visually impaired. he or she may be unable to imitate social behavior or understand nonverbal cues. Early recognition of eye disease results in more effective treatment and that can be sight saving and sometimes even life saving. Yet. many children under the age of 5 do not receive any vision screening at all. The Vision Care for Kids Act of 2007 would authorize a grant program to provide comprehensive eye exams for uninsured children with vision disorders. with priority for children under the age of 9. Funds would be used for treatment and services to correct vision disorders identified through eye exams and to increase public awareness of visual impairment in children. H.R. 507 would require States receiving funds to contribute a 25 percent match of funds for each Federal dollar obtained through the program. The bill before us today makes great strides in providing access to an array of visionrelated services. including vision screening services that can help uninsured children in low- to moderateincome families.

I think. We are both aiming towards the same goal. fortunately. of trying to reach a balanced budget by 2012. 5 years from now. But the Republican budget will reach that goal of 2012 without raising taxes by almost $400 billion. which is what your chart behind you shows. And that is critical. So. number one. we will not put a burden of almost $4.000. $3.800. on the families in the State of New Jersey. $l.500 if you are a family of four making $70.000. Secondly. by not raising taxes we will not be undermining the progrowth policies of this administration and of this government over the last 10 years. Those progrowth policies. for New Jerseyans at least. have created tremendous employment. very low unemployment. so that that family that is making that $70.000 a year or more or less In New Jersey at least knows that the unemployment rate is almost at historic lows at this point. So they know there is the opportunity for jobs. and because of that. there is great opportunity to improve yourselves in careers and what have you. And because of that progrowth policy. we have seen the deficit shrink by 26 percent. And. thirdly. and I think this is very important to everyone at home. is that we are making sure on the Republican proposal that those dollars that we do spend. because we are always going to have some spending by the Federal Government. that those dollars will not be wasted. not waste. fraud. and abuse. but will be spent on those things that are critical to my State. to your State. to national security. to homeland security. and to our veterans as well. So balance the budget without raising taxes. make sure we continue the progrowth tax policies that we have had in the past to create jobs. and make sure that those dollars are wisely spent. They all come under the umbrella of one thing. and you said it: to realize that these dollars come from the family budget.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I rise today to introduce The Government Reservation Accelerated Development for Education Aid Act. GRADEA. H.R. 701. a bill to ensure the Federal government fully funds the Impact Aid program. In 1950. President Harry Truman established the Impact Aid program to meet the revenue shortfalls in school districts and communities that occur in districts with federally owned land. which are exempt from State and local property taxes. Public schools are required by law to accept all children from military families. Native American reservations or other Federal establishments. This puts a severe financial burden on school districts that educate a significant number of federally connected children. diminishing the overall quality of education. and increasing the funding burden on local taxpayers. For years Impact Aid was fully funded and offered some of the strongest direct assistance to military families across the Nation. Unfortunately. over the last decade we have fallen behind on this commitment. GRADEA has gamered bipartisan support and offers the opportunity to reverse this negative trend. Earlier this Congress I introduced H.R. 12. in order to ensure that students in my district continue to receive the resources needed to succeed. I introduced this bill to help North Chicago continue to qualify as \"heavily impacted\" and therefore. receive maximum funding. and to ensure that Glenview and Highland Park receive fair compensation. I believe that it is crucial for schools outside of my district that are affected by the presence of the Federal government to receive support from the Impact Aid program as well. This funding is necessary to maintain school quality. protect surrounding communities from financial burden and to fulfill an obligation to our men and women serving overseas. by caring for their families at home.",

We will have more as we go on through the morning. We expect to vote at noontime today on the increase on the minimum wage. This is day seven. We had five courageous Republicans who voted with us to pass what we call a clean minimum wage law that would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 without additional kinds of tax provisions in there. The nine times we have increased the minimum wage we have only added tax provisions on one time. It is not necessary to add additional tax provisions. since we are restoring the purchasing power of the minimum wage to what it was some 10 years ago. But I raise another broader issue for a few moments and that is. What is it about these working families that so outrages our Republican friends? What is it about providing a decent wagesome would say it is not decent because it is still so low at $7.25 an hourbut what is it about our Republican friends that they refuse to give us a vote in the Senate? It is true that 80 Republicans voted for an increase over in the House of Representatives. But Republican leadership has been strongly opposed to this over the last 10 years",

We hear talk of honoring people who work hard and play by the rules. Yet. as the Senator recounted. the minimum wage hasnt been increased for 10 years. There has been almost a hostility to workers in this body and down the hall in the House of Representatives. where 6 million workers. as Senator KENNEDY pointed out. have lost their overtime or have had their overtime limited. There were attempts to cut the prevailing wage in Louisiana when the average wage of workers in Louisiana in the building trades was only $29.000. When you look at the charts Senator KENNEDY pointed out. you see there is an absolute stagnation or decline in wages in the last 5 years for most Americansfor the 80 percent lowest paid Americans. if you will.

The rising tide raised all the boats across the country. Then look at what happened. Productivity went up. and the real minimum wage went down. Does the Senator not share the belief with me that if workers are going to work hard and producewe have the labor force that is the hardest working labor force in the industrial world. It works longer. harder. and has had the greatest increase in productivity.

You are adding to the wealth of your employer. the wealth of our country. making our country better off.

That is why one of the best selling books out there now is a book called \"War Against The Middle Class.\" As Senator KENNEDY has said. it is clear that as productivity has gone up. as workers are working harder than ever before. only a relatively small number of people are sharing in the wealth they create or sharing in the productivity gains that have always marked the success of our country and of our economy.",

For millions around the world. especially Latinos. the final curtain on the holiday season doesnt begin to fall until January 6. Three Kings Day. From El Barrio through Mexico and the Carribean all the way down to the tip of South America. communities find their own unique way to celebrate the Biblical journey of Balthasar. Melchior. and Caspar. Like Christmas. it is a day for kids and family. a time to exchange gifts and celebrate life. Surely. it is also a time to remember that acts of kindness and generosity should extend well into the year. Yet. perhaps more than any other day of the season. it is day to remember the potential that we all have for greatness. especially our children. Balthasar. Melchior. and Caspar traveled on the wings of hope. believing that a better future lay in the hands of this humble child in the manger. They did not write him off because he was a carpenters son or because he was poor. They crossed deserts and overcame hurdles because they believed that despite his present conditions. his future was as bright and limitless as the stars that adorned the sky. Unfortunately. not enough of todays children are at the center of that kind of investment of time and energy. Despite the tireless work of many parents and educators. far too many are falling through the cracks in schools that are illequipped to teach them the skills that they need for work and life. So on this last weekend of the holiday season. let all of us resolve to renew our commitment to our next generation. The private and public sector must work together to arm our children with the necessary tools that they will need to realize their goals and dreams. The future of this great land rests on their shoulders and how many of them have the opportunity to fully shine and reach their full potential.",

I rise today to call attention to and to honor the recent heroics of Wesley Autrey. the selfless New Yorker who this past week jumped in front of a subway train to save a stranger that had fallen below. As we begin the difficult task of putting America back on track. we can all draw inspiration from this 50yearold Harlem father. The construction worker was with his two daughters waiting for the train when he noticed that film student Cameron Hollopeter had suffered a seizure. The Navy veteran and two other strangers immediately rushed to the 20yearolds aid. Autrey helped stabilize him. sticking a pen in his mouth to prevent him from swallowing his tongue. Yet. just when it appeared that he was fine. Hollopeter had a relapse and stumbled off the subway platform. With a No. 1 train fast approaching. Autrey made a split second decision to put this young mans life ahead of his own. He jumped down and pinned Hollopeter between the rails. shielding him from harms way. In the days since that split second decision. Autrey has been deservingly lavished with tons of media attention and honors. Not surprisingly. the humble Autrey has been caught off guard. He wasnt thinking of the fame or glory. All he could think about. he says. was his girls6yearold Shuqui and 4yearold Syshe. He didnt want them to see a man die before their eyes. He didnt want them to witness their father do nothing to stop the blood and the screams that could follow. He asked himself. how will I be judged? Will it be said that I had the opportunity to help and just sat there to do nothing. His conscience wouldnt let him be stilland neither should any of us. We live in a time of great imbalance. In the midst of great prosperity. tar too many are struggling to just keep their head above water. Far too many are disconnected from opportunity and hope. We must follow the example set by Mr. Autrey and not sit on the sidelines while injustice and tragedy unfolds before our eyes. We must ask ourselves: Did we do all that we could to help our fellow brothers and sisters? What did we do to help better the world? Wesley Autrey has done his duty. Now its time to do ours.

It provides that any security commitment. arrangement. or assurance that obligates the United States to respond to internal or external threats against Iraq must be approved by an act of Congress or by a treaty that receives advice and consent. Mr. Chairman. the United States has many friends around the world. including in the Middle East. with whom we have nonlegally binding arrangement about security. However. legally binding security commitments to use the Armed Forces of the United States have only been entered into with the approval of Congress. U.S. security commitments to NATO and Japan. for example. have been made pursuant to a treaty subject to advice and consent with the Senate. I believe that past precedent should be our guide as to how to deal with any legally binding obligation of the United States that would commit both the current President and all of his successors to defending Iraq. If the President believes this is wise for the country. he should not do it alone. it should only be taken with congressional approval. Mr. Chairman. this is not an esoteric or hypothetical situation. This past weekend I was in Baghdad with Speaker PELOSIs delegation. Its quite clear from our discussions there that the government of Iraq at the highest level expects that any strategic framework or other agreement between the United States and Iraq will include a legally binding security commitment that would require the United States to respond to threats against Iraq. This amendment ensures congressional approval and. implicitly. congressional oversight of any proposed legally binding commitment to Iraqs security. I would hope that all my colleagues. irrespective of their political affiliation and their views about the conflict in Iraq. would agree that Congress should not be sidelined when it comes to what could be a millennial commitment to defend a country in the heart of one of the hottest regions on the planet.

This amendment asks that the Secretaries jointly establish and operate a temporary program to offer employment as translators. interpreters. et cetera. This is not a mandate in the words at all that are before us. Under this amendment. these Iraqis must have assisted our country in Iraq for at least a year and be here in the United States legally. As a practical matter. these are the Iraqis who have been brought to our country under the legislation offered by my good friend DUNCAN HUNTER that was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2 years ago. which is good language. We are also not talking about a large number of people. We are talking about 760 people who have been brought to the United States. I think we can do something for them. I think a careful reading of the amendment will solve a lot of discussion today. Mr. ISRAEL is right.",

Again. this committee worked to make sure that they got over here. that they were protected and that their families were protected. and I am glad we did that. I will offer my small offices. We have had jobs fairs at Bethesda and Walter Reed for our returning wounded warriors where we bring people from industry and we bring people from the agencies and we try to get them together with our wounded vets who are returning and help them to match up and get jobs. I would be happy to do the same thing with respect to these interpreters. And. indeed. interpreters have special skills. This should be something that can be done. The only thing I would object to is the mandated job. We dont offer that to our veterans. I just think that is a step a little bit too far.

The idea that the gentleman has given us a requirement for the administration to project until 2068. for 50. 60 years as to what is going to happen on the battlefield and what the casualties are going to be. and I believe he has laid out 23 considerations. When you get out that far. Mr. Chairman. this becomes basically an editorial against the war. and I think there are other ways you can put that if you want to frame that particular position. But the idea that we are asking as we sit here and try to figure out what gas prices are going to be in 2 weeks. the idea that we are going to figure out how Iraq is going to be situated half a century from now. I think that is simply something that trivializes our debate on this very critical issue. And let me tell you. 23 factors if we actually put this thing in law. the idea that we are supposed to have our people in uniform devoted to figuring out how to succeed in their mission. how to take care of our people. to have them out there trying to be seers of the future for half a century with respect to a war that is changing on a weekly basis is an enormous burden on people who wear the uniform. So. Mr. Chairman. I think we should all vote a resounding \"no\" on this. and lets do analyses that are relevant. that can be utilized. But the idea of sending our people down the pike for a 50year look at the future I think is not going to be good for this committee and I think it is not going to be productive for the security of the United States.

The two scenarios that we are talking about are based upon illustrative scenarios that the CBO has already used and estimated the longterm costs of this war. The third estimate allows the administration to base their cost estimates on their own parameters. including the operational costs. the reconstruction costs. the costs to government contractors. private military security firms. and providing lifetime health care and disability benefits for veterans. We know this is done on a daily basis in the private sector. because these types of projections are made for people suffering these very same signature wounds who are injured in automobile collisions and then taken care of by Federal dollars.",

Although often overlooked. each military service offers active duty personnel and eligible members of the Guard and Reserve tuition assistance to take college courses during offduty hours. For example. the Armed Forces Tuition Assistance Program offers active duty personnel up to $4.500 each year to take college courses. These important programs help active duty soldiers to plan ahead by getting an education and setting goals that match their career aspirations. However. with the demands of deployments and training. many active duty soldiers have difficulty finding time to use these education benefits and face obstacles in attending the institution of their choice. In response. Congressman HINOJOSA and I have introduced this straightforward amendment which gives military installations the ability to enter into partnership with educational institutions for the purpose of making course schedules and curriculum more accessible and flexible for active duty troops. Such partnerships have proven effective in certain areas of the country. and our amendment makes clear the importance of working with local institutions to assist servicemembers in taking better advantage of their educational benefits.

Each of our veterans who have served this country deserves to be honored by a grateful Nation. I come to the floor today to offer an amendment that provides funding for the Authorized Provider Partnership Program. otherwise known as AP3. Before the 2000 national defense authorization. veterans who had fully retired from the military were normally not afforded a traditional military funeral. The 2000 National Defense Authorization Act then established the AP3 program. which required the Department of Defense to provide at least the folding and presentation of a flag. the playing of taps. and to assist with any transportation or miscellaneous expenses. The original provisions of this bill allow the Department of Defense to waive the obligation. which has resulted now in their funding being cut from this program. My amendment will reinstate the funding specifically for AP3 to $3 million. $1 million for the three branches of the military. to continue funeral honor services. Our veterans have served our country bravely and were prepared to take the ultimate sacrifice. We owe it to them to give them a proper and fitting sendoff in the recognition that they have served this country with honor. Their love of country will not go unrecognized. I would like to say. each of us members have attended funerals of our veterans as they passed away. and there is very compelling and very stirring of patriotism to see our older veterans pay tribute to them by honor guard or folding or presentation of the flag.

These brave men served with pride. courage and conviction. waging a war on two frontsabroad against a forceful and oppressive fascism. and at home against the intolerance of racial injustice. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor incited doubts about the loyalty of Japanese Americans. these brave men who enlisted to fight to protect our nation were faced with segregated training conditions. families and friends relocated to internment camps. and repeated questions about their combat abilities. At a time when they could have easily turned their backs on a country which had seemingly turned its back on them. these men chose the nobler. bolder. and more difficult route. The \"Go For Broke\" regiments went on to earn several awards for their distinctive service in combat. including: 7 Presidential Unit Citations. 21 Medals of Honor. 52 Distinguished Service Crosses. 560 Silver Stars. 22 Legion of Merit Medals. 15 Soldiers Medals. and nearly 10.000 Purple Hearts. among numerous additional distinctions.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. during our time in Congress we all have benefitted from the efforts of our staffs. I certainly have been blessed with the services of wonderful people through my career. The standard in my office was set early in my professional life. before I came to Congress. The daughter of a friend became my assistant in private law practice and has been with me continuously since 1968. Berna Dean Nierman has been a true and faithful friend as well as a very competent and valuable employee through the years. The first person invited to join my Congressional staff was Berna Dean. She opened the office in Sedalia. MO. and has managed it continuously since 1977. She has handled thousands of constituent problems. She has been responsible for overseeing the process for selecting appointees to the various military academies and she has had responsibility for helping arrange tours for constituents who are visiting the Capitol from Missouris 4th District. She has handled countless phone calls on legislative issues and problems in government and has always been professional in her response always. We have shared professional and personal triumphs and hardships. It has been a joy to watch her celebrate her marriage to Wayne Nierman and then to see the family grow as Christopher and Christine came along and developed into outstanding young adults in their own right. She was a friend and confidant to my late wife Susie. Her advice and counsel were always welcomed by her and I continue to benefit from her wise counsel. Berna Dean was my first employee and set a very high standard for those who followed. Her character and work ethic. along with an engaging and warm personality. reflect the small town values instilled in her by her wonderful parents. After 32 years of Congressional service and 40 years working with me. Berna Dean Nierman is retiring. She will be missed. but I know I am not losing a friend. but just changing the location where I can contact her. She and Wayne have my best wishes for many. many happy years together. I ask the Congress to join me in thanking her for her outstanding service to the people of the Fourth Congressional District of Missouri and our country.",

President Truman sent U.S. forces to support South Korea and the United Nations followed suit. This initial conflict led to a 3year war in which American forces defended South Korean territory against Communist invaders from North Korea and China. The United States and our allies suffered numerous successes and setbacks. engaging in a difficult struggle for terrain on the Korean peninsula. In the end. over 54.000 American service members died during the Korean War and over 100.000 were wounded. We are still living with the legacy of the Korean war today. Thousands of American servicemembers remain on guard on the Korean peninsula along the Demilitarized Zone. While the Korean war is sometimes called the \"Forgotten War.\" it is certainly not forgotten in the 110Oth Congress. I am proud to honor the commitment and service of those soldiers who fought in Korea and those who continue to stand watch at their posts on the peninsula today. On this day. the 57th anniversary of the start of the Korean war. we honor the sacrifice and service of Americas Armed Farces and pledge to continue to work on their behalf in this Congress and beyond.",

The American GI. in my judgment. has sacrificed greatly. and their families. in giving sovereignty to this Nation. Now we see it is in the grip of extraordinary sectarian violence. Sunni upon Shia. Shia upon Sunni. I am not trying to ascribe which is more guilty than the other. but why should they proceed to try and destabilize the very government that gives all Iraqis a tremendous measure of freedom. free from tyranny and from Saddam Hussein. Why should the American GI. who does not have a language proficiency. who does not have a full understanding of the culture giving rise to these enormous animosities and hatreds that precipitate the killings and other actionswhy should not that be left to the Iraqi forces? We have trained upwards of 200.000. We have reason to believe today there are 60.000 to 70.000 who are testedin many respects they have been participating in a number of military operations. together with our forces. Let elements of that group be the principals to take the lead. as they proudly say. give them the lead. and go into the sectarian violence. That would enable our commanders. our President. to send fewer than 20.500 into that area.

So I thank both leaders. and I join my distinguished leader at this time in the objection because I do hope we do not have to resort to legislative need of a bill.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his excellent statement. He outlined the issue very well. I emphasize two points the Senator made. First is the cost. The National Governors Association has estimated that compliance with the requirements of the REAL ID card will impose $11 billion of costs on State governments over the next 5 years. Yet we have appropriated only $40 million to be used toward that cost. and of that amount the Department of Homeland Security has only allocated $6 million. so only a tiny fraction of the expected cost. The second point I emphasize is the Department of Homeland Security has yet to issue the regulations detailing how States are to comply with the law. So to expect the States to comply by May of next year with regulations that have yet to be issued is simply unfair and will add another layer of costs because of the short time for compliance. This 2 years will allow a more careful review. It will allow more input by the States when DHS does issue the regulations. and it will allow us to devise a costeffective way of achieving a goal all of us have. and that is to make drivers licenses more secure. I am very grateful for the insights of the Senator from Tennessee. for his support. and for his very early leadership on this issue. Madam President.

We worked together when last this subject came before the Senate to bring about a result that I believe was a good one and in the public interest. which was that the Secretary of Homeland Security issued regulations to create an identity card. The card has a marvelous acronym. which doesnt sound as serious as it is. The acronym is TWIC. transportation worker identification card. This is one of the necessities of the post9/11 age. that we need to move toward some filter for people working in areas that now have become higher vulnerability areas and are more likely targets for terrorism. Unfortunately. that includes our ports and. obviously. includes our airports as well. which have a separate ID program on which they are working. I know there is some hope within the Department of Homeland Security that we are moving toward a more common program for a similar background check and card for postal workers at a host of different transportationrelated locations to protect them and us from potential terrorist attacks. Senator DEMINT.

It doesnt rewind the clock in terms of throwing out the work that the Department has done. but it recognizes that it is simply unreasonable to expect States to comply by May of next year with complex and costly regulations that the Department has yet to issue. The Department has yet to issue the detailed guidance that the States need. It also recognizes that the quality of the final regulations will be improved by the formation of a committee with State officials. privacy advocates. technological experts. and Federal officials sitting down. looking at the regulations. and providing input to the Department on their proposed regulations and also providing that input to us. The third provision of the amendment would increase the waiver authority that the Secretary can have if it proves that there are technological barriers to complying with certain provisions of the law. I think this is a reasonable approach to a real problem. Finally. let me say to my colleagues. the estimates for the cost of compliance with this law are as high as $11 billion over the next 5 years. This is a huge unfunded mandate on the States. My hope is through our approach we can come up with more practical. costeffective means of achieving a goal that all of us share and that is improving the security of drivers licenses that are used for Federal identification purposes. such as boarding an airplane. There is a real need to have a secure drivers license. but lets do it in a practical. collaborative way. and lets make sure there is adequate time to comply.

I am writing with respect to the Senate debate over S. 4. legislation to implement 9/11 Commission recommendations. We understand that an amendment may be offered. possibly by Senator DeMint. to strike or weaken a provision in the bill that gives Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screeners collective bargaining and other civil service protections. We strongly urge you to oppose this amendment. In addition. we urge you to support an amendment to be offered by Senator Collins that would delay implementation of requirements under the REAL ID Act and to reopen negotiated rulemaking of the Act. With respect to the DeMint amendment. it is important to highlight that civil service protections. backed up by collective bargaining. ensure that federal employment is efficient. fair. open to all. free from political interference and staffed by honest. competent and dedicated employees. Civil service protections and collective bargaining rights ensure that federal employees are able to fulfill their assignments with professional integrity and a commitment to the public interest. The decision to take away civil service protections and collective bargaining rights has resulted in a demoralized workforce. with injury and illness rates that are six times higher than the federal average and an attrition rate that is more than ten times higher than the federal employee average. Clearly. the removal of civil service protections and collective bargaining rights has jeopardized the public. not made it safer. With respect to the Collins amendment. we have previously expressed our concern over the costs to the states to implement the requirements under the REAL ID Act. It is clear that states do not have the capacity to comply with the Act by the 2008 deadline and that a number of serious concerns related to privacy must be addressed. The Collins amendment provides the opportunity to address these matters. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005. Part of a suite of measures to beef up homeland security. the act requires that by mid2008. Americans must have a federally approved ID cardmost likely an enhanced drivers licenseto travel on airplanes. collect government payments or use government services and open a bank account. The national ID cards would have to be machinereadable. As the deadline approaches for compliance with the act. opposition to the mandate has grown. Late last month. the Maine Legislature became the first in the nation to pass a measure against the requirement. unequivocally refusing to implement the act and urging Congress to repeal it. Too expensive. too fast. too much of an invasion of privacy and too burdensome to administer. said a bipartisan coalition of Maine lawmakers. Estimate of the cost of compliance in Maine alone is $185 million. The Legislatures rejection made news around the nation. What Maine started threatened to become a tidal wave of state opposition. In an effort to stem the momentum and salvage what she considers good about the requirement. U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Friday announced shes introducing legislation to delay implementation of the act and provide states with a more reasonable time frame for complying with its new standards for drivers licenses. \"The costs of complying with REAL ID are enormous and overly burdensome to states. including Maine.\" said Collins. We agree. Collins legislation puts the brakes on a mandate that raises significant concerns. as well as the broader question of whether the REAL ID would ultimately be effective. Her bill would give the Department of Homeland Security the ability to delay or waive REAL ID requirements if states dont have the technical capability to comply with it. or the money. It furthermore calls to the discussion table the right group of people to hammer out an alternative: federal and state officials. privacy advocates and others with a stake in the matter. Were encouraged that this senator. who has made her name as an advocate of effective and real security measures. has focused on finding a solution to the real problems posed by REAL ID.

The amendment offered by Senator DEMINT codifies in statute the list of permanent and interim disqualifying offenses for individuals applying for a TWIC that the Department of Homeland Security has already codified in final regulations this January.

Senator DEMINTs language restricts the authority of the Secretary to identify. adopt. and modify criminal offenses that may pose a terrorist security threat.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. Democrats wisely seized on earmark reform as an issue during last years elections. I believe that their promises of reform. coupled with the Republican Partys inability to control earmarks. directly contributed to the Democrats success in last years elections. However. the majority party does not appear to be following through with the substantive reforms that were promised. Take the LaborHHS bill that will soon be considered in conference. It contains more than 1.300 House earmarks. more than 1.000 Senate earmarks. It goes without saying that few of these earmarks have received even a cursory screening. let alone a thorough vetting. We need to remember that we are only halfway through the process and it is in the conference that much of the earmark mischief occurs. Public confidence in our ability as stewards of their taxpayer dollars will further erode. Madam Speaker. while watching the Democrats make the same political miscalculations as we did in the majority may delight us as Republicans. it has to be sorely disappointing to taxpayers. I urge all Members. Republicans and Democrats. to support legislation to impose an earmark moratorium until we can scrutinize all earmarks.",

This morning. the Associated Press reported that President Bush will veto any plan that raises the resources necessary to fund childrens health care. An overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats in Congress disagree with the President on this issue. But the President is content to continue to stand between 10 million children and their health care. The Presidents refusal to move forward could have serious consequences for middleclass families. The New York Times reported today that 21 States will run out of money for childrens health care this year if the spending for the SCHIP program continues only at current levels. The parents of these children earn a paycheck. not a welfare check. Millions of children and their parents are counting on this President and Republicans in Congress to offer more than an emergency room as health care. The same children who are counting on the President to act will celebrate Halloween this evening and President Bush wont miss out on the fun. At 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. President Bush is having what he calls an SCHIP Halloween. Its all trick. no treat. Hes preventing health care coverage for millions of kids.",

They mask them with official decals and even license plates. thus. making it easier to bring drugs into the United States. Even though this criminal activity is highly organized. at least 11 drug dealers have been captured bringing thousands of dollars worth of drugs into our country using these fake State vehicles. But when the U.S. Attorney prosecuted these criminals. they received relatively light sentences. Some people received only fines. One received 24 months in prison. far less than the 11and 12year sentences that Border Agents Ramos and Compean received when they were prosecuted by the same U.S. Attorney for wounding a drug smuggler on the border. The U.S. Attorneys weak prosecution of drug smugglers is disturbing. The U.S. Attorneys Office seems to be more interested in prosecuting border agents than it is in prosecuting the real criminals that bring drugs into our country. The overwhelming message here is that a measly fine is just a cost of doing business: the drug smuggling business in America. And thats just the way it is.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. within the last month. the American people have seen just how misplaced President Bushs priorities are when it comes to addressing the needs of hardworking Americans. Earlier this month. the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have provided 10 million children private health insurance through the SCHIP program. The bill cost an additional $35 billion over the next 5 years. and would have allowed us to receive 4 million more uninsured children. Instead. the President suggested a mere $5 billion increase. which would lead to more than 800.000 children losing their health insurance coverage. Contrast that with the Presidents announcement last week that he was requesting an additional $189 billion in emergency funds over the next year for the war in Iraq. which was $42 billion higher than originally thought. Fortunately. most Americans. Senators and Governors have caught on to the Presidents misplaced priorities. But Republicans here in the House continue to blindly follow this President. And just as they refused to join us last week in standing by these 10 million kids. House Republicans will most likely sign off on the Presidents war funding request without ever asking a single question.",

On behalf of the Twin Cities and the citizens of Minnesota. I wish to congratulate West Side Community Health Services for their work providing a progressive health care model that emphasizes education. prevention. and integrated services. These outstanding services are provided with respect for the cultures of the patients they serve. For more than a generation. West Side Community Health Services has been the voice for Latino. Hmong. adolescent. immigrant. and low income communities. West Side Community Health Services can be proud of their outreach to educate patients and family members where health care knowledge is needed most: In urban neighborhoods. schools. areas of public housing and homeless shelters. In 1969. West Side Community Health Services was established when a group of volunteers saw the need for bilingual health care for Spanish speaking residents. Located in the basement of St. Michaels Church. volunteers served between 6 and 7 patients a day. Since then. West Side Community Health Services has flourished. incorporating its first clinic servicing 1.900 people in 1972. adding dental services in 1978. health care for the homeless in 1987 and two public housing clinics in 1993. In 2000. West Side Community Health Services achieved accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations. In its 35 years. West Side Community Health Services has increased the number of patients served to over 35.000. In 2006. 84 percent of their patients were from Asian. African American. American Indian or Latino communities. 85 percent had incomes less than $41.000 for a family of four. and half did not have health insurance. The 250 people who work at West Side Community Health Services facilitate access to health care by breaking down barriers related to trust. cost. location. culture. and language. In doing so West Side Community Health Services provides much needed care to vulnerable members of the communityserving them with the compassion. respect and quality health care they deserve. Madam Speaker. in honor of the founders of West Side Community Health Services. its staff. board members. and volunteers committed to educating and improving the health of the community.

Smith was a visionary who knew that Minneapolis could become a place of equal opportunity for all people regardless of racial or ethnic differences. During the turbulent 1960s. Smith worked vigorously to advance the cause of the civil rights movement in Minneapolis. He served as a local facilitator working with community leaders to set into action the teachings of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Smiths efforts ultimately contributed to the creation of human rights commissions in Minneapolis and throughout the state of Minnesota. Smith also helped guide local social action groups such as the Minneapolis Urban League and the Black Unity and Futurism Youth Organization of Minneapolis. Recognizing the important role which unions play in protecting workers rights. Smith fought vigorously to gain union membership for African American workers. Once that battle was won. Smith accepted the challenge of becoming a union organizer. working for the American Federation of State. County and Municipal Employees. AFLCIO in New Orleans. Atlanta and Tulsa. In closing.

This battle included some of the fiercest fighting of the Pacific Theater in which his division. the Sixth Marine Division Reinforced. suffered 2.662 casualties. According to Mr. James Forrestal. Secretary of the Navy in 1945. \"Units of the division withstood overwhelming artillery and mortar barrages. repulsed furious counterattacks and staunchly pushed over the rocky terrain to reduce almost impregnable defenses and captured Sugar Loaf Hill.\" Sievertson was wounded during this battle on May 19. 1945 and received the Purple Heart. After recovering in a Navy hospital in Guam. he returned to his unit and participated in the occupation of Japan after its surrender to the United States. Many years later as a civilian. Sievertson learned from the West Virginia Veterans of Foreign Wars Newsletter that his division had been given a Presidential Unit Citation from President Harry S. Truman. The article described how another Marine had served in the same division during the same time period and had received the award from his U.S. Senator decades later. This inspired Sievertson to contact his Congressman to see if he qualified for the award also. After some inquires by my staff. we learned that Sievertson did indeed qualify for the citation and was long overdue to receive it. After 62 years. on August 20. 2007. I had the pleasure of personally awarding Mr. Sievertson the Presidential Unit Citation for the Battle of Sugar Loaf Hill.

It was your colleague who stepped on the floor and talked about we dont want oil exploration off the coast. We dont want more crude oil supplies. Well. I have a solution that would help keep our beaches healthy. Lets use coal to liquid technologies. Lets mine our vast abundant resource of coal right here. Lets build a coal to liquid refinery. In fact. Sasol. the South African energy company. just announced that the Brits are going to buy synthetic aviation fuel. You know. we had all these aviation industry folks just go bankrupt. these low cost airlines that could get to these healthy beaches. You know one reason why they went bankrupt? The high cost of aviation fuel. Those are jobs gone. Those are the inability of me and my family on a low cost airline to appreciate these healthy beaches. Well. I have a solution. Theyve been to the floor on motion to commit coal to liquid technology. Get our coal. refine it in to liquid fuels. put it in a pipeline and ship it to our commercial and military aviation. Ive been using this chart for a year and a half. Has this majority moved on decreasing our reliance on imported crude oil? Negligibly. Zip. zero. Maybe on the RFS. I voted for it. I appreciate that. But doing anything to expand our ability to get our own resources. no. were here talking about healthy beaches. We dont want to talk about crude oil exploration.

If we are really concerned about lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign oil. we need to invest in renewable resources. and we have passed legislation to do just that. The open rule before us today is a fair rule that allows for debate on the important issues that face our country. from water pollutants to public health concerns. It is Congress responsibility to set high standards and assert proper oversight of these issues. The underlying bill. H.R. 2537. takes huge steps to promote public health throughout the great beaches of our country and ensure that our beaches will be preserved for future generations to enjoy and benefit from. Congress has a distinct obligation to future generations to keep our water clean and preserve our beaches. This bill increases funding for States to effectively monitor the coasts. ensure swift public notification and takes us into the next generation of water monitoring. We have a commitment to keep the millions who visit our beaches safe and informed. This bill does just that. and I urge its adoption. Mr. Speaker. I urge a \"yes\" vote on the previous question and on the rule. I yield back the balance of my time. and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered.",

Many Americans do not know the depth of this crisisonly 35 percent of people with disabilities are able to find jobs. Those people with disabilities who are not as fortunate are left to grapple with numerous obstacles to work and are often not provided the opportunity to become independent. selfsufficient wage earners. For almost all Americans. employment focuses on ability. But for people with disabilities. it is often the disability that takes precedence. We all have abilities and as responsible citizens. it is our imperative to apply them for the greater good. When all Americans work. communities will benefit as people with disabilities become selfsufficient. taxpaying citizens. I commend people with disabilities for their tireless efforts to share their abilities in the American workplace despite barriers. and hope that someday the high unemployment rate will be a thing of the past. I am proud to support a program that helps us reach the goal of employment for all: the AbilityOne Program. The AbilityOne Program provides muchneeded employment opportunities by using the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy products and services from participating communitybased nonprofit agencies that are dedicated to training and employing individuals with disabilities. In this program. people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities have the opportunity to acquire job skills and training. receive good wages and benefits and gain greater independence and quality of life. In the United States. the program serves nearly 38.000 people with disabilities and generated approximately $369 million in wages earned and $1.6 billion in products sold. In Georgia alone. over 900 people with disabilities earned $8.7 million in wages last year as a result of AbilityOne. I am proud that Georgias 10th congressional district is home to brandnew AbilityOne contract at the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center. The Honorable Charlie was an AbilityOne Congressional Champion during his years in office and I am proud to carry on his tradition of supporting people with disabilities and the fine work they do. It is with great pleasure that I extend my support to the AbilityOne Program. its supporters. and its workers for making a difference in unemployment among people with disabilities in this country.",

I am very disappointed that a minority of Senators blocked the ConsumerFirst Energy Act of 2008. which puts American consumers ahead of big oil companies and other corporate interests. This bill would prevent price gouging and market manipulation from driving up the price of gas. The antiprice gouging language. based on Senator CANTWELLs bill that I cosponsored. would protect consumers from price gouging by sellers and distributors of oil. gasoline. or petroleum distillates during natural disasters and abnormal market disruptions. As a cosponsor of the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act. I also strongly support closing loopholes that allow traders using overseas markets to secretively bid up the price of oil and saddle Americans with the price at the gas pump. Todays vote on the ConsumerFirst Energy Act of 2008 was an opportunity 54. Pt. 9 11915 to stand up to the OPEC cartel and force big oil to pay their fair share. I have long supported the efforts of the senior Senator from Wisconsin to make oilproducing and exporting cartels illegal and make colluding oilproducing nations liable in U.S. court for violations of antitrust law. Our oil companies can also be part of the solution. This bill would have encouraged them to Invest in clean. affordable. and domestically produced renewable alternative fuels. expanded refinery capacity and utilization. and renewable electricity production. Last years Renewable Fuels. Consumer Protection. and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 put our Nations energy policy on a new path: one that encourages renewable energy. conservation of the resources we have. and American innovation.

Our current chairman.

As a result of this report. the President came out with his American Competitive Initiative. and this Congress passed. and the President signed. the America COMPETES Act. which specifically addresses the concerns raised in this resolution. In COMPETES. were dedicating resources to create a broad pool of citizens who are literate in STEM subjects and we are increasing science scholarships and providing financial resources to attract underrepresented populations to STEM fields. Likewise. NSF is funding tremendous STEM education curriculum work in all grades. and OSTP and other Federal agencies. like the Department of Education. are providing strong leadership as appropriate at the Federal level.

Quinn Chapel reached out to the community. becoming a positive influence on families looking for opportunity in the early days of Michigan. As Flint grew. so did Quinn Chapel. In 1877 the congregation moved from Mrs. Wests home and into a new location on Seventh Street. A decision was made in 1912 to build a new sanctuary and the brick structure was dedicated in 1922. The music program gained national recognition and the Senior Choir took first place in a national music contest during the 1940s. When the City of Flint decided to build the municipal center in 1955. Quinn Chapel had to relocate again. The first Church service was held in the new structure on Lippincott Boulevard on December 25. 1960.

This tradition of service began on June 27. 1856. when the Sisters of Mercy arrived in St. Louis to open St. Francis Xavier Parish School at the request of then Archbishop Peter J. Kenrick. The Sisters later expanded their ministry beyond the school walls. establishing an orphanage. instituting an industrial school for singleparent children. beginning a Sunday school course for African American women. and continuously visiting the poor. sick. and imprisoned. The Sisters in these ministries frequently incurred personal sacrifices. but this did not deter them from their good works.

With undying faith and dedication. however. the Sisters were able to overcome these challenges. In their many years of service. the Sisters of Mercy have worked at five high schools and more than 20 parish elementary schools.

I commend the President for making this trip and for recognizing the sacrifices made on the streets of Budapest in the name of liberty and justice. Fifty years ago. at the height of the Cold War. Central Europe. was a prisoner. and Moscow was its jailer. Confronted with overwhelming Soviet domination. the Hungarian response was to reaffirm the core values of democracy: individual freedom and national independence. On October 23. 1956. these two powerful forcestyrannical communism and the principles of democracymet and clashed in the middle of Europe. Within the Soviet Empire. the 1956 Hungarian Revolution presented an alternative to a deceptively dangerous idea. the idea that the best solution to a warravaged world is to eliminate political. cultural. religious. economic and national differences by imposing a single. universal \"truth.\" This idea represented the incontestable dogma of communism. At the heart of the clash was Imre Nagy who assumed the post of Prime Minister even announced Hungarys intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. But. when the Soviet Union crushed Hungarys bid for freedom during those day in October. Imre Nagy and his colleagues were arrested. convicted in secret trials. and eventually executed as \"traitors\" on June 16. 1958. To prevent the inevitable expressions of support for Nagy and what he stood for. he and the others executed with him were buried by the Moscowbacked regime in Budapest in unmarked graves. The significance of his and countless other Hungarians sacrifice is etched onto the political map of the 21st century and echoed in the recent developments throughout the world. As President Bush observed. \"The lesson of the Hungarian experience is clear: liberty can be delayed. but it cannot be denied.\" That is the real moral of the events of 1956 and the subsequent human sacrifices of Imre Nagy and his fellow freedom fighters.

I am proud to celebrate this accomplishment today. and prouder still to note the Liberty Tribune is the secondoldest weekly newspaper west of the Mississippi River still in continuous publication. From their modest beginnings. founded by 19yearold Robert H. Miller. the Liberty Tribune has always called the town square their home. Mr. Miller founded the Tribune through the financial contributions of Dr. William Jewell. namesake of the nationally recognized William Jewell College. The Liberty Tribune has covered and been a part of historically significant news in their community from the very beginning. The Tribune boasts the only embedded reporter during Alexander Doniphans march to the MexicanAmerican War. They covered the persecution of Mormon founder Joseph Smith and the first crime committed by legendary outlaw Jesse James. The Liberty Tribune has been bringing all the news of the day to the citizens of Liberty since 1846 and they show no signs of stopping. Today the Bradley family of St. Joseph. proud owners of the Tribunes parent company the NewsPress Gazette. carry on the tradition of dedicated news coverage for the citizens of Liberty. Missouri.

Secondly. it is estimated that 40 percent of the people here illegally are visa overstays. Some go back after awhile. Some never go back. What does this constitute?

My bill would expedite the implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling. or COOL. for beef and other agricultural products. and set that date at September 30. 2007. I am pleased that Senator BAUCUS joins me in this effort. as does Senator THUNE. Senator GRASSLEY. Senator TESTER. Senator BINGAMAN. Senator DORGAN. Senator ENZI. and Senator CONRAD. Consumers drive our economy. and it is important that we provide them relevant information about the products they are purchasing. U.S. consumers overwhelmingly support mandatory COOL. They have a right to know where their food comes from. Labeling provides more product information. increased consumer choice. and the chance to support American agriculture. Labeling also allows our producers to distinguish their superior products. Trade is not going away. With increased trade comes an increase in the importance of country of origin labeling. Many nations already label food and other productsincluding the United States. If it is good enough for Tshirts. it ought to be good enough for Tbones. Mandatory COOL was signed into law with the 2002 Farm Bill. I was an original supporter of COOL during the Farm Bill debate. and I have become increasingly frustrated with efforts to delay its implementation. The latest delay was inserted into the Fiscal Year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill. and I voted against the bill for that reason. Producers and consumers have waited long enough for country of origin labeling. It is high time we make it happen. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed In the RECORD.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation that will bring parity to all renewable energy facilities that qualify for the production tax credit under section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code. I have been a longtime supporter of the production tax credit. There are significant wind facilities in Oregon. January 26. 2007 CONGRE where we have over 335 megawatts of installed wind capacity. These facilities provide clean energy as well as important revenues to farmers and rural counties in Eastern Oregon. Currently. however. some eligible renewable facilities get only half the perkilowatt credit that other types of facilities receive. My goal here is to level the playing field for all eligible renewables without reducing the credit any facility currently receives. Therefore. my bill provides that all eligible facilities would receive the higher credit amount for each kilowatt of electricity produced. I believe that this bill will help to provide the necessary incentives to diversify our renewable energy resources. It will also eliminate the competitive disadvantage that certain types of renewables currently face. Utilities have little incentive to select renewables that qualify for the lower credit rate when buying green power. The eligible facilities that receive the lower rate include openloop biomass. incremental hydropower. and small irrigation systems. all of which are important energy sources that could help meet the growing demand for electricity in my State of Oregon and in many other parts of the country. I urge my colleagues to join me in increasing the credit rate for eligible renewables. and fostering the development and deployment of these important facilities.

I do not believe it is important at this time to restate a position that many of us took in this Nation in opposition to the attack against Iraq: preemptive. unilateral. and without a constitutional vote of this Congress. We have long since said that we stand united behind the United States military. but it is clear that our policies now in the aftermath are failing. with the insurgents going against our troops in high numbers. with the loss of life increasing and now the political delay because those in Iraq want direct and prompt election. In addition. it is important not to cover up the wash out. the white out. the words of Mr. Kay. finding no weapons of mass destruction. Today. I ask for a serious and collaborative effort with the United Nations who. of course. this government has approached. our NATO allies and Mideast allies to deal with the aftermath of Iraq. Secondarily. I ask for a full and open hearing by all committees of jurisdiction on the issue of the lack of finding of weapons of mass destruction. I do that because that is the basis upon which representations were made to the United States and the people for which we entered into Iraq.

I rise today in support of H.R. 1385. the Breast Cancer Research Postal Stamp because I believe that number is unacceptable. Breast cancer is currently the most common cancer among women in the United States with incidents on the rise. In my home State of New Jersey over 6.000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer last year and tragically. approximately 1.500 women died from this terrible disease. I support and cosponsored H.R. 1385 because it is about changing those statistics. it is about hope. In December of 2003. the Breast Cancer Research Stamp expired. and today we have an opportunity and a responsibility to renew it. Approximately 500 million copies of this special Breast Cancer Research Stamp have been sold. raising about $40 million for the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. These are programs that help more women get screened. help more breast cancer cases to be detected and detected early. and help more women get the treatment that allows them to survive. There is another very positive aspect of the Breast Cancer Research Stampit raises awareness. Each time the stamp passes hands as a letter goes from sender to recipient. another person becomes aware. another man grows concemed and reminds his wife to get a mammogram. another woman schedules a checkup with her doctor. and another mother teaches her daughter about breast self exams. Mr. Speaker. I rise today because \"breast cancer needs to be stamped out!\" I strongly hope that my colleagues will stand with me and reauthorize the Breast Cancer Research Stamp.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise in support of reauthorizing the Breast Research Stamp Act . The public has widely supported the stamp. and their voluntary purchases have generated over $35 million dollars for breast cancer research. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program use this donation to help the 2 million women nationwide who are daily battling this disease. The Breast Cancer Research Stamp was developed by Dr. Ernie Bodai. designed by Ethel Kessler. and introduced by Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN in 1998. Since its introduction. over 485 million stamps have been sold with 8 cents of each purchase price going toward breast research. The stamp expired December 31. 2003 and there has been overwhelming support to extend the stamps production through 2006. Congressman JOE BACA proposed the stamps extension with 148 cosponsors and numerous groups including the American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association supporting H.R. 1385. The revenue created by the sale of this stamp will help fight the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. and it will be used to educate women and encourage early detection practices in Texas and across the country. The Alamo Breast Cancer Foundation (ABCF) is a San Antonio based organization that supports awareness. treatment. and counsels those receiving cancer treatments. In Texas alone. 13.700 women will be diagnosed and 2.600 lives will be lost to this disease in the coming year. In the entire country. 40.000 people a year will die from breast cancer. Mr. Speaker. breast cancer will touch 1 out of every 8 women in America. This statistic is far too high and includes mothers. grandmothers. college students. and their loved ones. I urge my fellow Representatives to support the Breast Research Stamp Act and to continue to present the public with a simple method to donate to a worthy cause.",

In Afghanistan. they continue to perform an important mission by taking action against our enemies in the country that served as host to the Al Qaeda organization that attacked the United States of America on September 11th. 2001. and they do so with complete skill. courage. and professionalism. I am fully supportive of them and their mission. I have voted to provide funding solely for our military activities in Afghanistan. and would do so again if such a bill were to come before the House. However. the funding measure in Amendment Number 1 brought before the House today included funding for the ongoing war in Iraq without accompanying conditions on those funds or a timeline for withdrawal of American forces. I remain opposed to the Presidents mistaken war in Iraq. which has now claimed over 4.000 American lives. undermined our military and ability to respond to other threats abroad. and cost hundreds of billions of dollars that could have been used to meet pressing needs at home. I believe that we must change course in Iraq. and cannot support the appropriation of additional funds without measures to impose conditions on that funding and start bringing our troops home. Accordingly. I could not vote for Amendment Number 1.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of our troops. and in support of a responsible U.S. policy in Iraq. I have opposed the Iraq war from the very beginning. Over 5 years later. this war has taken the lives of more than 4.000 of our brave troops. Our armed forces are incredibly strained. and our nations image tarnished in the wake of this foreign relations disaster. I have opposed continued funding of this war in the past. and I will vote against Amendment No. 1. which gives the President another blank check. Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 of this bill. however. are a marked and deliberate shift away from the failed and shortsighted policies of President Bush. And No. 2 requires that all troops be fully trained and equipped before deployment. and calls for a redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq to begin in 30 days. It also bans any permanent U.S. bases in Iraq and codifies contracting fraud as a criminal offense. Amendment No. 3 will restore the education benefits under the GI bill to include a full. 4year college education for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Mr. Speaker. this war has taken an incredible toll on American troops. their families. and our entire country. We cannot turn back the hands of time. but we can move forward to bring our troops home. end this war. and provide them with the tools they will need to continue their education. As this New Direction Congress has done time and again. today we will tell the President that he is wrong. Let us truly support the troops and vote to bring them home.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2642. This bill calls for a responsible redeployment from Iraq. and forces the Administration to answer for its actions. The cost of this war continues to devastate America. This bill includes $96.6 billion in funding. but not without accountability. This bill includes funds to equip our troops. You would not have a surgeon perform a surgery without proper tools. we must not send our patriotic Americans to war without the proper equipment. This bill will increase transparency in our relationship with Iraq. and redirects the voice of America back to Congress. not the Administration. and pass on the cost of future reconstruction of Iraq back to the hands of the Iraqi people. I believe our troops and their families should be our first priority. The cost of this war comes in many forms. including unexpected costs for our military families. Just like World War II veterans. our soldiers returning from overseas will now have a GI bill that keeps Americas promise of an education to them. With the costs of the war rising. the costs of oil skyrocketing. and the number of foreclosures hitting emergency levels. many working families are facing uphill battles. Congress must not just stand by and watch. This bill includes emergency provisions for harmful Medicaid cuts and an extension on the devastated unemployment compensation program for working families. From my District alone. this war has cut short the lives of 13 young men and has brought back hundreds of injured soldiers. The cost of this war is too high both at home and overseas. our families are hanging on by a thread. I urge my colleagues to bring our troops home and support H.R. 2642.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MURTHA for his help on an important issue to me and the men and woman at Cannon Air Force Base in my district. Since the early stages of this legislation. Mr. MURTHA has worked with me to include aircraft for SOCOM and AFSOC. which has recently expanded to Cannon. Cannon is the new home to the 27th Fighter Wing. which is being stood up and is in need of aircraft appropriate to the specific job performed by these soldiers. That is why I am pleased that the supplemental includes money for CV22 and MC130J aircrafts designated for AFSOC. This will greatly assist in accelerating the capabilities at Cannon and will give the men and women serving there the tools they need to help keep America safe. The CV22s and MC130Js are integral to the training and mission work done by the 27th. I am fully committed to ensuring that our soldiers have the training and equipment they need to protect our nation. which is why I requested this funding. I would like to once again thank Mr. MURTHA demonstrating our shared commitment to our soldiers by including funding for these aircraft.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to protest the Democrat Leaderships dictatorial tactics. Our Founding Fathers. in their infinite wisdom. created a system of government by which the peoples voice would be heard in legislative decisions. especially those affecting the use of their hard earned taxpayer dollars. The House of Representatives has the awesome responsibility to represent the will of the people. and for that reason. under the Constitution of the United States. spending bills originate in this body. What we have here today. however. is the suppression of the peoples voice. This bill is brought to the floor without consideration by the committee of jurisdiction whose chairmen didnt even have input and without true consideration by the House with a lockdown rule that does not allow for consideration of amendments or a substitute bill. Democrat and Republican Members have been shut out of this process. This bill contains funding for the men and women who protect this nation at home and abroadyet the defense subcommittee which holds hearings year round about their needs has not been consulted. This bill contains funding for our nations veterans. yet again the subcommittee that best understands their needs has not been consulted. This bill contains funding for domestic priorities and yet again the subcommittees of jurisdiction have not been consulted. Why is the Speaker of the House opposed to allowing the House of Representatives have their say? I can only assume it is that she knows the American people would reject this irresponsible use of their hard earned tax dollars. This bill takes $250 billion out of the pockets of American workers. $250 billion. That cannot be taken lightly. Families across this nation are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of gas. rising food prices. rising education costs. etc. The people must have a say in whether this is a wise use of their money. I strongly support our troops. as do my constituents. yet we are not given a chance to have a say in how to best supply them. Mr. Speaker. I encourage all of my colleagues to stand up for their constituents and demand that we have a say. Vote against the bill and force the Democrat Leadership to bring this bill through regular order.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the amendment to be voted on today which will provide another blank check for the war in Iraq: I remain steadfast in my opposition to the Iraq war and its continued funding. Tens of thousands of our bravest sons and daughters have been wounded and over 4 thousand killed. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this war. which has necessarily meant we have had fewer resources to deal with significant problems here at home. Our continued military involvement in Iraq only prolongs the tragedy this war has been for our country and delays the inevitable time when Iraq will have to take responsibility for its own security. While my support for our heroic troops is unwavering. it is time to bring them home. These views are shared by the vast majority of the American people. I strongly support the other two amendments the House is considering today. One amendment would bring needed change to our efforts in Iraq. For example. it would require that the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq begin within thirty days with a goal of completing that redeployment by December 2009. And. it would encourage Iraq to contribute towards its own reconstruction. The other amendment addresses important domestic priorities. Among other provisions it would modernize educational benefits for veterans and extend unemployment insurance. It also would block devastating Medicaid regulations which. if left in place. would reduce access to safetynet health care for people across the country and threaten the ability of certain health care providerss. such as Denver Health in my district. to offer vital services. These three amendments on the floor today offer the Members of the House of Representatives a stark choice. They can choose to reject the views of the American people and blindly follow the misguided policies of the Bush Administration. Or. they can choose to end this war. support our veterans. and help Americans struggling in these dark economic times. History will look most kindly on those who show the independent judgment and wisdom that such important decisions require.",

This is an emergency. Our young people are finding the doors of opportunity closed. Many of them support their families. They need money for books. We need a summer job program.
