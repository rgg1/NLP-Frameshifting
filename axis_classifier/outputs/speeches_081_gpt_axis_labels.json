I do want to mention one thing that is a little aside from this bill. yet has contributed toward the necessity for this very piece of legislation. and that is in the future when the House considers housing legislation I sincerely hope that those who take part in the drafting and in the planning of these programs will take into consideration the impact that these housing programs have on the local communities. There should be some provision in that legislation whereby either a percentage of the rent collected on that property should go for the maintenance of the schools of that district or there should be some provision in the construction program. It is not right that we continue to create these impacts and hardships on those communities because representatives have been going out from the Housing Administration to towns. as they did in mine. and say: \"Here is some Federal money. If you do not get it. somebody else will. We are going to give it to you.\" Then proceed to take more land off the tax books. which cuts down the available revenue for the school districts. and the first thing you know you are in the situation we are in now. I drop that suggestion as being one of the things that came to our mind very forcibly in the handling of this particular piece of legislation. Any Federal housing program set in motion should take care of its own troubleslet it make provision for payments to the local schools districts. in lieu of taxes. sums of money sufficient to pay the school expenses of the children living on that nontaxable property. That is exactly what a private individual must do when he lives in his own home. and if the Federal Government does not do its part. then the homeowners taxes go up.",

The American people went to a defic.-financing program during the war. It was a deliberate matter of public policy. The war debt piled up. Let us talk a little about that debt. The Seventyninth Congress levied a tax program that in 1948 yielded a $8.400.000.000 surplus. At that time we were starting to pay off the debt. The Eightieth Republican Congress surely helped the tax program. Republican Senators have talked a great deal this afternoon about the McClellan resolution.

What did that bill do? In 1948 there was a surplus of $8.400.000.000. In 1949 there was a deficit of $1.500 000.000. In 1950.

For many years the people of this country have been interested in devising a system of hearings before administrative branches that would give to the citizens of this country a fair hearing and their day in court. if it was necessary to go to court. in order to obtain simple justice. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the Administrative Procedures Act applies in deportation matters. The Immigration Service knew full well a year ago. at least they were advised. that that act was applicable. I knew of their practices and asked representatives of the Immigration Service to come to my office to a conference where the Immigration Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary pointed out to them that their practice of having one man act as complaining witness. as prosecutor. as judge. as jury. and as executioner was in violation of the law. There was a very simple course open to them. all they had to do was select one of their inspectors and designate him to hold hearings. But they did not see fit to take this advice. and they went on with their practice which was clearly in violation of the law. The Supreme Court subsequently so determined. They appeared before this Appropriations Committee and misrepresented the facts. They said that it would cost millions of dollars in order to set up a system of trial examiners if the decision of the Supreme Court was to be complied with.

By means of a Special Committee on Psychological Warfare. this House could go on record as seeking * * * the necessary legislative groundwork for securing a psychological warfare agency in the event of a war emergency. with the least possible waste of money and with the least possible waste of time. To this end. I introduced House Resolution 374. What I have to say to you now is no Itoldyouso. cryingoverspilledmilk appeal. It is an appeal for Congress to act to meet an acknowledged crisis. This House should have a. special committee on psychological warfare. On August 17. 1950. the Department of State announced the establishment of a national psychological strategy board under the chairmanship of the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The Department of Defense. the Joint Chiefs of Staff. and the Central Intelligence Agency have been requested by designate representatives to sit on the board. The National Security Resources Board and the Economic Cooperation Administration have been invited to provide liaison representatives. Thus. all the major agencies concerned with defense and foreign policy have recognized the imperative need for a potent psychological warfare program. This House should be no less concerned. During World War II. this House had no staff. no committee which was directly concerned* with psychological warfare. The then Committees on Miltary Affairs and Naval Affairs. the Appropriations Subcommittee which dealt with the OWL. and the Committee on Foreign Affairs were not kept informed on a daytoday basis. The personnel serving those committees did not pretend to have the highly specialized background necessary to understand what was being done in psychological warfare. As the result. there were times when too much money was provided for impractical psychological warfare and too little for the absolute essentials of this vital program. Let us profit by the mistakes of the past. We do not need to repeat those mistakes. We can match the Psychological Strategy Board of the Administrative Agencies with a special committee of the House of Representatives. This Special Committee on Psychological Warfare could put a brake upon failures and hasten worldwide achievements. The House of Representatives should act. with the greatest expediency. on House Resolution 374.",

According to the dispatch. this doctor receives a $5 fee for each Xray he examines. and it is stated that he has examined 4.500 Xrays so far this month. for which he has received or will receive $22.500. something more than $1.000 a day for his services. This is an outrageous raid upon the Public Treasury. The officials responsible for it are either guilty of malfeasance in office or unbelievable stupidity. It is frightening to contemplate what the total cost of such a program will be if it is being carried on at all induction centers throughout the land. Mr. Chairman. are the Armed Forces so destitute of medical officers that they cannot provide doctors to examine Xrays taken at the Milwaukee induction center or at any other induction center where this irresponsible policy is being pursued? What happened to the thousands of young men who received medical education at Government expense during World War II? Is no one in that group available? Cannot Reserve officers who are capable of checking Xrays be called to duty? Is it not possible that local chapters of the American Medical Association will as a patriotic gesture furnish volunteers to examine these Xrays? These are but a few of the questions the Secretary of Defense should be called upon to answer. He should be directed to appear before the appropriate committee and to bring with him his subordinates who are responsible for instituting this monstrous program. A full investigation should be made immediately.. The American taxpayers will not stand for such treatment. Mr. Chairman. They are already saddled with a gigantic debt exceeding $250.000.000.000.

What will the increase mean to anybody if they are all exempted? Let me point out that under the bill introduced by the gentleman from Texas quite a number of workers will be taken out from the present coverage. The quickest way I know to make a comparison between the two pieces of legislation. the existing law and the bill under consideration. Is to figure the position of the present law that has been on the books since 1938 and see what people are covered by the law. If they are covered by the present law they will be covered by the bill under consideration. If they are not covered by the present law they will not be covered by the proposed law. I believe that is the quickest answer I can give on the question of coverage.

    "speech": "It seems to me that is the absurd proposition in this kind of legislation. It is compulsory unemployment. It cannot be anything else. It has no real excuse for existence. because people who can work ordinarily are employed for what they can earn. They cannot be paid for what they do not produce just because it would be nice to pay a higher wage. or because the worker needs a higher wage. This bill does not provide any measure at all of the productivity of the worker who offers himself for work in the lowerearning category. For example. he comes to you with a basket of apples and says. \"I have a surplus of apples. I have worked hard all summer and I have got to have 75 cents for a half bushel because the law says so.\" and you say. \"No. I can pay only 50. that is all the money I have in the till.\" He says. \"Well then. I must throw my apples away to the hogs.\" A mans labor is nothing but the product of his labor and has no value above the product he produces. It can bring nothing but what the consumer will pay. Yet this law simply presupposes that the employer has the control of what is going to be paid. He Is nothing but an agent of the consumer and can pay nothing that the consumer will not pay. Suppose a southern lumber mill gets an order for a carload of 2 x 4s at $20 a thousand. and the little mill in Georgia says. \"Why. under this law I have to pay 75 cents. I must have $30 a thousand to fill that order.\" So his men go idle because the market offering. the only money there is available. is $20 a thousand. Finally I plead for a positive action and not a retreating actionnot further steps into the management of our economynot further steps into socialism. but a retreat to recover liberalism or true freedom in our economy. Let us do nothing more about encroaching upon freedom than to protect the individual from exploitation which the Lucas bill attempts to do. Let us reject the Lesinski bill which is an out and out efforta child born of the original concept that we must extend and extend to the whole economy the management of our economy by the Government.",

A 75cent minimum could be expected to provide no more than $1.500 a year. and with any irregularities of employment the amount may be substantially less. $1.500. however. is less than the cost of the lowest State budget for single women living alone (as compiled by State governments for use in the administration of tleir minimum wage laws). One thousand five hundred dollars is also $200 less per year than the cost of a fourperson family budget on an emergency level.

In the McCarran bill the definition of a displaced person is changed. It says displaced persons are not only those under the shelter and the wing of the IRO. but also the expellees who may be in particular zones. In other words. instead of approximately 200.000 displaced persons in Europe. we find there are 8.000.000 other displaced persons because of the Potsdam arrangement. In the opinion of the Senator from Michigan that definition would so dilute the number of displaced persons coming under the IRO that we would find their problem impossible of solution. I may explain it in this way. Personally. I feel very keenly about it. If I were a citizen of Germany. one of the first things I would want to have solved would be the original displacedpersons problem. because I would feel that there are displaced persons in Germany who coulI never find a real root in Germany because of former persecution or slave labor. The Senator from Michigan introduced the original displacedpersons bill. and he has been greatly interested in this question. He believed there could be no peace unless the displacedpersons problem was solved. He has seen the displaced persons camps and has observed the displaced persons problem at first hand. He has realized that there was involved an international problem. and that it affected all the allies with reference to displaced persons in Europe. and particularly in Germany. It seemed to me that the only way to solve it was to place such persons under one organization. It was in accord with this reasoning that we created the International Refugee Organization. I am not discounting the fact that we have the question of expellees. and I have real feeling for them. I want to give their problem all the attention we can. I realize that it is a great problem. one which should never have come about. as it traces back to an error at Potsdam.

One day with another. there are anywhere from 2.000.000 to 5.000.000 persons illegally in the United States. During World War II. and before we entered it. there were brought into this country nearly 300.000 actually displaced persons. They had been displaced by the Nazi regime. and they came here during that time. I heard the able Senator from New Jersey criticize my statement recently and express wonderment as to where I had obtained my figures. I challenge anyone to dispute those figures. I have them here. and I shall be glad to read them later on. We brought in about 300.000 during that time. Then. under the Executive order of December 22. 1945. following the war. we brought in 44.000. Under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. we have up to date brought in about 138.000. In addition to that. we brought in last year under the quota and immigration law. 180.000. and. last year alone. we brought into this country as visitors. under visitors visas. 500.000. The 500.000 who came here under visitors visas are still here. The 180.000 who came here under quota provision of the law are still here. Will some Senator tell me how many of the 500.000 who entered under visitors visas were not displaced persons or how many of the 500.000 who came under visitors visas were displaced persons? They are still here. Many of them have overrun their visitors time. Furthermore. there are pending today before the Judiciary Committee of the SenateI am quoting now literally from memoryresolutions deferring the deportation of about 4.000 individuals. whose cases have already been acted on by the Department of Justice.

I submit that if a religious or racial persecutee has settled in another country he should remain there. There are too many deserving displaced persons who have not been settled. There are too many people in Europe who have not been settled. There are too many people on their own. A great argument has been made to the effect that we must do our part to solve the displacedpersons problem. In fact. that is the whole hypothesis on which we rest our effort to pass the bill. We must do our part to solve the displacedpersons problem. If that be true. why do we not take displaced persons who have not been settled in some other country?

Unfortunately. the most authoritative facts that I can get constrain me to the conclusion that. although we have had our Pearl Harbor. we are not yet awake. This does not mean that some headway has not been made in alerting Europe. in making appropriations of funds. in enacting economic controls. and in producing munitions of war. But the real test of whether we have abandoned politics as usual and business as usual is in connection with manpower. The published figures indicate that the amount of manpower for which funds will be forthcoming will mean a total of 2.120.000 men under arms in the Army. Navy. and Air Force at the end of the present fiscal year. This is 658.648 larger than the total for the fiscal year which ended June 30. 1950.

I have served a great many years on the Committee on Appropriations. and so far as I can recall we have never turned down a request looking to the aid and betterment and upbuilding of the Territory of Alaska. The present occupant of the chair will join me in that statement. I know. because he is a member of the committee. So far as I can recall. I do not remember any bill of any kind intended to help the great Territory of Alaska being turned down. I know the Senate has been unusually considerate of the Territory of Alaska. and has helped it along in every way. Looking at the matter solely froln the standpoint of the Territory of Alaska. the land and the people. I doubt if there would be as good a government there. if statehood were granted. as now exists. because our whole country seems to feel that we should look after the people there and help them. and we do that. I desired to call that to the attention of the Senator in connection with what he has just been telling the Senate. He is correct in what he says. there is no doubt. and I am sure no one in Alaska would complain that their government is a poor government because their needs have not been taken care of. When we come to a State. we find conditions very different. In one sense. as conditions now exist. the people of Alaska are the wards of the United States Government. If Alaska took on statehood. I doubt very much whether that situation would continue. So. looking at the matter from the standpoint of the people who reside in Alaskaand there are not many of themit would not be as well for them to have statehood as to continue under the present condition.",

Yet we paid back to them $71.000.000. So our administration over them is a vry benevolent sort of administration. We certainly are not taking advantage of Alaska. and she is not suffering because she does not have Senators here or Representatives in the House of Representatives. Of course. Alaska has a Territorial Delegate in the House. and he is very able and alert. and very attentive to his duties in looking after the interests of Alaska. Bu..t aside from that. as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee has said. since Alaska is a Territory. the obligation is felt by the Senate and the whole Congress to see to it that Alaska has every consideration for her development and for all the projects which are needed. Presently the taxes in Alaska are higher than in any State of the Union. The taxes under their own government budget are about $8.000.000.

That was done under the general law which covers such procedure in relation to the building of airports through the country. The amount represented was $150.000. That was done on April 11. 1950. On April 17. 1950. the Palmer Airport Association executed this check which I hold in my handit is the original checkfor $145.000. and returned it to the Territorial government. showing that they were only receiving $5.000 for the site. In line therewith they amended their application for assistance from the United States. on the basis of which they would be entitled to receive $37.500 in connection with the site. In addition to that they were going to receive threefourths of the cost of construction. So they filed a new application. When they filed the latter application. they asked for a total of $293.500. or $163.500 more than they had asked for in the January 9 application. Before that time they had made a smaller request. The admitted purpose Akas to have the Government pay both for the site and all the cost of the airport base. This. of course. is a private concern. It is not a Government concern. But it was dealing with a matter which concerned the Territory of Alaska. Territorial officials were joined in the matter. The active members of the organization helped to put through the proposition Which would have defrauded the Federal Government by which they would have obtained money on the basis of a site which was costing much less than had been indicated. They had spent considerable money on the airport. some $58.000. but even when they had the United States engineers appraise the airport their total appraisal of everything connected therewith amounted to only $131.000. They had gotten some friendly appraisers to make appraisals. One appraisal was $150.090. Another appraisal was $175.000. That is the basis on which they filed the application. and changed the amount to $193.500.",

It is no more possible to build up civil defense establishments on an interim basis than it is possible to build up our Military Establishment on an interim basis. The reason why the pending bill has been separated into three sections covering a long range of governmental powers. with emergency power granted in only one section. is to have established on a permanent basis a skeleton organization which could be activated at any time over the years when the situation demanded it. Of course. it is contemplated that Congress at any time could either repeal the legislation. or the Committee on Appropriations could reduce the appropriations. and thus reduce the size of the organization. At least. the organizational administration and the functions should be kept on a permanent basis. so that the organization would be ready to be activated in the event we entered another period of cold or active war or difficulty with another nation. The whole bill. with the exception of section 3. is based upon and written with the idea that it would be in effect until Congress terminated the act. as Congress has already terminated other war powers during recent years. but that we would set up a permanent organization to be used if necessity called for it. In the first place. Mr. President. the bill allows the States to mahe compacts which are based. and intended t) be based. on a longrange basis.

I invite the Senators attention to a fact I am sure he knows. namely. that the House bill has a provision. section 412. which ends the act after June 30. 1954. In accelerating the discussion. and perhaps getting the matter into conference. I wonder how the Senator would feel if the amendment of the Senator from Ohio were offered to the emergency title only. I can see a great deal of argument along the lines which the Senator is discussing. in favor of continuing the permanent organization. I can see also what the Senator from Ohio means about giving Congress an opportunity to review the emergency powers and making the Administrator sell the arguments in favor of those powers. rather than the other way around. I wonder how a suggestion of that character. for the purpose of taking the entire question to conference. would appeal to the Senator from Tennessee?",

First. there are only five Instances wherein the Constitution of the United States requires more than a majority vote. First. when a proposed constitutional amendment is to be voted upon. twothirds approval in the Senate and the House is required. although the House uniformly has majority rule for the passage of legislation and for closing debate. Second. to expel a Member requires twothirds. Third. to override a Presidential veto requires twothirds. Fourth. to convict an impeached officer requires twothirds. Fifth. to ratify a treaty requires twothirds. But. Mr. President. twothirds of what? of the whole Senate? Does it require 64 votes? No. twothirds of those voting. a quorum being present. Yet we are about to adopt a twothirds rule for the passage of bitterly controversial legislation. legislation upon which there would be a filibuster unless twothirds of all sitting Senators should vote to close debate. That does not mean twothirds of those voting. but twothirds of all qualified Senators. Ordinarily that means 64 Senators. unless some Senators credentials happen not to have been approved. The substitute resolution says twothirds of all qualified Senators. The Constitution of the United States. in respect to the important matter of a constitutional amendment. expelling a Senator elected by the people. overriding a veto of the President of the United States elected by the people. convicting an impeached officer. disgracing him as well as taking away his perquisites. or the ratification of a treaty. which may for all practical purposes. commit us to war. requires a vote of twothirds of those voting.

It remains an unfair labor practice for a union or an employer to coerce employees in such a way as to interfere with their right of organization or their right to work. This prohibits mass picketing. Again. Mr. President. I ask: Is this a bill to regulate union rules and regulations and the relationship of a laborunion member to his fellow union members? That is already covered by their own constitution and bylaws. which they freely adopt. or by such local law as might be pertinent to the case. Is that the sort of thing about which the Congress should legislate? If the Congress is going to regulate that sort of thingin other words. if we are to deny to the union the right to coerce its own membersshall not we have to deny management the right to coerce a stockholder. or deny to a group of stockholders the right to coerce one stockholder? Yet there is nothing about those matters in this measure. The Thomas bill and the Wagner Act deal with collective bargaining. We were thinking about the relationships between labor and management. We were trying to keep an open channel of association between those two. and to protect that right. But now the Congress of the United States is asked to assert its power in the form of a police regulation relative to the relationship of a union to each of its individual members.

Sometimes workers are assaulted and sometimes other rights or privileges which the workers have are abused. However. all we are interested in here Is what adversely affects the open channel of collective bargaining between management and labor.

A union may have 1.000 members. or 100.000 members. with all sorts of local. district. regional. State. and national representatives and associations. and all sorts of people in it. Under the present law. if one assumes to do something when he is apparently acting for the union. but when in fact and in truth he is not the agent of the union. yet he can subject the union to all manner of litigation. which may drain all the money from its treasury and result in vexatious and grievous burdens. That is certainly an unwise and unjust provision to be applied to labor unions. That is another reason why I prefer the Thomas bill. in which the question of agency is more limited. and there is a far stricter relationship. A far clearer showing would be required in order to make the union responsible for the acts of an individual than under the present law.",

On page 7 of the bill occurs an amendment which was adopted last evening and which included the expenses of the American Battle Monuments Commission. Knowing that it is always rather hard to have deficiency bills brought to the attention of the committee and of the Senate. and in many instances there has been neglect on the part of some departments to request deficiency appropriations. I call the attention of the Senator from Wyoming at this time to the fact that it may be necessary for the American Battle Monuments Commission. through no fault of their own. to ask for a deficiency appropriation later. In order that the Senator may know the reasons why that will be done. Iwish to say that the American Battle Monuments Commission. I am advised by the Secretary of the Commission. has recently had three additional cemeteries turned over to it in foreign lands. and within the next 8 to 12 months 5 additional cemeteries will be turned over to it. making a total of 8 which will be placed in its care. During the past few years. under the law. the Army. through the Quartermaster General. has operated these cemeteries. I wish to make the record clear that it is through no fault of the Battle Monuments Commission. or the Secretary. or any of those connected with the Commission. that the proper appropriations were not requested. but under the conditions which exist it will be necessary for the Commission to come to Congress later for a deficiency. when it can figure out the amount of money which will be needed to continue the operation of these cemeteries. principally in foreign lands. which have previously been operated by the Army.",

Since the pending bill was reported to the Senate I have received word indirectly from General Marshall that several cemeteries are about to be turned over to the American Battle Monuments Commission by the Army authorities. When that is done. it will become the obligation of the Commission to provide for their care and upkeep. But there is nothing that can be done about it in this bill. because there is no budget estimate as yet. In due course I assume the request will be made of the Bureau of the Budget for an appropriation. and when the budget estimate is sent to the Congress. the appropriate committees both of the House and the Senate will pay attention to it. However. I think it is worth saying that this illustrates that many of the obligations which the Federal Government must now meet are altogether new obligations which never were undertaken in the past. The pending bill itself carries $5.920.800 for the American Battle Monuments Commission. a new expenditure. but one which the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States felt was wholly desirable because the people of America do not want to have the cemeteries in which their sons are buried go unattended.",

I recall that the Senator from Massachusetts felt that It would be unwise to make shipments of any equipment. machinery. or anything else which originated in the Marshallplan program. into western European countries. which might have potential war use in eastern Europe. Recently I have read that many trade agreements have been negotiated between the Marshallplan countries. or at least some of them. and Russia. whereby huge shipments of potential war goods are going behind the iron curtain.

We can send commodities into those countries and get things back in exchange for them whereby the trade may be very profitable for us. In general. my understanding is that the goods which are sent from the United States and from the Marshallplan countries in behind the iron curtain can roughly be classified. broadly speaking. into. first. those goods which are of direct specialized military value. and those are prohibited. and are not sent either from the United States or from the Marshallplan countries. So much for that category. Then there is the category of goods which are predominantly commercial In nature. but have a certain military value. for instance. an automobile. Those are subject to licensing. Then there are goods which in themselves have no military value. but in the production of them there may be trade secrets. or matters of that kind. which might be of use in other ways. Those are subject to licensing also. It is further my understanding that all the categories that are not prohibited are either subject to the approval of the American military authorities. or. in the case of certain foreign countries. the shipments are known to the American military authorities. and the American military authorities are satisfied to have the shipments go on. This is not a subject about which it Is possible to make a quick and easy answer. The term \"war materials.\" for instance. is a very broad term. It covers a wide variety of articles. and each situation has to be judged separately. and has to be judged by men who make a profession and a lifelong study of that subject.

America developed its first system of rent controls. as I recall. in about the year 1941. or the early part of 1942. In the years which have passed. despite a tremendous volume of private and public construction. America presently has some twomillonodd fewer units of rental housing than the Nation possessed when rent controls on the Federal level were first imposed. Whatever we do about rent controls in the future. we had better make up our minds that any law we may pass will result in providing additional rental space in which Americans can live. rather than taking away space which they had some years ago. Scores of American cities have exercised the localoption provision which is a part of the law or have otherwise been decontrolled. I should like to mention only a few. in passing: Augusta. Ga.. Joplin. Mo.. Charlotte. N. C.. Tulsa. Okla.. Charleston. S. C.. Bellingham. Bremerton. Everett. Olympia. and Spokane. Wash.. Bloomington. Ind.. Miami. Fla.. Milwaukee. Wis.. Dallas. Tex.. Buffalo. N. Y.. Richmond. Va.. Salt Lake City. Utah. Birmingham. Ala.. and San Diego. Calif. So far as I know. the experience of those cities under decontrol has been extraordinarily healthy and beneficial for all their residents and for the business in those communities. Again we should bear in mind that some of those cities have grown rapidly and have surrounding them all the problems which are referred to by the Office of the Housing Expediter in an attempt to frighten so many of us. Since April 1949 an estimated 8.000.000 rental housing units have been removed from Federal control. If we pass Senate Joint Resolution 207. we veto the homerule provisions which we fought so hard and so vigorously to make available to the very persons to whom we are inclined to say. tomorrow. \"What we gave you but a few months ago we now are desirous of taking away from You.\"",

Over 3.500 dirt farmers attended the meetings and 18 Members of Congress were present. including 7 Members of the Senate and 11 Members of the House. Over 100 witnesses from 15 different States testified. One of the interesting features of the Conference was the presence of a large number of young GI farmers and their wives. It is this youhg group. who testified who spoke out in favor of our private enterprise system and most emphatically declared that they wanted a minimum of Government interference in a longrange farm program. Very little sentiment was expressed for the socalled Brannan plan. In fact. only two witnesses recommended such a program for agriculture. Even the president of the Farmers Union of Nebraska testified that he found very little sentiment for the Brannan plan among Farmers Union members in his own State. Farmers came to the conference voluntarily in response to an open invitation to be present. They expressed themselves freely and the Members of Congress only listened. In contrast to the Brannan meeting at Des Moines last June which was packed with Government employees and labor leaders. the Sioux City conference was thoroughly a farmers meeting. The farmers were asked what they wanted in the line of a permanent farm program and no attempt was made to shove a predigested package of cureall down their throats. A transcript will be made of the hearings and the same will be made available to those who are interested. Republican Members of Congress have now been put on notice as to what the farmers of the Midwest. at least. want in th2 line of a longrange program for agriculture. The farmers proposals and views no doubt will be reflected in proper legislation to be presented by Republican Members of Congress at an early date. One thing is certain. and that is that the American farmer is tired of stopgap farm legislation. He wants a longrange agricultural program enacted without delay. He wants a sound and sensible program which can have the support of all elements of our economy and. lastly. he wants a program completely divorced from politics.",

It represents the best compromise I could get to Implement a policy I approve. The reported dropping of the Abomb In Russia has influenced the thinking of all of us. I have found 3 different views in Congress as to how it should affect this legislation. There are those who say this proves that there is no use of our going ahead with any plan for arming ground forces in Europe. There are those who say that we ought to furnish merely a token supply of arms as evidence of our good will. but that it is futile to go farther than that now. My own view Is that the dropping of the Abomb makes prompt action by the North Atlantic countries Imperative. that this is no time for halfway measures on either side of the Atlantic.

During the course of debate in the House on this bill I opposed the measure with every resource at my command. I oppose it now and my opposition is even more determined because of the new global developments. The proponents of arms aid to western Europe say that because the Soviet Union now has the atom bomb there exists a more compelling reason why we should pass this legislation. legislation which comes back to the House from another body not in the reduced form in which it left the House but in its original and expensive form and shape. I contend that the very explosion of the Soviet bomb has made even more futile any concept of the defense of western Europe on the ground. If the French. the Italians. and the rest of the signatory nations to the Atlantic Treaty had the will to fight a week ago. that will to fight on the ground against all of the force and fury of the atom bomb has certainly been decreased tremendously in the last few days. There is only one answer. in my opinion. to this new threat to the peace of the world. We can continue to plod toward war through the mud in an ox cart. or we can think in terms of our national security. our national safety. and our national welfare in terms of an air armada second to none. in terms of an effective and modern counterforce to meet this new threat.

I am convinced that we are facing as grave a responsibility at this moment as we have in many long years. An adverse decision of this House today on the pending legislation will go over the world with a reverberation as appalling as was the explosion of the Russian bomb the other day. Mr. Speaker. I have only 3 minutes. and I wish simply to point out one fact of supreme import. We are in possession of the most destructive agency the world has ever known. the atomic bomb. Our control of that agency is distinguished by the fact that the American people are governed by moral principles and a sense of responsibility and an absence of jungle cruelty in their attitude toward their fellow men. The Russians are in possession of that same destructive agency today. but their Government has departed altogether from the high moral quality of many of the millions of their people. Their Government has absolutely no morals. no moral restraint. It has a program of world conquest. with the United States as the ultimate end of that conquest. It is restrained by no moral considerations. by no humanitarian ideals. It is as cruel as the jungle and. as for me. If it were the last vote I ever make.

I appreciate we went through this whole matter last month so far as the pay bill is concerned and that the membership has a thorough understanding. but may I say that we have heard considerable said about raising the pay of these higher officers. There seems to be a little objection on the part of some so far as increasing the salaries of the high officers are concerned. However. we have appropriated about $15.900.000.000 for our national defense and we need capable officers to administer the spending of this $15.900.000.000 or as much as they see fit to spend. The increase in salaries will permit these most capable officers to not seek private employment and we will save. in my opinion. many times the amount involved in the increase which will be given them under this bill. It was my pleasure last week to spend several hours with General Bill Tunner who has administered the air lift in Berlin. May I say that with men of that type handling the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars It will be wise for the Congress to raise the salaries In order to keep such men as Bill Tunner In the service. May I refer briefly to the peacetime draft and universal military training. I know there are few people who want to draft young men. force them against their will. Into the service through the universal military training route if we can keep away from it.

Under this new bill that we bring to you today we have cut more than $87.000.000 from that amount. and whereas under the first bill the cost would have been approximately $406.000.000 in 1951. it will taper .off until the annual increase will be $302.000.000. or. in other words. we have cut in the present bill more than $104.000.000 annually. which is not to be sneezed at. It is more than peanuts. Now. having said that. I wish to point out something that is more or less a prophecyand one hardly dares to prognosticate. of course. on anything in these perilous and uncertain timesbut it is my firm conviction that if this legislation is enacted. ultimately it will result in a saving to the American taxpayers. and the cost will be much less than it is today under our antiquated. outmoded. arcaic. hodgepodge system that no one can understand. Under this legislation we have cut the pay of general and flag officers 10 percent. I think it is too much of a cut.

Slightly over 1 percent of the Air Force officers are general officers. and only seventenths of 1 percent of the officer strength of the Marine Corps are general officers. So. because we constantly elbow and associate from day to day here in Washington with many of the high ranking officers. it is easy for some people to get the impression that our Army. Navy. Marine Corps. and Air Force are made up of generals and admirals. which is far from the truth. The traditional ratio. I think. always has been. may I say to the gentleman from New York . about 1 officer for 10 enlisted men. It is practically that today.

I find it extremely difficult to discover any justificatior. for the Senate committee striking the very worthy provision which was included by the House of Representatives. calling upon the Federal Government to aid in providing assistance for the disabled. The bill as it passed the House provided for assistance to those totally and permanently disabled. I am thinking in terms of welfare cases. There are persons who have lost their arms. there are persons who have lost their legs. persons who have TB..cancer or have heart disease. who will never be able to work again in their lives.

Louisiana probably leads the Nation in its attempt to provide for unfortunate disabled people who. by reason of sickness. or by reason of loss of arms. or legs. or other physical impairment. are unable to earn a living in any manner whatsoever. Mr. President. I should think that anyone who would ponder on his Bible teaching would realize that we should not deny such people a little charitable help from the Federal Government.

But this plan is adjusted to that. and allows to the old people their proportionate share of whatever is the national income and whatever is the national productivity. in terms of food. rather than in terms of dollars. which latter is. as we now find. utterly inadequate. But. in addition. there is the other consideration. namely. that it eliminates the possibility of political shenanigans. such as are an inevitable part of the administration of the means test. If it were possible to have people without human fallacies it would perhaps be possible for them to do justice to all the gradations of income groups. But since it is administered by very human beings of one or another political persuasion. I presume it is a little more easy perhaps in Florida for a Democrat to receive benefits by way of oldage assistance. and I presume in the State of Maine. it would be more easy for a Republican to receive such benefits. That is the result of the inevitable operations of human nature. I believe we shall arrive at an equitable solution of the problem and of the fundamental principles involved by the universal application of a payasyougo plan. of a widely distributed tax which will be subject to study. and the elimination of a means test. Those fundamental principles I believe must eventually evolve.

Mr. Chairman. there is a project in the Seventh Congressional District of Tennessee by the Army engineers which has a low dam known as the Cheatham Lock and Dam and Dover Dam on the lower Cumberland River. This project is very controversial. It has been a matter of controversy for something over a year. On January 27. 1950. Senator KEFAUVER. of Tennessee. Congressman PRIEST. Congressman GORE and I wrote the President of the United States and requested that the TVA make a survey of the lower Cumberland River to find out which place it would be better to have a dam and whether it should be a high dam or a low dam. The Army engineers have wanted to build a low dam for several years. but there has been much controversy in all the counties affected. So on February 2. 1950. the President requested that the TVA make a survey to see what would be inundated and what would be best to recommend to the people. In this appropriation there are $1.800.000 for this project. I am asking the committee to go along and cut this $1.800.000 so that the dam will not be built until this survey has been made by the TVA. Then we can find out what will actually be done to the peoples land in that district.",

They are there on the ground and they have all the facts. They told me without qualification that a cut from $5.000.000 to $3.500.000 in that project is. for valid and sound reasons. going to mean a delay of 2 years in the completion of the project. Once that project is completed. the Government will take in $1.033.000 a year from hydroelectric power. The 2 years delay which the present cut may entail will mean that we are going to lose over $2.000.000 in revenue and to lose badly needed electric power and the use of the waterway for 2 years in order to delaynot savethe expenditure of $1.500.000.

It is the bill extending the draft. which has been reported favorably by the Committee on Armed Services. I am not sure how long the consideration of that bill will take. but it will probably be 2 or 3 days. However. that measure will be the unfinished business following the disposition of the socialsecurity bill. It is my hope that by the time we dispose of the draft bill the Committee on Foreign Relations will have reported the bill dealing with the militaryassistance program. and probably that bill will follow the disposition of the extensionofthedraft measure. I should also like to announce to the Senate that on the 10th day of July a motion will be made to proceed to the consideration of the Fair Employment Practice Commission bill. On the same day. in view of the fact that we had debate of about a week on the measure. we will also file a petition for cloture. which. under the rules of the Senate. will bring about a vote on cloture on Wednesday.

In the early days of the program. ECA provided funds to cover marine insurance on shipments abroad. Some months later the Administrator changed this policy and announced that he would no longer allocate dollars for the payment of marineinsurance premiums. Many protests were raised by the industry. and these protests were forcibly called to the attention of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation. The staff of the joint committee made a study of the matter and prepared a report on the situation last year. After this report was. prepared. the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation held hearings at which members of the insurance industry and officials of the ECA appeared and testified with respect to the ECA policy. As a result of these hearings and the studies made by the staff of the joint committee. I submitted an amendment to the ECA extension authorization last year which was adopted by the Senate and finally passed the Congress in a re-. vised form. This amendment provided that the ECA Administrator should provide dollar funds for the payment of insurance premiums on commodities purchased in the United States where such insurance was placed on a competitive basis in accordance with normal trade practices prevailing prior to the outbreak of World War II. Subsequent to the passage of this legis!ation. the ECA issued a revised regulation which was supposed to give effect to the change in the law. I do not think the regulation gave full implementation to the intent of Congress in enacting the amendment to which I have referred. On July 18 of last year I wrote the Administrator of the ECA. pointing out my objection to the revised amendment issued by the ECA and he replied under date of July 26 in a letter which I do not consider satisfactory. Since that time. I continue to receive. as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation. protests from the insurance industry pointing out the fact that the",

I. therefore. concluded that further reductions in the amount of aid to be given western Europe in the final 2 years of the Marshall plan would be desirable if for no other reason than that such reductions would materially lessen the shock of final termination of aid in 1952.

Genocide. which is the mass destruction of a national racial or religious group. was outlawed by the United Nations in December 1948. The convention entered into at that time was signed by 21 nations. including the United States. In the past 18 months. 15 of those nations have ratified the treaty. Ratification by the Senate of the United States is conspicuous by its absence. The Genocide Treaty is a most significant step in the development of international law and international morality. By officially declaring that genocide is a crime against the world and against humanity and a violation of international law. it marks a most significant advance toward the replacement of force by morality as the mainspring of world affairs. Individual murder has long headed the list of internationally recognized and extraditable crimes. Nevertheless. group murder has never been legally curbed. We can take pride in the fact that American representatives were leaders in bringing the United Nations to adopt the antigenocide convention. In this respect. I want to pay special tribute to Prof. Raphael Lemkin. visiting lecturer in law. Yale University. The provisions of the Genocide Treaty embody American principles of justice and morality. The United States has everything to gain and nothing to lose by the advancement of those principles throughout the world.

At page 1843 of the CONGRESSIONAL REcORD. the Senator stated: The time has come when Congress must unequivocally face the problem of potato surpluses and promptly enact a sound and practical pricesupport program. * * * * * These changes in the Agricultural Act which I am recommending will not only bring the 1950 crop under effective supervision but will also enable the Secretary of Agriculture to set up a permanent workable program for future crops. * * * * S Any impartial Judgment must lead to the conclusion that the laws which were adequate during the war are wholly ineffectual and illadapted to the postwar potato industry. This fact is conclusively established by the record. * * * S S Our present laws. while adequate during the war. are wholly unsuited today. The reason is clear. It is this overplanting and excessive marketing that must be corrected. It can be done only if the Secretary is empowered to set marketing quotas and to exact penalties from those who exceed them. Potatoes will then be brought under a workable program such as we now have for the basic commodities like tobacco and cotton. Mr. President. unless the potato growers are willing to be placed under some kind of program. similar to the tobacco. corn. wheat. and cotton programs. they are not entitled to any support whatever. * * * * * Those are things which have been going on. which this bill intends to prevent and. at the same time. give the honest potato grower the benefit of the support program to which he is entitled.

As our chairman and the ranking minority member have called to your attention. for over 10 years the United States has not engaged in any publicbuilding program. During the war period. and even before the war when we were in preparation. and in the postwar days. we felt it was not expedient to spend large sums of money on a building program. for a number of reasons. One. of course. was to provide men and material to build housing for veterans and others who were in distress and who needed lowcost housing. In addition to that. we were expending hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars in projects in putting the country in a condition first to prepare for war. then to carry on war. and then after the war was over. in the rehabilitation following the war. So we have had no building program during that period. This bill merely attempts to pick up where we left off and carry on the program that we had away back in the early days of public building in the United States. In doing so. we have attempted. as far as possible. by legislation. to hedge about the bill so that there will be as little political consideration given to this building program as possible. As the chairman has called to your attention. we have endeavored to provide that there shall be fairness in every congressional district. We have endeavored to spell out in the very language of the bill that every congressional district in the United States shall be given consideration in the determination of where these projects shall go. The bill provides that no building shall be constructed that is not needed and Justified and partisan political consideration shall be barred. In carrying out that program we have also provided that we will recognize local architects in the drawing of plans for the construction of these buildings so that we may. as far as possible. build up local communities and give an opportunity to those who know local conditions to engage in this program.",

We feel now. however. that possibly changes will be coming about shortly. I believe we all recognize that we are facing possibly an unemployment situation. so I think the committee in all wisdom decided that rather than have a program of hodgepodge construction and WPA projects that we would ask you as Members of Congress to go along with us and establish a construction program of necessary buildings. to acquire sites and complete plans in order that we might have a definite and worthwhile program to combat unemployment in the various districts when and if it should come.

Dr. Wold has qpent years on -this research and tells how the health of our Presidents has affected great decisions of this country and the world. Look magazine for this week publishes one -of the chapters of this book on -the health of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paralysis. later illnesses. and unUsually lengthy term of service. during an era of great national strain. focused more than usual attention on the state of the Presidents health. Our Presidents carry a tremendous burden that at times seems more than the strongest man might be able to bear. Our Presidents. because of their tremendous responsibilities. need to divide these responsibilities so that part of them could be carried by a socalled Assistant President. and by a strong Cabinet. I am Certain that If the people had been properly informed of Franklin Roosevelts health by competent. unbiased physicians. he. himself. never would have made the sacrifice of running for a fourth term. and indeed might be alive today. It seems to me that often selfish. greedy politicians. officeholders. and leeches on our political body use undue force and persuasion to keep their political advantages. The world now knows that Franklin Roosevelt was an ill man at the end of his third term. His condition became worse when he was a candidate for a fourth term. In the early part of his fourth term he had important conferences with world leaders. He and his advisers made agreements with Joe Stalin that have cost this country billions of dollars and perhaps even a third world war. He gave his best and perhaps came to an untimely death because of the crushing burdens forced upon an ill \ufffd man. I have often recommended. that Presidents be examined periodically by unbiased. well qualified medical men and that a report be given to the proper committee of Congress. I am also just as certain that no President should ever serve more than two terms. This Nation ought to profit by past mistakes.",

The gentleman will recollect that some Members of this House who favor the coloring of oleomargarine yellow have insisted that the dairy farmers of the country must yield to scientific progress. If the gentleman will permit. I would like to elaborate on that a little bit. The scientific progress that has been made on oleo to make it taste and appear like butter results from a ruling made by Mr. McNutt. when he was head of the Pure Food and Drug Section. because he issued a regulation that the oleo industry \"could put in vitamins the equivalent to butter and he also ruled that they could use butter flavor and flavor the product to taste like butter. He also ruled that they could churn it in milk in order to give butter texture to the product so that it would taste like butter and have the same nutritive value as butter. I therefore contend that it was not as a result of scientific progress but it was by edict of a man in Government who issued a regulation permitting this apparent deception and fraud on behalf of a product in order to take the market away from the legitimate dairy farmers of the country. Now. as the gentleman said. they want to color the product yellow to make it look like butter. thereby to not only destroy the integrity of two and a half million dairy farmers but also permit deception and fraud on the housewives of the country.",

If they are able to do that. it is going to mean that many of the dairy farmers of the country. and especially those in the South. will go out of business. I have been all over the South in the last 2 or 3 years. There has been great development down there in every line. and especially in dairying. While this bill is not sponsored entirely by people from that section of the country. undoubtedly they have a right to be interested in it. It seems to me it would be a shortsighted policy to do anything to retard its development. The dairy farms and the dairy herds conform in every way with the preservation of our soil. As a Member said here the other day. one of the crying needs of our time is the preservation of our soil. The dairy farmer in his operations conforms in every detail with that program. As I have said time and time again. these are little people that we cannot afford to run out of business. As a result of dairy farming. we have built up in every sectioh of the country. in every congressional district. some activity connected with dairying. Either cheese making. butter making. or the preparation and delivery of milk to the home.

That program is now well on its way to completion. I know that many of you have read that because that program is on its way to completion Pittsburgh has become one of the boom cities of the Nation. Currently. that great city is building dozens of skyscrapers. New industries are moving In along the waterways. New transportation facilities are being stretched across the State to it. If this appropriation Is cut by $2.000.000 it will create a gamble of 1 year on the weather. This big dam will cut the possible maximum flood level by some 5/2 feet in the city of Pittsburgh. As my colleague pointed out. it will give that great steelproducing center and munitionsproducing center a degree of safety which is. I believe. much more vital than many of the things we are currently doing for defense. We know that the ultimate cost of the project will be increased if the dam is not finished with economic speed. So I say to the Committee that I do wish you would give this amendment very serious consideration. The amount of funds involved is mall and the need Is great. If we can get this dam finished on time. the Nation will be safer. The prosperity of one of its greatest incomeproducing areas will be safer. I can assure you that in the long run it will pay dividends to the United States of America to have this dam finished on time.",

I might say at this time that I plead guilty to being a member of the economy cut faction. I will always be against economy when stacked up againsthuman life. The $257.000.000.000 debt mentioned was incurred because it was thought In time of war it was proper to spend money instead of wasting lives. That is where we are on some of these emergency floodcontrol projects. To my mind. this is one of the most important projects in the Midwest. and it is entitled to highest priority. The seriousness of the recent crisis at Vincennes. Ind.. has been attested to by the Corps of Engineers. and their representatives have stated that this is one of the most necessary floodcontrol items in the entire Midwest. Past Congresses have already appropriated $90.000.000 for plans and specifications. so this project is ready to go. as soon as sufficient construction funds are allocated. In January of this year the city of Vincennes experienced a flood crisis. This makes the second time that this entire city has been in extreme danger of being flooded. Previously. in 1943. \ufffdIe city was in great danger and had it not been for 3.500 soldiers sent from Camp Atterbury to fight the flood. the city would probably have been inundated at that time. In January of this year a second crisis of similar proportions was experienced. One thousand soldiers from Fort Knox spent approximately 3 weeks in Knox County under the direction of the Louisville district engineer fighting a flood crest which topped the existing flood wall.",

It is an actual fact that it is about a 12inch concrete wall. and there are cracks in that wall as big as your hand. The engineers went in there and sandbagged the cracks. They built a secondary sandbag levee 45 feet behind it. As a matter of fact. the waters of the Wabash actually topped the PWAbuilt concrete wall. and the only way they stopped it was by putting a frame box extension on top of the concrete wall and filling it with mud. The water actually went several inches above the top of that wall. It is a real crisis there. It looks like we will be able to escape a flood this spring. but those are things that will be repeated. The strange thing about it is that the Bureau of the Budget is willing to recommend millions of dollars to repair these agricultural flood levees. The situation at Vincennes is that the agricultural levees. both on the Indiana and the Illinois side. protect those farm lands. and they funnel the water right down to Vincennes where it forms a bottleneck. The only thing that saved the city was because the levee broke way up above Vincennes on the Indiana side. and directly across the river at Lawrenceville. Ill. Go back in there with engineers. rebuild those levee walls. form the funnel. and Vincennes will be endangered again in another flood crisis. For that reason I believe that the men. women. and children. who got out and filled sandbags in this last flood crisis are entitled to some Federal help to protect their cities.",

As I read it. inasmuch as the only empowerment which the Board is given to prevent union members from engaging in an unfair labor practice does not. if the word \"person\" does not include labor organizations. give it any power to prevent an unfair labor practice by a labor organization. there is virtually no effect to the provision that certain things shall be unfair labor practices on the part of a labor organization. Is it not true that by eliminating the words \"labor organization\" from the definition of the word \"person\" there is no authority on the part of the National Labor Relations Board to prevent a labor organization from engaging in an unfair labor practice. although section 8 creates various unfair labor practices on the part of labor organizations?

I shall not go into the tetails of the British loan. for now that loan is water under the bridge. I do not deny that some good came from that loan. but. of course. it did not by any means accomplish what it was supposed to do. The loan was to carry the United Kingdom economy for a period of over 3 years. but in less than 20 months we were again asked for aid. Now. Mr. President. we come to the ECA Act which was adopted by the Congress during the Eightieth Congress. Let us remember that all the proposals and all the plans our advisers said would do the trick did not work out that way. but in the meantime we continued to put up the money. we spent the amounts I have just stated. and then ECA came Into being last year. Under that plan we are being asked to put up. over a period of 4 years. a total of $17.000.000.000. Last year we appropriated $5.000.000.000. plus. We are now being asked to appropriate another $5.500.000.000. With that money the economy of Europe is to be improved. Mr. President. in my opening remarks I stated briefly how the socalled counterpart fund was created.

We owe almost twice as much money as the countries we are assisting. and yet we are being asked to do more. I have here certain figures showing the population and area of our country in contrast to the population and area of the ERP countries.

Both the ECA report and the joint copimittee report go into great length in discussing the budgetary and currency situation in each of the countries. They fail to draw any positive conclusions or to evaluate the efficacy of the steps taken by the individual countries. The ECA report seems to apologize for prevailing conditions. while the joint committee repcrt seems to point to steps that still must be taken. However. the reports indicate six countries have taken specific steps toward a program of monetary and budgetary reform. with varying success. Little or no progress is indicated in two countriesAustria and Greece. The joint committee recognizes that much more must be done in this field and criticizes ECA policy as follows: The establishment of sound currencies in Europe would eliminate these retarding influences. The ECA has made what might be described as a commodity approach as distinguished from a monetary approach to the problem of European recovery. that Is. it has given primary emphasis to supplying the means of production to Europe. relying on the use of the counterpart funds and moral suasion to bring about currency reform.

In the first place. if we compare the situation which now exists with the situation which existed a year ago. it will be found that a year ago. by way of grants for construction. the Congress allowed for contract authorizations $8.000.000. That has been cut to $2.500.000. The major part. or at least a considerable part. of the Increase proposed by the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington and those associated with him Is to bring the contract authorization item up to where it was last year. plus a percentage increase. which I imagine might be 20 or 25 percentI have not figured it outover what was actually allowed last year. I think a very strong case can be made for that proposal. I do not mean that a strong case cannot be made in connection with the heart situation. but I do not think the two should be blanketed together. I think they should be debated on their merits.",

Mr. President. that I am impressed with many of the arguments of my colleagues who are opposing the extension of Federal controls. I believe they have correctly pointed out serious inequities in our present rentcontrol program. I agree with them that we must have a completely redesigned approach to fit the emergency conditions that are facing us and to coordinate rent controls with whatever controls may be found to be necessary over wages and prices. Until such a new approach can be developed. however. I do not think we can afford to take the risk of leaving rents uncontrolled in many areasand that is the case in my Statewhere a sudden influx of war workers or Armed Forces personnel may cause rents to rise sharply. For this reason I believe it is in the public interest to extend Federal rent controls for 2 months as provided for in Senate Joint Resolution 207. and I shall support this measure. I have just been advisedand this may be helpful to the Senator from Ohio . who asked me a question a moment agothat the situation in New Jersey is as follows: 113 municipalities have voted to extend Federal control. 366 municipalities have taken no action. and therefore would be without controls if the Federal law expires. 164 of these have populations of 1.000 or more. 88 municipalities have definitely been decontrolled. 567 is the total number of municipalities in New Jersey. We may note. therefore. that 65 percent of the New Jersey municipalities have thus far taken no action. and if they take no action by December 31. they will be without rent controls after that date. Many of those municipalities have no way of knowing when the emergency may hit them.",

Leaving the rentcontrol law unchanged until we have given these matters further consideration would also be reassuring to the young family men calld back into the service and to the fighting men at the front who would worry about the status of their families living in rented quarters. If Congress decides that further rentcontrol legislation is necessary beyond the 60day extension period.

This measure is shot through with exceptions of so many different kinds that it has become purely a discriminatory measure against a limited number of property owners who are still having to base their rents primarily on conditions which existed 8. 9. or 10 years ago. As a measure of the last war. the joint resolution should be entirely out. As a measure of the new war the joint resolution does not even purport to be such a thing. It does not provide for a continuation of any general controls. It simply provides for continuing a few of the controls of the last war in the case of a limited number of dwellings as a means of holding on to the power to control rents. Mr. Woods and his administration have not wanted to give up that power at any time. Last year they fought against discontinuing it. After thorough consideration. we in the Senate decided that the Second World War rent controls should come to an end.

I am certain that the Senator from Wyoming is going to offer an amendment which he offe:ed in committee. and which was defeated in committee. So far as the Senator from Illinois is concerned. I should like to finish the tax bill this week if we can possibly do so. I ask the Senator from Georgia whether he believes that to be possible. The reason I express the hope that we may be able to finish the tax bill this week is because when we complete action on it. we will take up the internal security bill. We should certainly be able to complete action on that bill next week. Then we have a few other minor matters on which to act. and if the conference report can be made on the appropriations bill and acted upon. we will be able to sign off for a little while. That is why I ask the Senator from Georgia now whether he agrees that there is a possibility of finishing the tax bill this week.",

I read from page 6 of Judge Tarvers report: It has definitely been brought out during this investigation and hearings that there has been no reconciliation of the inventories submitted monthly by the various warehouses with records of the WFA and that storage and service charges are being paid solely upon the word of the warehouseman that such storage and service charges are due and accurate without checking against any storage records of the WFA.

I still live in hopes. Mr. Speaker. that some day I am going to persuade him of the correctness of the side which I take. This is in defense of the American merchant marine. There is no money involved. There is a technical point involved which says that a line. in order to set itself up and to offer itself as a carrier to the people of the United States. must some months ahead of time establish its trade routes. it must offer its service to people all over the United States and must. therefore. know in advance that it is eligible to an operating subsidy. It must know that. once started. it may continue to operate for the benefit of its customers upon that line. It may take months to secure information and to present its case to the Maritime Commission. I know one line that has perhaps $50.000 involved already of its own money in order that it may set itself up so that it is in the eligible class for subsidies. if needed. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas sets an arbitrary figure for the number of boats which may receive subsidies. It is not the prerogative of the Appropriations Committee to set an arbitrary figure but to set a figure in money. We have set that figure in money in the appropriation and I have no controversy with that figure. it is adequate. In addition to that. the gentleman from Texas wishes in his amendment to set a figure which limits the number of ships to those now under the wire for an operating subsidy or were entitled to it as of January 1 of this year. Rather than to argue that point. I wish to point out that two lines involved. having 15 ships. which would be shut out by this amendment. are the very lines upon which the United States has been depending since the outbreak of the war in Korea to carry supplies to the men on the battle front over there.

They are not subsidized at the present time. Their applications are in for a subsidy. Their vessels are not included in the 263 figure set by the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas . With the return to a normal condition. which we all hope will be somewhere in the immediate future. and with the cessation of the business now being conducted by these lines and possibly other lines. these particular lines would be barred from any subsidy and would be out of business. I think it is an unfair approach to companies that are doing their best to return the American flag to the seas.

Mr. President. the fact is that the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Morton Salt Company (334 U.

Federal Trade Commission (324 U. S. 726. 742. and refers to note 14). In note 14 the Court states: This language is to be read also in the light of the following statement in the same case. discussing the meaning of section 2 (a). as contained in the RobinsonPatman Act. in relation to section 3 of the Clayton Act: \"It is to be observed that section 2 (a) does not require a finding that the discriminations in price have in fact had an adverse effect on competition. The statute is designed to reach such discriminations in their incipiency. before the harm to competition is effected.

The Court said: \"Section 3 condemns sales or agreements where the effect of such sale or contract of sale may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create monopoly * * * But we do not think that the purpose in using the word may was to prohibit the mere possibility of the consequences described.

Anyone can divide thE figure 2.000.000 into 49.000.000 and know that it is costing more than $20 an acre for every acre of peanuts grown. Every time a farmer planted an acre of peanuts for oil in 1949 it cost the Government of the United States $27. Farmers do not get that much out of the various crops in different parts of the country. and there are those of us who would like to see the provision of the law affecting peanuts corrected in such a manner that it will continue to operate satisfactorily. I believe that what we need most of all is to grant additional acreage to the farmers in Virginia and North Carolina who grow the ball park kind of peanuts. the kind we are now forced to import from China and other countries.

It has been endorsed and supported by many individuals. labor organizations. veterans groups. postoffice employee organizations. and many other groups. The bills opposition seems to revolve around the cost. I would like to repeat. for the benefit of any who were not here when the matter was originally discussed. that the cost per year for these veterans in the Post Office Department under section 1. which is the part of the bill which we must consider. as that is the portion of the bill which our committee recommended out and which will be considered by the House. is about $23.000.000 annually. The overall cost for the period as long as a total of 8 years will be about $163.000.000. If all of the other veterans in Federal organizations were taken In under section 1 of the bill. it would mean a cost of about $17.000.000 annually. or a total overall cost for the entire period of about $70.000.000. The reason for the less cost is because o the grades that these additional employees are taken in at and because there Is a difference In the grades. There are 11 Post Office Department grades. and only 7 grades In the Federal service. Furthermore. the grades In the case of the Post Office Department. that is. the withingrades. cost more in the additional amounts given per grade. compared to the grades in the Federal service. In the case of the Post Office Department. 120.000 veterans will be benefited. There will be 180.000 more veterans benefited if this bill were extended to all veterans in all classes of the Federal Government. So. we see that the cost is relatively small. We are giving them only what they deserve. Therefore. I believe this bill should be adopted by unanimous vote of the House.",

I do not want to be taken for a moment to indicate that the gentleman from Tennessee is as solicitous as I am about opportunities for veterans. I am sure he is and that that is the purpose of his amendment. and my comment is only designed toward the purpose which I feel he would want to serve himself. and that is to get this bill passed. It is really an honest difference. I fear. if the bill Is loaded down with an openend proposition. it might lose enoagh votes possibly even to defeat it. and we both do not want that. On the bill itself I would like to point out two factors which are very important. First. It is clear now that this is the same sort of bill which was passed for veterans of World War I. There we had a twoyear war. and hence we had a twoyear cutoff date. The cutoff date. as I understand it was 1920. Here. with a fouryear war. we have a longer cutoff date. and the cutoff date is July 1. 1950. Second. The juxtaposition of the two figures indicates why the effort is being made to do this for postal employees. and why other Government employees are not at this time included. The two figures are $163.000.000 overall. as the cost of this bill. and $70.000.009 overall which would be the cost for all other veterans employed by the Government if included. What that indicates is that the salary schedules for postal employees are so designed that postal employees need more relief in this matter than other Government employees. because it costs more money to bring them to parity. I point out that the $70.000.000 applies to about twice as many veterans as the $163.000.000 applies to in the Post Office Department. about 94.000 to about 180.000. thus emphasizing again the point which I make.",

There is no question as to the merits of the projectI can say that to the Senator from New Jersey. there is no question as to the merits of his amendment-",

I did object. The situation of the Senator from New Jersey in my opinion is identical. and there is nothing for the Committee on Public Works to do other than to oppose the amendment. If the Senator from New Jersey can persuade the Senate to approve his amendment. the Senate is supreme. but. so far as my not keeping faith is concerned. I resent the Senator from New Jersey saying that I played politics. I leave my standing to the Senator from Pennsylvania . the Senator from Nevada . the Senator from Washington . the Senator from Utah or the other Republican Senators. Let them point to one case in which I have played politics in the committee. Mr. President. the Committee on Public Works is a construction committee. and no matter how meritorious a project may be. if the committee has not acted on it. not as a partisan committee. not by the Democrats on the committee only. but by the committee members. including the Republican members.

I said to the distinguished chairman of the committee that I thought his committee had gone pretty far in adding $400.000.000 to a $1.100.000.000 appropriation which had come to us from the House. He told me that he would resist all other amendments carrying authorizatiots. I said. \"I will be happy to support you in that position.\" So. whenever I got a chance. I supported the chairman in his opposition to all amendments carrying authorizations. To explain my apparent inconsistency today. it appeared that Friday. by a very overwhelming vote. the Senate voted to add just one authorization. for Connecticut. It was a project which had a ratio o\ufffd benefits to cost of 7 to 4. and there was only one other in this billion and a half dollars worth of projects which had a higher ratio than that. and that was my little project in Accomac County. called the Quinby project. which is a small dredging operation.",

The haul from the cotton section in the San Joaquin Valley is an easy down hill haul to Stockton. We are anxious to get a warehouse that can store cotton awaiting shipment out of the port of Stockton. If the Secretary of Agriculture and the Commodity Credit Corporation will give us a lift. we think they can help us finance such a warehouse and the port will make suitable arrangements to pay back the cost of the Investment with interest. This bill seems to give that authority. although it may not directly build the warehouseat least not by the use of CCC funds. But if they recognize the need for the warehouse and I have been assured that they do. the Secretary might make a thorough study of the need for this warehouse. which might be submitted to the RFC in the event a loan for that purpose is sought by the port district.

I should like to remind the Senate. with considerable pride. that this highly deserved honor to the Nations fathers. originated in my State. the State of Washington. In 1910 Mrs. Bruce Dodd. of Spokane. Wash.. suggested the idea to a Spokane newspaper reporter as a tribute to her father. William J. Smart. Her suggestion was adopted by the local ministerial association and the YMCA and together they sponsored the first Fathers Day on June 3 of that year. In 1914 the Congress recognized Fathers Day as a national holiday. but when World War I intervened the idea was abandoned until 1922. Since that time Fathers Day has been proclaimed a national holiday the third Sunday in June each year. The joint resolution (S. J. Res. 91) relating to Fathers Day was read twice by its title and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.",

This Communist student is very officious in publicizing his doctrines in the campus newspaper. I think Senators will be amazed to know that the money of the taxpayers is being used to provide scholarships for known Communists through the Atomic Energy Commission. There is a suggestion in Dr. Lilienthals letter that if the time comes when restricted data is to be considered. that before these students are given access to this data. that there might be some investigation as to their loyalty.

I cannot conceive that there would be any very serious effort made to impose any undue penalty upon any legitimate business. It is a bit unfortunate. and yet there is much justice and much equity and much fairness in having a severe penalty against those who violate the law with their eyes open. when they cannot any longer be surprised. and cannot any longer be unaware about what they are ordered to do or not to do. by a final order of the Federal Trade Commission.

The fifth article of the treaty states. quoting again from the report: Article V. paragraph 1. which. from the standpoint of assuring the rights of aliens to engage in economic activities may. together with article VI. be considered the heart of the treaty. provides that each country shall accord to the citizens and companies of the other the same rights it accords to its own citizens and companies with regard to engaging in commercial. manufacturing. processing. financial. construction. publishing. scientific. education. religious. philanthropic. and professional activities.

But even with such low wage rates. the cotton growers are in trouble. They are trying to produce and to continue to produce cotton on land which has been producing cotton for 150 years. They are continuing to grow a soildepleting crop. and are doing the best they can to make up for that depletion by adding chemical fertilizer. These old cotton States of the South are just now getting under way toward conversion to other more profitable types of agricultural production. The one greatest opportunity which lies before them is that of converting to an animal industry. and particularly to a dairy industry. Under the false pretense of protecting their income. this bill is striking a blow at the greatest hope which would otherwise lie before them. If we undertake to Increase the cottonseed production to meet the demands for unrestricted invasion of oleo into the butter market. we must remember that while we are increasing the production of cottonseed. we are also increasing the production of cotton fiber. which is already in such tremendous surplus that the cotton market would collapse today were it not for payments and loans from the Federal Treasury. Why do we undertake to encourage the continuance of uneconomic conditions for the benefit of a handful of oleo manufacturers? Why do we not take a longrange view of the situation. and protect the income of American agricultural workers. protect the market for American industrial goods. protect the wage level of American workers. and protect the economy of the Nation. by amending this bill so that it will be impossible for the oleo interests to partially destroy the branch of our American economy upon which the greatest number of our people depend.",

Mr. President. a newspaper from San Francisco. the San Francisco CallBulletin. advertising Wilsons oleomargarine as \"churned fresh daily.\" As we know. \"churning\" means separating the butterfat from the milk.

Therefore. the purpose of this amendment. without interfering with budget approval or without interfering with investigation moneys for any other projects in the United States. is merely to transfer the $175.000 for planning on the Kennewick division of the Yakima project from that category of investigation to the category of construction money for that project. under the suggestion of the committees statement that it is not considered by the committee as a new project. I urge that this amendment be adopted and that the $175.000 be placed in the category of aid to construction. In closing. may I add that the transfer of these moneys will not in any way change the total sum of money involved in the entire bill. It merely transfers $175.000 from general investigations to the construction moneys in the succeeding chapter. under the unanimous consent to offer the amendment in this form.",

The introduction of this pest to Hawail during the period of the war has been attended with devastating results. It is regarded by us in Hawaii as the most serious menace of its kind ever to confront our agriculture. Its presence in Hawaii constitutes a threat to the fruit and vegetable growing industries of the West. Southwest. and southern parts of this country that Is viewed with the utmost alarm by every scientist who has explored its potentialities. The importation from Hawaii of fresh fruit and vegetables has been prohibited for several years. and now this quarantine has been placed on the importation of Vanda orchids. The shipment of these orchids from Hawaii to all parts of this country has developed so rapidly during recent years that it promises to develop into an industry that would yield four to five millions of dollars annually. The quarantine that was placed only a few weeks ago on the importation of these flowers threatens to eradicate this industry completely. The situation Is regarded now with such seriousness by those immediately combating it that a committee of leading businessmen in Honolulu has now under consideration a plan to ask an appropriation of $2.000.000 from the Federal Government to fight this pest. The Legislature of the Territory in the meantime is expected toact on legislation providing at least $200.000 to explore methods for sterilizing products raised In Hawaii for shipment to the States. This is far from being a local problem alone. The west coast is already alert to its seriousness and recognizes the need for broadening the field of research into methods for properly dealing with It. I am grateful indeed to learn from the hearings that the committee devoted careful attention to this problem and hope that as a result of this inquiry a means will be found to expand research in this field.

Such facilities were established. both in Soil Conservation Service and in the Forest Service during the WPA days. when these thousands of recreation units were built. Since that time it has been virtually impossible in view of the other claims for Federal funds to properly support and maintain these facilities. If we set out to do it today it would add tremendously to the funds expended. and the committee has merely suggested to the legislative committee that thought be given to a proper way of dealing with these facilities locally. if it be true that we cannot support them as we would like to from Federal funds. The intention of the committee was to direct the Department to make some move to correct health hazard at Salt Lake City. if they will. to permit the Forest. Service facilities to be used as they are now being used. The whole attitude of the committee was one of trying to be helpful. We think that it can be worked out.

In my State of Montana we have some 24.000.000 acres of national forest land. I served for 8 years as a forest ranger in one of the great game areas of the United States. that adjoining the Yellowstone National Park. The last few years I have been chairman of a game committee that is seeking to coordinate the activities in game management of the Park Service. the Forest Service. and Fish and Wildlife Service. the State Fish and Game Commission. the Rod and Gun Clubs. and the farmers and ranchers. We have had considerable success in coordinating those activities for better management of game and I am sure the solution to the game problem is not in giving the Federal Government the right to issue licenses and to fix bag limitsthat is a State function. the problem can be worked out much better through cooperation of these agencies and the State with the local people.

I think they have come through in fine fashion. I want to say briefly that in following up my appearance before the committee I at that time touched on four particular subjectsfirst of all. forestry. Although Indiana is not a forestry State. as are many of the other States that have testified here. in my connection with the Government at the State level. it was brought to my attention that great sections even of our own State have not been selfsustaining for years simply because we have lacked the foresight to encourage and develop reforestation there. That represents not only a drain upon the more productive parts of the State. but it also represents a drain upon the people themselves. because their standard of living has fallen and many of them have even been forced to evacuate and leave their communities. If a little management and encouragement at the Federal level had been exercised years ago. that would still be a rich and productive area in terms of timber resources. I mentioned briefly also the Extension Service and said that during the course of my testimony to the committee I could think of no other service. particularly with reference to the 4H Club work. that has given greater service and proved more worth while to the people of our country in the development not only of technical ability but citizenship as well. I commend the committee on their expansion of the budget at that particular point so that the 4H Clubs would be given greater impetus. I also touched upon soil conservation. I think that. too. represents a field wherein we have lagged and where the country as a whole will be called upon at some time to account for the great visible assets of our empire that have been allowed to be washed away.

It is the first time in my recollection that we have not been engaged in a knockout fight about some major item. I am happy to find that the appropriations for the Extension Service have been increased in the sum of $1.000.000. This gives splendid recognition to the very fine work being done by our 4H Clubs. The additional appropriation will be for the expansion of this great program. The development of our farm boys and girls Is one of the most important pursuits in which we can become engaged. I may say that I regret that the appropriations for flood control have been decreased $1.025.000 under the budget estimate for flood control. This decrease will. of course. affect the work being done on the Little Sioux River project which happens to be in my congressional district. This project is a model for the entire United States. The work Is going forward in fine shape and I express the hope that the Committee on Appropriations will not at.any time so reduce the appropriation for this project as to jeopardize its completion on schedule. Early in this session I introduced a bill to grant the Commodity Credit Corporation additional authority for the acquisition of grainstorage facilities. I assume that the authority given the CCC in this bill to borrow $4.750.000.000 on the credit of the United States. will provide the necessary funds to take care of the situation in my bill or similar legislation as enacted into law at this session of Congress. Needless to say. I am also Immensely pleased to find that ample provisions are made In this bill for the REA. I have been a loyal supporter of this program throughout the years. Not only does this bill provide a specific loan authorization of $350.000.000. but grants additional authority to loan an additional $150.000.000 if needed.

The committee took counsel one with another and decided to extend the Synthetic Rubber Act and keep the plants available for us in case of emergency. At that time the atmosphere was peaceful. and there was a good deal of sentiment and support for the statement that the Government should get out of business. Many persons said. \"Get the Government out of business and turn the plants over to private industry.\" If that had been done it is not unlikely that the plants might have been closed down. or. at least. their usefulness would have been impaired if we had needed them quickly. I am glad to say that the committee of which the able Senator from Oregon is a member was unanimous in saying that until the international situation. which looked relatively calm 3 or 4 or 5 months ago. cleared completely so that we could turn these plants over to private industry with a degree of safety which we did not at that time think was present. we had better hold on to them.

But if it provides capital for a 1yearold son. and then the tax is split. so that each one pays less tax. that is not a bona fide partnership. Let me refer to the case which the Senator from Oklahoma suggested. The amendment will not only deprive the Government of tax revenue. but will make legitimate what is now looked upon by the courts as illegal. I have before me a case in which two brothers. who were partners in a manufacturing business. provided a trust interest for their wives and children. in 1938. The children of one brother were 1 and 8 years of age. The children of the other brother were 15 and 18 years of age. The total amount of the incometax deficiency involved for the brothers in a single year was more than $95.000. In a decision in the middle district of North Carolina the court ruled that this partnership was invalid for tax purposes. The case is now being appealed to a higher court. It is my understanding that under the provisions of this amendment the court would be bound to find the partnership valid. and the partnership would be entitled to a refund of the entire $95.000. I believe it would apply to those cases which are in litigation. There are numerous cases in litigation. Under the present law the courts have held that they involve invalid partnerships for tax purposes. This amendment would validate those partnerships. and the partners would be entitled to a refund.",

The people of this Nation who saw the possibilities of water transportation found in Representative Dempsey a man of vision and an able and courageous leader in this Important work: Our former colleague came to Congress well prepared to take a prominent part in all legislative problems. because of his conspicuous service as assistant United States attorney from 1899 to 1907 and his broad experience in the practice of his chosen profession. The natural charm and unfailing courtesy of Representative Dempsey won him a host of friends throughout the Nation. After leavihg Congress Representative Dempsey opened a law office in Washington and soon built up a large and lucrative practice. I have a deep affection for our former colleague as did all those who had the privilege of serving with him. Representative Dempsey is survived by his wife.

JOHNSTON: With your letter of March 31. 1949. you attached a memorandum relating to the British film quota and requesting that the State Department attempt to negotiate a reduction in this quota. As you know the Department took this matter up with British officials in early April. The Department has now received a response from the British Government to the protest made at that time. This response was substantially as follows: The British Government states that the quota. which was fixed by Parliament. cannot be modified at the present time. It hopes. however. that as a result of the recent meetings in Washington between certain members of the American and British film industries and those scheduled to take place early in June an improvement in the relations between the two groups may be effected. The British Government states that it feels that the quota in no way contravenes the General Trade Agreement or any other legal commitment. that the British Government had the same right to raise this quota as the United States or any other government would have to raise an import duty with respect to which it had made no commitments. It believes that the quota is consistent with and a necessary part of the British effort to build up production and trade looking .toward an improvement in the British balanceoftrade situation. The British G3overnment contends also that the quota is reasonable from the standpoint of British film production possibilities although the quota was not entirely filled with British features during the first year. This fact presumably accounted for the reduction in the quota from 45 percent to 40 percent for the second year. Finally the British Government expresses surprise that the setting up of the film quota should have been necessarily unexpected by the American film industry or interpreted as an act of bad faith as a consequence of any understanding between the industry and the British Government in conrection with the film agreement of 1948. I am sorry to have to transmit an unfavorable reply to you particularly in view of the efforts which have been made toward getting a modification of the quota. The Department is studying the response which the British Government has made in this case. Sincerely yours. JAME Act",

I agree with the distinguished chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary when he says: This particular provision * * should be stricken from the bill. or. if it is not stricken. certain safeguards should have been added. Section 8 does not protect the people of the United States from having a group of Communists or Fascists. or whatever they may be. come into this country. Section 8. which In a proviso permits the entry of 100 persons a year. provides: Whenever the Director and the Attorney I General shall determine that the entry of a particular alien into the United States for permanent residence is in the Interest of national security or essential to the furtherance of the national Intelligence mission. such alien and his immediate family shall I be given entry into the United States for permanent residence without regard to their inadmissibility under the immigration or any other laws and regulations. or to the failure to comply with such laws and regulations pertaining to admissibility. Mr. President. I submit there Is noths iag in the bill which gives us any jurisdiction over these persons after they get into our country. When they come here they are on an absolute par with the distinguished Senator from Maryland. They can go wherever they want to go. they can do what they want to do. There is no provision that they must make reports. There is no provision for following them up. That Is why I say that. agreeing as I do with the distinguished Senator from Maryland.

I do not believe in special privileges. or providing one thing for one part of the country and not for another. The need for economy at the present time is so great that we should not embark upon a $23.000.000 additional program which is going to run to $100.000.000 before we get through. An investigation of this item by the Post Office Department a couple of years ago resulted in a recommendation on their part that this service not be attempted. I think this Congress must at this time assert itself and take some responsibility. We are going to be given the opportunity of voting for a taxreduction bill on excise taxes. Frankly. I cannot conscientiously vote for that kind of bill and then vote for increased expenses in this instance. I do not believe any needed services will be curtailed in the slightest degree if this money is not added. I think the committee has provided ample funds for the entire service. The total amount of this amendment is something like $23.000.000. The total amount here is $1.786.000.000. That is $92.000.000 above last year. I think the committee has been exceedingly generous with the Department for its postal operations. The cut is something like 11/3 percent on that particular item. It is not enough so that it should not in the slightest degree interfere with the services of the Department. You know that the gentleman from New Jersey told us. while the gentleman from Louisiana was in the well of the House. that the President had found they had allowed $42.000.000 too much to take care of the regular operations of the Post Office Department. The overall cut on the Post Office Department was only $28.000.000 or twothirds of what the President found was overestimated.

We have heard about the Lustron matter which the House has so very clearly gone on record against. They built a lot of these metal houses which are not satisfactory and have not worked out. They could not sell them for anything like what they cost. It is about time we stopped putting a great deal of money up for things like that which ought not to come out of the Treasury. There was something. as I remember it. like $100.000.000 in Lustron. For KaiserFrazer there was something like $50.000.000. although I cannot remember the exact figure. This Waltham Watch business ran to something like $67.000.000. and I do not know how much was involved in TexMass. but I think it was several million dollars. If they would concentrate their activities on really relieving distressed and legitimate going concerns and not get mixed up in things of that kind and not spend the Federal Governments money for loans of that sort. they can get along with a great deal less money for their operating expenses. This will only reduce the amount to $1.755.000.000 below last years appropriations. I believe that can be done and that they can get along without any trouble at all. This is one of the places where a cut can be made which will be a constructive cut and which will result in less dangerous activities so far as the Federal Treasury is concerned. Perhaps it might result in a very large saving if we can confine the activities of that Corporation to things which need to be done instead of having them engage in these highly speculative matters which have not worked out at all.",

As of March 31. the commodities which would be affected are 83.000.000 pounds of dried eggs. 86.000.000 pounds of butter. 305.000.000 pounds of dried milk. some 20.000.000 pounds of cheese. and. I believe. prunes and raisins are included. 17.000.000 pounds of prunes. and 8.000.000 pounds of raisins. There is some question as to whether there might not be some dried edible beans available for this purpose. because they do not keep indefinitely. and the Government has about 4.000.000 pounds on hand. The amendment permits the Secretary to dispose of them on such terms and conditions as he deems appropriate and in the public interest. It does limit him. however. to paying he transportation costs to the ships side. He cannot pay costs overseas. It will in effect permit dried milk and dried eggs. which are in heavy surplus. to be disposed of in the same manner as the law which was enacted affecting cotton and peanut acreages a short time ago permitted potatoes to be disposed of. Of course. potatoes were so bulky and .heavy that I do not know how many the Department got rid of. I believe they got rid of some of them to Spain and Portugal. I may say that this proposal to make these products available for -foreign relief purposes has been considered when bills have come up previously. It was considered as an amendment to other bills. particularly the cottonacreage bill. but at that time there were some 30 bills introduced in the House carrying the same provision or approximately the same provision. and the House Committee on Agriculture had started hearings.

Therefore. our Government went into the Mexican market and bought a large amount of beef.

Furthermore. if it is represented to the court. and the court believes it. that they are unable to provide bonds. they are released on their own recognizance.

I hope and trust that our State Department is properly protecting the interests of the United States by working diligently through diplomatic and all other channels to make sure that the Chinese Communist regime will not be admitted to the United Nations. where it could only make trouble for the organization and for all peoples who want to work together to prevent further Communist aggression.",

However. in the language of the chairman of the committee. which I have just quoted. I think he admitted that the amendment is a good one. As far as I can see there is absolutely no justification for putting this type of restriction upon the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They ought to have whatever staff they need to do the job. Senators know that the amendment does not propose to create new officers. -All that is done is to take officers. as the language provides. from the other three branches of the services In such numbers as the Joint Chiefs of Staffand each service is represented on the Joint Chiefsand the Secretary of Defense decide they need to do the work of the Joint Chiefs. Why. I ask. in the name of common sense. can we justify writing into the bill the arbitrary restriction of 210? Maybe under some circumstances they may need 500 or 300 or 211. But we say quite arbitrarily. \"We limit you to 210.\" What I think my good friend from Maryland ought to do is to offer to take the amendment to conference. but if he does not want to do that. and because of his loyalty to what he thinks is a commitment which he owes the full committee.

I may say that the Joint Chiefs were not displeased with the number provided in the 210 quota. The chairman of the committee himself had sufficient confidence in the Joint Chiefs to feel that if no limitation had been provided the committee would have acted more wisely. but. as I say.

The only way we can induce men to endure the criticisms and the slings and arrows which go with such a great controversial job. involving the spending of so much money. is at least to make the job attractive for them in as many respects as possible. It was the final opinion of Mr. Hoover and others that if we were to retain the titles Secretary of the Army. Secretary of the Navy. and Secretary of the Air Force. rather than Under Secretary of Defense for the Army. Under Secretary of Defense for the Navy. and Under Secretary of Defense for the Air Force. in the public mind the idea that it is a position of prestige would find lodgement. Men might be induced. In a close decision. to take such a job. when otherwise they might be reluctant to surrender great business interests. perhaps. for the mere title of Under Secretary.

We favor the enactment and just enforcement of such Federal legislation as may be necessary to maintain this right at all times in every part of this Republic. And more than that.

It is my conviction that this legislation is unsound in principle and impracticable in application and it certainly should not be enacted into law. To say by the strong arm of the Federal law to a free American citizen that he does not have the right to exercise his choice in the selection of his employees is a violation of some of the most cherished and timehonored principles of our system of government. The enactment of this legislation would seriously disturb and in many instances destroy the friendly and cordial relationship existing between employers and employees. It would likewise force many employees to work and associate with other employees who are very disagreeable to them. In adopting this type of program the Federal Government would be extending a measure of control over our people that would be entirely untenable. To set up a Government agency as the arbiter of employment in private business would place a burden on the private enterprise system that it should not have to bearthis private enterprise system that has contributed so largely toward making this the greatest country in all the world.

The exact opposite is the truth. and I base that statement on the very language of the bill itself. No bill has ever come before this Congress which discriminates more against citizens of this country and particularly against a minority than does this bill. because by the language of the bill itself you will find that not only will they lose all the privileges they now have. but they will not be able to get any privileges at all except at the will and pleasure of the bureaucrats which this bill will set up. This bill is selling these minorities down the river because the terms of the bill itself specify that it shall not apply to any factory employing less than 50 people. In other words. if anyone has the misfortune to work where there are only 49 people or less. and you are saying to the people that you say you want to help. \"It does not make any differenceyou cannot be discriminated against until you get in a crowd of 50 or more people.\" In other words there cannot be any such thing as discrimination until there are more than 50 peoplein a plant.",

He could make a man appear there Tuesday and then compel you to be anywhere else they want you to go at noon the next day._ There is such power In this bill that if the Commission so desires. they can bankrupt any company in the United States by forcing them to go all over the country to defend themselves against a bunch of frivolous complaints. Furthermore in subsection (b). section 2 of this bill you have something here which discriminates against not only minorities in this country but against every decent American citizen. It says all persons in the jurisdiction of the United States shall have these rights. An enemy alien in this country is within the jurisdiction of this Government and automatically you here give him rights that he never has had before. You are setting up something here which would make the employment officer at the atomic energy plants subject to criminal prosecution. Mr. Chairman. trying to eliminate discrimination through this bill is just as silly as a farmer burning down the barn to get rid of the rats.",

I submitted the best arguments that I could in opposition to that and similar bills on July 5. 1945. and on July 12. 1945. as I had previously submitted the best arguments that I could on May 26. 1944. against similar legislation. THE NAME There is something in a name with which to conjure. It sounds all right to provide for fairemployment practice. All citizens want to be fair. but a name may be deceptive. The proposal is by regulation and by statute to require all employers with 50 or more employees and all Federal departments and agencies to eliminate discrimination in regard to hiring. and terms or conditions of employment because of race. color. religion. ancestry or national origin. The proposal sounds well. but a name may be misleading. The important matter is not the name but the purpose behind the name. The bill might better be called \"Unfair Employment Practice Act.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. Chairman. the purpose of the bill is to make permanent the second judgeship presently existing in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. which judgeship now exists under an act which prohibits the filling of the first vacancy in this office of district judge for said district. Since. the beginning of the Government in 1789. until 1946. the district of Delaware had one judge. By an act approved July 24. 1946. the number was increased to two judges with a proviso. however. that the first vacancy occurring in the district should not be filled. The reason for the increase of one temporary judge in 1946 was due to the continued growth of judicial business over the years. with particular reference to the characteristics of the cases involved. to the point where it was no longer expeditious or practical to limit the district to one judge. Although the number of cases handled in comparison with other districts in the United States was relatively low. the second judge was needed because the high proportion of cases brought in that district were complicated and difficult.and. on account of their nature. took a long time for trial and ultimate disposal. Since the addition of the temporary judge in 1946. experience has indicated that the status of the court docket and judicial business is as burdensome today as it was in 1946 and this will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. Consequently. the need for two judges in the district will continue. The report of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts directs attention to the fact that the cases instituted in the district of Delaware are concerned with large business and corporate affairs. The fact is recognized that the reason for many corporations being incorporated in Delaware is the liberal laws of the State of Delaware concerning incorporation requirements. The enactment of this bill has been recommended by both the Department of Justice and the Judicial Conference of the United States. Mr: Chairman. we are faced today with a situation in Delaware that is a very sad one. The judge who is now operating under a temporary status is very ill. in fact. so ill. I understand. that serious loss is imminent. I will ask the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. BooGs] if the situation has changed any.",

First. may I say that this bill does not create a new judgeship. It simply makes permanent the temporary judgeship already existing in Delaware. We have two judges at the present time. and we will only have two judges on a permanent basis if this bill should be enacted into law. That is an important consideration because in the previous discussions of the various bills which have been before this body it has been pointed out by way of objection to them that passage of the bill would necessitate a new courthouse. a new marshal. new clerks. a new staff. and so forth. but that objection would not apply in this case due to the fact we are not creating a new court.

I certainly approve of that method and think it is a splendid thing to do and that we should utilize it to the maximum. however. as has been pointed out so ably by the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from New York these cases in Delaware run from 8 to 13 months in trial work alone and you cannot. therefore. ask any judge to leave his own district for that period of time. It would be unreasonable to expect him to do it. The litigants and the citizens of his own district would not tolerate it. So I do not think that objection would apply in this particular instance.",

Here is a case. the Zenith Radio Corp. against RCA. General Electric. Western Electric. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Bell Telephone Laboratories. and Westinghouse Electric Co.

Further than that I know that my colleague will recall that Judge Paul Leahy. from the Federal court in Delaware. also testified that when that case was terminated the next case under the Federal statute is RCA against American Telephone & Telegraph Co.. and he said further that that case is considered by counsel to be one of the largest patent cases that will ever b% tried. that there has been some intimation that there will be 1.000 to 1.100 patents involved.

He further said that the docket has been cluttered up for the past 8 years. Another thing that complicates the situation in Delaware is the fact that they have to administer the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. and that calls for the reorganization of a $15.000.000.000 industry and they had 60 statements in that particular case.

What I say is that we should not freeze in and make permanent a second judge because there is also the point which was discussed here at such great length with regard to the Ohio judge that the Committee on the Judiciary should bring to this floor at an early date a measure raising the jurisdictional limit on these Federal court cases from $3.000 to $10.000.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I wish to speak briefly on the item for emergency control of insects by the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. The Appropriations Committee leveled some very serious charges at this agency in connection with its operations in the grasshopper eradication campaign last year. As a result of the committees investigations. the Commission made very sizable reductions in the amounts requested by the Bureau. While I praise the committee in its efforts for economy. the fact remains that the sums appropriated in the recent deficiency bill and recommended for appropriation in this measure are not adequate to control a grasshopper plague of the proportions we now expect in Montana and Wyoming. Terrific destruction of crops and ranges are in prospect if the hoppers are not controlled this spring. bcfore they have a chance to spread over the countryside. It is a job that the local people cannot do alone. Far the larger share of the land involved is in Federal ownership. It is a Federal responsibility not only to prevent grasshopper destruction of the range it owns. but also to control grasshoppers so that they will not spread to the adjacent land in private ownership. The ranchers and farmers in the area have a right to expect that the Government will take care of its own problem. and they also wish to have Federal assistance on a 5050 basis for the campaign against hoppers on State. county. and private lands. The original Bureau request for $3.523.000 for this springs work was cut by the Budget Bureau to $2.200.000 and further reduced to $1.000.000 in the urgent deficiency bill. The Bureau also requested $2.500.000 for 1951 which is cut to $850.000 in the pending bill. These amounts I fear will not be adequate for the work ahead. I am told that a supplemental request may soon be submitted for additional funds for this springs work. and I hope it will have the speedy attention of the Congress. I also hope that a suitable adjustment will be made for the 1951 fiscal year. At this point I wish to include in my remarks an expression of concern from the county commissioners of six counties in northeast Montana. A similar situation is in prospect in southeast Montana and in Wyoming.",

I believe that there are ways that the Government can save money on its agricultural program. At the present time the Government is engaged in the business of making loans on perishable commodities as well as those that are nonperishable. handling those commodities. transporting them. storing them. and selling them. the Government is in a big business in perishable products. There is a way that the Government can get out of that business of handling. transporting.. storing. and selling perishable products. That plan has been suggested by the Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Brannan. There are two things about that plan that I desire to especially invite your attention to: No. 1. it will get the Gov-. ernment out of the business that I have already stated. No. 2. it will preserve agriculture for the familysized farm. Today it is difficult for any person to go into private business in a line that is already dominated by large concerns. What chance has a young GI going into the grocery business. for instance. when one large concern admits that in 29 percent of the areas they sell at a loss? Naturally. it results in putting the little stores out of business. and to add to the bad effect. the Government permits them to have a tax deduction for those losses. thereby subsidizing. out of the United States Treasury the concerns that destroy the independent small merchant in this country. Take the large steel concerns. they are not just in the steel business. they are in the fabricating business. they are going into all lines of business. What chance has an individual going into competition with them when the big steel companies have absolute control of the supply of materials and can cut off the supply of an individual any time they desire?

He was not a candidate for reelection because of waning health due to the strenuous work of reorganizing the national defense.

He was highminded. tough. unswerving. and courageous in his own decisions on legislative matters. but his tact. his understanding and sympathy with those of opposing views. and his organizing ability. helped to make some of the debates on vexatious defense questions generate more light and less heat. leaving fewer scars after the vote was taken. His organization of the new Armed Services Committee last session was a work of real statesmanship that will benefit our country for years to come. and could well be an example to other committees.

Mr. President. as I have listened to the colloquy between the Senator from South Dakota and the leadership on the other side of the aisle. those words have a familiar ring as they have been directed by those in administrative authority to my friend from South Dakota.

I can draw only one conclusion. and that is that the majority leader is saying that the majority party will determine in every instance what is good and proper for the United States of America. but the Senator from Washington wishes to dissociate himself from any such view. The conclusion of the quotation is as follows: The question in this debate Is not excise taxes. the question is whether a Senator on the opposite side of the aisle can take the leadership away from the majority partyIn this instance it happens to be the junior Senator from the sovereign State of South Dakotaand advise the Senate and the country that from now on. any time the Senator from Washington desires to make a motion for the consideration of some measure in which he is Interested. the majority of the Senators must go along with him. Mr. President. I think those quotations add substance and reality to the case which the Senator from South Dakota has offered to the Senate and to all the citizens of the United States of America. It seems to the junior Senator from Washington that if there is no disposition on the part of the majority to bring up a bill which is of such vital concern to many Americans and to the Senator from South Dakota. the responsibility for failing so to do must be assumed in its entirety by Senators on the other side of the aisle.",

I hope before the Eightyfirst Congress adjourns that I will be privileged to vote for a bill that will increase the postal rates on certain classes of mail. Something was mentioned earlier today about the postal service being a service institution. That is true. I know of one publisher in my own district who places in the mails 1.000 copies of his paper each week. and who is paying less than $1 to have these 1.000 copies distributed by the post office. Certainly there should be an increase in this category. I again call the attention of the committee to the large increase in the amount of parcel post being handled by the Post Office Department at a tremendous loss. It was brought out during the committee hearings that many of the mailorder houses ship as many as two or three carloads of parcel post in 1 day. Express companies have placed a high minimum on shipments. so over a period of years most of the small packages handled by these companies have been shifted over to the Post Office Department. thus. we are certainly subsidizing mailorder houses to the extent of many millions of dollars monthly. I think that a correction should be made. I certainly hope the proper committee gives consideration to drafting legislation that will correct this situation. because we are subsidizing practically every niailorder house in America.

J. P. Alvey. familiarly known as \"Perry\" Alvey to all who dealt with him. for the past 12 years had been in charge of the Washington. D. C.. office of the Bonneville Power Administration in the Department of the Interior. Without a doubt he could be described as one of the best bureaucratsand I use that term as a complimentin the entire Government service. During a long and distinguished career as an engineer. utility executive. soldier. and public servant. he became a most trusted friend and adviser of thousands who came to him for assistance. In his years of work in the Bonneville Administration office here. in which his primary responsibility was to serve as the liaison between that agency and us who represent in Congress the territory it serves. no request of ours was too great to be handled nor too trifling to deserve a full consideration. To my personal knowledge. he worked day and night. Sundays and holidays. whenever his duties required. in order to meet the demands of the Congress and the people. I honestly believe he literally worked himself into the grave. Perry Alvey was born in Galveston. Tex.. December 1. 1885. He was graduated from the University of Texas in 1906 and from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1907. From that time until 1937 he worked in the construction business and for various utility and railway companies. taking time out to serve as a captain of engineers in the AEF. In 1937 he left his post as general manager of the Chicago & Illinois Valley Railroad to become consulting engineer of the Bonneville Power Administration. We will all miss him very greatly.",

It would mean that instead of saving money it would cost the Government twothirds of that amount. or about twothirds. I shall not attempt to be exact. but it would be in the neighborhood of between $190.000.000 and $200.000.000.

I am one of the oldfashioned persons who believe that a couple of hundred million dollars. especially when we are at war. is a rather important amount of money.

I am in favor of economy. and that is one reason why I am greatly concerned at this time because I find myself in the very unhappy position of opposing economy in connection with these items in the appropriation bill. But as I look at the report on flood control. I find an item of $35.000 for a survey or study in connection with the development of a plan of flood control at Aitkin. Minn. Alf of us. Mr. President. read of the terrific flood which damaged and devastated much property in Minnesota within the past few months. There is another project on the Clearwater River for which more than $2.000.000 has been appropriated and expended. and it will require $1.250.000 to complete the project. That amount is in the appropriation bill in connection with the project. If we fail to appropriate the necessary funds. the project must come to a standstill. Funds have been invested to no avail unless we complete the project. Mr. President. I have seen that area. I have seen bridges absolutely washed out. power dams under many feet of water. including an entire power unit and building at Crookston. which had supplied power to the city and the surrounding communities. I saw the entire countryside under water. The only reason I am speaking at this moment is that if one of the items. amounting to $1.300.000. is cut 50 percent. in accordance with one amendment. and 60 percent in accordance with another amendment. I am wondering what the full effect on the project will actually be when such a drastic reduction is made.",

There is a floodcontrol project in North Dakota which also affects Minnesota. There is an item of $1.300.000 in connection with it which would be affected by the proposed reduction. Mr. President. I am for economy. but I am bothered at this moment because any Senator who votes against the amendments will be looked upon by every taxpayer in the Nation as one who is reckless and wasteful with Federal tax revenues. Yet. at the same time. I represent in part a State in which only a few months ago in some areas the water was anywhere from 6 to 12 feet deep. Furniture was floating around in dining rooms. The water was away up the walls. and homes were practically ruined by being submerged in water 6 or 7 feet deep for several weeks. Farms were standing under many feet of water. and they cannot produce anywhere near a normal crop this year. The farmers suffered damage to their real estate as well as losing a years crops. They are in no position to look into the future with much hope or courage unless they can see steps taken to prevent future floods. If the item in the appropriation bill of $1.300.000 for the project on the Red River. to which I have referred. is cut 50 percent. I should like to know definitely as to whether we shall have any construction which will give us any assurance of controlling future floods.",

I say there will have to be sacrifices made. There is one small item in the bill about which I am particularly concerned. because the Federal Government has constructed on the opposite side of the river from a little county seat town a large levee which protects a great farming area on the eastern bank of the river. but in constructing it the result has been that the water level on the other side has been raised to such an extent that in January 1949 the flood level was so high that public schools had to be closed for 6 weeks. It would require only $228.000 to construct the protection levee. but even that may have to go by the board in this emergency. I am pointing out that my community may be hit anti the community of the Senator from Minnesota may be hit by any reduction which may be made.

I presume the argument of the Senator from Illinois is based upon that theory that we must do that which is most nearly right. We are facing a world emergency. Whether or not the trouble in Korea is the beginning of a series of troubles involving our spending from ten to twenty billion dollars a month is another thing. But the thought which has occurred most insistently to me after the distinguished Senator from Arkansas made the statement respecting Government agencies evaluating projects that can be postponed. is that if it could be said that 10 or 20 or 30 percent of them can be postponed. then we should not appropriate that money. because it means we have to levy it on the people.

R. 3001 retroactive. the committee has agreed to express its belief that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General in cooperation with the Foreign Skilled Personnel Board would have the opportunity. under the terms of this bill. to adjust the immigration status of such aliens. many of whom perform at this time very valuable work in the fields of education. medicine. national security and defense. technical progress. etc. I am glad to say that it is the intent of the committee. as stated in this particular excerpt that I have read. that the Attorney General. in the administration of this act. will issue a special regulation or regulations. These regulations will cover the particular persons stated in this excerpt and will permit persons qualified as specialists. who are already in this country under various temporary permits. particularly students. and for example. nuns or people in religious orders engaged in educational pursuits. to remain in this country. May I say further that I believe it is a good thing. because I feel it will make foreign students. who are now in the country learning certain specialties outlined in this bill. feel that there is a place for them in this country if they desire to remain. This provision assures them that they will not be summarily deported because they publicly made such an election or tried for permanent Immigration when they are on a student status. but can remain here permanently when they have or succeed in obtaining such qualifications or special skills encompassed by this act. It is a pleasure to know the Members of the House Legislative Committee agree with this interpretation of the meaning of the provisions of the act.",

He said that the young American boys did not care to go into that type of work. that they prefer to go into radio. automobile manufacturing. and other types of mechanical work. and that there was a great scarcity of hand craft. skilled tailors in the Nation. due to the fact that in times past most of our hand craft. skilled tailors came from foreign countries.

It has not been possible in this short time to study in detail all of the provisions of this particular bill. But in substance it would provide. for instance. that retired Army and Navy officers might be recalled to service and receive not only their retired pay. but also to be paid for their new Government service. There is no one who has higher regard for these military men than I. They have served their country well. But their country has also served them well. It educated them. It has taken care of them through adversity and depression. It has cared for them in their illness. It has helped them to nurse their families back to health. When the time came for them to retire they were given very substantial retirement pay. Although the Government owes them a debt. they. in turn. owe the Government a much greater debt. If these men are needed in the service today during this or any future emergency. there is the very simple expedient of recalling them to active duty and letting them revert back to active duty pay being assigned where their ability can be best used. That takes care of the situation entirely. Of course it will be said that the bill provides a ceiling of $5.000. But at the same time the President. in a national emergency is given the power to suspend that ceiling. If that is done there is no limit on what this dual remuneration might be. May I point out further. Mr. Speaker. there was no such legislation or provision such as this during all of World War II. Certainly the present emergency is not as serious as World War II. Therefore.

She served in that body for about 15 years. succeeding her great and illustrious husband. Hon. T. H. Caraway. After the death of her husband she was on November 13. 1931. appointed to succeed him and to serve until the next general election. Then at the following general election in 1932 was elected to a full term. She was reelected in 1938. and she retired at the expiration of her term on January 3. 1945. Many of the people of Arkansas will remember Mrs. Caraway as a charming and pleasant young woman in her early days. they will remember her as a beautiful and charming. hospitable and pleasing wife and widow of the great Senator. T. H. Caraway. Their residence in Arkansas was at Jonesboro. All of Arkansas will remember her as one of the outstanding members of the United States Senate for a period of about 15 years. After she retired from the United States Senate she was appointed to the United States Employees Commission and then in 1948 she was appointed to the United States Employees Compensation Appeals Board. She always rendered very able and conscientious public service. I wish to say on behalf of the people of Arkansas that we bow our heads today in grief and sorrow at the untimely passing and answering of the last roll call of that great. good. and gracious woman.

Dr. Fitzgerald is wholly incorrect in his statement and I was sorry to learn that he had misinformed the committee. As a matter of fact. the Commodity Credit Corporation has a stock pile of something over 75.000.000 pounds of wool. 34.000.000 pounds of this wool is shorn. grease wool. and over 40.000.000 pounds is scoured. pulled wool. Accordingly. it can be said that the Commodity Credit Corporation is holding the equivalent of 100.000.000 pounds of grease wool. A breakdown on the wool in the Commodity Credit Corporation discloses that 32.000.000 pounds of the scoured. pulled wool is graded 56 to 58 and 20.000.000 pounds of the shorn wool is the same grade. Accordingly. 85 percent of the wool in the hands of the Commodity Credit Corporation would be highly desirable for use in Germany and in western Europe for processing for domestic purposes in those countries. There is no question that these wools would be of splendid use for blanket purposes. I have made diligent inquiry and none of the wools in the hands of the Commodity Credit Corporation are carpet wools. The Commodity Credit officials have advised me that they do have about 10.000 pounds of forty to fortyfours but even these wools are not carpet Wools and these 10.000 pounds represent but onehundredth of 1 percent of the stock pile in the hands of the Commodity Credit Corporation.

As I explained in my opening statement. the purpose of this amendment is merely to provide that the expenditure of funds which have been appropriated for a 15month period may be accelerated and the money spent in 131/2 months if the President. after recommendation by the Administrator. deems such action necessary to carry out the purposes of the act. It is not our purpose toask for any increase in the funds of ECA and if the funds last for 15 months. I am certain that the Administrator will be delighted to stretch them out. The purpose of the amendment is merely to see that the Administration and this Government is not embarrassed by an absolute lack of funds at the end of the term.

There we cringed before communism. We permitted our Ambassador to be held in his compound. We permitted an American vice consul to be beaten up by the Communist police.

However. it was done. and it is my information that the extra cost of irrigating the land is borne by Grand Coulee. and that it will not be borne by Hells Canyon. Now we are faced with a question of fact regarding Hells Canyon and Mountain Home. and it has been developed that the subsidy from Hells Canyon to Mountain Home will be approximately $180.000.000. at least. If that subsidy were not given. then either one of two things might happen: Either. first. the power rates all over the Northwest could be reducedbelow what they otherwise will beand a lower rate would result in further developing industry in the Northwestor second. if the power rates are not reduced. a greater revenue would come to the Federal Government. Of course. I should be very happy to see these projects riot merely pay for themselves but contribute net revenues to the Treasury. and thus help to reduce the national deficit.

In the Yakima Valley 2 years ago we celebrated the repayment of the first irrigation project loan in the United States. made on the Teton project. That lcan has been paid off with interest. All the bonds have been paid off. The Federal Government has been paid back every dime it has loaned. and the project has contributed 20 times the loan in taxes and in developments in the project. What we are now considering is a loan. It is not a subsidy. Of course. what the Senator from Illinois says is correct to this extent. that if we build Hells Canyon without Mountain Home it would mean that the revenues from Hells Canyon which would go into a basin account would help pay for all other irrigation projects. Nine hundred dollars is not a great deal of money per acre of irrigated land. In the West there are many pieces of land which are worth more than $900 per acre irrigated. I know many places where I should like to be able to secure land for $900 per acre irrigated. I do not know too much about the Mountain Home project. that is as to the value of the land there.

    "speech": "I may say to the gentleman from Massachusetts there has been a statute on the books for about 10 years. an act authorizing the Civil Service Commission to permit participation in politics on the local level in these area3 immediately adjacent to Washington where there are a great many Federal employees. There is a situation in these adjoining counties where most of the people. probably a majority of them. are Federal employees. Naturally. they are interested in their local school boards. their local mayor and cotsncil. boards of supervisors. and so forth. yet. under the provisions of the Hatch Act they were absolutely restricted from any participation in their local affairs. To remedy that situation. about 10 years ago the Congress passed an act allowing the Civil Service Commission to issue regulations authorizing such participation in local affairs. Pursuant to that the Civil Service Commission issued a regulation authorizing participation provided such participation was not in one of the regular standing political parties. In practice this has worked a great injustice. The socalled Nonpartisan League is in fact a political .party. and Federal employees who want to be members of the Democratic Party or the Republican Party and who do not want to give up their political affiliations and join a party whose principles they do not subscribe to. have to join such a party in order to participate in their local affairs. This amendment simply does this: It still leaves the matter under the control and discretion of the Civil Service Commission to the extent that it allows the Commission to determine whether or not they should participate in local affairs. but it does go on to provide that if the Commission does allow participation. the Commission cannot restrict them as to how they are going to participate nor may the Commission examine the platform or the party plan of the party the individual wants to join to determine whether the Federal officeholder should participate.",

We have raised $82.000.000 from the people of that community over the years to take care of our own floodcontrol program and in 1936 we became a part of the recognized floodcontrol responsibility of the Nation. Since that time we have had complete and agreeable cooperation with the United States Army engineers in all of the projects. We had a committee come back here to meet with the subcommittee and to testify as to our problem. The bill before us provides a sum of money that would take approximately 40 years to complete the project which was estimated by the Army engineers could have been completed in 20 years. We have been at it 13 years now. We can compensate for the difference in the war years. however. under the schedule that the appropriations are being made against authorizations up to the present time. the other floodcontrol projects in the Nation will have been completed in the next 20 years and we in Los Angeles County will be 20 years behind schedule. It is only fair in considering the problems that we are faced with the fact we cannot control the floodwaters in southern California like you can In other parts of the United States because we have no watershed in the mountains. A flash flood there is very dangerous and disastrous. We cannot control them without adequate channel work on the San Gabriel and Los Angeles Rivers. I am asking that the committee give serious consideration to this request as a fair one taking into consideration the amount we are contributing from our own tax funds. We appreciate the amount the subcommittee has recommended but it is not enough to complete our projects in a reasonable length of time. Two of our most important projects are not included in the amount in H. R. 3734. These two projects are Live Oak Wash and San Antonio Canyon project.",

Now. in regard to this amendment. you can do just as you want to do. The Army engineers are now authorized to maintain a water level of 1.830 feet above sea level and the spillways were put in so that the dam will not be higher. If the dam is not higher we will not be drowned out in my city. but if the Army engineers have their way and raise that water level 20 feet they will drown out a city of 10.000 people. they will destroy 90.000 acres of the best land there is in any country. and they will destroy three Irrigation projects that are now in operation. as well as the railroad. If you permit the Army engineers to go on and buy land they do not needand in my judgment they will never need ityou are simply putting the life and the property of the people of that area. containing a population of some 50.000 people. and you are putting the destiny of all those people.

It was a part of the Democratic platform. it was a plank that we carried to the people and upon which we were elected as a part of that program. We went to the people and we said: We are going to install transmission lines carrying power to the farmers. The purpose of this amendment is very simple. What I have asked here in substance is that we continue the program that we started at the beginning of the Eightyfirst Congress to see if we can have something more constructive come out of this session. Last summer I happened to be with the chairman of this committee. the gentleman from Ohio . at the time we visited northern Colorado. The farmers in northern and northeastern Colorado came in pleading with us to give them more power to pump water for their farms. to put water on the soil. and some of the greatest 5minute speeches I ever heard were made by the farm leaders of the rural electrification coops. What I ask here is not appropriations for new work. but that we extend the work that we started in the last session. that we extend the work that we have been carrying on from 2 to 4 years. I have discussed this matter with the gentleman from northern Colorado . He understands what the people are demanding in his district. This is not pork barrel. this money is reimbursable. this money will come back to the Government. It is necessary that this program go forward. I should like to say without impugning the motives of this committee. for they have done excellent work. It is true that after the last Interior appropriation bill went over to the Senate the other body struck some of these items. I am merely asking this body to assume its own responsibility. I note on page 172 of the report there has been an exclusion from the ColoradoBig Thompson project of transmission lines. will the gentleman from Washington be kind enough to tell me why these were excluded?",

My own position has been that these lines are necessary. they are an integral part of the wellestablished policy of this Government to provide transmission lines to bring power from the great reclamation and power dams throughout America. In this same connection I may say that it is also an established policy of this Government that public bodies and REA cooperatives should have first preference in the purchase of public power.

This Keyhole Dam is the result of a compact negotiated between the United States and the two States. ratified by both legislatures. The compact reserved certain water to Wyoming. it reserves to Wyoming all the stock water dams they want. it reserves 10 percent of the water in the dam. The Bureau of Reclamation has spent three quarters of a million on the project so far. The Bureau of Reclamation has a contract with the water users whereby they are to pay for the irrigation storage in the reservoir. but. of course. they are not going to pay for it unless it is completed. There has already been appropriated in the prior 2 years $765.000 plus $1.724.000.

I refer to one item on page 171 of the report. the Folsom power facilities. including switchyards. We passed a law several years ago providing for the transfer of electricity generated at the Folsom Dam to be integrated into the Central Valley project system of transmission lines. and it is very important now while the Folsom Dam is being built that the power facilities be built concurrently with the dam. The civilfunctions bill contains several million dollars for the construction of this great dam. with a storage capacity of 1.000.000 acrefeet. We think that as they are building the dam they should have a plan End the money to carry out the plan which will take the power generated at that great dam and transmit it over to the transmission lines of the Central Valley project. One other Item that I think should have been left in the bill is an item of $300.000 on page 171 of the report. It is referred to as the West Side transmission line. It may be that we do not have to go into the steamplant problem now. but I am convinced that we should have a transmission grid to take care oi the electricity produced at the Shasta Dam and Keswick Dam. It may be that in the future we may be able to integrate that juice with the Pacific Gas & Electric Co.s system and in that way avoid the necessity of building a steam plant by firming up our power with the supply we may be able to get from the private utility.

After a little correspondence I told them I would be forced to take other steps if they could not at least check this case. I received a letter from them that the money had been paid. When I checked into the matter of when the money had been paid it seemed that it had been paid in 1948. after my last letter went to the Department. in which I told them I would not take \"No\" for an answer and that I expected them to give me complete details.",

Of course there is no reason why an agency handling so much of the Governments money should not record its transaction as it goes along.

During World. War II the Commodity Credit Corporation was purchasing raw wool and it was distributed for manufacture into clothing.

The purpose of the amendment is to curtail expenditures for transportation of mails from $400.000.000 to $370.000.000. which would amount to a saving of $30.000.000. I had the privilege to be the chairman of the Subcommittee of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee which held extensive hearings last year on the whole problem of transportation of our mails by railroad. I am convinced as a result of those hearings that our Government is today overpaying the railroads in what amounts to a subsidy of at least $30.000.000an amount. Mr. President. which is conservative in the light of reports in my possession from the General Accounting Office and the Post Office Department. The appropriation bill appropriates $400.000.000 for the transportation of the mails. More than half of this sumnearly $250.000.000is allocated to the transportation of mail by railroad. Postmaster General Donaldson. in hearings before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service last year. stated that the Post Office Department \"used about half of the space we paid for.\" The General Accounting Office checked some of the mail runs. and found that our Government was paying as much as 84 percent additional for unused space and deadhead cars. It found that 22 percent of the money the railroads received from the Post Office Department was received for no services rendered. The Post Office Department has estimated that in 1949 it paid more than $30.000.000 to the railroads for space it did not use. The General Accounting Office. therefore. recommended that the Post Office Department should not pay for empty cars and unused space. Our amendment. Mr. President. once and for all. would correct this gross inequity and would be a significant step in placing the Post Office Department on a businesslike basis. I was much amused to notice an advertisement in the July 1950 issue of Ties. the Southern Railway System magazine. The advertisement. which appeared regularly in the newspapers of towns and cities served by the Southern Railway System. was signed by Mr. Ernest E. Norris. president.

I emphasize the words \"which no private shipper or no other governmental agency assumes.\" I submit that this is a waste of Government funds. Mr. President. In view of the overt evidence of waste of Government funds and in view of the emphasis which has been placed again and again in the Senate on economy. there is no excuse for appropriating an additional $30.000.000 of funds which the General Accounting Office by its own survey has said is unwarranted.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to point out what I think is a typical example of the need for this money. It is not only typical but it is a glaring example as well. In the district I represent the Federal Government owns 280.000 acres of land which was acquired in World War II. At the conclusion of World War II it maintained this land in an inactive status. This large body of land. the fourth largest purchase in the history of the United States. is adjacent to a town with a population of 1.500 people. The nearest city is 38 miles away. They have brought a thousand civilian employees into this camp. They have put 9.000 troops there. and are making preparation for a maximum of over 50.000. Here is this little town with a small schoolhouse faced with this proposition. They telephoned me and asked me: \"What are you going to do about it?\" I referred them to Mr. Cleveland Baileys bill and told them what the Congress would do. I said: \"You can borrow the money to keep the school operating. you can have faith in what Congress is going to do.\" Surely we are not going to break faith with them now. Another factor in that situation: The commanding officer of the camp said. \"You will need to have 15 additional teachers on the job.\" In all conscience we must keep faith with these people and provide the funds necessary. This is not a dreamedup figure that the Bureau of the Budget sent to Congress. it is based on the most careful calculation. based on evidence given to a subcommittee of the Committee on Education and Labor. it is a concrete figure. it is a firm figure. To recklessly cut it in half reflects on my own committee and shows indifference to the problem and not the intelligent approach to it that it deserves. I hope we adopt these amendments and restore these funds to the bill as they should be.",

The testimony we heard and the conditions we saw and the efforts of the educators to give over 300.000 children in these United States a decent education or at least some significant part of an education was tragic. What we have is some 300.000 little kids in this country who are in need of this education. who have no schools at the present time to go to. or in most cases they have only parttime schools. At this time I make this one plea for 300.000 children of this Nation as well as the educators who participate in the almost unbearable situation of trying to provide those kids with an education.

My hat is off to the committee and its members for the work they have done. it has been a wonderful job. The second point is that so many of us from the South have supported this motion that I think the House should be assured that it is no case of sectionalism. it is simply a case of Uncle Sams putting so many training centers and war industries in the salubrious climate and delightful temperatures of the South during the war. and this burden came to us inevitably. The condition cited by the gentleman from Georgia cannot compare with one case in my district. where in 1940 according to the last census we had a total of 503 people in one small community. yet within 60 days after the plants were built there were 27.000 workers employed. not counting their wives and children. So it is absolutely impossible for Childersburg. Ala.. a place that is as fine as they grow but which grew too fast to get along without the aid that this authorization bill provides. We are asking that both of these amendments so eloquently spoken for by the gentleman from Oklahoma be adopted. because we know that there is no other way. Childersburg has 210 more children in grammar grades now than we had during the peak. The war plants are completely shut down. except that they are being kept in a standby situation.",

When you consider that this program that we have put together on a permanent basis this year. really consolidates more permanently what has been done in a temporary way in the past. when you consider that we have spent in other years large sums of moneylast year I believe the amount appropriated was about $17.000.000. now we are going to cut this to $11.500.000it just does not make good sense to me.

The action of the conferees in reducing the $23.000.000 figure to half of that amount. or $11.500.000 plus certain transfers amounting to $4.900.000. will not be sufficient to carry out the intent of Congress in this field.

Not only is this true at Hamilton Air Force Base. where 00 units of Wherry Act housing have been approved. and of the other military installations in the county. but also at small communities like Two Rock. in Sonoma County.

This amount included an appropriation to the Bureau of Community Facilities In accordance with the Wier Act of $7.050.000. With the $11.500.000 which this bill carries and the $.913.000 that is carried in the general apropriation bill there will be available for this purpose $16.500.000. an increase of 33/3 percent. or a little more over what was had before.

He passed away this morning after having a cerebral hemorrhage. Senator Gore served the State of Oklahoma as its first Senator. He came to the United States Senate In 1907 and served with great distinction until 1920. He returned to the United States Senate in 1926 and served until 1932. He was accidentally blinded as a child. Despite this almost insuperable handicap he managed to write a record of great and distinguished service in the political life of his country and in his State. Oklahoma deeply mourns and regrets the death of this truly great and courageous statesman. His sense of humor. his sense of fairness. his courage to face defeat for a principle in which he believed without compromise. sets him apart and sets him forward with the great statesmen who have served the United States of America. Senator Gore was 78 years of age when he passed away at 9:50 a. m. today. I would like to incorporate here excerpts from the Washington Evening Star announcing Senator Gores passing: Thomas Pryor Gore was of the breed that turns handicaps into assets. When he was 8 years old. a stick thrown at a cow by a playmate blinded his left eye. Three years later. accidental discharge of a toy gun destroyed the other eye. For the next 5 years. until he was 16. young Tom Gore was without formal schooling. But during those years he was developing the qualities that served him well through three Senate termsa retentive memory. an independence seldom found in the handicapped and a bright philosophy that penetrated the walls of darkness. Before the darkness closed in Mr. Gore had been a page boy in the State senate of his native Mississippi. It was then the germ of politics was planted. It was nurtured along the way. such as the day when he was 16 orized the name of every Senator. and from that time on he knew by heart every congressional roster.",

I would beat the face off of him.\" Mr. Gore quietly rose and said. \"Mr. Chairman. just blindfold the Senator and lead him around here.\" The laughter that followed almost broke up the meeting.

I hope the appropriate committees will make inquiry to find out if any publicity is being given out which is against the national interest of our country. Further. the press of the country ought to be very careful in using matters they may ascertain which are against the national interest.

I am gratified that such an amendment was adopted by the Committee of the Whole House. During this week. I have commented on the situation facing New England with respect to the loss of its industries to the Southern and Southwestern States. This comment was made in connection with another subject. but it applies equally well in this instance. I believe that a 75cent minimum wage will grant to all workers in interstate commerce only a sufficient amount to make possible the minimum living standard. There should be no reluctance on the part of New England representatives in Congress in voting for this amountas its adoption minimizes to some extent the threat of unfair competition by southern industries. We. in New England. who are accustomed to paying our skilled labor reasonably high wages. must always contend with the beckoning of those industries by southern States which point to their surplus labor pools and the availability of labor at lower wages than are currently paid in New England. This economic threat will be reduced by the imposition of a standard 75cent minimum. and it will. at the same time. aid the South economically by raising the living standards of workers in that area. Although the amendment adopted was not offered by me. I feel that its inclusion in the Lucas bill is a forward step in our Nations economy.",

As I explained to the Senator from South Carolina and certain other members of the committee. I did not receive until that day certain serious allegations in regard to policies of the ExportImport Bank and methods of conducting the affairs of that bank. which caused me to ask for a hearing. So I simply repeat the statement already made. and move to the next point. Under the circumstances of the case. Mr. President. there is no parliamentary procedure in the Senate that would estop the committee from then and there saying to the junior Senator from Oregon. \"The committee will hear you in executive session in advance of asking for a vote on the confirmation of the nominations.\" The reporting of the nominations to the Senate in no way established any parliamentary right or created any parliamentary barrier which prevented the committee from hearing me within the next few days thereafter. in executive session. in regard to these nominations. That is the procedural point I made. I simply say that. in my opinion. the committee. unconsciously. unintentionally. and inadvertently. is guilty of an act of discourtesy to the Senator from Oregon. because under the circumstances I think any Senator. as a matter of parliamentary or senatorial courtesy. should have been heard in accordance with such a reasonable request as I made.",

To finish what I was in the process of saying as to my second major point. the motion for confirmation tonight places the Senator from Oregon in the position where he -must make a choice of whether he should discuss at this time on the floor of the Senate certain matters affecting the policies of the ExportImport Bank. and certain loans which have been granted and certain loans which have been denied by the ExportImport Bank. or to withhold that information and discussion at this time. awaiting an executive hearing before the committee. which could be described as a hearing after the fact. At least that kind of discussion might cause some change in the policies of the Exportimport Bank after the nominations of these men have been confirmed. What the Senator from Oregon intends to do. Mr. President. is to raise certain questions tonight and refrain from a public discussion at this time of certain information which he will raise in the committee. First. the Senator from Oregon will make a motion that these nominations be recommitted to the Committee on Banking and Currency pending a hearing called by the Senator from South Carolina.

The Senator from Wyoming last night emphasized the fact. and I am somewhat inclined to agree with himthe Senate agreed. anywaythat the General Accounting Office should have its full requested appropriation because it had done such a fine job.

After struggling for a long time we were absolutely unable to obtain any agreement. We made proposal after proposal to the House in an effort to solve the difficulty. Finally this language was written out. and after long and careful discussion and bickering back and forth it was agreed to.

I know that the Senator is going to ask. \"What is a fair return?\" We do not spell it out. We naturally expect the Expediter to devise a workable plan under which the owner can be assured that he will receive a fair income from his property. We believe that it can be done. The Senator from Michigan may be interested to know that there was a great deal of argument in favor of the formula which the House had devised. providing for a reasonable return on reasonable value. In that formula no one spelled out what a reasonable return was. No one spelled out what reasonable value was. I think the Senator would be interested to know that in a sampling of 121 or more cases which the Expediter made in approximately 20 different cities. under the fair return formula. the owners would have obtained relief In 56 cases. but considering the same cases under the hardship provision which Is in the law today. 101 owners would have obtained relief. Of the 121 cases. 56 would have obtained relief under the House formula. and about 65 would actually have had to roll rents back.

Any man who is disloyal and is convicted of disloyalty by the loyalty board ought never to be eligible for further Government employment.",

We have here it seems a very plain fact. that the head of the agency could remove anybody by simply labeling him as a bad security risk. How can we. in this country. be talking about freedom and the rights of men and yet give someone the power to destroy a mans employment. not merely for the time being. but to label him for all time as having been a poor security risk? The public generally and other possible employers are not going to draw a fine line between a security risk and a disloyal person. Now. let us think for a moment. in the hope of getting some reason here. The amendment of the gentleman from California is regarded as too extreme by some.

We have about 260 cotton producers in Jack County. Thirtynine of these received less than 5 acres. twentysix of which were new growers. Thirtyfour applications for new growers all received as much as 3.8 acres up to 15.3 acres from reserve of 170 acres set aside for new growers. All new growers were genuine farmers. living on the farm or another one near. Some had not grown cotton in several years. Therefore no history for old farms. Under the amendment Public Law 471. the county was given 595.1 acres with 4k.1 acres by appeal. This justification through the county committee having been compelled to reduce the farmers reported acreage to come within the BAE figures. There are always a few farmers who ask for a new grower cotton allotment and fail to get their acreage planted. This same condition applies on both wheat and peanuts. For instance. last fall we had 10 new grower wheat allotments and only 4 were seeded. We are very largely a cattle country but always have a few who depend on cotton. peanuts and wheat for a cash crop. It seems to our county committee that the cotton allotment law 272 does not do justice to the already diversifying farmer who has already set up a crop rotation system to take care of and build his soil. having already cut his cash crop to the minimum to save the soil. We were talking to a PMA administrative officer from the Texas plains country this week who had gotten a factor of 0.5803 per cropland for his county. While here we got a factor of 0.1248. We could live with a factor of 0.20 or 0.25 of cropland and to bring some of the larger factors back to 0.40 would help a lot of small factored counties.

I do not seen how a unanimousconsent request can be granted for this measure as a whole containing these two titles in the light of the very limited consideration that have been given to it and having regard also to what I think is clearly a situation in which we could certainly take the time necessary to inquire more carefully into the provisions of title I at least.",

I should like to explain the nature of the amendment which is being offered jointly by a bipartisan group of Senators. including the Senator from Vermont . the Senator from Oregon . the Senator from New Hampshire . the Senator from Maine . the Senator from Alabama . the Senator from Minnesota . the Senator from Kentucky . and myself. The amendment amends section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 by adding a new subsection which requires the officers of any labor organization. including the officers of any affiliated national or international labor organization. and the officers of any employer and the officers of any employers association with which the employer is affiliated. to file with the National Labor Relations Board affidavits that they are not members of Communist. Fascist. or totalitarian organizations. as a condition . precedent to resorting to the procedures of the Board. The above requirements also apply to organizations advocating the overthrow -of the Government by force or illegal or unconstitutional methods. We know that most labor organizations are free from Communist or Fascist influences. and. moreover. many provide in their constitutions or bylaws that no person can be an officer or a member if he is affiliated with such organizations. For example. I believe that the constitution of the United Mine Workers of America provides that no one can even be a member of that organization if he is a Communist. Similarly. I believe the constitution of the United Steel Workers provides that no Communist can be an officer of that union. The pending amendment sets forth that if the constitutions or bylaws of labor organizations make such provision. such affidavits will not be required. providedand this is a very important provisothat the National Labor Relations Board is satisfied that the provision is being enforced in good faith. In other words. it would not be possible for an organization merely to make a paper disavowal. merely to say that no Communist or Fascist could be an officer. but it would also be necessary for the organization to enforce that prohibition in good faith. so that a mere paper clause in a constitution would not fully satisfy the requirement. and. as under the present law. the execution of a false affidavit is specifically made a crime. under section 35 (a) of the Criminal Code.",

It would seem to me that that would clearly be grounds for criminal prosecution under section 35 (a). and that the Department of Justice could proceed against them. and. as a matter of fact.

Mr. Lewis refuses to sign the antiCommunist affidavit. stating that It is an insult to him to do so. A simiJar position has been taken by Mr. Philip Murray. the head of the United Steel workers. We all know that Mr. Murray is not a Communist and that he is a very vigorous opponent of communism. The United Steel workers have a clause in their constitution or bylaws that no one can be an officer In that union who is a Communist. and there is every evidence that this law of the United Steel workers is vigorously enforced wherever information is available. Yet Mr. Murray refuses to sign the nonCommunist affidavit because. he says. it is Insulting. To meet that situation. which is not a capricious disregard of law but a conscientious belief on the part of persons like these two men. this clause is put In. so that if the union itself is actually enforcing the antiCommunist prohibition. then that is regarded as meeting the requirements of the act. It would seem to me that on the whole. this is in line with the general principle which we try to follow. that in such matters selfgovernment should be placed in the hands of the unions.

Tuberculosis killed 48.064 people in 1947. while cancer killed 189.811. I do not mean by that that we should not have beds for tuberculosis patients. but I do say that the figures show considerable neglect on the part of all of us respecting this No. 2 killer of our people.

The present salary of a circuit judge is $17.500. and that of a district judge $15.000. When you first glance at the salary you do not get the rest of the picture. as my colleague. the gentleman from New York endeavored to tell you. We have improved the conditions of the Federal court greatly in the last 10 years in that we have provided additional services. I am glad we did that because it makes for efficiency. When you create a Federal judge. do not forget that you have to have a clerk of the district court to service that court Then there are probationary officers. the matter of criers. secretaries. stenographers. reporters. law clerks. and travel expenses and per diem. In addition to that we will have to appropriate money for the Justice Department which. invariably. when we create a new judgeship. asks for additional marshals and United States attorneys. So. I ask that you give very serious consideration when you pass a piece of legislation creating a judgeship. that you take all of these things into consideration. because $23.000.000 servicing 286 district and circuit judges over the country. is a tremendous increase over the appropriation which we have been making for the Federal judiciary not long ago. Although I am a very good friend of the Federal judiciary. and I want the best Federal judiciary in the world. I think in these times of stress we should give some attention to economy in Government. Perhaps some of the judges are needed. Perhaps some of them can be held up.",

I do not think there is any State in the Union where the Federal judiciary is clogged or stymied like it has been for the past 10 years in Indiana. Every member of the Judiciary Committee that I have talked with has stated that this bill asking for an additional judge in Indiana is one that should be granted without opposition. When you compare Indiana with other States of the Union. we should really have two additional judges instead of the one that we are asking for. The United States Judicial Council. after investigation. has recommended that this additional Federal judge for Indiana be granted. The Indiana Bar Association. the Hammond. Ind.. Bar Association. the Gary. Ind.. Bar Association. practically every bar association in the State of Indiana has endorsed this bill. I do not know of any lawyer in the State of Indiana who would oppose an additional Federal judge for Indiana. Of course. I do not say that any other State that has three Federal judges is not entitled to three Federal judges. but when you consider that the State of Indiana has over 4.000.000 population and only two Federal judges. and we have States in this Union with only seven or eight hundred thousand population which have as high as three or four Federal judges.

Indiana is a great State. which has something like 4.000.000 population with only two Federal judges to take care of the Federal business within the confines of that Commonwealth at this time. I notice that Indiana has a lower number of criminal cases in the Federal courts than the national average.

I should like to insert in the RECORD the sections of the law which point this out very clearly. I should also like to state that on August 9. 1949.

Under the 1938 act as amended. the Secretary can proclaim acreage allotments only when marketing quotas are proclaimed for tobacco (see. 321) and cotton (see. 344. as amended by Public Law 372).

    "speech": "There are often times when there are fluctuations in the price. and there are often times when the Commodity Credit Corporation has to make farm loans. Any man who knows anything about agriculture knows that prices do not remain static. When they fluctuate. the market is bolstered. It has fluctuated on rye. corn. wheat. hogs. and milk. a host of commodities. within the last year. It Is my information that there may be some who are afraid the farmer Is getting too rich. If so. let us see how rich the farm people of America are. Last year the average income of all farm people was $905. That included food grown on the farm and eaten in the farm home. It included income earned off the farm. as well as income from farming. It added up to $905. compared with $1.572 for the average person not living on a farm. I ask the Members of the Senate. when we take $905. which Includes the farm produce the farmer and his family consume on his own farm. and compare it with $1.572. the average income of a person off the farm. how can we justify a farmsupport program of less than 90 percent of parity on the basics? Farm people are nearly onefifth of all the people in the United States. and they get a total of less than onetenth of the national income. The question I wish to ask is: Shallwe cut that some more? Let us not fool ourselves. If we maintain a mandatory support level of 90 percent of parity for a few commodities called basic. we will not be doing too much to prevent the disparity of either farm prices or farm Income. It would be a pitifully small thing to do. We would not be doing anything directly at all for the commodities that make up the greater bulk of farm incomethose important products which are not called basic. Of course. it Is my considered judgment that we ouht to have many .more commbdities under mandatory price supports. many .more. I might point out that those that are under mandatory price support of 90 percent of parity. the basics. do not represent the great bulk of American agriculture.",

I charged that the difficulty with the farm storage problem had been maladministration on the part of the Secretary of Agriculture. Today I notice in the paper that Mr. Truman has signed a bill for grain storage and that he is \"dramatically moving to keep one of his most productive farmbelt campaign promises.\" Six things are to be done by the Secretary of Agriculture under this \"dramatic move.\" according to the news release. Three of them could and should have been done prior to the adoption of this bill. The other three things are not necessary. but political moves. First. the three things the Secretary has always had power to do. but now are dramatic moves made 10 minutes after the President signed the bill: 1. He announced distress loans will be made on wheat piled on the ground in the open. He has always had that authority. 2. Announced that government will find suitable emergency storage where it is not feasible to store in the open. He has always had this authority. 3. Called a meeting of manufacturers of onthefarmtype grain storage to make a survey of need. Dramatic move? Now. the three unnecessary moves: The first is to provide for loans to farmers to build wheat storage. Why. wheat farmers are loaning to the Government. The other two provide for acquiring facilities for storage when other facilities are not available. East of the Mississippi are storage facilities for over 100.000.000 bushels of grain. sufficient for this years crop. Can failure to use this space be the dramatic move to create an artificial shortage to prove who is the real friend of the farmer?",

I refer you to the RECORD of February 15. The few of us who had seen the plans for the changes were deeply disturbed. We are still. On last Monday I was in Nashville. Tenn.. giving the commencement address to the graduating classes in medicine. dentistry. and nursing of that extraordinarily fine Negro college of Meharry. In the Tuesday morning Nashville Tennessean I found a column in which this is the description given after saying that only half the job will be done this year so we shall have to be turned out twice: Next year about this same time they hope to evict Congress again and remodel both Chambers into something neat and not quite so gaudy as now. The skylights with the State seals will go. the walls will be paneled in light woods and the Congressmen will work under artificial light. as in a wartime munitions factory. The whole job will cost about $5.000.000. which seems like a high price for a new roof and an exterior decorating job. but a committee of celebrated architects claim the work couldnt be done properly any cheaper. Critics of the enterprise. including a number of Senators who have talked bitterly on the subject. claim the seat of our laws Is going to look something like a cocktail lounge de luxe. I had a long look at the watercolor sketches myself. and I cannot agree. Id say that the place will resemble more than anything else an ultramodern dress salon in a highclass department store. I expressed myself somewhat bitterly in February that we were to lose the beautiful State seals of our present ceiling. and I remind you that as the plans then were we would lose all our daylight and would function under a closed ceiling of some soundproofing construction. with artificial light entirely.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the ECA has many and divergent methods of spending the American taxpayers dollars in its recovery efforts. but I think one of the most interesting proposals concerns foreign budget balancing. May I quote to yor from page 738 of the hearings wherein we find buried in very fine print and contained in a lengthy written statement by ECA. these budgetary proposals. ECA states: Under the bilateral agreements. participating countries are obliged to make all practicable measures to balance their internal budgets. * * * Inadequate controls over governmental expenditures and ineffective and inadequate systems of taxation create unbalanced budgets. thereby contributing to inflation and postponing recovery. Now in order to assist these European countries to balance their budgets and Improve their general government administration. the ECA plans to spend next year the sum of onehalf million United States taxpayers dollars to bring European fiscal experts here to study our methods. At the same time the ECA will spend $800.000 sending our experts to Europe to assist them in these two fields. ECA states that 36.000 mandays will be spent in this program. It seems to me that the only lesson they will learn here is the horrible example of how a budget can remain unbalanced in a period of this Nations highest income level. The fact of the matter Is that we have only balanced our budget once in the last 17 years and are certainly going in the red to the tune of about $2.000.000.000 again this year. Yet we spend an additional half million to bring Europeans here to study our methods and at the same time we go into the red another $800.000 by sending our experts to Europe to teach them budget balancing and efficient government operation. If our Government were operated efficiently and our budgetary system sound. the expenditure could possibly be justified. but In face of our prevailing conditions this proposal hardly makes sense to me.. Let us hope that the Europeams who come here do not take to heart the lessons of our overlapping bureaus and agencies and our army of Federal employees. Let us hope further that they do not seriously consider our lesson of how to run a Government by going further in the hole each day.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the gentlewoman from Ohio made some remarks about remodeling the House Chamber. You will recall that 2 years ago I introduced a bill asking that an electric voting system be placed in the House of Representatives. I know some of the older Members will object to an electric voting system. We have had one in the Capitol Building at Lincoln. Nebr.. for a number of years. and find it a very efficient manner of recording votes. We waste a great deal of time In this House in the matter of voting. I have contacted the Architect of the Capitol on this matter. I think that when we make the plans for remodeling this Chamber they ought to be set up to include not only an electric voting system but provision for broadcasting and television. We ought to anticipate what changes may occur in the next 50 years. When the remodeling is completed in this Chamber. it should meet all the demands that might be anticipated in the next half century. There has been much discussion as to the advisability of broadcasting a part of our procedure. With broadcasting will come television. Times change and the House of Representatives will need to change to meet the demands of modern time. One of these advancements is an electric voting system. The Chamber ought to be wired with that purpose in mind. It ought to be wired for broadcasting and television. There may be other new advancements which might even call for heating the Capitol with the products of atomic energy. I would respectfully suggest that the Architect of the Capitol and the committee in charge of remodeling. keep all of these ideas in mind and anticipate the future needs and demands of those who will occupy this Chamber in the years to come.",

Mr. Speaker. the rule before us. which provides for 2 hours general debate. after which the bill will be taken up under the 5minute rule. being an open rule. makes in order the most constructive. farreaching and beneficial piece of legislation ever enacted in many years. The bill comes from the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. chairmanned by the able gentleman from Illinois . Some of you may recollect that in March 1948. the President of the United States sent to both Houses a message in which he pleaded. urged. and recommended this legislation. But even as far back as 1933 President Roosevelt recommended this legislation. and again urged the Congress In 1939 to take action. and President Truman in 1945 also recommended that legislation be passed. Unfortunately during the last Congress it was not enacted Into law. In this Congress. when the matter was recommended and reported and submitted to the splendid and capable committee. it started hearings. and to my mind It devoted a great deal of its time to considering this Important piece of legislation. In years gone by I have called attention to the fact that there should be unification of the purchasing of all the governmental needs and properties. as well as the disposition of properties. but unfortunately such legislation. notwithstanding that it has also been recommended before. has not received the consideration that it deserves. So. today we have before us a bill that will unify many of these various branches of our Government. It will simplify purchasing. selling procedures and record methods and will tend for economy. It might be stated by some gentlemen on the other side that it does not comply exactly with all of the recommendations of the socalled Hoover Commission that the President appointed. but I am of the opinion that it really complies with most of the provisions. and I have confidence in that great committee that reported this bill that they have embodied in the bill all the worthy and deserving provisions in the interest of economy and the simplification of the activities of the various agencies.",

It seems to me we must move rather quickly now if we are to get the benefits of the Reorganization Act in this session of Congress. because of the 60day limitation. On May 6 the Commission filed Its final report with the Congress and with the President.
