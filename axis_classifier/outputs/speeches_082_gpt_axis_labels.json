Further inquiry has developed that this particular project. under a Dr. Bump. would not be financed out of the appropriation now being considered. Rather. it would be financed out of funds reverting from a permanent indefinite appropriation to aid the States in wildlife development. It also appears that this proviso in its present form may seriously jeopardize some of the work of the Fish and Wildlife Service in connection with migratory birds. by limiting activities in Canada and Mexico. The Senator from Michigan did not Intend to move for the deletion of this proviso. because I believe it has merit in shutting off activities like the Bump expedition. but I hope that in conference the provision may be modified so as not to apply to any essential activities in Central and North America. and I am sure that can be worked out.",

For one thing. the committee has made a substantial reduction from the budget figure. However.

It is a new appropriation. and it is one without express authorization in law. which made it subject to a point of order In the House. Also. I should like to invite the chairmans particular attention to the fact that this appropriation. on page 38. line 9. Is \"in addition to current local revenues.\" As I understand. those local revenues are relatively modest. amounting to something like $250.000 a year. However. I have noted in the hearings that those local revenues are not accounted for separately and are commingled with this appropriation. Would the chairman of the committee agree with me that particularly since we are here starting a new administrative program this commingling of local revenues was undesirable? Is it not possible that we could inform the High Commissioner of the trust territories that these revenues should be kept separate for accounting purposes and perhaps earmarked for some specific purpose?

President Truman issued the following statement: India has an urgent need for grain to prevent suffering and starvation. This I pointed out in my message of February 12 to the Congress. My views have not changed. We can. at some sacrifice. spare the grain. We should do sofirst. to save human lives. and secondly. to strengthen freedom and democracy in an important area of Asia. Moreover. we should provide the first million tons promptly as a grant. We can then explore in greater detail the situation with respect to the remaining million tons. India must have 6.000.000 tons of grain in order to meet the famine conditions caused by severe drought. India has made arrangements to buy 4.000.000 tons through ordinary sources. including United States suppliers. To pay for the additional 2.000.000 tons of grain would place too great a strain on the financial resources of India and would prevent the carrying out of its essential development program. In addition. with the provision of grain to India as a grant. the Indian Government will deposit the local currency coming from the distribution of the grain to the Indian people into a special account which can be used for agricultural development projects in India agreed to by us. These projects will help alleviate the recurrence of such conditions as the present. The House Foreign Affairs Committee carefully investigated this matter and on March 5 favorably reported a bill to provide the grain to India. This bill has bipartisan support. It reflects the desire of the American people to help the Indian people in their present emergency. Prompt action is vital. The monsoon season occurs in India during the summer. Many roads are then made impassable and grain shipments to remote areas are greatly impaired. Each days delay after April 1 in starting shipments will leave a serious gap in Indias food supply later this summer and ca.use great suffering.

I asked him about the harmful effects of gambling in breaking up homes. in causing heartache and heartbreak in countless families. The gambler replietd in an answr that tried to put gambling in the same category with investing in the stock market. This is not unusual. in that innumerable members of the gambling fraternity have on many occasions attempted to draw a cloak over their activity and liken it to totally different investments by millions of Americans in stocks and bonds. Actually. any such attempt at a comparison is. I believe. unwarranted. Investments in stocks and bonds plays a constructive role in our freeenterprise system in that capital is furnished to American industry to expand. to create jobs. to move forward the wheels of progress. On the other hand. gambling on horses or on the roll of dice or on any other such basis performs no constructive function in society whatsoever. The return from such gambling helps build up organized narcotics sales. prostitution. extortion. and all sorts of other vices. The bettor himself cannot win. the odds are hopelessly against him. To be sure. same element of risk is involved in both gambling and in investment in the market. but there the similarity ends. and actually the science of sound investment has reached such development that individuals can. with relative confidence. invest their savings in corporations which have outstanding records of divide _d returns. and take a minimum of risk. subject. of course. to minimum economic fluctuations in our system.

There is no doubt about it that a nation is better off in any kind of a fight when it has allies. when it is joined by people who have a common cause. so that it will not have to do all the fighting and dying by itself. In World War I the Allies did not begin to win until they had set up an international force. One of the reasons why we were successful in World War II was that we constituted an international force. an integrated force. It was a good thing to do.

I do not want any outside commission to write a plan to bring to the Committee on Armed Services. I want the Committee on Armed Services to write their own plan. Mr. Chairman. I believe the Committee on Armed Services has some of the most intelligent men on military affairs in the United States. I do not believe there are 29 members of the Armed Forces who know more about the armed services of the United States than the 29 members of the House committee. I have the highest respect for them. I know they have been giving a great deal of study to the subject of universal military training. If we want to set up a commission they should make recommendations and then let the Committee on Armed Services write the plan that you and I are to vote for or vote against. In so doing. the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services has the same thought in mind as I have. We just disagree in that he wants a commission to write a plan and I want the Congress to do the legislating.",

That is a power which is delegated to the Congress of the United States. as set out by the Constitution of the United States. My amendment provides for the Commission to make a report on or before January 15. 1952. to the Committee on Armed Services. then the Congress would consider the committee recommendations. In that way we do not delegate our power to any commission of three or five men. but we take the responsibility right here.

It further provides that not to exceed 100 may be compensated at rates higher than grade 15. which means from $11.500 to $14.000. and 25 not in excess of $15.000 per annum.

These people say they will hire employees under the Civil Service Act but \"we will put in a few more at a higher salary.\" Then they tell you they are unable to secure persons qualified for some particular job. and therefore they have to go aboveceiling salaries. The number here is 100. Rather than strike the whole thing out. I have offered a compromise. so that with respect to the 10 instead of 25 they will get as high as $15.000. and with respect to the remainder. which I have cut down to 60and this is mildthey would get somewhere between $11.000 and $14.000.

It will be a tremendous step toward cutting back on the intolerable burden of nonessential Government employment. I want to stress just one thing more. This is the first appropriation bill for 1952. What we do here on this bill is going to create the precedent and set the pattern for our action on the 1952 budget. I am absolutely confident the people of this country are looking to us to reduce the overload of Federal employees provided for in the budget for 1952 by at least 10 percent. That is the purpose and effect of this amendment. We should not miss this opportunity to set the pace for consideration of the whole 1952 budget. I yield the floor.",

We who have been associated with him here for many years know that the Senator from Tennessee. chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. is recognized for his devotion. his loyalty. and his patriotism. It was unnecessary for him to explain his vote. but the Senator from Tennessee conscientiously thought the cut should have been 10 percent and there was not a single member who would even dare have in mind the questioning of his motives or of his integrity in coming to that decision. The other members of the full committee and of the subcommittee decided that possibly a 10percent cut would be a little too drastic. We know that this body has a right to overrule the subcommittee. or to overrule the full committee. and the question is clear as to the issue upon which the Senate is to vote. The committee has recommended a cut of 5 percent in the money items for personal services. The amendment of the Senator from Michigan. of which my good friend from Tennessee approves. is to the effect that the cut should be 10 percent instead of 5 percent. So the issue is clear. I believe that the proponent of the 5percent cut would desire. as I understand. during the afternoon. to explain the position which he took in favor of tfle 5percent cut. But. after that. and notwithstanding that. I might have to oppose the position of the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Tennessee. It would be one of the few times that I know of that I have ever taken a position contrary to that of the Senator from Tennessee. I should like to have the Senate come to a conclusion.

R. That section. as it was reported by the Senate committee. provides that in any case where the Secretary of Agriculture determines and reports to the President and to the Tariff Commission that an emergency condition exists with regard to a perishable agricultural commodity. the Tariff Commission shall make an immediate investigation under section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. or under section 7the escapeclause procedureof H.

The President may also take action under section 8. without waiting for Tariff Commission recommendations. if In his judgment the emergency requires such action. However. Mr. President. neither In section 8which specifically refers to perishable agricultural commoditiesnor in any other section of the reciprocal trade agreements extension legislation. is action by the President made mandatory. when imports threaten domestic production and interfere with pricesupport and conservation programs.

We shall all miss him. not only for his kindly and friendly self. but for his sage counsel and wisdom. In his more than fourscore years. CHARLES AUBREY EATON has devoted himself wholly to public service. He has lived many lives in one. all of them outstanding for his unselfish dedication and untiring efforts in behalf of his fellowmen. When Dr. EATON came to the House of Representatives in March 1925. he had already had a distinguished career in the pulpit. He brought with him to the House a rare depth of understanding of human problems that provided a broad foundation for his new career of public service. Among the qualities for which we all love \"Doc\" EATON. and which have helped to make him a truly great man as well as a brilliant legislator. are his innate sense of fairness and his constant desire to help others. These basic qualities were emphasized during his chairmanship of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Those who have worked with Dr. EATON as we in this House have. have all come to hold him in affectionate esteem and admiration. His selfeffacing modesty is as strong a characteristic as is his desire to get the right things done the right way. This has caused him to be described as \"one of the most important and leastpublicized men now in public life. A brilliant legislator. still strong and subtle at 80. he gets resuitsand lets the credit go.\" Well. Mr. Speaker. dear old \"Doc\" EATON can let the credit go. He is too great a man to be concerned with it. Nevertheless. in the minds and hearts of all who have been privileged to serve and work with him. he shall always have our love. our esteem and our good will.

These amendments to the supplemental appropriations bill call for an increased appropriation for the Office of Education. It strikes me as being only fair. just. and equitable that the Federal Government should contribute a reasonable amount to the schools which are now overcrowded. and are increasingly becoming more overcrowded. by children whose parents are military personnel or are otherwise employed by the Federal Government. In my opinion. this is not a local problem but a national one. Uncle Sam steps in and takes over a piece of property. thereby removing it from the tax rolls. and it is not fair that the increased school enrollment caused by the Government people moving in should be fully and completely borne by the local taxpayers. For instance. in my district. the Hillsborough County school system is very overcrowded by reason of the great number of children from MacDill Field. Tampa. The local school authorities from Tampa have advised me that it will cost the local taxpayers thousands of dollarsover $50.000 as a very minimum. above the funds already availableto carry on the routine costs of teaching these youngsters from MacDill Field alone. This illustrates how important it is that the Federal Government bear a part of the burden brought about by the military operations there. This cannot be honestly called an aid to Federal education. It is actually a fulfillment of a moral obligation of the Government as set forth in Public Law 847 of the Eightyfirst Congress. Rather than a Federal aid to education. it could more properly be termed a measure to prevent Federal damage to education. I want it thoroughly Understood that there is no possible chance of any Federal control of the handling or the expenditures of these funds. insofar as the policies of the schools are concerned. The policies would still be in the hands of the local school authorities. This same supplemental appropriation bill calls for some $190.000.000 for our point 4 program and some $4.000.000.000 for our foreign aid or Mutual Security Program. It is my opinion that there is nothing more important to the welfare of our defense efforts than the education of our children.

Unless we provide the funds in this bill. districts which have been compelled to expand school facilities far beyond normal needs to take care of children channeled into their systems because of Federal operations in their areas. will be under a severe handicap. I have had firsthand knowledge and experience regarding Federal impact on local school systems. Four or five districts in Madison and St. Clair Counties in Illinois have been forced to construct new buildings and to expand facilities to take care of a great influx of children because of defense programs. The districts affected normally would not have their present heavy load which creates financial problems they cannot solve without Federal assistance.

You could look out from the front door of the administration building and see nothing but three or four farm houses. Today that same area is a solid city with a great war production manufacturing plant within about two blocks of the school itself. mostly of Federal housing. So I know what I am talking about. both as to the crowded condition of the schools and of the restricted tax base. In my State of Arizona there is a bond debt limit for school districts. The school districts cannot go beyond that limit.

There are two of these Federal impact school districts in my congressional district. For instance. you have all heard about Lustron. That expensive and tragic experiment. I regret to say. took place in my district in a factory that had been making aircraft. When Lustron died. unwept and unsung. the Navy took title to the factory and put North American Aircraft in there to make airplanes for the national defense. The employees poured in and the children poured into Jefferson local school district. Taking that plant off the tax duplicate cut off about 40 percent of the tax resources of that district. Only a few years ago this school district built a new school. bonding itself almost to the limit under Ohio laws. Childreih from nearby Federal installations promptly filled up the school. but even under these two laws nothing was allowed to help pay for the bonds. even though the Government would have had to provide construction money if the school had not been built by the local district. Now. that new school is full and overflowing and the district cannot issue bonds within the statutory limit for the necessary additional construction.

My theory is that the American producer is entitled primarily to the American market. That does not mean that we should build barriers. It does mean that we must think in terms of employment of our people. Where are we to get the tax money with which to operate the Government? How are we to carry on in general if we are to take from the American producer the market which is his? That question applies to manufacturing. it applies to farming. it applies to fishing. it applies generally. Because of our high standard of living. naturally. in terms of cost production. our products. except in a few unusual cases. cost more to produce than similar products can be produced abroad. As I have said. we must think in terms of keeping our people employed. There seems to be an issue. and I should like to ask the Senator from Maryland a few questions. The Senator from Maryland stated that a tariff of 3 cents a pound would put the industry in the East out of business. It seems to me that that is a conclusion.

Foreign cheese was being precipitated upon the American market. to be sold in competition with the American product. of which Wisconsin produces between 45 and 50 percent. As a result many .of our producers were simply wiped out. Now there is a little fight between the east coast and the west coast. It depends upon whose ox is gored. I say that we must discuss this subject from the standpoint of principle. Primarily the American producer is entitled to the American market. Of course. the free traders would like to flood the American market with cheap goods and throw our people out of employment. As a result. tax returns would go down and recession and depression would follow. We cannot afford such a situation in the present state of affairs. with the Government needing more than $70.000.000.000 a year in order to operate. So I would like to have definite figures. first. on the question of whether or not a tariff of 3 cents a pound could injure or would injure the industry on the east coast. It seems to me that tariff rates. should be provided to cover the differential. the cost of production between here and abroad in such a way as not to put out of business those who are engaged in the tuna industry. That is a very important consideration. I will say to the Senator from Maryland. with respect to how I shall vote. As I said. I am not a member of the committee and I did not hear the testimony.

There Is always sufficient interest on the part of some of us in Interior and Insular Affairs to keep the committee busy at its last meeting. Mr. President. as I see it. this Is a very simple problem. The tariff rates on tuna and the reciprocal trade agreements affecting it were all enacted in the 1930s. At that time those who exported tuna to the United Statesand Japan was the greatest exporter to the United States of tunapacked their tuna in oil and in other ways. They did not have the knowhow to freeze tuna. nor did they have reefers--refrigerated shipsin which to bring in fresh tuna. The development with respect to shipping frozen and fresh tuna came about since the passage of the original laws. Had the development occurred prior to the enactment of the original laws undoubtedly some sort of protection would have been provided. either by way of a reciprocal trade agreement or by a provision in the original act. I cannot conceive. following the primary objective stated by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin . and having consideration for the American industry. that we would allow imports completely free from duty. We have not done any business with Japan for almost 11 or 12 years. Since then the Japanese exporters of tuna have obtained the knowhow. mainly from the United States. as to how to freeze tuna. and how to bring in fresh tuna in reefers. Therefore. Mr. President. we are confronted with a new situation.

The bill would establish a temporary. reasonable. and I think very low tariff on the tuna which is imported. in order to keep the market stabilized during an 8month period. The canners in Maryland are taking advantage of the situation. and rightly so. But. I may say to the Senator from Maryland that their honeymoon will continue for only another 6 or 7 months in any event. because as soon as a reciprocal trade agreement is entered into with Japanand such an agreement is now in process of negotiationthere will be established quotas. allotments. or a tariff on fresh and frozen tuna. I held many hearings in Japan about a year ago. Even the Japanese expect that they cannot continue forever the tuna business as it is now.

Then $100.000.000 was specifically added for Spain. which resulted in a net reduction of $274.000.000 in the House figures. The Senate also added an amendment concerning Morocco.

It can accept the contract itself as security for the loan. That is vitally important to small business. We saw fit.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to refer briefly to the inquiry and statement of the Senator from Vermont. Following that. I think a motion should be made to recommit this bill. for various reasons. I think certainly and obviously the debate has had a confusing effect on the part of sponsors of the Byrd bill. I also think that by reason of other commitments. many Members of the Senate were unable to hear the discussion and they should have an opportunity to think over the action they took today. I believe this bill ought to be recommitted to the committee. in order that the full membership of the Senate may give it attention. I think it quite evident that there is a great difference of opinion as to the effect of the action just taken by the Senate. First. I should like to call the attention of the Senator from Vermont to the figures to which I referred a moment ago. I have the figures. I may say. regarding the loans authorized for the fiscal year 1951. and the loans outstanding on June 30. 1951. both by States and by areas. that is. the New England. Middle Atlantic. South Atlantic and EastNorthCentral States. I think the statement made by the Senator left an implication that Arkansas and one or two other States had most of the loans. That is quite erroneous. Let us. for example. consider the New England area. There were in that area 136 loans. with $45.143.000 authorized. in fiscal 1951. Let us compare that with the Middle Atlantic area. for example. in which there were 178 loans. with but $14.236.000 authorized in 1951. We come next to the WestSouthCentral area. including. of course. the State of Texas. which I think is slightly larger than the State of Vermont. In that State there were 241 loans. with a total of $59.845.000. In my own State of Arkansas there were 128 loans. with a total of $3.154.000. which is not out of proportion. let us say. to loans made in the State of New Hampshire. After all. Arkansas is perhaps four times as large as the State of New Hampshire.",

Though not informed as to the expansion and growth of industry within the State of New Hampshire. my guess would be that the applications for loans in that S ate are not out of proportion to the loans authorized elsewhere. In other words. the probability is that the people of New Hampshire have not had the same need for loans that some of the more rapidly growing States have had. However. I may say that I have never before heard the idea expressed that there might be a discrimination based upon geographical location. I do not think these figures would bear that out.",

Last year we debated the question of sending land troops. If there is a division of our troops in f(ermany and the Russians attack. the troops are there and cannot get away and we are necessarily involved in war. If the Russians should attack in Germany and our troops are in England. they can get away. It would not necessarily involve us in war. I think we must recognize that the President does have certain rights to send troops. The limitation is that only Congress can declare war. I think he cannot do things that would necessarily involve us in war. So it seems to me that some word like \"necersarily\" ought to be in the resolution.

That is what they said at the time the debate was proceeding. Those in charge of the treaty told me that my reservations were not needed at that time. because everything was taken care of. and Congress would have its full power. They were apparently following the precedent of the 1945 United Nations Participation Act. In that law it was provided that the President would have the right to negotiate special agreements with the United Nations to provide for a United Nations police force. which this country would join in supplying. to keep the peace of the world. The proponents said those special agreements would be brought to the Congress and for approval by the Congress. That was the law of 1945. They said no troops not so provided for would be used or sent by the President into any of the areas being discussed. The President wrote a letter addressed to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations in which he agreed with that procedure. But apparently he has now changed his mind.

But it is contended by the other side that when article 5 says that \"the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\" it is then made similar to an attack on the United States. when the constitutional process of going to war is the Presidential action. and Congress has nothing to say about it. It is admitted that if another nation attacks the United States. the President may make war without a declaration of war by Congress. The doubt which has arisen never was cleared up in the debate on the Atlantic Pact. so far as I can remember.

Labor could be stabilized by means of legislation which would take care of American labcr first and which would provide working conditions under which an American could work in keeping with our standards. We love to brag about our standards of living. They are grand. and it is important and necessary that we keep them up. We cannot keep up American standards of living on 70 cents a day. It cannot be done here or elsewhere. At any rate. the American Farm Bureau Federation. through its President. sent a telegram approving Senate bill 984.

Mexico. where growers from the United States picked out workers whom they wanted to hire under contract. Hermosillo. Mexico. is south of the border from Nogales. Ariz. It is within the state of Sonora. in the Republic of Mexico. The scene was far from pleasant to read about. Look magazine In Its March 27th issue had a picture and text article portraying In unforgettable terms the sad dilemma of these people. In its April 9 issue Time magazine dealt with the problem. and Newsweek in its April 16 issue ran an article about the \"Woeful Wetbacks.\" The Washington Post carried an editorial on April 9 deploring \"the influx of aliens willing to work for wages that are indecently low according to American standards.\" That is one of the issues. The editorial concluded: We agree with the Commission that our efforts in the future should be directed toward increasing the number of our own farm workers and eliminating dependence on foreign labor. What is wrong with that? Let me say to my good friend from Nebraska that I inquired from Mr. Goodwin. of the Employment Service. as to the situation in this field. The Employment Service has not even scratched the surface. We appropriated millions of dollars for that particular service. It has not scratched the surface of the resources of American labor. But still they are willing to employ labor from outside. and are anxious to come before the subcommittee which I happen to head. a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. for money to investigate foreign labor.

It involves several minor changes in the tax laws of the District. principally with respect to the amount of interest charged on delinquent taxes. and outside of those minor changes in the tax law. it relates largely to the office of the Board of Tax Appeals for the District. The Board of Tax Appeals under the reorganization bill. which went into effect in the District yesterday. as a matter of fact. is abolished. It is anticipated that in the absence of this legislation. the District Commissioners would set up another board which would be appointed. and be under the domination of the District Commissioners. The fact is that the Board of Tax Appeals is really a court which decides the rights as between the District Commissioners and the citizens in the matter of the payment of his taxes. Therefore. it would not be exactly fair for that Board to be under the domination of one party to the controversy with respect to the payment of taxes. So the committee has devised an amendment which is printed in the bill. which would set the Board of Tax Appeals up as a court. as an independent body independent of the District Commissioners who are a party to all litigation that comes before the court. Does that explanation sufficiently explain the bill?",

It is my understanding that Mr. Joseph Morgan. a very able lawyer. who was formerly president of the District of Columbia Bar Association will be judge of the Tax Court on the adoption of this law. I might say further that one of the concerns which we have had in the setting up of this legislation is that we have been confronted with the recent Reorganization Act which went into effect at midnight last night as affecting the reorganization of the Government of the District of Columbia.

If we pass the substitute amendment. we will get ourselves in the very awkward position of having to approve every administrative act that is involved in this particular matter. The Committee on Armed Services operates under a referral proposition. which is more similar to the proposition of the gentleman from Michigan than that of the gentlewoman from Illinois . It is not exactly consistent with either. I believe that the language in the case of realestate transactions which come back to the Committee on Armed Services. requires that the Department of Defense come into agreement with the Committee on Armed Services. Now. that avoids the necessity for the Committee on Armed Services to take a definite position either approving or disapproving. In these matters which are submitted to the the committee. the committee has an opportunity to examine them before action is taken. If the committee does not act upon them. then I think it is proper to presume at least that the committee will interpose no objection. If that opportunity is given the committee. it seems to me that is just as far as there is any necessity for going. Personally.

I would like to call your attention to the laws that might be affected in regard to defense activities.

In the marking up of this item of this bill. every single member of the subcommittee present. both majority and minority was in agreement with the exception of the gentleman from Ohio who now offers the amendment to cut the appropriation to $70.000.000. The gentleman from Ohio. the gentleman from New York . and others who have spoken in support of the pending amendment have been opposed to having any Voice of America for a long time past. I say to you definitely that if you adopt this amendment the radio broadcasting and the overseas missions of the Voice of America would have to be curtailed below the minimum program level considered essential by your committee. The six new languages approved by the committee could not be added to the broadcasting schedule. We would be cutting our radio broadcasts to Russia below the minimum requirement of 3 hours daily. or our 11/2 hours to the European satellites. or our halfhour programs to such vital countries as India. Malaya. Indonesia. and Thailand. We must not allow our staffs overseas to fall below the present ratio of one American for every million and a half persons of the free world. The Kremlin has one propagandist for every 660 people in the world. If the $70.000.000 proposal is accepted. it will mean that Russias expenditure of over a billion dollars a year. not counting the money spent by the satellites and the native Communist parties. will give her a 15 to 1 firepower advantage over us. May I point out to you further that if you adopt this amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio it would be possible to produce only one motionpicture program about every 6 weeks.

The gentleman from California has offered an amendment which has been reported by the Clerk. The gentleman from New York has made a point of order against the amendment on the ground that it is not a proper limitation on an appropriation bill. The Chair has examined the amendment with some degree of care. and would invite attention to the fact that it provides: None of the money appropriated in title I of this act shall be paid to the head of any executive department who. within a period of 5 years preceding his appointment. was a partner in. or a member of a professional firm which derived any part of its income from representing. or acting for a foreign government. or who. acting as an individual. derived income from such representation. It should be clear that almost any limitation must necessarily require some action on the part of somebody. One of the classic illustrations given on many occasions by the distinguished parliamentarian to whom the Chair made reference a few moments ago. Hon. James R. Mann. of Illinois. was that if a provision states that \"no part of this appropriation shall be paid to a redheaded man.\" somebody will have to find that redheaded man and determine whether his hair is red. therefore. it would appear that in any instance where a limitation is sought to be imposed there must be some activity contemplated or some effort exerted by somebody to carry out the provisions of the limitation. The Chair would invite attention to section 1593 of Cannons Precedents. and reads the syllabus: A provision that no part of an appropriation be used for payment of any employee not appointed through the civil service was held to be a limitation and in order on an appropriation bill. That decision was on December 8. The Chair is of the opinion that that decision is applicable to the pending question raised by the point of order made by the gentleman from New York. It would appear that the overall and controlling element of the pending amendment is a limitation on an appropriation bill. It is entirely negative in character. and does not affirmatively impose any additional duties upon anybody. Therefore the Chair overrules the point of order.",

No objection at all would be made to that. because I think the State Department has much to learn about Michigan. particularly in view of the way the State Department treated Michigan in the case of the copper situation. when the State Department refused to allow the industries of Michigan to buy 3.000 tons of copper which. if purchased. would have permitted approximately 50.000 persons to continue at work. By means of the International Materials Conference. the State Department has exercised a cartel against the workers in Michigan. So we would like to have a representative of the State Department come to Michigan. Probably Michigan is a foreign land. so far as the State Department is concerned. However. I believe it should be pointed out that there already are in Michigan many agencies and representatives of the Federal Government. For instance. the Detroit directory lists approximately 200 telephones for various agencies of the Federal Government. If members of the Foreign Service wish to learn something about operations in Michigan. it would be wise for them to study some of the operations which are not purely political. If they would come to Michigan. even for a vacation. or if they would come to Michigan as representatives of some of the other agencies of the Federal Government. such as the Department of Commerce. the Department of the Interior. the Department of Justice. or various other agencies. they would be able to ascertain what is going on in the business life of Michigan and in the business life of the Nation as a whole. As the Senator from California has indicated. if the Foreign Service officers went to the various States on the basis of such an arrangement. they would learn a great deal about the Nation as a whole. On the other hand. I believe they would obtain less knowledge if they simply went to the Governors offices. It seems to me the Foreign Service officers would learn more about American life if they studied other activities in Michigan. rather than if they confined their studies to the office of the Governor.",

I do not claim to be able to follow that line of reasoning. For months this country has allowed the Socialists of Britain and the Communists of France by direct or indirect means to prevent the utilization of Spains resources as an ally. It has been one of the crowning examples of weak diplomacy on the part of the United States. Every military man has recognized the fallacy of this course. They knew that American GIs might one day have to take the place of available Spanish troops in Europes defense. Spain has probably been the greatest example of allied failure to utilize troops where they are available. Spains troops are organized. they are at least as well trained and equipped as most of the other continental troops we are dealing with. They offer us what may be the last bastion which may be held in Europe at this time. Obviously an armed Spain acting jointly with other nations would be a bolster to nonCommunist forces in other parts of Europe.

The committee amendment was offered In committee by the gentleman from Virginia . It is not all that some members of the committee wanted. but I feel it is fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the problem which we are now confronted with. The committee bill limits OPS to the one rollback of May 20. The second rollback. due August. and the third. due October 1. would not become operative. The committee amendment simply provides that no ceiling on any agricultural product shall be established or maintained at less than 90 percent of the price prevailing on May 19. 1951. Let me explain. The parity concept is not disturbed. The parity floor would remain intact. If any commodity was below parity on May 19. it would be free to rise to parity. The formula in the bill would not apply. The amendment would only apply to those products above parity on May 19. 1951. These commodities would be free to rise to parity. The formula in the bill would not apply. The amendment would only apply to those products above parity on May 19. At this time. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Cox] on the amendment he offered a few minutes before the Committee rose yesterday afternoon. While I cannot support the position he takes. he is on sound ground when he says that if it is wrong to allow rollbacks on agriculture products. it is wrong to allow rollbacks on all industrial products. There is no equality in sacrifice in the amendment offered by my colleague from North Carolina. I am for our great farm programs. and have and will continue to championthe needs of our rural people.

From 1947 to 1950 it was dollar for dollar. for 1951 through 1955 it is to be 11/2 to 1. after 1955 it is to be 3 to 1. Notwithstanding the shift as it was set up by the Congress to the States. the Federal contribution has remained the same. we have kept it up. So through additional contributions the total amount should be increased. Not only Is that true. but the amendment which I offered. and which was adopted. permits a saving of section 32 funds for the handling of surpluses which makes many million of dollars more available in commodities than we have had the last 2 or 3 years. Now. the sky is the limit as to what we would like to do with such a worth while program. but the question is: How much can we do? Mr. H. CARL ANDERSEN. Furthermore. the Secretary of Agriculture. at my request and insistence. and also at that of the gentleman from Mississippi and the gentleman from Washington . put into operation in March and April a program for purchasing certain pork products and shell eggs to the extent of about $25.000.000. and furthermore at our suggestion. this has been poured into the school lunch program in addition to the $84.000.000 that we contributed in the regular appropriation bill. By that program we helped our hog and egg prices go up nearer parity for the producer and at the same time helped the school children of America. Mr. Chairman. this amendment comes out of the clear sky and has not been submitted to either the gentlemen from Mississippi or myself. Certainly it appears to me to be very much out of place. and I hope it is defeated. I repeat. no request by the Department of Agriculture has come to us for these additional millions of dollars.",

I rise to call attention to an item that appears on page 43 of this bill in the amount of $6.489.954 that you have agreed to pay as claims allowed by the Motor Carriers Claims Commission to certain motor carriers because they were taken over by the Government during a period from August 11. 1944. to October 4. 1945. Being a period of less than 14 months. It appears the reason for taking over these carriers was to prevent a stoppage by strike during the war. After a wage settlement was made the Government stepped out of the business. I am informed that the taking over of the property was a formal one under Executive order. The lines were run as they had done before. There were a few managers in uniform and certain additional accountings were required. Mr. Chairman. I realize it is late now to call attention to these matters. This bill has been filed only 3 days. There is little. if any. testimony before the committee on these items. I call attention to this matter because the total in the item is a good sized one. Furthermore there is dissenting opinion filed on each of the several claims filed hereunder. These opinions are filed by one of the three Commissioners. Hon. Randolph Carpenter. He is a former Member of this House and an able lawyer. Another reason why this matter should be called to the attention of Congress is these claims amounting to millions of dollars are chargeable against the Government. does it not raise a question of claims being filed by other transportation companies where such company operations are taken over because of a threat of strikes. or for other reasons. Then. what about the taking over of the steel industry because of dispute between the employer and employees. In any event. I deem it worth while to call these matters to your attention. Mr. Randolphs opinion on one of these claims is included herewith. The other opinions are similar. In this particular case the amount allowed was $149.921.47. The findings of the Commission in this case are by no means complete. In my opinion. based upon the record. the following findings of fact should be made in this case.",

These funds have now been accumulating for several years and involve hundreds of millions of dollars. In most instances these foreign currencies are being made available to agencies without the approval of the Congress. This provision would place control in the hands of the Congress through annual appropriations. Agencies of the Government having need for currencies of foreign countries would advise the Congress as to the amount and purposes for which the need appeared. The Congress would then appropriate dollars for the purchase of foreign currencies standing to our credit in the United States Treasury. It is anticipated that considerable savings will result from the congressional control established by this provision. The provision is effective after the fiscal year 1953 so the regular budget for fiscal year 1954 will carry in dollars the estimated foreign currency needs of agencies operated abroad. Unless appropriated for the purchase of these currencies. they would go back to the United States Treasury.

When we entered the conference we had no bill that had any substantial merit. When we came back I think we have a bill that will at least subserve the purpose for which it is enacted until its expiration. The bill as it left the House had in it the Talle amendment. The Talle amendment provided that where commodities were below ceiling for a period of 3 months they would automatically be decontrolled and they could not be recontrolled until they were in short supply. That short supply would have to be evidenced by the fact that they were rationed at the retail level or were allocated. Of course. that meant that when commodities were decontrolled they would never be recontrolled because I am sure that no President would ever again ration at the retail level or allocate commodities in general use by the public. That amendment adroitly prepared a trap for the President to accomplish his own undoing. It was thoughtfully initiated and skillfully prepared. That amendment is out of the bill. and I think the bill as it comes back here will serve the purpose for which it was enacted. I think if we are going to have price control. wage control or rent control it is obvious that we ought to have an effective bill. I do not think this bill will be very effective. but it is a bill that will keep the machinery alive and can be used if a great emergency should come upon us. It certainly would be ill advised at this time to destroy price control and wage control and the machinery that provides for it in the light of the present conditions of world affairs and the present uncertainty of our future. We have made some changes in the bill that are material. The Cole amendment provided for individual adjustment of dollars and cents ceiling on commodities. That. we felt. could not be accomplished.

Personally I think that was a mistake to tell the President what he should do to accomplish the purposes that were solely within the province of the Executive. If the House of Representatives will persist in invading the jurisdiction of the President. what argument will it have when its own jurisdiction is invaded. This is a subversive amendment that all those who love the fundamental principles of the Constitution as I do. should oppose. The provision with reference to rents was changed very materially from either the House or the Senate bill. The Senate bill provided that the control of rents would expire on February 28. as I remember it. The House bill provided that they would expire on June 30. The conferees reconciled those differences by providing that rent control would expire on September 30. However. there is a provision in the conference report that rent control in all areas except critical defense areas will expire on Septemler 30. unless the local regulatory body acts affirmatively and provides that they shall continue. In other words. although rent control may continue in the defense areas. in other areas of the United States it will expire on September 30 unless there is affirmative action by the local regulatory board. I know this will not meet the approval of some of our colleagues who felt that we ought to have a strong rentcontrol law. but if you do not agree to the provisions of the conference report you will have no rentcontrol law.

I want the RECORD to show at this point that this bill fails to rectify a senseless provision of the basic law whereby a railroad pensioner. to qualify for compensation. must quit his present nonrailroad and parttime job forever. although he can walk across the street and take another nonrailroad. parttime job and qualify. This ridiculous proposition is best described by the following representative case which was called to my attention. A former railroad employee. with a disability status. was erroneously held responsible by the Railroad Retirement Board for some $2.000 in alleged overpayment of pension. His pension was withdrawn. The Board later rescinded that ruling. absolving the employee of any fault in connection with the alleged overpayment. but now. because the pension was withdrawn. and because of the language of the present basic law. the employee must quit forever the parttime nonrailroad job which he has held for a number of years and in which he is earning less than the maximum allowable. I say again. that although he must quit his present job. forever. to be eligible for pension reinstatement. he can walk across the street and take another nonrailroad. parttime job and then be eligible for pension reinstatement. Obviously. this makes no sense whatsoever. The technicality in the present law. creating such situations. should be struck out in fairness to the retired railroad employees the law was designed to protect. Those members of this and the other body appointed to the recently created joint committee to investigate the railroad retirement situation. should insist that the basic law be amended at the earliest possible opportunity to eliminate the unjust provision which I have discussed. I will be glad to open my files in this case and to cooperate in any other possible manner.",

Descendants of this heroic volunteer citizen army under General Washington are today gathered on that same surrender field. Other descendants are scattered throughout our own country and many are serving in our Armed Forces in distant places. It seems important to me.

We are responsible for legislation which gives authority to send our young men to the battlefields of the world and to dissipate our resources and distribute our wealth.

I realize that anyone who proposes a reduction in the AEC funds immediately creates the impression that he may be attempting to cut back the manufacture of atomic weapons. but. so far as I am ATE 12749 concerned. that is not the case. It is not the funds for the production of atomic weapons that I would shave. The Senate committee provided a reduction of 10 percent in personal services for administration. and allowed the full budget estimate for all the rest of the Commissions activities. but the House indicated a desire that the Commission simplify its program and practice some of the austerity which Congress has commended to various other agencies. I feel the Senate should concur in general with the position of the House. I have been looking at the justifications submitted in connection with the supplemental request. On page 82. for example. I find a request for over $46.000 for information services. In view of President Trumans recent censorship decree. I feel sure that the agency will be unable usefully to employ 12 persons as information specialists. On page 114 of the justification another item appears. a soft spot in my judgment. It is for a small bus terminal. to cost approximately $30.000. On page 119 there is a request for $4.500.000. with which to build 300 dwelling units. According to my arithmetic. this amounts to $15.000 per family unit. It appears that less expensive dwellings could well be built during this period of national crisis. On pages 120 and 121 I find a request for $3.105.000. to provide for an extension of the civil defense program. to build atomic shelters. and to finance a socalled shelter program. I may point out that both the House and Senate have seen fit to eliminate the shelter program from civilian defense.

Mr. Hiss also is listed as Director of the Office of Special Political Affairs. Mr. Vincent is listed as Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs. Both positions. as you knov had an important bearing or. the matter before the committee at that time.

The plan roughly contemplates that a certain number of months from the day it is to go into effect. certain divisions of the Communist army and certain divisions of the Nationalist army will be amalgamated. When that occurs. it s essential that the troops from the Communkt side which go into the troops of the new Chinese army have a minimum of the same sort of training that their compatriots have had. Some of the divisions in the present national army have been trained by United States forces. These American training forces that we are talking about will be forces that will take a Communist outfit which is to be amalgamated with the new army and put it in shape so that it can readily go into the outfit.

SUMMARY Increases in labor and distribution costs in recent years have been more important than rising farmproduct prices in increasing the cost of bakery goods. Today a pound of bakery products reflects 1.9 cents higher costs for ingredients and 2.5 cents higher costs for manufacturing labor and distribution than in 1945. The baking industry has maintained approximately the same profit ratio to total sales3 to 5 percentsince 1946. which is equivalent to 9 to 13 percent on the invested capital of the companies reporting.

Since that time the administration. from the President on down. has been using up a lot of valuable time criticizing and condemning the House of Representatives for its action in that matter. As a mat ter of fact. if the newspapers correctly quote the President he was so impatient and intemperate that in expressing his impatience he characterized House amendments as \"fool amendments in the House of Representatives.\" It mightbe a debatable question. as to which foot the shoe belonged on and I am not going into that. What I wanted to talk to you about was what the amendment really was. what it really sought to ac. complish. and to try and correct some of the misstatements. the flagrant misstatements. that have been made concerning it. So I got together a few fig? ures of my own. and I will begin by calling the attention of the House and the administration to the large appropriations this Congress has been making for the Military Establishment since 1948. We appropriated in 1948 $8.797.000.000. in 1949 we appropriated $10.575.000.000. in 1950 $13.075.000.000. in 1951 $48.000.000.000. in 1952 $56.000.000.000 and in 1953 $52.000.000.000. Mr. Chairman. I am not going to undertake to make any apologies for my part in the adoption of the SmithCoudert amendment. I do not have to make any because I was here voting for a stronger Armed Forces. a bigger and better Navy. a bigger and better Army. a bigger and better defense before either the President or Mr. Finletter or Mr. Lovett ever came on the national scene. I have been doing so consistently for 20 years. So my purpose is not to apologize to anybody for anything but to state some facts and figures. Most of you voted for the SmithCoudert amendment. so you know what it purported to do. It purported to provide that the Armed Forces should spend in the next fiscal year $2.500.000.000 less than .they estimated themselves they were going to spend.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the deficiency appropriation bill. which is now before the House. is almost entirely a request for military funds. In other words. practically every dollar reflected In this supplemental request is the result of continued hostilities in Korea. The funds are needed for the remainder of the fiscal year 1952. which ends June 30. The total sum of $1.457.000.000 was requested for the Department of Defense. The committee has reduced that amount by $56.100.000. so that the estimate which comes to you today represents approximately $1.400.000.000. Of that fund. by far the largest amount. or $1.168.000.000. Is for the Army. The Army. of course. has been bearing the brunt of the fighting in the Korean war. The request for Army funds is broken down into three itemsmilitary personnel. maintenance and operation. and civilian relief in Korea. The military personnel picture is based entirely upon the strength of the Armed Forces. The fact that the Korean war continued into this fiscal year meant that it was necessary for us to keep more men in the Army than had been planned when funds were requested for the fiscal year 1952 program. We had anticipated an average Army strength of 1.531.000 men and a yearend strength of 1.552.000 men. But we actually will have an average strength during this year of 1.575.000 men in the Army. and a yearend strength of 1.650.000. Those additional troops have provided two additional combat divisions. additional regimental combat teams. additional antiaircraft battalions. and other special units which are required to carry on the war in Korea and to provide a greater state of readiness elsewhere. So this is purely and simply a mathematical computation. We have these men in uniform because the defense of the Nation justifies it. We have an obligation to pay them. and clothe them. and feed them. and to transport them to the different theaters of operation. and to rotate them home. We did not feel that any reduction could be made in the $335.000.000. which represents 29 percent of the total requested for the Army. The next item. and the largest item.

The Department of the Navy has requested $44.100.000. of which $38.000.000 is required for personnel costs for the Marine Corps. You have exactly the same situation here that you had in Army personnel figures. The Korean war has proceeded beyond the anticipated expiration date. additional marines have been brought into uniform. they must be fed. they must be paid. they must be equipped. they must be transported. These are the costs. and it does not appear that they could be cut. In addition the Navy requested a sum of $6.100.000 for the naval petroleum reserve experiments or drilling activities in Alaska. But instead of appropriating additional money. authorization is given for the Secretary to use that amount from his emergency fund. so there is no additional appropriation for the $6.100.000. The Department of the Air Force requested $245.000.000 for maintenance and operation. There. again. you see the impact of the Korean war. and under almost the same circumstances as I described in maintenance and operations requirements of the Army. The committee took a $10.000.000 cut In an effort to require economies which appear reasonable.

It is one of those billsand we get them right alongcalling for a deficiency appropriation. which means. as I understand. that either in the first place we did not appropriate enough money or the folks spending it just spent a little more than they should have spent. Usually we find not a little has been wasted. Someone said a moment ago that the money was needed because of the situation in Korea for which. of course. the Congress is not responsible. The Korean warwhich he would not let MacArthur winis the Presidents baby. The gentleman from Virginia. Mr. HOWARD SMITH. as he so often does. gave us some information which seemed to me to be extremely valuable. that is. if we use it and act upon It. If I understood him correctly he suggested that the President and some of the department heads should be a little more charitable in their statements. a little more accurate in their figuring. The substance of one part of his statement was. if I got him correctly. and I think I did. was that they cannot add correctly. They come up here and give us a set of figures and we. not knowing and not having the facilities to get the real facts. are forced to vote for the totals named in bills like this. We never will escape their unreasonable demandswe never will force them to be efficientuntil on one of their bills calling not for equipment but for compensation for the brass we just reject it in toto.

I know that General Collins made no such statement at all. and I think some of these reports have been quite exaggerated. I hope to insert in this issue of the RECORD the statement by General Collins. been checking CCCs handling of grain storage. Here the waste definitely edges into corruption. though Secretary Brannan insists that the crooks are on the outside and his people. at least most of them. are innocent. despite evidence of gifts ranging from Bibles and shrimp to cash bribes in one instance. The sordid story has been well publicized: Warehousemen. to whom CCC has been paying fancy prices to store Government grain. have been selling the grain. hoping. by speculating on the commodity market. to profit and cover up. Secretary Brannan struck out in all directions when this one broke. Among other things. he said \"the actual excuse for circulating\" news about the grain thefts was that \"the political season has induced my opponents to launch an allout attack on the grainstorage program.\" He hinted darkly that it was all a plot against the American farmer. The public still does not know how high the grain shortages will run. Brannan once estimated \"$5.000.000 to $7.000.000\". Senator WILLIAMS thinks $10.000.000 will be nearer the target. Brannan says we probably wont actually lose more than $1.000.000 through the thefts and implies that a mere million is a pittance compared with the magnitude of the multibilliondollar storage program. WILLIAMS retorts that a million dollars of the taxpayers money looks pretty big to him. and hes skeptical about that estimate anyway.",

As a matter of fact. the principal amendment. for a cut of $1.000.000.0. was voted on at 1:25 oclock this afternoon. after the unanimousconsent agreement was entered into. and I actually felt that the entire bill would be completed this afternoon. My own personal reflection is that the vote on the $1.000.000.000 amendment was a little too close for the sponsors of the proposed legislation. and therefore we had to listen to a most interesting discourse upon the primary election in the State of West Virginia. which took about an hour and a half. We have listened all afternoon to discussions not too germane to the amendment pending. However. I am willing and happy to go along with the majority leader. and my distinguished colleagues who are sponsors of the amendment. I hope we will get a vote at an early hour tomorrow.",

Later on. when the Senate Banking and Currency Committee held hearings on the bill to repeal section 104. It developed that there was widespread opposition to the bill among many groups. Two of the Nations principal farm organizationsthe American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Unionwent on record against section 104. on the grounds that American agriculture would be harmed by the section. The National Cotton Council is against the section. The CIO and the Interna-. tional Association of Machinists are also in opposition. The United States Chamber of Commerce is on record against section 104. So are the Commerce and Industry Association of New York. Tobacco Associates. Inc.. the Association of Food Distributors. the American Chamber of Commerce for Trade with Italy. and many other organizations.

What could be more unfortunate than the things that have taken place there? We certainly are losing face In Japan and Korea and we have lost faith there in the last months in what has been done by those in charge of our forces. The removal of General MacArthur from Japan was one of the greatest tragedies that has ever taken place. If General MacArthur had been allowed to remain in Japan and had remained in charge of the troops. there would have been no rioting in Japan. and there would have been no rioting among the prisoners. There would have been discipline and orderly procedure. respect for the United States. Even prisoners benefit from proper discipline and suffer from the lack of it. The removal of the star from General Colson. a fine gentleman with a fine military record. and reduced to the rank of colonel in great haste without due consideration of all the facts which even \"to this date have not been presented looks like a coveringup of the responsibility of persons higher up in authority.

Today we. the representatives of the people. are given an opportunity to apply the brakes and thus make a further contribution toward reversing the trend in extravagant governmental spending. This rule makes in order the consideration of H. R. 7072. the annual independent offices appropriation bill. a bill appropriating funds for the next fiscal year for most of the Federal bureaus. The President. through his Budget Bureau. requested of the Congress a total of $2.085.097.390 for these bureaus. The Appropriations Committee. under the able leadership of its subcommittee chairman. the gentleman from Texas . has cut that request by a total of $700.048.695. In every case the committee has made substantial reductions excepting. of course. such items which are fixed and not susceptible to reduction. As one who has long been interested In this economy drive. I desire now to express. in the premises. on my own part and on the part of my coworkers. the gratitude of all economyminded Members of this body for the committees efforts. While further efforts will be made in the form of appropriate amendments to make even further economies. I apprehend that determined efforts will be made by those Members of the House who consider themselves liberal minded to restore the reductions made by the committee in an effort to continue the spending spree. This effort must not prevail. The line must be held.",

DIRKSEN. has introduced an amendment which he Intends to propose to the Defense Production Act now pending before the Senate Banking Committee. The Dirksen amendment is designed to strip from the Wage Stabilization Board any and all authority which it may have to intervene in an attempt to settle labor disputes. This is precisely the same objective I had in mind when I introduced the Allen resolution 2 weeks agoto attempt to persuade Congress that this Board should be limited by legislation. Some of my colleagues have attempted to dissuade me from this effort. Some of my colleagues have said that we should wait and see what the Wage Stabilization Board does in the steel and aircraft disputes before we act. The point at issue here is that no Gov.ernment agency. however constituted. should have the power to recommend a union shop. It may be that this Boardfearful of congressional actionmay decide that it will pass up the present opportunity to foist the union shop on the steel industry. And if that is the course of events. we should all be thankful. But that will not solve the problem of the Wage Stabilization Board and its extralegal authority to settle labor disputes. This authority must be denied. Personally. I do not feel that any governmental agency should compel or make anyone belong to a union if he does not want to belong to that union.",

I do not believe the people I represent in the Seventeenth Congressional District of Michigan want me to support this legislation. The people of my district have provided their own marketing facilities. and I am sure they would not want me to support legislation which would make them potentially liable some day to pay for market facilities in cities perhaps a thousand miles away from them. This bill provides exactly that. That is one of the objections I have to this bill. The other objection. which is more serious in my opinion and which has been very ably discussed by the gentleman from New York . is the principle of looking to Washington for every conceivable thing in their normal life. Lincoln once said: The Government should never do for the people what the people can do for themselves. It seems to me that when the history of this country is examined. that in this particular field we will find that the people through the years have done .for themselves what the Government might have done for them. The people have never asked that it be done for them. We might as well say to the country. \"Why not let the Federal Government guarantee the money or the loan required for the building of police stations. fireengine houses. textile mills. and merchandising plants?\" This bill violates the American principle of local selfgovernment. This is a foot in the door. I do not say the Federal Government may positively be called upon to pay the bill. but suppose it is called upon to pay for a venture which has not proven successful. Then the Government of the United States is in the marketing business. If these risks are not good enough to be taken by local investors. they should not be built. The best judges of that are the people in the local area. whether it is New York. Boston. Philadelphia. or any other city. For that reason.

We did not want Government loans or financing in a situation of this kind. So we adopted a method that has been approved by this Congress on many occasions in connection with the housing problem. We have voted to insure billions in housing loans and I dare say that everyone who has spoken against this form of financing today. has supported the guarantee of housing loans.

In fact. our committee has devoted more time to this important subject than the Department of Agriculture itself has with the fifty or sixty million dollars a year we have appropriated for research. I inquired of the Research Section of the Department of Agriculture. which receives these large appropriations. as to what they had done about the merchandising of farm products and you will find without exception that they have not gone into the merchandising of agricultural products in any detail. I am opposing this measure principally on account of the timing of it. We are told that we must make sacrifices in this country. and the people generally. because we are in a desperate situation. we are in a war that we must win.

That is my objection to the bill. I fully recognize that we must improve the marketing facilitiesfor the perishable items. but legislative action should not be taken until the emergency is past. Incidentally3 my district produces mostly perishable items. including dairy products. fruits and particularly vegetables. and we want markets in these larger cities to take care of the handling of our particular kind of products. So that I favor the bill in principle. but I want it to work. The argument is used that if we enact this legislation. if we guarantee these loans to build up these big markets in New York. in Philadelphia. in Richmond. in West Virginia. and in about 40 other places. we are going to reduce the cost of living to the people. that they will be able to buy cheaper food. These buildings they are going to build need steel. They could not put them up otherwise. because they are buildings with terminal facilities that run from 1.000 to 3.000 feet long. They must have the steel. But the building costs are so terrific now that the tenants of these stalls and these spaces in the buildings will have to pay two or three times as much rent if they are going to break even and meet the guaranteed commitments on the loan. so they will have to raise the prices of their fruits and vegetables to the consumer.

I do not like to criticize. but the Army engineers request for funds for flood control has been greatly reduced by the Bureau of the Budget too often for many years past. until it has become a desperate situation leading up to the latest destruction. You will recall that I explained to this committee the past several years what I thought I could see coming. And it did come this spring. and it came in a much worse degree than I expected. I am sorry to say. We have a critical condition upstream in Harrison and Monona Counties. where the river is about to break through in several places. The Army engineers and the local engineers are holding their breath for fear it is going to break through and start a new channel. and. if it does. it will really cost money to get Old Man River back in the proper channel again.",

To me that is just as important in the way of conservation of land to drain this formerly fine farm land as to conserve soil in any other manner.

I have a little more than a passing interest in the patriotism of the Hawaiians. because Mr. President. it was my privilege to assist in the drafting of legislation which was responsible for the creation in Hawaii of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. at the time when the debate was going on in the Congress as to whether we should have several cemeteries throughout the Pacific as the final resting place for boys from the mainland of the United States who. for one reason or other. were not being returned to the United States. The Congress decided that there should be one National Memorial Cemetery in the Pacific. and that is in what is known as the Punch Bowl Crater. and there it is that boys from every State of the Union are sleeping. Mr. President. There is a bit of the United States in Hawaii. Paraphrasing the words of the English poet who said that wherever he slept there would be a bit of England. there is a bit of the mainland of the United States in Hawaii. in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. The Hawaiians themselves have written a record of which no State would need be ashamed. Hawaiis casualties in Korea are 1.097. of which 261 were killed. Until April 17. 1951. Koreas Hawaiian war casualties totaled 681. That was at the rate of 1.36 per thousand of Hawaiis population. At the same time. the percentage figure for the United States is 0.4 of 1 per thousand.",

As I said a moment ago. I am not satisfied with the tidelands bill as it is presented now in the Senate. The Senate has the power to amend that bill. It has the power to modify that bill. It has the power to restore title to the tidelands to the people of California. Texas. Louisiana. and all the other States.

This reduction is caused. to a large degree. by the fact that the Capitol Power Plant. during the next fiscal year. can only expend $3.000.000. which is $2.000.000 under the estimates of 1952..

The July 19 issue of the Leader. published at Bismarck. N. Dak.. under the headline \"North Dakota Wheat Yield May Be Greatest in State History.\" states: The biggest wheat crop in North Dakotas history will be harvested this year. the United States Department of Agriculture forecast last week. The Departments July 1 estimate put the prospective State wheat crop at 165.540.000 bushels. * * * If the crop comes through as abundantly as indicated by July 1 conditions. North Dakota will return to the No. 1 position among wheatproducing States. When the President spoke to the Nation on December 16. 1951. relative to the international situation. he also stated that one of the two National Guard units to be ordered immediately into active duty was the Fortyseventh Division. comprised of men and boys from the Middlewestern States of North Dakota and Minnesota. I should like. in this connection. to take this method of advising the military authorities of our Armed ForcesArmy. Navy. Air Force. Marines. and Coast Guardof the immediate need for implementation of a harvest furlough program of at least a 30day period in order that these men in the various services. who come from farms where the family cannot now obtain sufficient or competent help to run the power farm machinery. can return to their family farms to assist with the harvesting of the crops. I have here a number of letters which are typical of the many that I have received from desperate mothers and fathers who have written me concerning their need for the help of their sons during the harvest period. which is so eminent. I should like particularly to call attention to two letters I have receivedone from Mr. Russell D. Chase. States Attorney of Stutsman County. Jamestown. N. Dak.. and the other from Mrs. W. A. Lilyquist. of Lisbon. N. Dak.. concerning this existing emergency. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that these letters may be printed in the RECORD at this point in my remarks.",

The Extension Service will refer the farmer to the local PMA office. 2. The local PMA office will advise the farmer as to whether or not funds are available to pay for this conservation practice and if such funds are available. the farmer is advised that a PMA representative will be sent to inspect the area on his farm which he desires terraced.

I had cattle for which I myself paid $75 a head which were taken to the sandpits and shot. and I received a check for $17 apiece. The Senator from North Dakota fought the program of Henry Wallace to plow under every third row of cotton and wheat. but the program did accomplish one thing.

I do not care to make any remarks regarding the bill beyond the brief statement that it merely proposes to suspend until March 31. 1953. practically a year. the duty on lead. The suspension is made necessary by the fact that lead imports are needed in the United States for defense purposes. and the duty now provided for in the law. though small. tends to restrict imports of lead. It is believed by the authorities who are charged with the responsibility in this field that the suspension of the duty for the 12 months beginning March 31. 1952. will result in an increase in the imports of lcad into the United States. The bill specifically provides that in the event the price of lead falls below a certain point. 18 cents a pound. and that condition continues for any one calendar month within the period of the suspension. the act itself shall become ineffective. and the duty shall be restored. That. briefly. is what the bill provides. So far as the principle of suspending the duty for the 12 months from March 31 this year to March 31 next year is concerned. perhaps there is no disagreement. There may be a disagreement as to how the duties fixed in the Tariff Act of 1930 and under the Canadian Tariff Agreement should go back into effect. The duties fixed in the Tariff Act of 1930 were cut by 50 percent in the treaty with Mexico. On the cancellation of that treaty. the duties fixed in the act of 1930 went back into full effect. Subsequently. however. a trade agreement was entered into with Canada. and the duty was cut 50 percent under the 1930 figures. Mr. President. the whole purpose of the bill is to undertake to induce larger imports of lead into the United States. Lead is now needed. The general world market price for lead is above that paid in the United States at this time. I understand.",

The letter was marked \"confidential\" at the time I received it. This afternoon I obtained permission from the Solicitor to release his opinion. This memorandum not only sets forth clearly the point of view of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. but also recites some of the statements upon which I based the opinion I gave to the Secretary of the Interior last fall to the effect that the Federal Property Act of 1949 does not apply to these submerged lands. The bill as reintroduced now. together with the veto message of the President and the Executive order of the President. all give me every reason to believe. since no action has been taken to apply the Federal Property Act to the submerged lands. that the President of the United States is pursuing the legislative approach.",

The passage of this bill is essential if we are to have economy and efficiency in the military departments. Extended investigations of the subcommittee of which I have the honor to be chairman leads to the undeniable conclusion that there is less unity in supply matters in the military setup than there was in 1945 when our country was so aroused over waste in the Army and Navy. We now have triplication in llace of duplication. We must have better management of the business activities of the Department of Defense if we are to have military and economic security. We have only to pause a moment to reflect that the Korean war has now exceeded World War I in lengththat Is why this legislation is a \"surefire\" must. The bill which I am introducing will. first. set up an Under Secretary of Defense for Supply Management. second. abolish the impotent Munitions Board. third. transfer to the Secretary of Defense control over supply matters now vested in many boards. individuals. and so forth. fourth. create an efficient and welltrained supply corps to assist the Under Secretary to perform his duties. and give the Under Secretary proper control over appropriations for supply. The stakes in this matter are great. I urge that this body insist on action. I can assure the House that our subcommittee is going to continue to investigate and report on this subject which is so important to our defense and to our economy.

During the deliberations in the drafting of the bill with respect to the deferment of individuals within the 181/2 to 26 age bracket who might be deferred for agriculture or college or one thing or another. the committee amended section 6 of the present Draft Act to provide that every individual who may be deferred would be liable for service up to the age of 35. so that no college student or other deferred person would escape his liability for service because of his deferment. If he is under 35. he is still subject to the draft. Subsequently the committee wrote a definite time limitation on the bill. July 1954. Of course. the result of that would be that all these men who are being deferred during the period between now and 1954 would escape liability completely after 1954.

This program that we are all talking about. the Farmers Home Administration. is a program which has done much. but it hs been greatly hampered. It has been completely hampered because it has never had the loan money which is needed in order to make these production and subsistence loans. The administrative money required does not need to be increased for the making of more loans. It takes more time on the part of the county supervisor to explain why he cannot. make a loan. and many times they have gone through the process of making the loan. and the borrowers go to the trouble of accumulating property. and then for some reason or another. when they get ready to make that loan. they find they are out of funds. I have the great privilege of being the State director in Minnesota of the Farm Security and Farm Home Administrator. and not once while I was administrator of that program did we have loan funds to last us 6 months of the year. Think of the situation that a person is in who is making the effort to start in farming. and who goes through the process of making the contract. who comes in for a loan. and finds out that the money is gone. There is another thing involved here. When you compare the amounts of money you find that the money is remaining relatively stable over the years. What has happened is this: It costs more today to start farming than it has ever cost. Therefore you are giving less people an opportunity. even with the $120.000.000 than you did with the funds 5 years or 3 years ago. If we are going to talk in terms of familysize farms. if we are going to talk in terms of assisting people to get started in an economic way on their land. this is the way to do it.

This bill came from the National Defense Agency.. When it was first brought to Congress it was referred to the Armed Services Committee. As the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce has charge of communications. we felt that that was intruding on our jurisdiction. and we asked that the bill be transferred to our committee. It was so transferred. There is existing law on this subject. Under section 606 (c) of the Communications Act. the President is authorized to control or use radio stations and their apparatus under certain emergency conditions. The authority of the President under that section is limited to electronic devices used in transmitting radio communications. and does not include all devices capable of emitting radiations useful to enemy aircraft for navigational purposes. In other words. an ordinary motor. unless it has been carefully constructed. may emit signals which can be used by operators of enemy planes to reach any point they may wish to reach. Motors. diathermy machines. and all other apparatus of that kind emit signals. and at the present time there is no control. No one is in control over such signals. We already have in the law control over regular broadcasting instruments. but the bill would give the Federal Communications Commission responsibility to look after other machines. which were not built for the transmission of signals. but which do emit signals. It is a safety measure of. very high importance. \"",

The support of this proposal to grant recognition to the bereaved survivors of those killed in action while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States is certainly appropriate.

While it is true that nothing can begin to compensate the wives. mothers. and famiiles of the men who have so nobly given their lives for the principles of world freedom and justice. these small buttons are a shining symbol of their sacrifice.

I have never understood that citizenship determined the qualifications of electors. but that they are determined by State law. If I may. I should like to call the Senators attention to article 1. section 2. of the Constitution. which relates to the House of Representatives: The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. and the electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature. There is no authority there for any Federal officer to determine whether or not someone is qualified to vote. When we turn to the election of a President. we find that article 2 of the Constitution provides: Each State shall appoint. in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct. a number of electors. equal to the -vhole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. There is no authority for giving the Secretary of Defense the right to say whether or not the qualifications have been met. When we come to the seventeenth amendment of the Constitution. which deals with the election of Senators. the first paragraph reads: The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State. elected by the people thereof. for 6 years. and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures. How Senators can contend that by passing a law we can give to the Secretary of Defense the right to determine the qualifications of electors in the face of those express provisions I do not see.

I might say that the gentleman and I are both members of the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs. and I knew that he feels as I have felt. sitting there listening to the pleas of some tribes of Indians who come here asking for a small per capita payment to them. of their own funds. It seems to me a very. very unfair situation that those Indians who have funds of their own. who have been kept in bondage so long. should be forced to come before the Congress of the United States and beg for a small part of that money to be given to them for their own use.",

The objectives of the Bosone resolution are the emancipation of the American Indianwith that I agree. It does not provide for any further examination into other activities of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. and it is an investigation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs itself. it is the old question of whether a department or agency of the Government can properly investigate itself. I do not think it can. The matter of this emancipation becomes a question of legislation by the Congress of the United States. and it is the duty of the Members of Congress to make the investigation to determine the proper legislation. Let me express one further thought and then I will yield to the gentleman from Nebraska: On the question of expense. I am convinced that the record will show that the Congress of the United States does a job of this kind much more inexpensively than a bureau of the Government. Let me point out that in the Bosone resolution there is a provision that $75.000 of appropriated funds shall be used for the investigation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I submit to the House that a proper subcommittee of the House of Representatives could at a great deal lower cost do a much more effective job of determining the functions of the Bureau and what legislation we should pass. I do not believe we should authorize the expenditure of $75.000 within the Bureau to tell us what legislation we should pass. I now yield to the gentleman from Nebraska.",

I think the best proof that one can find as to why the Congress should be given this power to make the investigation was demonstrated during the last session of the Eightieth Congress.

There are a few tribes which could not be emancipated in that length of time. such as the Navajo Tribeit will take longer for thembut a great majority of them could be emancipated to the benefit of the Indians and the Treasury in 5 years if the gentlemans bill is adopted by the Congress.

I want to commend heartily the gentleman from Ohio for introducing this resolution. and I commend also those of my colleagues who are interested in this question and have spoken here this afternoon. It seems to me that this situation stems from a great many mistakes that have been made in regard to our treatment of the Indians. I think one of the greatest mistakes was putting them on reservations without any plan to help them work out their freedom. The reservations were set up and populated before the War Between the States and have been continued to the present time. They have been little better than concentration camps. where members of a minority group were concentrated. The idea was first to keep them under the military control. Then it seemed to be the easiest way just to keep them there under the paternalistic care of the Federal Government. Other mistakes were made such as that In 1902 when the Congress and the Indian Commissioner himself serving under Theodore Roosevelt declared after a long study of this problem that it was time to abolish the Indian Bureau and to set these Indians free to give them full rights of citizenship as rapidly as they could assume those rights. Unfortunately the advice of that Indian Commissioner was not taken. The Indian Bureau. then spending about $3.000.000 a year was considered a terrible burden upon the people. but no moves were made to set the Indians free at that time. Another great mistake was made in 1925 when Congress passed a resolution declaring that the Indians of this country were full citizens and were to have all rights of citizenship. Unfortunately that proved to be an empty gesture because at the same time Congress kept the Indian Bureau with its full control over the life of the Indians. There was an inconsistency there. of course. and instead of the Indians finding themselves full citizens as they supposed they would be. they found themselves still wards of the Government. In 1933 we compounded all of the miostakes that had been made in the past when. as the gentleman from Montana",

All those are matters of the civilservice law. If no better law is provided. the question is whether the Civil Service Commission will disregard the intent of Congress in the case of the permanent agencies. and will proceed to bring in new employees and to put them through their probationary periods and then will proceed to qualify them for employment on a permanent basis. That is the question we must consider insofar as the temporary agencies of the Government are concerned.

Generally. a new type of competitive appointment would be authorized in the rest of the service. These would be called civil service reserve appointments. They would grant the appointees civil service status but only indefinite tenure. In this way the permanent force (comprising those employees having permanent tenure) could be kept below the September 1. 1950. or comparable level while at the same time maintaining a uniform appointment system which would not place the defense agencies at a disadvantage.

That. notwithstanding the provisions hereof. and in order to avoid undue hardship or inequity. the Civil Service Commission. when requested by the head of the agency involved. may authorize promotions in individual cases of meritorious nature. That would permit the Commission 0 take care of this situation. I also want to read from the RECORD what Representative WHITTEN said: Mr. Chairman. these amendments were worked out by the gentleman from Tennessee . chairman of the Committee on Civil ServiceThat is. of the House of Representativesand myself. with the cooperation of representatives of the Civil Service Commission and the Comptroller General. These amendmentsHe is talking now about the amendment which is now sought to be stricken from the bill. These amendments do not change the basic policy nor objectives of section 1310 of Public Law 253. the socalled Whitten rider. These amendments. if adopted. will prevent certain interpretations placed on section 1310 of Public Law 253. which were not intended and which. in my judgment. in most cases were not required by that act. from bringing about results not intended.",

There has been a barrage of propaganda against it. We have now to consider what should be done with the legislation. Three avenues are open. The first is to eliminate it. which would do what the Senator from Rhode Island desires to do. The next would be to retain it in full or to amend it. It would seem that any move that would prevent building up a vast army of permanent Government employees is most desirable. Any move which would force Government agencies to think once again about the alltoooften haphazard method which has characterized much of the hiring and many of the promotions should not be dismissed too lightly. We know what has happened in all departments. I think there is an exception in the case of mail carriers. Their salaries had not been increased by the socalled emergency pay to any extent. as had salaries in other departments. An evidence that the shoe is pinching is the fairly well organized attempt which is being made to eliminate the rider from the statute books. It is said that no one has appeared in behalf of the taxpayer. That is true. We do not find any appearances before the Appropriations Committees in behalf of the taxpayers. It is the tax consumer who appears before the Appropriations Committees. Tax consumers are the ones who are in the employ of the Government. and while they are drawing their salaries from the Government they are appearing before the Commission and before the Appropriations Committees.

I believe it was intended to accomplish something good and wholesome. namely. to restrict bureaucracy. I am against bureaucracy as strongly as anyone else is. But after an experience of 19 months I believe the Whitten rider has not worked so well. and we are beginning to recognize that fully. insofar as the postal field service is concerned.

I am not suggesting that Congress should appropriate more money. but I am suggesting that in connection with appropriations we might make. public libraries. which are so essential in critical areas where defense housing facilities are being constructed. are very badly needed and would be a great attraction.

So that even with the amount in question. $12.000.000. added there will be only $17.000.000. and some of it always hangs over and is not spent during the year. In other words. the total available under the bill will be $17.750.000. $5.750.000 which was appropriated early this year for the fiscal year 1951 has not been used. because the State Department had not considered that the foreign nations had .met their requirements. They now think the foreign nations will meet their requirements. Of the total requirements only onethird will come from the United States to be spent in these foreign countries. As to how that onethird is to be contributed is a matter to be interpreted by the State Department. The Department has now obtained an agreement on the part of the other nations to proceed. and finally to make the full amount available for allocation on the part of the United States $17.750.000. Probably it does not mean that there will be an actual expenditure in 1 year or more than $12.000.000. because the allocation must be made quite in advance of the actual expenditure.

At the time this bill was introduced it was estimated that in Missouri alone we would need some five to six thousand Mexican laborers to supplement the domestic labor available to help harvest our cotton crop. Our people in that section of the country have met the request of the Department of Agriculture by planting sufficient acreage to meet the production goals set by Secretary Brannan. In the past we have relied upon this Mexican labor. We had hoped we would have the opportunity to get this labor next fall.

I hope the Poage bill will come to the floor of the House and become the law of the land. As everyone knows. many of the farmers in the Middle West. and a large number of them in the Pacific Coast States in particular. rely for the harvesting of the fabulous perishable crops they raise out there on migratory labor. One bill that has been presented and passed in XCVI379 the Chamber on the other side of the Capitol. in my opinion. is unworkable. It contains provisions with which a farmer simply cannot comply. At his peril he employs a wetbackan illegal entrant. He may use every precaution. and yet later find that one of his employees came into the United States illegally. If he is the victim of such circumstances it makes him subject to very severe penalties. because the bill provides that he would then be guilty of a felony. In addition to this. the bill that has passed the Senate requires every employer of farm labor to become an informer which makes him guilty of felony if he suspects the worker is illegally in the country and does not report his suspicions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This is a throwback to the days of Hitler. To indicate how enormous the inflow of migrant foreign labor is. I need but tell you that it is estimated that between 75.000 and 80.000 such migrants come into California each month during the fruit and vegetable season. which is from late April into the autumn when the grapes are harvested.

Let us take care of them when they are discharged. A good many veterans in hospitals who were discharged under the retirement act did not get retirement pay.

I happen to be an Army Reserve officer and I have for many years served in the Florida National Guard. I know that there are a number of Members of this body who are also reservists at the present time. or who have in the past been members of the Guard or the Reserves. Any of these gentlemen will tell you that the weakness of any Reserve component program has always been the fact that basically trained enlisted men were not available for enlistment. plus the fact that the turnover in enlisted men has been so great that it has been impossible to create truly effective units. Testimony recently given to the House Armed Services Committee indicates that the turnover in enlisted men in the National Guard runs as high as 30 percent per year.

The writer says: This figure does not coincide with any which is available here and I can only conclude that it must have been furnished to you by someone who made the common mistake of failing to distinguish between obligations and expenditures. This distinction is of the greatest importance and popular misunderstanding of its precise nature has been the source of much confusion. To explain the distinction properly requires a brief -description of what Congress actually does when it makes an appropriation. When Congress makes an appropriation. we commonly say that Congress is appropriating funds. This naturally gives rise to the impression that Congress Is taking physical cash in an amount equivalent to the appropriation and actually placing it in the hands of the executive branch for immediate payment out. This is not the case. instead. Congress is simply granting the executive branch the authority to do two things: First. to make obligationsThat is. contracts with the producers of needed articlesin the amount of such appropriation. that is to make binding commitments (or contracts) to pay out that amount at the date or dates specified in the commitment. When this particular authority to obligate is exercised. and binding commitments are made. we say that the funds are obligated. Second. to make the expenditures required to carry out such obligations. that is actual payments in cash to the. persons to whom such obligations are owed from cash which is available to the Government in the United States Treasury at the time of the payments. At this stage we say that the funds are expended. Therefore. It is important to remember that under present congressional procedures. the executive branch does not have the authority. unless and until Congress does make an appropriation. either (1) to spend money or (2) to make a contract which will. at some subsequent date. legally require the Government to spend money. With the foregoing brief explanation of terms. we can turn to the current picture. The facts. as derived from official sources and estimates. are these: (1) On June 30. 1952. the end of the current fiscal year. It Is estimated that of the total amounts heretofore appropriated for foreignaid purposes. only around $400.000.000 will remain unobligated.",

He was going to save 25 percent and cut down on Federal employment. balance the budget. and so forth. During the peacetime years. and during his complete control of the economy. because of a subservient Congress. from 1933 through 1939. which were the peacetime years of Mr. Roosevelts reign. the average national income was $58.500.000.It was $10.500.000.000 less a year under the magical influence of President Roosevelt than it was in the peacetime administration of the Republicans. including that terrible year 1932. about which we hear so much and which was such a bad year. Not only was the annual national income during the stewardship of the Democrats. under their management of the Nations economy. $10.500.000.000 less than under the Republican administration. but there was an increase of more than $20.000.000.000 in the national debt. which was money borrowed from the accumulation of the public and pumped into savings by way of leafraking and other made and false programs of work. Mr. President. Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle talk about prosperity. but the Senator from New Hampshire is absolutely right when he says that they never brought prosperity under a selfsustaining and selfsupporting economy until they put a million men in uniform and gave them a years training and began to let war contracts and to force the economy in order to get us into World War II. We have lived on hysteria and fear and threats to the economy to the United States which emanate from the White House periodically. We suffered a million casualties in World War II. and we have suffered approximately 200.000 battle and nonbattle casualties in Korea. Now we have the fear of world war III. and we have borrowed money being pumped into the economy every year. I wanted to know whether the Senator from New Hampshire was aware of those facts.",

Mr. Speaker. this may look like a big order. but this has come to us well recommended from various sources. Your Committee on the Judiciary conducted a very careful survey to see whether or not these judgeships were needed. This matter was brought to the attention of the Committee on the Judiciary by the judicial council first. They recommended these judgeships. Secondly. it was recommended by the Administrative Committee of the United States District Courts. This legislation is brought to us on the endorsement of the local bar associations. the State bar associations. and the American Bar Association. This bill has been gone over very thoroughly. May I say that the late Congressman Byrne spent a great deal of his time on this subcommittee going over this particular bill. It is true that four judgeships have been added to this bill that were not recommended by the judicial council or by the administrative committee. not because they were against the establishment of those judgeships. but because the judicial council has not had an opportunity to go over them.",

Is the judiciary in all sections of the country to be forced to remain bogged down in a morass of pending litigation. merely because there are those in this body who want to await the outcome of the next national election? Are litigants to be denied justice because we in Congress play politics with the court system? Have those of you who oppose this measure closed your eyes and your ears to the needs in the various sections of the United States for additional Federal judges? This bill provides for the appointment of one additional district judge for the southern district of Florida. Even if this legislation wins congressional approval. it will still mean that we will only have one Federal judge for approximately 500.000 people. The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended the creation of this additional judgeship. Besides the tremendous population increase in the southern district of Florida. which has given to our State two additional Members of this body. the workload of the court has been extremely heavy. For the first half of 1952. there were 655 private civil cases pending. The case load per judge exceeds the national average not only in that type of case. but also in all civil cases. The southern district of Florida comprises 45 counties and court is held from Fernandina to Key West. a distance of approximately 550 miles. As of the end of last year. there were almost a thousand civil cases and 300 criminal cases pending in that court which had not been disposed of. In 1951. the total number of civil cases commenced per judge was 257. as compared with the national average of 204. The courts are the very foundation of our democracy. but no court can function efficiently or with dignity if it is hopelessly overburdened or if the litigants are unreasonably delayed in obtaining relief.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. among the number of additional circuit and district judges. provided for in the bill presently under consideration. there is included an additional district judgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin. At present. there are two Federal district judges in the entire State of Wisconsin. which has a population of approximately three and a half million. In the eastern district. there is located the metropolis of Milwaukee. the eighth largest industrial center in the country. In addition. the district includes a number of smaller industrial communities which commence with Kenosha and Racine in the southern extremity of the State. and continue northward along the western shore of Lake Michigan to Green Bay. The number of civil and criminal cases pending in that Federal district is so large that it is impossible for a single judge to handle all of them. The appointment of an additional Judge for the eastern district of Wisconsin was recommended by the circuit council for the seventh circuit. which consists of six judges of the court of appeals for that circuit. The Judicial Conference of the United States. meeting in September of 1951. confirmed this recommendation. urging the creation of this additional judgeship. The statistics contained on page 91 of the committee report amply support these recommendations. They show that there is a serious and unavoidable congestion of civil cases in the eastern district of Wisconsin. despite the conscientious efforts of the only district judge who holds court in three different places throughout the area. The statistics further point out that the civil case loan in this district is much higher than the case load per judge on the national average for all the districts in the United States. Presently. there are hundreds of cases ready for trial which cannot be reached because the court is not able to hear them. Mr. Speaker. I feel that the people in every Federal district should have available access to Federal courts where they can seek legal redress without prolonged delays. I further believe that no court can function effectively when it is overburdened to the extent that the litigants have to wait entirely too long before their cases can be heard. In the interests of justice. to which the people are entitled. I feel that Congress should approve this additional judgeship for the eastern district of Wisconsin.",

I agree with my distinguished friend from Indiana that the appointment of additional judges will not solve this problem. In an attempt to do something about it I introduced the bill from the report accompanying which the gentleman from Indiana quoted. However. until such time as the Congress devises a way to take jurisdiction away from the Federal courts we are going to find it necessar- to increase the number of judges. Unfortunately. with those increases goes the need for additional quarters. the entourage with each judge. and additional construction of courthouses. I think it is incumbent upon the Congress of the United States to do something immediately about depriving the courts of jurisdiction. but until that is done it is not good business to deprive the citizens of this Nation of their day in court. As a matter of fact. in the eastern district of Pennsylvania the civil trial list is behind over 3.000 cases. with the result that people who are entitled to their compensation never get it. They are settling cases on the basis of 50 percent rather than wait very nearly 3 years in order to gain simple justice. It seems to me the way to deal with this entire matter is to debate the bill and. section by section. pass on that which is needed and that which. in the Judgment of this body. Is unnecessary.

I am not going to offer an amendment because yesterday amendments were not favorably received and the temper of the House seems to be the same today. I think probably the Members feel that the money for this just cause will be added when the bill goes to the other body. As I have said on the floor numerous times. I have felt that we in New England have been discriminated against for a number of years. I assure the House that to have New England suffer severely economically is very bad for the country. New England pays very heavy taxes. New England is entitled to consideratioa instead of neglect. Today. in the Merrimack River. the engineers are watching closely the flood conditions in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. They do not know whether we will have a flood or not. Ten days ago they felt that we might have a flood larger than the 1938 flood. Something permanent in construction must be done to remedy the danger of high waters. I say again. as I did yesterday. that the Governor of New Hampshire and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are very remiss in not getting together and signing the compact between the two States. But if the money for the survey comes in and the appropriation is ready. I am sure those compacts will be signed at once. There is no doubt about the danger that will ensue to the national defense if we have a flood. I hope when the conferees of this Subcommittee on Appropriations and the Senate conferees get together the House conferees will follow the recommendation that I am sure the Senate will maketo restore money for the flood and power surveys in the Merrimack River and all of New England and New Yorkand right the great injustice done our section of the country.

That is what the amendment attempts to do. It requests the President of the United States to invoke immediately the provisions of the TaftHartley Act. whereby the present steel strike can be suspended for at least 80 days. It was to meet just such a situation that Congress passed the TaftHartley Act. When it passed the act. Congress intended that if a crisis such as now confronts us should occur. the President should invoke its provisions to stop the strikea great national strike in this instancefor a period of 80 days. Mr. President. we are now losing in steel production in the neighborhood of 300.000 tons a day. If such a condition continues for 80 days. we will lose 25.000.000 tons. That is nearly onequarter of the entire steel production of this country. Everybody knows that steel is the very basis of our preparedness program. Without steel. we could not fight the war. Without steel. we could not build airplanes. tanks. or battleships. What Russia fears more than anything else is the massproduction capacity of this country.

It as certainly the clear intent of Congress that in an emergency of this kind the President should invoke the TaftHartley Act. in order to allow an 80day breathing spell. I was a Member of the Senate when the TaftHartley Act was passed. The particular provision to which I have just adverted was discussed for hours. and it was clearly the desire of Congress to have in the bill such a provision as would give power to the President to stop a great national strike like the present one in the steel industry. for at least 80 days. Mr. President. I submit that we are facing a very perilous threat. We cannot permit anyone to sabotage our efforts. We must go forward with our production. We must keep steel plants running in order to reach the production of 110.000.000 tons of steel. which is our program.

I think that if Congress should adopt the seizure amendment proposed by the Senator from South Carolina. two necessities would confront us. First. the bill would have to be passed by both Houses of Congress ahd signed by the President. Second. the board proposed to be created under the Maybank amendment would have to be selected by the President and confirmed by the Senate. It is to be assumed that. even if we were to take that approach deliberately. we would not wait for another month to do anything about the steel strike. In any event. it seems to me that we would have to act first under the TaftHartley law to enjoin the strike and get operations going again. Then we would set up the machinery either of the TaftHartley law or of any other law which might be passed with respect to seizure. The junior Senator from Virginia will vote with his senior colleague for this request to the President to use what appears at the moment to be the only practical remedy to restore production in a work stoppage which imperils the national safety. The junior Senator from Virginia does not like seizure any more than do any of his colleagues. Under seizure wages are frozen. and that is objectionable.

I think the Congress and the President would be grossly derelict in the performance of their duty and responsibility to the Nation and particularly to the men who are carrying the fighting burden in Korea. did they not exhaust every remedy of whatever nature to bring about satisfactory results. Instead of arguing about what happened in January. or in 9 days. or arguing about the merits of the TaftHartley Act. we ought to move as promptly as possible to get results. I therefore enthusiastically support this amendment. But I do not think that even it would afford a remedy that would meet all the conditions and all the requirements of the situation. I think it is a congressional matter. and that it is incumbent upon us to pass a law which will meet this situation. We took the position that the President did not have authority to seize the steel mills. The Supreme Court upheld that position. and I think the burden is now on the President to proceed under the TaftHartley Act. I think the burden Is on the Congress to proceed to the enactment of legislation which would fully meet such an occasion. I do not think it can be done overnight. I want to hear the argument on the Maybank amendment. but I doubt that it would meet the needs of the occasion. I think it is going to require that the best lawyers. the best industrialists. and the best labor specialists get together and spend days In cooperation with the Congress In order to draft a law which would meet a situation of this kind effectively. But In the meantime. we need steel. and I think the President should proceed under the law that we have on the books. Therefore. Mr. President. I support this amendment enthusiastically.",

We find that the allocation authority has already allocated more steel than is available for the various uses. according to the War Production Administrator. In the absence of the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency. I may say that yesterday our staff was directed to look into the question of steel tonnage. By the end of this year or the beginning of next year there will be a total tonnage of 117.000.000 tons. The industry is now operating at about 104 percent of normal capacity. The shortage of scrap is also involved. That problem is being considered in connection with the warproduction program. Our committee has a great many statistics available. It is now working to bring them up to date. so as to find out where the steel iswhether hoarding Is going on. whether it is in the black market. or whether the Government has more laid aside at the present time than it can utilize.

That committee traveled throughout the country. taking testimony in many different places. and did a magnificent job in its investigation of the problem. and then in working for a good many weeks in preparing the bill. A subcommittee of the Senate also went into the matter thoroughly and did excellent work. The General Accounting Office. under the direction of the Comptroller General. Hon. Lindsay C. Warren. made a study of the existing GI law and went into the matter very thoroughly. particularly In some 19 States. Then. of course. we have the observations and reports as a result of studies made by the Veterans Administration itself.",

He is subject to orders. He is subject to serving anywhere he may be ordered to serve. If he is sent to the front lines in Korea. he goes to the front lines in Korea. On the other hand. if his superior military commanders decide that he should serve in Washington. New Hampshire. on the west coast. or in Germany. Greece. or somewhere else. he goes wherever he is ordered to go. When he enters the service he loses all control over where he is to serve. Where he serves is entirely in the hands of his superior commanders. He has nothing to say about it. The Senator knows that during World War II there were many men who grieved because they were left at home. The same situation was true in World War I. I think the Senator and I can bear witness to the fact that during World War I. in which he and I both served in the Armed Forces. many men were dissatisfied because they were left at home and were not sent into some combat area. They felt that they had been called into service. or had volunteered. to fight for their country. In the case of many of them. instead of being sent to some combat area they were kept here. undoubtedly for some good reason. either to supervise training. give courses of instruction. or for some other particular purpose. So when a man once puts on his uniform and enters the service of the Armed Forces he loses all control over where he is to serve or what his service shall be. As the Senator knows. under the GI bill which we passed for the benefit of veterans of World War II. we had to accept the fact that a man had no control over the place of his service. and we drew no line of distinction so far as education and training benefits were concerned.",

I am satisfied that the adoption of the reservations would amount. in fact. to a rejection of the treaty. in the sense that it would have to go back to the 48 nations in the conference for renegotiation. I do not think it follows that because the reservations are an attempt to refer only to the obligations. duties. and liabilities of the United States under the treaty. therefore no other nation would have an interest in the reservations. The treaty is a joint enterprise among the 48 signers thereof. and it must be presumed that their signatures are based upon the assumption that whatever obligations. duties. and liabilities the United States assumed under the treaty when we signed it were at least a part of the consideration which induced the representatives of other nations. in turn. to sign the treaty. Therefore I think the adoption of these reservations would. in effect. amount to a rejection of the treaty. The second point I wish to make is with regard to the legal concept of sovereignty. Whenever we enter Into a treaty which involves conditions which we accept and which involves duties and obligations which we assume. in that sense the treaty affects the sovereignty of the United States. The question is not whether the treaty affects our sovereignty. but in what respects it affects our sovereignty. There is a need for a discourse which time does not now permit in this forum upon the legal implications of the word \"sovereignty.\" I respectfully submit that the term \"sovereignty\" is being used rather loosely in debate these days. All the major treaties which we have entered into throughout our history have had a direct bearing upon the sovereignty of the United States in the sense that every liability we have assumed under those treaties has affected our sovereignty. The question is. Does this treaty do damage to the sovereign rights of the United States? I think it does not. and therefore I shall vote for the treaty without reservations.",

I share the concern of the Senator from Idaho as to whether it is our country or the document called a treaty that is before the Senate at the present time that is going to be submitted to that treatment. Mr. President. I am frankly astonished at the treatment that was accorded reservation No. 1. and I am even more astonished at the discussion on the floor. because it entirely missed the point. If ever there was evidence that consideration of the treaty should be postponed. it is to be found in the discussion which took place a while ago on reservation No. 1. The language of the reservation is as follows: Nothing contained in this treaty shall be construed (a) to impose any limitations on the right of the United States as a sovereign power to exercise complete and unlimited control over its foreign policy. its military establishment. and its domestic concerns. or (b) to impose any continuing limitations on the full and unconditional sovereignty of Japan. It does not say we are going to exercise our sovereign power over foreign policy. but suppose we wanted to: then what? It does not say we are going to exercise our sovereign power with respect to the military establishment. but suppose a controversy arose between the United Nations and the United States with respect to the defense and protection of our troops in Korea? It does not say we are going to exercise our sovereign power with respect to domestic concerns. It says we reserve the right to do so. That matter was not made clear. Who could do less than to confess his astonishment that the discussion missed the whole point? Reservation No. 1 should have been adopted by the Senate of the United States. because it is far more important than are reservations 2. 3. and 4.

I cannot vouch for all the figures but since the bill provides for the elimination of the first three grades and a general increase of $400. it follows that the chafiges shown in section 12 (a) of P. L. 134. Salaries of Clerical Employees. and so forth. are in error. Three grades from eleven leave eight. not five. Also. adding $400 to the maximum grade salary of $3.670 raises it to $4.070 not $4.293.90. Apparently. the committee report uses the figures of the bill as introduced and not as reported out. Th3 Senate. when debating the companion bill. S. 355. seemed to have difficulty explaining the elimination of grade provisions. For your information. I will give you a brief summary. Public Law 134 (1945) added six grades (or step increases) to the previous fivegrade system. Those in the service were raised four grades but everyone entering after June 30. 1945. started in grade 1. the entrance salary established in 1926. In spite of all our efforts to remedy this injustice. nothing was done until 1949. when grades 1 and 2 were dropped for those receiving regular appointments. and grade 2 was dropped for substitutes. Inasmuch as almost all substitutes must servw more than a year before receiving a regular appointment ad a small sprinkling of jobs are the only positions for which direct regular appointments are made. only grade 2 was actually eliminated. In addition. those men above grade 2 received no benefits. while they actually composed the bulk of the postwar appointees. Under the House bill. H. R. 244. these men will be advanced two grades. Those who have already benefited by the 1949 law will advance. one or no grades. New appointments will be to the present grade 4. What can the gentleman say about that?",

However. the Post Office and Civil Service Committee in its wisdom. after full consideration of all the factors involved. has brought this measure to the floor. The committee spokesmen have assured us that the bill as presently drawn has the support of the majority of postal workers. If that is so. and I have no reason to doubt the fact. then I shall support the measure. If amendments are offered to improve the measure I shall support them also. Mr. Chairman. the basis for my support of H. R. 244 is to be found in the countless letters which have been written to me by postal employees who have pointed out that their present pay dces not enable them to meet living costs. Many of them have found it necessary to find parttime employment in addition to their regular work in order to supplement their income. The wives of many have been compelled to find employment also. Their standard of living has fallen below what it has been or should be. These employees who have served us faithfully and well throughout the years are entitled to receive better consideration and treatment at our hands. I sincerely trust that the House will pass this bill together with improving amendments. if any. What I have had to say concerning postal employees applies with equal force to other Federal employees. Upon completion of our consideration on H. R. 244. two other measures dealing with the subject of pay increases for other employ.ees will be taken up. I urge the House to give favorable consideration to these measures also.",

To my mind. that AsiaticPacific basket clause will wound the sensibilities of the people of Asia. people whose friendship we are endeavoring now to cultivate. It will be grist to the Communist mill.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I have always had difficulty In understanding just where the line of preference ended and that of discrimination began. We all have our preferences. As I suggested one day to a member of the minority who said a great deal about discrimination. every one of us discriminates when we exercise our preference for anything. as for example. to get married. or almost anything else we do. Our forefathers who founded this country came here. I have been told. to escape persecution. They wanted to enjoy liberty and freedom. But. if I remember correctly. about the first thing they did when they got here was to say that no one here in America should drink tea made from a certain shipment to Boston that came from Great Britain. They sure discriminated against that teathey dumped it into the harbor. Then. the next thing they did was to fight Great Britain and finally kick the British armies out. Yes. they surely discriminated against the British in those days. There is no doubt about that. The gentleman from New York just said that what this country needed was a new people. new seed. Evidently. he has so little faith in the present generation of Americans that he thinks we must go abroad and import more people in order to be able to continue our existence. He sure was completely wrong in his statement that our people do not live as longas in other days. I want to ask the gentleman from New York . continuing his argument. does he mean that when people come here from abroad. regardless of their station in life. their knowledge. their physical or mental condition. or their race. that they should intermarry with those who are here and create a new race of people? Is that your argument?",

This gentleman wants to bring these people in to strengthen this Nation. but he discriminates against them by saying that he does not advocate intermarriage with those who are here. He does not want to let them marry other people who are here. Why is he not consistent? He advocates the practicing of discrimination by those he would admit by holding that they should not intermarry with our own citizens. One moment he condemns discrimination. With his next breath he urges it be adopted by those his amendment would bring here. I go along with my friend from Mississippi in one thing. I am glad to see him here. Over the years he has insisted that if there were any people in this country that needed protection from those who practice discrimination while condemning it. it was the white gentiles. Is not that what you have here? I have no question. My answer is \"Yes.\" You will find that is the right answer. Who practices discrimination? Think that one over. Judge. from your own knowledge. Here is the situation. I ask you to look at the record of the various commissions and groups that have been created here under the last and the present administration. Who was it that was discriminated against? I recall one group that obtained control of a commission. a commission created to prevent discrimination. and what did that group do? Although they numbered but 9 percent of the population they held 52 percent of the jobs and spent 59 percent of the money that was appropriated to prevent discrimination. and they discriminated against every white American. Deeds of kindness. not words. from social reformers. socalled. and professional troublemakers is what we need.",

The principal purpose of the bill is to expedite the settlement of claims of merchant seamen injured on board ship including those owned by the United States Government. Merchant seamen are not covered by any compensation act and they must look to the courts of admiralty for adjudication of claims arising from injuries sustained in the course of their work. In admiralty. determination of issues both in fact and law are made by the court. Federal statute. however. makes exception in cases arising on certain classes of vessels engaged in coastwise trade and those vessels operating in interstate commerce on inland waters. In these cases either party to an action in a matter of contract or tort may request the determination of issues of fact by a jury. This limitation on jury trial has been severely criticized on several occasions by the courts. Judge Addison Brown in the Empire case (19 F. 588) stated: Why it should be limited to American vessels plying between domestic ports and denied to all foreign vessels. and to American vessels engaged in foreign trade. it is impossible to conceive. The bill will remove this unjust discrimination. In addition it will eliminate delays in the settlement of cases involving merchant seamen injured on vessels owned by the United States. through the waiver of Governmental immunity from suit. The bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative JOHN SHELLEY. of California. and as H. R. 5695. was referred to the Judiciary Committee in the House. The bill to amend title 28. United States Code. so as to extend the privilege of trial by jury to certain cases arising within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. was read twice by its title. and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.",

So the question arose as to whether we chould revise the program and ut it on a sounder experimental basis. or abandon it altogether. The Eightieth Congress approved a bill which was sponsored by the Senator from Arkansas and myself. It was a bipartisah measure. and was approved in the Senate without any serious opposition. It limited the number of counties which could be insured. We tried get the insurance companies interested in it. As I recall. the bill itself authorized the Federal Government to work through private insurance companies so far as possible. but except for writing hail insurance. they were not interested in crop insurance at all. and were hardly in_.terested in hail insurance. They had to cha i tllch a high rate that I do not think the companies thefit\ufffdeVes liked it. But the program worked out. and most of the crops insured finished in the black or broke even. It was used largely by tobacco growers and wheat growers. The Eightyfirst Congress. which is supposed to be the next worst in history until the Eightysecond is appraised. amended the bill so as to provide for extending the activities.

There was reason for increasing the appropriation. First of all. I wish to point out that we are dealing with a loan fund. and that the funds are repaid to the Treasury. The loans are made to a class of farmers who must have certification to the fact that they cannot obtain funds anywhere else. The repayments on principal amounts are running considerably more than 99 percent. If we include interest payments. which are made at a higher rate than the Government pays. it will be seen that the funds are paid off to an extent greater than the Government is out of pocket because of them. That is the first part of my statement. In the second place. the Bureau of the Budget recommended an increase in the loan fund to $110.000.000. They did it for two reasons. First. because of increased farming costs. fewer farmers can be assisted now than a year ago with the same amount of loan funds. The average size of initial adjustment loans has increased from $1.189 in 1949 to $1.360 in 1950. and for the current fiscal year it will average approximately $1.750.

There will be more applications from veterans. many of whom have received onthefarm training at the expense of the Federal Government. than this fund will be able to accommodate. This item is not costing the Government any money because it represents a loan which is repaid. However. if we strike out this item. we shall be denying operating funds to more than 7.000 farmers throughout the United States. and that at a time when we are requesting more farm production than we have ever had before.

We are building for ourselves a great defense structure for the purpose of maintaining our system of Government and our way of life. and Congress has authorized appropriations and has ordered the Government to move ahead in building a bulwark which will be absolutely irresistible and insurmountable.

I wish to associate myself with the fine principles the Senator from Minnesota has just enunciated. I think the principle he set forth in his last remarks is a great tribute to his statesmanship. I should like to know if he agrees with me that a church or a college or a socalled charitable institution that. separate and distinct from its college activities or its church activities or its charitable activities. owns a business. as it is now permitted to do under the charitable trust provision in the present law and in the laws of many States. or. let us say. owns an office building in some adjoining city from which It receives a large income each year. but in regard to which it is exempt from paying taxes. furnishes a good illustration of an institution placing a burden on other groups. It operates a business enterprise on which it does not pay taxes. but on which it ought to pay taxes. because it gets police protection. fire protection. and all the other services that go into tax costs. Is it not a good example of the advantage which can be taken of a tax loophole of that kind. when by what might be an immoral act. if one considers the morality of the situation. some churches. some lodges. some hospitals. some charitable institutions. are really operating today at the expense of all the taxpayers of the Nation?",

At a quarter to 12. as the bell sounded for the convening of the Senate at 12 oclock noon. we in committee were discussing the appropriation. Yesterday we had before us a joint resolution calling for $15.000.000. We approved it in only the matter of the length of time necessary to have the joint resolution explained to us. When we learned what it was for we approved it. We had not recessed that Appropriations Committee meeting for more than 2 hours when I received a telephone call that the House had increased the amount to $25.000.000 by adopting a floor amendment. The Appropriations Committee reconvened a few minutes before 12 today. and we again gave consideration to the matter. In view of the fact that the amendment had been placed on the joint resolution on the House floor. increasing the amount $10.000.000. we in our consideration of the matter followed the recommendation of the Bureau of the Budget. and the Appropriations Committee approved the joint resolution providing for $15.000.000. We felt that if we followed the recommendation of the Bureau of the Budgetand all this has taken place in the past 24 hourswe would be doing the just and the considerate thing as an appropriations committee. If I can be shown that at this moment it is necessary to provide $25.600.000 rather than $15.000.000 I would most happily vote for $25.000.000. because it will be necessary to aid municipalities. counties and States in the reconstruction of their sewer systems. their water systems. utilities of all kinds. otherwise there will be a terrible epidemic of disease in the now flooded area that can take a toll even as great as that taken by the devastating flood itself.

While we all join in seeing to it that appropriate relief assistance is given to the severely affected people in the floodstricken area. it is likewise important to remember that other parts of the country have also suffered disasters of similar proportions. I believe it is further proof of the importance of effective flood control. It is further evidence of the dereliction of public responsibility which we see occasionally when we strike out appropriations and authorizations for effective flood control. I am thinking at this moment of a community in my State which has had one flood after another. namely Aitken. Minn.. Its people have suffered severe personal property loss.. Yet in the House of Representatives the funds which had been requested for a survey by the Corps of Army Engineers were denied in the name of economy. I am thinking of another community. the city of North Mankato. Minn.. in which 4.500 people were flooded out of their homes. and where 90 percent of the homes were under water. They received no assistance whatever. Even at this hour the Corps of Army Engineers has been directed to stop any survey for the purposes of flood control in that area.

It has got to be in conformity with the Constitution of the United States. Then you bring it back here for approval. If we have the power to approve we likewise have the power of disapproval. I know it will be argued that because the Puerto Ricans convened a constitutional assembly and adopted this constitution. there is nothing further for the Congress to do except to approve it. But if one were to adopt that position. and I cannot under the language of the statute. then approval here would be a mere token. What was the reason why the Congress of the United States said that the Puerto Rican Constitution should come back here for approval? Why. to my mind it is simply because Puerto Rico is yet to be governed under the basic law that existed before this thing was ever started. They are not to be given independent status. they are. not to be given sovereign status. they are not to be given statehood. We yet carry a responsibility for Puerto Rico.

They said then it was administratively difficult. if. not impossible. to go back into all of these subcontracts involving raw materials. and to renegotiate them because the contractor himself might be producing in part for Government and in part for civilian use. and the job of allocating which raw materials went into war contracts and which went into civilian goods was such a problem that they did not at that time want to undertake it. In this bill we have not gone as far as we did in the World War i law with respect to the exemption of such products. Under this bill. the man who produces on the farm. produces from the mine. or produces oil or gas would. in general. be exempt from renegotiation up to the first commercially marketable state. In the Wurld War II act. however. the exemption applied to anyone who sold these raw products whether he produced them or not. We have limited it now to the producer. so it is a little more restrictive in that sense. We do not permit our definition of a raw product to go as high up the scale toward the finished product as was the case in the World War II act. This is of great importance. in my opinion. for in the case of the World War II acu we found that we had exempted specifically pig iron used in the manufacture of steel. but that. of course. is not what we had intended to do. I think perhaps those applying the Renegotiation Act went further in their interpretation of the language than we ever intended when we wrote the law itself.",

Let me talk just a moment on that. since the gentleman from Pennsylvania has informed me that he will not offer an amendment to prescribe such a limitation. In the first place. I do not know. and I doubt that any Member is in a position now to properly describe what is and what Is not a defense contract. We say contracts with defense establishments. the Army. Navy. Air Force. Atomic Energy Commission. the Department of Commerce. which is the Maritime Administrationthat is what we are getting at in that Departmentand with General Services Administration which does do some buying of raw materials and other things that go directly into the war effort. as I understand it. We specify certain departments of Government that deal almost exclusively in defense contracts. But if we would say in this bill that there shall be no renegotiation of any contract except a defense contract. then it is necessary. as I take it. for us to define what we mean by a defense contract. What would be a defense contract? I will ask any of you gentlemen who have worked with this a lot longer than I have on the Ways and Means Committee and the Appropriations Committee where you are making appropriations for the defense. What is a defense contract? If we thus limit the application of the bill to a defense contract without defining what we mean by \"defense.\" have we actually accomplished anything. because the definition. unless we define it. will be left to this renegotiation board? I am glad the gentleman from Pennsylvania is agreeable to passage of the bill by the House in its preent form applying to all contracts entered into by these specifically named departments in order to avoid any possibility of ambiguity as to what we Intend or mean. and especially in view of the fact we have never defined. or we have never limited renegotiation in the past to strictly defense contracts or to war contracts.

The only tax reductions we have had In a dozen or more years came as a result of the performance of the Eightieth Congress. Whenever anyone tells our Federal administrators that we should start in at once to cut down on Washington spending. he is promptly asked the question. \"Where?\" Dozens of answers have been suggested. but none has ever found general acceptance by a Government determined to maintain its civilian personnel at the highest possible level. Senator HARRY BYRD. of Virginia. has proposed several alternative budgets in recent years. All have been commended. but not one has ever been tried by the Government. Within the past week there has been much discussion of his plan to reduce nonmilitary expenditures by approximately $7.000.000.000. When we remember that the Federal budget for the fiscal year from June 30. 1951. to July 1. 1952. contemplates expenditures of $75.000.000.000. with estimated revenues figured at only fiftyone billions. the necessity for sharp cutting of our spending program becomes all too obvious. There is every reason to believe that the $25.000.000.000 deficit estimated for the Cming year will be matched in other years to come. Senator BYRD has suggested that we trim the postal deficit by $3.600.000.000. cut our civilian payroll in the military departments by 150.000 personswe now have 1 civilian for every 2 men in uniform. reduce our foreignaid program to $500.000.000 from the present four billions in view of our military assistance plans for oversea aid.

Mr. President. only 10 days ago. after all the arguments against the plan had been developed. the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report formally announced its support of the plan and answered convincingly every argument made against it. The committee emphasized thatThe plan would strike a death blow at politics in tax collecting. 1. The plan. while not perfect. is a good one. following the recommendations of the Hoover Commission as we have certified. 2. The plan offers the first tangible opportunity to break up the political patronage system in accordance with the Hoover Commissions proposals. and this drive would suffer a sharp setback were the plan to be defeated. 3. Reorganization sentiment. both for this plan and for the other recommendations of the Hoover Commission. has been gathering force rapidly throughout the Nation and tis sentiment is being reflected in Congress. 4. The administration. according to the Budget Director. is currently working on a number of additional plans. which If permitted to become effective. will constitute further important progress toward our common objective. and the possibility of transmission and later approval of these plans would be greatly diminished were so crucial a proposal as plan No. 1 to be defeated.

I think the Members of this House want to give this whole proposition another thorough looking into. Let me recall to you first. every organization in that particular county that I know of is opposed to this expenditure. They are opposed not only from the viewpoint of the waste of taxpayers funds. but because of the fact that it would create a blight upon the area immediately surrounding this proposed 4.000.acre site. The FHA just announced a month or so ago that they would not insure property located within a certain distance of airports. Why should we place another airport 14 miles airline from the Washington National Airport? Why should we expend $50.000.000 if not more when we have this great 4.500acre site at Baltimore already constructed?

He is doing a wonderful job and will be doing a better job if given the power that Congress said last year would be given to him.

I am told that one of the large corporations of the country has 70 representatives here in Washington. D.

I feel that he has fallen prey to that illadvised group which is endeavoring to smear one of the greatest generals the United States has ever had. They do this for the sole purpose of attempting to justify. in the eyes of the American people. the Presidents unprecedented action which was apparently taken in a fit of rage. Of course. Mr. Speaker. I do not know what took place when we were not together as a committee. but as far as I am concerned. I want the record to showFirst. That at no time did General MacArthur or General Willoughby advocate the bombing of China or the occupation of China by American forces. Second. The first time I heard the cost of bombing China would be $10.000.000.000 and $40.000.000.000 more for occupation was when I read the Washington Post and the CONGRESSONAL RECORD. Third. I emphasize that General MacArthur never advocated starting a war in the Far East. He is not that kind of man. Fourth: MacArthu: did suggest a gift of 500 planes to Chiang Kaishek. It was my understanding that these planes were to be used for defense. Fifth. MacArthur 61 say that Chiang had some corrupt army men but added it must be remembered that Chiang fought communism longer and harder than any other tndivi:ial. Sixth. At no time did General Willc.ughby assure us \"that there would be no war in Korea for 2 years.\" As a matter of fact. I have received information showing that the military intelligence section of General MacArthurs command notified Washington of the impending North Korean attack 3 months before the attack. Seventh. General Roberts did express grave concern over the Korean situation but that was not over the North Korean dtvisions referred to by the gentleman from Virginia that Syngman Rhee was not being given the military aid that the Congress had provided for. Mr. Speaker. General Willoughby is on his way to the United States to appear before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. I am sure he would welcome a hearing before any congressional committee that desires to hear his testimony.",

The 500 planes that might be given for defense purposes on Formosa and might be used to stop aggression were mentioned. Never once did General MacArthur advocate that we come back here and urge the Congress of the United States to furnish these 500 planes. It was said to us in confidence in reply to a question that I asked. He never advocated it on his own volition. It came only because of a question that I asked General MacArthur. Furthermore. I want to say this: That in the presence of the general I do not think there was cne man sitting at that table who took down notes. I never would have had the courage.

It carries the date June 12. 1952. I am purposely withholding from the record the names of these 35 servicemen. although as I hold the letter in my hand you can see their signatures from where you sit. I have also eliminated the name of the.Korea area from which this letter was sent. I have changed the number of the hill which is referred to in one portion of this letter so that it cannot help identify these men. I have made these deletions and changes because they in no way alter the facts stated in this letter. and inasmuch as this letter makes serious statements of fact concerning the shortage of ammunition in Korea. I think it might cause the parents of these boys a great deal of anxiety if they knew their sons were fighting under such conditions. This letter is addressed to myself and my colleague from Ohio. the Honorable JOHN VORYS. as the result of a news story which the servicemen read that was published on May 16 in this country. Members of the House Rules Committee will -7856 recall that on May 15. when the $7.900.000.000 foreignaid bill was before the Rules Committee. I raised serious questions about why we were sending our latest model weapons to Europe while forcing our fighting men in Korea to suffer casualties in combat because they were fighting with outmoded equipment and were tragically handicapped by the lack of ammunition.

I believe. however. that basically there is much in the amendment that should be discussed. and I seriously doubt that the Senate can votb intelligently upon an amendment such as the one the Senator from Arkansas has proposed after a debate of only 30 minutes to each side. Therefore. if we discuss the amendment. we had better do so in very plain language. Then it could be rejected or it could be referred to committee. or some other disposition made of it. rather than have it become law. Mr. President. it is necessary for me to disagree to the amendment which the Senator from Arkansas has just ably discussed. First of all. the effect of his proposal is to repeal the Ferguson amendment. which was approved by the Senate on Friday of last week. However. as I interpret the new amendment. it does much more than to allow continuation of the International Materials Conference. and I hope that the Senate will note its implications quite carefully. In the first place. the amendment speaks of economic mobilization and what may be done to insure its accomplishment under the provisions of this proposal. Why does the amendment speak initially of economic mobilization but not mention military mobilization? Does the amendment intend to give the President sufficient authority to direct economic mobilization. whether for defense or nondefense purposes. in any nation of the world?",

This certainly takes in all agricultural and mineral products. and may also include manufactured goods. We have been speaking of copper. but cotton and wool are already under the IMC. I am also deeply concerned because the provisions of the amendment allow committees of international representatives to discuss the effective distribution of any materials. In other words. those representatives would have the authority to say what is best for the whole world. I ask the Senate whether we are ready to abandon free competitive world markets. which historically have set the prices and determined the distribution of available materials. I remind the Senate that on Monday of this week we reaffirmed our faith in free competitive enterprise when we approved the MSA bill. which specifically urged European countries to abandon cartel practices which they have followed for many years. By any stretch of the imagination does the Senate believe that such a group of men. no matter how competent. how endowed. how distinguished. how industrious. can plan the lives of more than 2.000.000.000 people? Mr. President. this amendment is in essence a declaration of belief in world planning or world socialism. It also should be noted that representatives from this country on the committees are designated by the President. with the advice and consent of the Senate.

In other words. as I interpret the recommendation. the President will be able to implement recommendations of a group of representatives of foreign powers in which the United States has only a single vote. I grant that such action by the President must be qualified by his finding that the decisions are necessary In the interest of national defense. But if the committees felt it was necessary to divert substantial materials from our own people to other nations. thus lowering the standard of living in the United States. the recommendation could be implemented by the authority granted in this amendment. Mr. President. I am fearful that the real effect of the amendment may be a step toward a world government. In this connection. I wish also to call the Senates attention to an interesting sentence which appears in the report on operations of the International Materials Conference.

As a matter of fact. certain of the recent changes in CMP were suggested by the subcommittee itself. The mere fact that these changes have been necessary might be viewed as evidence of the inherent weakness of the original system. This is a report by a committee of the House of Representatives which is dedicated to the assistance of small business in the United States. It has been studying this problem. It has been studying the effects of CMP for a considerable time. I quote from page 7 of the same report: Nor was the subcommittee convinced of the utility of the quantitive control of steel. copper. and aluminum as a device to regulate the entire industrial process. I quote from page 9 of the same report: Increase in productive capacity is the only basic solution to the problem of mounting needs for scarce materials. The subcommittee was quite disturbed. therefore. at the weaknesses in the programs for expanding the productive capacity of the steel. aluminum. and copper industries. In September the expansion programs were clearly behind schedule. Furthermore. responsibility for the expansion programs did not seem to be clearly flxed.

Vogeler. socalled confessions have been extracted from Archbishop Groesz and his fellow defendants. The silent answer of the Hungarian people to these outrageous actions by their Red oppressors and rulers is to be seen in the fact that they are attending church services in greater number than ever. The Catholic Church is the particular target of the Communist commissars in Hungary because of the devotion of the people to their faith. Those who live in freedom and under a just and ethical system of law. as well as the Hungarian people themselves. will recognize the current trial for exactly what it isDeclared the United States Department of State this weeka continuation of Communist efforts to suppress all human rights and liberties. to crush all elements who will not become subservient to the regime. and to destroy the moral and religious influence of the churches.

That is. if the entire proposal were put into effect in the steel mills as recommended by the Wage Stabilization Boardwage increases. fringe improvements. and all indirect effects on labor cost. But now if you will look at the integrated industry. and that brings in limestone. coal and coke. then you get these figures. if you take the entire integrated industry. Then you would find that the cost increase would amount to $3.49 in the first half of 1952. $4.58 in the second half. averaging $4.03 for all of 1952. Now after January 1. 1953. it would be $5.94. and the average for the 18 months would be $4.67. But let me say this: That these figures are based on the assumption that wage increases in coal. in ofe mines. and in limestone quarries would equal those in the steel mills as to both terms and effective dates.

I submit that in the interest of checking inflation. it is only fair. reasonable. and right to expect the steel companies to assume at least some of the cost of the recommendations of any wage increase and other benefits which are granted. because if they are given price increases that assume the entire cost. then all that is. done Is to feed the spiral of inflation rather than check it. The newspaper writer to whom I referred also said: Another misrepresentation has been the careless statement in Congress that the steel companies are building steel plants \"tax free\" and with money furnished by the taxpayers. Mr. President. let us analyze that problem. I am proud to be among those who. in connection with the present steel crisis. have pointed out the significance of benefits the steel industry derives from accelerated amortization. and I most emphatically want to state that these benefits are real and amount to savings of tremendous sums of money for the steel companies.

In the bill which the House Is now considering there is an item for $40.000 for research in black shank. a disease which affects tobacco. This disease first appeared in the United States in 1915 in the State of Florida. After this. it spread to various parts of the country. and now causes millions of dollars worth of damage to the tobacco crop in the United States each year. The seriousness of the spread of this dreaded disease has recently attracted a great deal of attention. for it is spreading into new areas and is steadily growing worse in areas which are already affected by it. In 1945 an inspection showed that 146 farms in Virginia were infected by this disease. 800 in North Carolina. and 20 in Kentucky. In 1950 the infection had spread to 2.919 farms in Virginia. 27.035 in North Carolina. and 751 in Kentucky. At the present time there is not a single county in the State of North Carolina which produces large amounts of bright fluecured tobacco that is not affected by the black shank disease. The same is true of the State of Virginia also. As the Members of this legislative body know. I am very interested in the problems of the farmers of this country. I have authored legislation for their benefit since I have been a Member of Congressamong which are the Kerr Tobacco Act. which was the beginning of our present control system. and the Kerr Seed Act. which prohibits the exportation of our tobacco seeds. I urge each Member of this House to support this small request for $40.000 to carry on research in the black shank disease. which is causing the farmers to lose money each year. We are spending money in all parts of the world. Surely we can afford to spend some here at home to benefit our own people.",

Mr. Speaker. who has given more generously and unselfishly of his time and his great talents to our country. The job that he was called upon to do in taking over the chairmanship of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities called for statesmanship. called for a man whose every instinct was one of patriotic concern for his country and for the citizens of this great country.

I beg the indulgence of the House in order that I may say a few words about a friend of long standing. with whom I have enjoyed serving during the 6 years I have been in Congress. Southerners have often been maligned by people who do not always understand Southerners by nature. Southerners usually are individualists. and there is reason for that. We have had pretty tough going in days gone by. especially in Georgia. Being a colonial State. we produced a type of citizenry that in many respects is somewhat different than those in other sections of the country. The Revolutionary blood of the early settlers still remains in the descendents of those early people in Georgia. They are rather unique even today. The average Georgian is a person who prides himself on the fact that he can shoot a pistol straight. play a good game of cards. and do an honest days work. and at the same time when Sunday comes around can lay aside more mundane things and worship God with great fervor. Above all else. Georgians are patriotic. JOHN WOOD has brought to the Congress that sort of spirit. He has truly been a patriot in the service he has rendered to the United States. All of America is indebted to this man for the fine way in which he has conducted the affairs of the Committee on UnAmerican Activities. Even before he brought that service to the Congress. he gave to the people of Georgia a full life of wonderful public service. He is respected. honored. and held in great esteem by every one in the State of Georgia who knows him. and I may say that the name of JOHN WOOD is well known throughout our State.",

I sponsored amendments in committee that I had hoped would be accepted. When the committee saw fit not to accept the amendment we had offered I had prepared a substitute that the Committee on Foreign Affairs did accept. and it is explained in the report. on page 72.

The simple fact remains that the .countries we are assisting with our American money do not have the slightest conception of the principles of taxation. nor the slightest conception of how to collect taxation they now have. They need our advice. In Europe especially. leaving out Great Britain. I found that the tax system was absolutely ridiculous. in other words. we are taking money from our people and ourselves. doing it gladly. and channeling it into Europe where they. in turn. are not paying taxes to support their share of the burden of rehabilitating their countries and of preparing for defense against the common foe. We send to Europe technical experts. agricultural experts. and military experts. This amendment merely states that no country shall receive assistance that does not from our country accept tax experts to advise in collection of taxes. When I was in Rome in December. on the front page of every paper. every paper in all of Italy. there was a picture and a headline of the one man in all of Italy who was honest enough to pay his correct taxes. That is a matter of record. The Premier of France now is doing his best to change the tax structure of France from the standpoint of collections. However. there is not a single penalty in any European country for anyone who does not pay their taxes. Only in Great Britain have the people really put their shoulders to the wheel. I do not believe it is fair to the American people to spend our money. the money that comes from the pocketbooks of the rich as well as the poor. and let the people at the top in Europe. the cream. get richer. and the milk at the bottom be skimmed more and more.

That will be the responsibility of those who want to tamper with the security of the United States. This question. as I understand. turns on the news that there has not been any tax bill passed. We will pass a tax bill before we go home. If we do not. when we get home. if I know the President of the United States. I think he will have us back here until we do pass one. That is what I would do if I were in his place. which I never will be. But Mr. Truman has called us back before. and certainly he has a precedent in his favor. But. above all. he has common sense.

No one has suggested a method of stopping the President. He has stated to Congress that it has no authority whatever. in this matter and we have not been able to refute him.

I consider Mr. Churchill to be the greatest statesman alive today. I wish we in the United States had a few men like him. - He is for England in all he does. Early in World War II. while the war was still confined to Europe. before the United States had entered the war. Mr. Churchill said to the United States. in general terms. \"Give us the money we need. We will fight the war.\" Later he said. speaking of lendlease and of other ways of getting equipment from the United States. \"Give us the equipment we need. We will furnish the men.\" Later on during the war. in a speech which was published in every newspaper in the world. he said. \"We are destroying the seed of England. You must send us more troops.\" We ended up by furnishing nearly threequarters of the Allied troops fighting in Europe. We are headed in exactly the same direction at the present time. In answer to the remainder of the question of the distinguished Senator from Kansas. I will say: No. there has been nothing said about the proportion of troops to be furnished. What is now being done by the administration is simply the breaking of the ice. pacifying the people in order to get our troops to Europe. No one believes the present two divisions can do anything effective in Europe. No one believes that the four additional divisions would be of much help to the two divisions of American soldiers now there. In my humble opinion. no one who has studied the question believes that any force consisting of less than 300 divisions is going to stop Russia in Europe.

Of course. it will be necessary for those forces to be properly armed when they begin operations. in order for them to be able to be effective.

Mr. President. Russia will not move against us as long as we are floundering. that is my opinion.

The Russians will probably never allow us to make adequate preparations in Europe and install our army there. Air power is the only deterrent to Russian aggression.

He seemed to have established a line of conduct on foreignproject appropriations which it is difficult for me to forget. I am glad to know of his conversion. and I appreciate his efforts to remove from these bills any of the fat that should be removed. Recently I made an investigation. from which I found that under the Marshall plan. the ECA. and the various other foreign relief and aid programs for overseas areas we have authorized or have spent $1.800.000.000 on reclamation and power projects in Europe. Asia. and Africa. I wish to call the attention of the Senator from Illinois to that fact. Apparently the administration is not willing to do anything much about reclamation in Utah. We cannot even get from the administration an estimate for a simple project calling for $1.350.000. even though that project is in a defense area. For the upper Colorado storage and related projects. we could not even get the Secretary of the Interior to send the report of the Reclamation Bureau to Congress. as is provided for under the reclamation law. Even if that project were authorized today. it might be 10 years before its construction would be begun. So I join with the Senator from Illinois in his desire to achieve economy. but if he wishes to put Illinois on the same basis as other States. including Utah. it will be necessary to cut the items in the bill much more than the Senator from Illinois is attempting to cut them.",

Only seven have gone up and only a few canoes have been able to come down through the rapids. The upper Colorado River certainly is not navigable. whereas the rivers in Illinois are navigable. and. as is said in our State song. they are \"gently flowing.\" and they certainly do not have the rapidity of flow the upper Colorado River has. Mr. President. I submit this initial recommendation simply to show my good faith.

I think it demonstrates the precise point I made in August of 1950. namely. that once the authorization for highways is passed then for all practical purposes. we lose control over subsequent appropriations for highways. I do not accept this premise. But I must certainly admit that Congress seems to operate on this basis. It is claimed that we are faced with a contractual obligation. My purpose in offering the amendment was to separate completely the contractual argument from the substance of the amendment which I shall shortly substitute for the pending amendment. The substitute amendment will have absolutely no effect on these socalled contractual agreements. I hope I shall be forgiven for offering my amendment after having offered the pending proposal. But we have become so habituated to raising the old contractual argument every time we propose a reduction in highway funds that I felt my amendment would be clearer to proceed in this manner. What I shall actually propose is this: A reduction of $50.000.000. The socalled commitments which this money is intended to fulfill can be met out of funds appropriated in the regular appropriations bill which should become law in a month or two. Thus the actual reduction would be made from funds appropriated for the fiscal year 195253. A reduction equal to $50.000.000 in the amounts to which the Bureau of Public Roads could commit us for the corresponding fiscal year would be made by adding a proviso that no part of the money could be disbursed to States unless they submitted programs which were 10 percent smaller than their allocations. Thus. by adopting my amendment. we could save $50.000.000 without upsetting any claimed commitments. We can do this since no State has as yet submitted programs in excess of 90 percent of their allocation for 195253.",

Bureau of Public Roads apportions money to States. Second. States submit programs. Third. Bureau of Public Roads approves program. Fourth. award of contracts. At this point the Government is claimed to be bound by contract to pay the sums contracted for. Fifth. States submit progress vouchers and receive payments of 90 percent of the Federal share for work in place. Sixth. States submit final vouchers for complete settlement of Federal share.

The point I am trying to make is that as of the first of April of this year only 18 percent of the funds allocated have been covered by definite programs submitted by the States. Arizona has programed a higher percentage of its total allocation than any other State. And even Arizona still has 19 percent of its allocation unprogramed.

The amendment which I have offered would place a limit of 90 percent on the estimated positions. As I understand. the budget figures. when first submitted. showed that there would be an estimated number of 546.000 graded civilian positions in the Military Establishment. Of course. as of June 30. 1951. they had not reached that total. I believe the budget figures indicate that they had 439.991 positions as of that date. In other words. they had roughly 105.000 positions to go to reach the budget estimate of June 30. 1952. If we cut down the estimated number in the budget 10 percent. it would take off roughly 54.600. and give a ceiling of 491.000 positions. It would be an increase of 51.000 over the figure that obtained on June 30. and it would be a decrease of roughly 56.000 positions.\" I am not unmindful of the fact that one can argue well on both sides of the question. In the first place. we have an expanding military program. I suppose it is fair to assume that extra positions will be added. On the other hand. in going around the country and making observations in one place and another. I concur in the observation made earlier in the spring on a number of military policy bills. that there is still a substantial waste of civilian manpower. I know of no way of dealing with it except to shrink the ceiling. The amendment would cut it by 10 percent. so that the ceiling would be about 491.000. instead of 530.000. as carried in the bill. That is the whole. story of the amendment in a nutshell.",

We have put in the national emergency fund. which has had the approval of the Senate. a provision to procure additional aircraft and additional air personnel. so that the United States of America and all of its people may knowand that. more important than that. that the Soviet dictators and their satellites may knowthat the United States of America is building an air power that will be capable of delivering. in case of necessity. to the very heart of Communist aggression the weapons which research and development are making available to us. It was for that reason that the committee in reviewing this matter. instead of adopting a ceiling of 500.000. which was proposed by the Senator from MichIgan LMr. FERGUSON]. adopted a ceiling of 530.000. I readily give the assurance to the Senator from Illinois that it will be the purpose of the Appropriations Committee carefully to police all of these positions. The committee intends to proceed with that work. The additional personnel allowed by the amendment just adopted was for the purpose of enabling air power to be expanded. Therefore. in those circumstances it is obvious. when the Senator offers an amendment which says that the ceiling shall be 90 percent of what the Budget Bureau estimated. inasmuch as the Budget Bureau never estimated anything for the additional appropriation which we have made for air power. we would by that very act impede the capacity of the Navy and the Air Force to expand as Congress wants them to expand.",

I believe the weakness of the committees position and the weakness of the position of the Bureau of the Budget. with which I have had a good -many.. dealings over a long period of years. is simply this: I could never find that they had had adequate staffing to go into the field and there make a survey and adequate exploration as to what the needs were. Normally -their explorations and surveys consist of having departmental budget officers lay the case before them. They cut a little here. cut a little there. augment a little here. and finally come up with the ultimate figure. The other point is that the Senate Appropriatiorfs Committee and the House Appropriations Committee are not staffed for constant surveillance of the agencies of government in Washington and in the field. to ascertain what an adequate personnel complement really is. I think a large element of guesswork is involved. The only way I can come to a conclusion regarding the matter is to keep my eyes open and to observe as I go from ode place in the country to another. As I do so. I see a considerable waste of manpower in many places where the Government has. headquarters establishments and military establishments of one kind. or another. I am firmly of the opinion that there is overstaffing. and that a 90percent directive would make it possible to carry on the expanded program in the building up of our air power.

I have no doubt that there are such cases. but. as I have said before and as I announced at the meeting of the full committee. it will be our purpose as a committee to summon the responsible officials of each of the military departments before us and make them go into this matter in detail. We have already been doing that. For instance. I now hold in my hand a letter which I received from the Assistant Secretary of Defense. Anna M. Rosenberg. I read a portion of the letter: I am enclosing a copy of a Department of Defense directive. which I know will be of interest to you. This directive is in line with our increased activities for more effective utilization of military and civilian personnel. and incorporates the following major features: 1. Establishes a ceiling for all military and civilian personnel in departmental activities in the Washington area at the strengths actually on board on July 20. 1951. Included are the departmental activities of the Army. Navy. Marine Corps. and Air Force. as well as those in the various boards and activities supporting the Secretary of Defense. 2. Within the next 90 days. each military department and the agencies of the Office of the Secretary of Defense must achieve a 5percent reduction in both military and civilian strengths within the departmental activities referred to above. These reductions will be accomplished through normal attrition or turnover. insofar as practicable. rather than through arbitrary reductions in force. 3. Military personnel will not be used to replace. civilian personnel. nor shall we permit the intent of this directive to be circumvented by the expanded use of temporary duty. detail of individuals from field activities (either within or outside of the Washington area). or by any similar actions.

I do not accept those figures without some little doubt. unless they can be verified in a wholly impartial fashion. In the second place. it does not appear that the Senate Appropriations Committee has an adequate staff or a field staff which can adequately handle this matter. and the only things the committee presents to us are the result of crossexaminations in the committee.

If that be true. and I think it is borne out by the figures carried in the bill. it certainly detracts from the case made by the Senator from Wyoming. Mr. President. the House has established no ceiling. I see no reason why the Senate conferees cannot take the amendment to conference and there go into the matter with the conferees on the part of the House. and finally determine what should be done. I renew my observation that there Is no staff of ours which has gone through the personnel figures. which are just so much guesswork unless they are verified. I think that anyone who has observed in various places in the United States the various military installations of one kind or another cannot help but come to the conclusion that they are overstaffed. Finally. Mr. President. every Member of Congress has. after all. some concern for those who are in uniform. men of good will. men of ability. men of integrity. who are interested in the solvency of the country and who constantly emphasize and bear down on the fact that there is a waste of civilian manpower in the military establishment at th& present time.",

There never was a time when we acted at all according to party lines. there was no partisan division at all. We were concerned with only one thing. namely. to report a bill which would enable the Department of Defense to provide effectively and efficiently for the defense of our country. I wish to say to the Senator from Illinoisand I beg him to believe what I saythat the Under Secretary of Defense. who now has been nominated to take the place of General Marshall. Mr. Robert Lovett. throughout the consideration of the budget left no stone unturned to eliminate unnecessary appropriations. Mr. Wilfred J. McNeil. the various def partmental secretaries. the entire staff of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. and members of the departmental staff. were all cooperating with the committee in its effort to reduce appropriations. If the Senator has observed what has been said here. he will know that. even when the Department asked for restorations. the committee never went along with the full amount of restoration requested. except. perhaps. in one instance which comes to my mind. There has been a studious and intensive effort to keep personnel down. and to save dollars. The committee is not dropping the matter now. but will proceed. I am not at all sure. I may say to the Senator. that a large additional staff would be helpful and efficient.

No provision has been made for the situation in Indiana. This is perhaps an understandable oversight. since the Indiana gross income tax law. as I have pointed out. is unique in its operation. It is to correct this inequity and to give business in Indiana the same margins allowed by operators of other States that I am offering this amendment. You will note that in cases where the amount of the Indiana gross income tax is less than onehalf cent on the transaction it shall not be allowable as a passthrough item. I should also like to point out to you that if the Indiana law provided for a net income tax the present situation would not be so acute. The fact that it is. however. a tax on gross income or gross receipts. ranging in amounts equal in some instances to almost half the profit margin. makes it a serious matter which deserves the sympathetic consideration of this body.

Would not your amendment give the merchant in Indiana the right to make a little more profit on the merchandise that he is selling because he is able to add the same tax onto it. whereas a man in a nonsalestax State would not be able to add on any tax. and he would have to absorb it in the selling price?",

But in the salestax States it is added to the dollarsandcents ceiling and it is collected as a separate tax at the timc. which the consumer pays. the merchant just simply being the agent by whom the collections are made and the money sent on to the State government. The same thing applies in our State under this gross income or gross salestax operation. except it does not show as a separate item of tax in connection with the price of the article which is delivered to the customer.

Mr. Chairman. in reference to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire I would like to add just this: In the last part of the colloquy. the gentleman from Washington indicated that part of these funds for the construction of transmission lines would be used for the purpose of getting power from some of the hydroelectricpower dams that were under construction or that might possibly be under construction in that particular area of the country. The subcommittee on civil functions appropriations has partial jurisdiction over the construction of certain power dams in the Columbia River Valley. I happen to be a membdr of this subcommittee. I am not at liberty at this time to divulge exactly what our subcommittee has done or might do in reference to the budget requests for the construction of some of these projects in the Northwest. but using the example of what was done by the civil functions subcommittee last year when we considered the Presidents budget. I think it may be fair to say. without revealing any confidences. that some of these projects in the Northwest will be slowed down a bit from the schedule set up in the Presidents budget. If we are going to slow down the construction schedule of some of these hydroelectric power projects in the Northwest. it is sensible to likewise slow down the construction of transmission lines which will transmit the power from the dams to other parts of that area. I think you will find that we can well afford to make a reduction in the funds for the Bonneville Power Administration simply because a construction schedule for a part of these projects in that area might likewise be curtailed in part. The amendment offered by the gentleman from New Hampshire does tie into the construction schedule for these hydroelectric projects in that part of the country. consequently I wholeheartedly and most emphatically recommend the adoption of the gentlemans amendment.",

I would like to call attention to the fact that included in new construction funds is $12.000.000 for line which will bring power from the McNary Dam into Pasco. into Richland. into Big Eddy. Portland. and Vancouver. into Kennewick and into the Walla Walla areas. In addition. there is $3.500.000 to bring power into the Bremerton Navy Yard area from across Puget Sound. involving a large submarine cable. Also included are two lines from Chief Joseph Dam to the Snohomish. Wash.. substation in sum of $7.685.000. To understand the need for these new lines. please bear in mind that there are two large dams that will come into operation during this fall and in January of 1953. In October Hungry Horse will come into operation. when the first generator will go on the line. McNary Dam will put its first generator on the line in Now. it certainly does not make sense to be building two dams that will produce about 1.500.000 kilowatts of power and then not build the transmission lines to take the power from the dams. These lines are vitally necessary to the delivery and use of this new power. Without them the power will not be sold and the investment in the dams will be wasted.",

It is quite obvious that it will be completed. As the gentleman from Washington has just explained. two large dams will start generators on the line this coming year. That power will simply have to go out into thin air unless there are transmission lines to take it away. But. in my opinion. more important than even that fact is that this money for construction of lines is also for the development of things that are badly needed in our present defense effort. I do not propose to work the atomic energy angle in this talk of mine. I want to mention something else. Mr. Chairman. there is in process of planning at this moment a mine and .processing plant in the southwestern part of the State of Oregon to produce nickel. Nickel is a very. very sorely needed product in the United States. This plant is to be installed by a very large industrial company. They have allocated more than a million dollars for the first operation there. They have planned to make an announcement on the 1st of April regarding their construction plans. They will produce a vast quantity of nickel. which the Government needs in its arms program. But this company has to have available to it 65.000 kilowatts of power. and there is not that amount of power available anywhere near this proposed plant. I think it is utter folly. in view of the fact that the lines will ultimately be constructed. to slow down or even stop this construction program now.",

JACK ANDERSON is the third generation of native Californians. whose heritage has been so closely identified with the development of California and the West and particularly with our agricultural economy. JACK ANDERSON is a typical Californian and has been an important personality with the specialty agricultural crop production which has formed the background of California prosperity and was the mecca of attraction for the great migration that has builded the West. For many years JACK ANDERSON has been Chairman of the Agricultural Subcommittee of the California delegation and his knowledge of our problems made him extremely helpful to all of our Members. In his energetic leadership he was most helpful in apprising the Members of Congress and the affected agencies of our problems and enlisting their sympathetic consideration. His service on many committees of this body. and particularly the Armed Services Committee of which he is an outstanding member. did credit to himself and honor to the State of California. as well as the district he was privileged to represent. The 14 years he has so ably served this country. I know. has left an impression on him which will never be forgotten and I am sure that his interest in the welfare of his State and Nation will not be diminished because of the severance of his ties here in Washington. I expect that as the years go on. his interest will remain keen and that on occasions we may see him in Washington where we may counsel with him on the problems that will continue to be ours.

It was easy for me. a freshman. to recognize the fine quality of statesmanship in JACK ANDERSON. who for 14 years has served in Congress with honor and distinction. His service on many committees of this body. and particularly the Armed Services Committee. of which he is an outstanding member. did credit to himself. to the Nation. the State of California. as well as the district he was privileged to represent. Jacks energetic leadership has won for him the high esteem in which he is regarded by all Members of this House. The aisle intersecting this body proved no barrier to the warm friendship enjoyed by Jack and his fellow Members. As a Democrat and a Floridian I highly treasure the friendship of JACK ANDERSON. a Republican and Californian. The life of a Congressman is hard but it is a rewarding one. in many respects. One of my rewards has been to know and serve with Jackfor. to me. he typifies the finest qualities of a public servant. The State of California and the United States is losing a great Congressman.

    "speech": "ContinuIng with my statement. on the basis of the expressed view of the Senate in these and other cases. my colleague and I considered seriously raising an objection to the New Jersey nomination to which I have already referred. I am frank to say that we decided not to do so for two reasons: First. because there had already been a delay of over 15 months in making a nomination to fill this vacancy in spite of a heavily congested calendar in the districtI shall refer to this delay again laterand. second. because we felt it was more appropriate to raise this issue of prior consultation on its own merits without basing our argument on a single case and thus. of necessity. singling out a single individual for criticism and investigation. It seems to me reasonably simple for the executive and legislative branches to work out cooperatively a procedure for prior consultation. Such a procedure would. in my judgment. involve the following steps: First. The Senators from the State where the vacqncy exists should be officially informed by the executive of the vacancy and requested to submit to the executive the names of qualified candidates. with such supporting data as they see fit. for consideration along with the names of qualified candidates suggested by other sources. Second. The executive should subsequently notify Sena..ors of the names of candidates who are being actively considered for nomination to positions in the State of such Senators. and supply them with full information as to the qualifications and character of the candidates. Third. The executive should arrange a meeting with the appropriate Senators. that is. Senators from the States concerned. prior to the final selection of a nominee. so that an attempt may be made to reach agreement. Fourth. If agreement is not reached. the executive would of course retain the sole responsibility and duty to submit to the Senate the namc of a candidate whom it considers qualified. But the Senators of the State concerned would. of course. have the right to present to the Judiciary Committee and to the Senate all the facts bearing on the case. I hope the Judiciary Committee will give careful consideration to this suggestion which I feel would best carry out the intent and spirit of the advice and consent clause of the Constitution without limiting any of the powers contained therein.",

He has covered it very thoroughly. and I know that the thoughtprovoking discussion we have had from him will serve to enlighten both the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Senate as a whole. Mr. President. the general purpose of the resolution now being submitted by the senior and junior Senators from New Jersey is to afford the Senate an opportunity to exercise statesmanlike judgment in protecting and fostering judicial balance and integrity in the courts of the Nation. The four specific objectives of the resolution are. First. to establish precedents or working formulas for maintaining an atmosphere of political balance and integrity in the judiciary as well as high standards of competence. second. to focus the attention of the Senate on the need for proper application of the advice and consent clause. third. to record the demand of the Senate that the work of the judicial branch be not impaired by undue delays in filling vacancies. and. fourth. to provide standards which will apprise the President. in advance. of the minimum qualifications requisite to confirmation by the Senate. Turning to the first point relating to balance. it is well known that Presidents in the past have attempted to appoint men who would maintain an attitude on the bench favorable to the policies of their administration. The late Franklin D. Roosevelt made such attempts and. for the most part. succeeded. That such attempts could be made. stems from the fact that the Constitution contains no express provision with regard to affiliation or competence. However. this omission is not in itself controlling. for with the Constitution. as with a statute or other written instrument. what is reasonably implied. is as much a part of it as what is expressedDillon v.

We have a 3year program. And that program. very frankly. instead of costing $7.500.000.000. which is provided by this bill. will probably cost nearly $20.000.000.000. because we will in all probability have to appropriate money next year and we will have to appropriate money the following year. It is a 3year program. We hope that by the end of 3 years we will have built up the military strength of European nations to the point that we can then begin to withdraw our aid. Since that is true. and you have a definite program mapped out by the Joint Chiefs of Staff with definite objectives. if you do not appropriate the money to accomplish those objectives this year. then you must appropriate It at some future time if the objectives are to be accomplished. Moreover. this is a program upon which we should either embark adequately or not at all. for the simple fact that if we send materials to Europe and do not send them in sufficient quantity to protect Europe. obviously. if the countries should be overrun by the enemy. then the equipment and materials which we have furnished the European nations will fall into the hands of the enemy. Very frankly that is a calculated risk that we must take anyway. But the sooner we build up the defensive strength to protect that material the better off we will be.

    "speech": "The paragraph reads as follows: Institutions of this characterHaving reference. of course. to savings banks and building and loan associationsbeing in a home mortgage lending operation. must of necessity build reserves against future losses. Our State statute provides that not less than 5 percent of net earnings each year must be placed in reserve for losses fund. until the reserve for losses has reached 5 percent of share capital. Our National organization of supervisors has concluded long ago that this 5percent goal is not enough. and has been urging a 10 percent of share capital as the end to be gained. With the upward surge in the cost of operations. many of our associations have very small margin of profits left after paying a dividend necessary to attract capital and assigning the amount required by statute to the reserve for losses fund. I wish to comment very briefly on that. I think it is most important that we protect and keep these savings and loan institutions financially sound for the purpose for which they were established. namely. to furnish loans for building. During the past 25 or 30 years the values of buildings which have been built by loans from these institutions have increased. therefore. these institutions have been very sound financially and have been solvent. But we may face a period when it might be necessary to have a greater reserve than we have at present. I hope. too. that it will be kept in mind that my State has suffered a very serious flood loss in many areas. Many of the building and loan institutions have * suffered great losses because of the flood. \ufffd I have. for instance. the statistics of one building and loan association at Ottawa. Kans.. the Home Savings and Loan Association. I have the figures here which were submitted to me. I think it is important to mention that this association had loans on 70 properties in the flood area totaling $135.Of those properties 39 of the 70 were completely washed away. Eight others were damaged beyond rehabilitation. Those are some of the contingencies which I think we must kepp in mind when we are dealing with this important subject.

I realize that that could be done. but it could be done. very likely. only at the sacrifice of interest paid to depositors. We all know that we can levy almost any kind of tax on savings institutions if we want to do itthat is. any tax which is not confiscatoryand still those institutions can presumably set aside. by degrees. certain amounts for reserves. even though the reserves may be inadequate.

I wish to read one paragraph from a letter which I have received from the president of the Ninth Federal Savings and Loan Association. of New York City. as follows: The effect of the proposed tax would be farreaching. Savings and loan associations are the most important single source of home finance funds in the country. In many communities savings and loan associations are almost the only source of such funds and the records will show that about onethird of all the home financing has been done by savings and loan associations. If this source of money for private home financing Is shut off. either immediately or eventually. as this tax would undoubtedly do. how many people in your community would be affected? It could only result in partial or complete paralysis of home financing and therefore home building and home buying. I have read this for the purpose of emphasizing the statement made by my distinguished -colleague. that if we shut off this source of private financial supportas would be the result. I believe. of the enactment of section 313then the whole burden. the whole responsibility. of financing home building will be placed on the Federal Government. something which. of course. would not be in the interest of the country. because I believe we all agree that the more we can encourage private financing of home building or private financing of any undertaking. so far as that is concerned. the better off we shall be.",

We found that the savings banks were in a somewhat vulnerable position by reason of the fact that reserves of an insufficient and inadequate size had been built up. I made the statement in connection with my remarks that the situation had now improved. because the reserves are larger than they were at that time. Apparently I was in error in making that statement. I quote now from the testimony of Mr. Schwulst. who. I believe. is the head of the Association of Mutual Savings Banks in the State of New York. He made the following statement. which will be found on page 718 of part 2 of the hearings before the Committee on Finance. in connection with House bill 4473: In 1930 their average ratio of general reserve to deposits was 11.65 percent. This ratio proved to be inadequate. Depression lasses from 1931 to 1944. after all profits and recoveries. were so large that they would have wiped out 90 percent of the banks reserves accumulated up to that time. In order to restore their reserves. the banks were compelled to cut drastically interest payments to their depositors. At the end of 1950. the ratio of general reserves to deposit was 11.4 percent. which is less than the ratio of 1930. You can understand our concern at the prospect of any legislation which might run counter to a sound reserve policy or interfere with the independent and prudent supervision of these banks by the States. In New York State. both the governors and the legislature have been very detcrmined to protect the interests of the depositors in the various savings institutions of our State. Therefore legislation was enacted making mandatory a reserve which is substantially in excess of the reserves which have been mentioned on the floor of the Senate. The reserves today in New York Statenot in all banks. but speaking generallywould average very considerably more than 10 percentprobably in the neighborhood of 15 percent. although I cannot give any authoritative figures.",

The savings banks and savings and loan associations would be inevitably compelled to face one of two alternatives--or possibly both of themto cut their interest or dividend rate. or to allow their reserves to sink to a level which would place the interests of their depositors in jeopardy.

The Senator from Michigan is not of the opinion that this bill will be in any way weakened by such a proposal. It will in fact be strengthened. Let there be no doubt that I favor renegotiation. and that the principle of renegotiation is strengthened by deleting exemptions. Questions may be raised on the floor with respect to those who make the Abomb. It has been said on the floor that those who have Abomb and nitrogen bomb contracts have them on the basis of cost plus a dollar. Those contracts would not be renegotiated under any circumstances. The bill contains an exemption with respect to security. How can the examination of a board into the profits under a contract affect security? I suppose all members of the Board and employees are going to be cleared for security. If we permit the use of that kind of a security shield as a basis for exemption we would not have any contracts renegotiated. because the services would say that all the contracts involved security and were not open to scrutiny. I wish to present to the Senate the fact that there is a great distinction between saying to the Board \"You cannot grant exemptions\" and giving the Board -discretion in determining the amount of -profit. When the Board is given the power to grant exemption it can grant an exemption without going into the matter of profit. The Board can grant exemption without even looking into the facts. But when we say to the Board that they can determine the amount of profit we assume that they are going to look into all the facts. After they secure the facts it is quite true they can play favoritism by allowing one contractor 1 percent more than another contractor. That is true. But there is a great difference between saying that they can do it after the record has been made. which record would be capable of being scrutinized by the Congress. and to say that they can arbitrarily. without any cause whatever. make the contract exempt from renegotiation. and that there will be no determination on the basis of the profits.",

On a general review they can tell from the income tax and the balancing of the books how much each company is making on its contracts. and can tell whether or not an excessive profit has been made. I wish to call to the attention of the Senate how this matter was handled in the past. The War Investigating Committee spent many hours. after the war was over. in trying to provide a guide should there be a need for any future renegotiation legislation. What did the committee do after weeks of examination of contracts? They made the following recommendation: The committee believes that any future Renegotiation Act be improved in the following specific ways: (a) By bringing within its operation all contractors with an annual war business exceeding $100.000. (b) Including war contracts of all Government agencies.

What this would do is to permit such holders of a class C license to go to the Alcoholic Beverage Board. make an application for and pay $250 for a license. He would qualify as to character in the conduct of his business to avoid the type of credit which would be extended promiscuously. It would be permissive with the retail business. In other words. the license would be for the purpose of determining the responsibility of the holder of that particular class C license in extending credit.

It reads as follows: VoTEs FOe SOLDIERS Nearly 3 months have gone by since President Truman urged congressional action to make it possible for about 2.500.000 men and women 1i the Armed Forces to vote in the coming elections. The soldier vote. of course. includes personnel In all the services. Mr. Truman has now felt it necessary to prod both Houses on this matter in letters to Vice President BARKLEY and Speaker RAYBURN. Existing State laws. such as the one in operation in New York State. make it possible for something like a 1.500.000 of our uniformed citizens to vote. For another million there is no such provision. Twentyfour States are delinquent in one respect or another. The Presidents recommendations were based on a report of a special committee of the American Political Science Association made last March. Bills introduced by Senator THEODORE F. GREEN. of Rhode Island. and Representative JOHN W. McCOaMACK. of Massachusetts. provide for Federal aid to enable the service personnel to vote. If the State laws do not set up workable machinery the Federal Government is empowered to send out ballots for Federal offices. and the pending legislation requires State officials to receive and count such ballots. Since few State legislatures can act before the fall elections. Federal action is all that remains in most cases to give the franchise back to those who have temporarily lost it because they are serving their country. What is proposed is plain justice. It Is hard to see how any Senator or Representative can properly oppose it. The service personnel and their friends and relativesand indeed all who believe in fair playhave a right to expect early action. An error has been called to my attention. which should be corrected. On page 15. in the official Federal ballot which is set forth on that page. the word \"invalid\" in the last clause of the concluding sentence should be changed to \"valid.\"",

I am concerned about immigration and the entry of illegal aliens into the United States. The bill as reported from the Committee on Agriculture. in my judgment. opens wide the doors to the continued illegal entrance of socalled wetbacks from Mexico. For a number of years this has been a very serious problem in the Southwest and is becoming a serious problem for a great part of the United States. We know that these Mexican wetbacks go as far north as Chicago. They become a serious social problem wherever they congregate in large numbers. They come in as illegal entrants. This bill as reported from the committee. as I said before. tends to give legislative sanction to this illegal entry. At the proper time it is my purpose to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. which will contain the provisions of the bill which passed the Senate. The Senate bill. I believe. is a much better bill than the bill reported by the Committee on Agriculture of the House. I hold in my hand a letter which I received from the president of the United LatinAmericans.of America. Inc.. an organization with headquarters in San Francisco. With your permission.

If you do not provide a legal method of entrance. the Mexican workers will come in anyway. Again. let me ask you to search your own conscience. Under this bill these Mexican workers have an opportunity to make a choice between entering the United States under a legal contract. where their rights are preserved. and. on the other hand. of coming in as a wetback. an illegal fugitive from the law. Which choice will they make? I am sure you would come to the conclusion that they will come in under the contract system. We give the Mexican worker that choice under this bill. We give him the opportunity to come in legally. If you defeat this bill and there is no opportunity for a Mexican to come in legally. they are going to be forced to resort to swimming the river.

This bill greatly improves the condition of the Mexican worker. of the American worker. and of the American farmer who must rely upon some kind of orderly entrance of the Mexicans in order to have a proper distribution of farm labor in those parts of America where we need It and not simply where it is easiest for the Mexican to go.",

To establish new \"rules of the game\" at this time of need for peak agricultural production would inevitably result in losses of production. 3. The bill would throw the major burden of enforcement of immigration law on farmers. It is difficult or impossible to distinguish between United States citizens of Mexican ancestry and Mexican nationals. Over 2.000.000 citizens claim Spanish as their mother tongue. These citizens would be required to carry evidence of citizenship. They would be handicapped in obtaining employment as compared with other citizens. 4.

You will find that the people who formed the corporation and obtained the contract are not experts and this is a technical job. You will find in the hearings a memorandum from the Air Force that the decision to give this contract to this company was made by the then Secretary of the Air Force. Mr. Symington.

I am sure that the consensus of opinIon of the membership of this House is to lift the burden of taxation from the taxpayers. I read an article the other day which I think was very pertinent. It referred to Patrick Henry and was as follows: \"If Patrick Henry thought taxation without representation was bad he should see it with representation.\"",

Why. the Army itself has let two and onehalf million contracts of different kinds involving $20.000.000.000 since the Korean war started. I do not know whether the gentleman from Georgia and the members of the Armed Forces Committee on the other side of the Capitol would be able to find time to handle all of these contracts.",

    "speech": "I want to say in regard to the gentleman that this House has committed itself to this theory. The Senate has committed itself to this rule. I refer you to a bill that was passed in this House in 1951. H. R. 4914. which became Public Law 155. In that law it provided that the Secretary of the Army and the Air Force and the Secretary of the Navy. as the case may be. or his designee. shall come into agreement with the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and of the House of Representatives with respect to these real estate transactions when they exceed the sum of $25.000. Now. this amendment provides that no funds herein appropriated could be used to pay off obligations incurred by the Secretaries of the various Departments of Army. Air. or Navy unless approved or in agreement with Armed Services Committee. of the Senate and the House. In this amendment we provide that these obligationsand you have heard a lot about obligations. and during the balance of this year there is going to be obligated some $58.000.000.000. I believe it was reported. What is wrong with letting the various secretaries of departments when they have a contract of over a million dollars. what is wrong with their coming up to the Armed Services Committees of the House and Senate and saying. \"We have done this. we want to enter into this obligation to expend your money in excess of a million dollars.\" What is wrong with that? Do you not think this would bring about some economy? The departments do not want to waste money. and become a party to extravagance and useless spending. but waste does occur. This amendment would put the brakes on further waste. useless spending. and extravagance that goes on. I think every one of you. unless the point of order is sustained to this amendment. will want to adopt it. because we want to save money. and. as I said. this is the way to save it. absolutely the way to save it.",

    "speech": "What is wrong with providing that the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House should have supervision over obligations made by the various departments when the obligation or contract exceeds $1.000.000. Here is the proper place to bring about some real economy. I think the Congress should pay more attention to where the taxpayers money goes after it is appropriated. The Congress holds the purse string to the taxpayers money until it is appropriated. but thereafter the purse strings become weak and break. The money is spent and we hold little control over the money until we start an investigation and discover that the horse has already gotten out of the stable and money spent extravagantly and uselessly.",
