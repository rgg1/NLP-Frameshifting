    "speech": "Mr. President. last week. a majority of Democratic Senators. 27 in all. voted for the GrammRudman amendment to force a balanced budget by a sequence of obligatory cuts in spending. This week. we have had the opportunity to test this conviction. There have been three specific votes to the HUD appropriations bills which in effect increased spending: 23 of the 26 Democrats who voted for GrammRudman also voted to increase revenue sharing. 17 of 26 voted against a cut in housing programs. 23 of 26 voted against the elimination of urban development action grants. For some time. the Republican Members of the Senate have been feeling the edges of the box they are in. I fear this is now happening to Democrats as well. we know very well that most of us believe in these programs. Why have we done this to ourselves?",

We cannot continue to provide our Nations veterans with the medical care they need and deserve if further cuts in spending are allowed to occur. Yesterday morning the Senate adopted an amendment. which I cosponsored. that would restore $100 million of the $296 million cut from the VA health care by the Appropriations Committee. After having restored that money. the Senate adopted an amendment to reduce the level of funding for HUD and independent agencies by 1.1 percent across the board. The effect of that amendment was to once again cut needed funds from VA medical care. The amendment we have before us now would once again restore the funding for VA medical care to a more appropriate level. Mr. President. as I have said many times before. I understand the need for reductions in Federal spending. I understand that we must make difficult decisions in order to meet those reductions. I do not feel. however. that the decision to further reduce the level of funding for veterans health care is a proper one.

This legislation offers us a unique opportunity to recognize the contributions of temporary service companies and employees to our Nations economy. Temporary help has come to serve a crucial role in the smooth functioning of American business. During robust economic times. temporary workers supplement the work force by boosting productivity. Temporaries are also invaluable to businesses that need help while they are in the process of finding permanent employees. In turn. the availability of temporary jobs brings many individuals who might not otherwise be employed into the work force. Since most temporary Jobs are nonmanufacturing ones. temporary industry employment is relatively stable during growth and recessionary periods. The growing importance of temporary help In todays business market has spawned incredible growth in the temporary services industry. For example. in 1970. the industry supplied roughly 180.000 jobs and generated $547 million in salaries. Last year. temporary services were responsible for 600.000 Jobs and $5.6 billion in payroll. In the past 15 months. temporary service companies have outperformed Standard & Poors 500 by a whopping 5 to 1 margin. The Industrys incredible growth rate has even outstripped the booming computer industry. ranking it third nationwide in terms of job growth. Given the impressive statistics the industry has produced. it is difficult to ignore its significance contributions to a strong economy. I hope my colleagues will share my gratitude to Americas temporary service companies and their 5 million employees by voting in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 195.",

    "speech": "still relies on bloodshed. dynamite and intimidation to coerce acceptance of the Unions demands. After the Enmons decision exempting Union violence from Federal control. there were at least 4.350 acts of violence committed by Union members from 1975 to 1984. The UMWA is the most violent Union in the United States being 6.2 times more violent than the average Union. An effective Hobbs Act is necessary to insure a reliable mechanism for dealing with large scale industrial violence. The argument raised by the unions against this legislation is the twisted logic that the bill would penalize one side and not the other in a labor management dispute. It would be unfair to labor to make minor picket line altercations a federal crime. There are two big holes in this argument: Hole number one is the feeble defense that such acts of violence are minor picket line scuffles. Murder. beatings. arson and dynamiting are not minor scufflesnot when they are planned. directed and paid for by union leaders as in the case with the examples that I have described to you today. The second hole in this twisted logic is the argument that the interest of labor is served by giving the working person an advantage in an economic decision allocating returns between capital and labor. Adversarial confrontation in the form of strikes and restrictive work rules simply destroys that productivity created by teamwork. The loser is the employee. Thus the twisted logic that the means justifies the ends or that violence helps achieve collective bargaining goals falls completely apart in todays world marketplace. Take away violence as a bargaining chip and the parties are left with only the tools of economic reality and rational facts. The result of an agreement. achieved under these conditions. is terms of employment that allows both the company and its employees to survive in the marketplace. How well they prosper depends upon how well they work as a team. not returns extracted from one at the expense of the other. The proposed amendment to the Hobbs Act would. in the final analysis. improve the well being of all employees by bridging the gap of trust between employees and their companies. The resulting productivity gains would result in greater long run economic returns available for distribution to the employee sector.o",

As millions of Americans meet the April 15 deadline today. Congress ought to be ashamed that we do not have the political courage to meet our own selfimposed deadline to reduce Federal spending. Why is it important for Congress to get on with the business of deficit reduction? We now have the kind of economic climate many of us have advocated for years: Low inflation. sustained economic growth. declining interest rates. and a dollar moving into a more advantageous position. The Federal Reserve recently lowered the interest rate it directly controlsthe discount rate is now at 7 percentand many forecasters are predicting It will move lower. Congress needs to complement this action by passing a budget resolution now that meets the GrammRudman deficit target. Millions of firsttime home buyers. millions of small businesses. millions of farmers all across America will benefit from the lower interest rates that will ensue from meaningful deficit reduction. Finally. there is the most dangerous consequence of procrastination of allthe likely erosion of confidence by the financial community. both domestic and international. that the U.S. Congress is serious about cutting the Federal deficits. The result can only be a renewed increase of interest ratesdespite recent Federal Reserve discount actiona stronger dollar and a likely delay in the improvement of our trade balance.

We cannot permit terrorists like Qadhafi and his kind to intimidate with impunity and without fear of retaliation. The raid on Libya was calculated to protect the lives of Americans and other citizens of the world community. It is my sincere hope that this military strike was successful in disrupting Ubyas terrorist agenda. and that it serves as a deterrent to future terrorist attacks by these cowards. who pride themselves on murdering innocent citizens. It is time for our allies to stand with us in exerting as much economic. political and diplomatic pressure as possible on Libya and the other peddlers of terrorism. Perhaps if our allies had joined with us for that purpose months ago. yesterdays actions might not have been necessary. I find it inexcusable that France forced our planes to fly an additional 1.200 miles each way around its borders. We are trying to protect the interests of the entire world. not just the United States. Its going to take the cooperation of all nations to stem the threat of terrorism and return some degree of sanity to our world. I am disappointed with some of our allies and their ostrichlike thinking.",

I could go onthe list is endless. the dead from terrorist attacks. The toast of Robert Goodloe Harper \"Millions for defense but not one cent for tribute\" was first used in 1798. Several years later that toast became the battle cry of the infant American Republic when it fought the pirates of Tripoli. For decades. piratesthe terrorists of their dayheld Europe at gunpoint. If govemments did not pay tribute the Tripoli pirates would disrupt sealanes by sinking ships. The Europeans were afraid. and. counseled caution. 180 years later. the Europeans are still cautioning as yet new Tripoli pirates are attacking travel lanes and committing other acts of barbarism. President Reagan. like Jefferson before him. was forced to protect travel lanes. and to defend against Tripoli pirates. While the use of force is dangerous. it has been the policy of the new Tripoli pirates for years. A failure to react with force was probably even more dangerous than allowing Qadhafi to go unchallenged. I wish there was a peaceful way to guarantee the safety of our citizens. but I support the President in his necessary use of force.",

If I thought adopting his amendment would bring him aboard and he would be for the constitutional amendment. I would be sorely tempted to accept it. Unfortunately. that is not the case. I agree with his criticism of this administration on this whole issue. There is no question that there has been pious talk on one side and action in precisely the opposite direction. For example. in the last 3 years we have added $600 billion to the deficit. That is $50 billion a year in perpetuity. from now on. we are going to be paying. The President has said he does not like to see Government used as a redistribution mechanism for the wealthy in this country. In fact. when we add to the deficit. we are redistributing the wealth and doing it massively. But. the reality is that what the Senator from Ohio suggests would be fine as a law. I assure him that if we adopt this constitutional amendment and he proposes an amendment to the statutes along this line. I will support him. But the Constitution ought to deal in broad principles and not in details. I would also point out to my colleagues that the carefully crafted amendment that we have worked out here in a bipartisan way contains neither a reference to the President nor to Congress. So. I think we are wise to keep the present language. Again. and this will apply not only to this amendment but to some other amendments that I am told will be proposed. we should not have all kinds of details in a constitutional amendment. The principle we seek to affirm is that we should not have an unbalanced budget unless there is a threefifths vote of the Congress to the contrary. That principle is very clear. Let us stick to that. Let us not add all kinds of details that we might want to put into the statute but should not be in the Constitution. With all due respect to my good friend from Ohio.

In response to those who say it is implicit in the amendment that the President will have to submit a balanced budget. I simply do not buy that argument. I would have thought that after speaking in favor of a balanced budget and frequently castigating Congress for not producing a balanced budget. this President would submit a balanced budget or at least sharp reductions in the deficit. Now. many of us have watched for several years as this President has submitted his recommendations for spending and his recommendations for taxing. and we have subtracted one from the other and come up with the Presidents recommendation for a deficit. We have been dismayed to see this President propose a $200 billion annual deficit one day. then turn around the next and shake his finger at the Congress and say. \"You had better produce a balanced budget.\" It apparently was not implicit in his denunciations of the Congress that he would make his own recommendations on how to produce a different result. I think if this particular constitutional amendment without the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio were adopted. this President would no more feel obligated to submit a balanced budget than he does at the current time. If he does not feel obligated to submit a balanced budget as a result of the speeches that he has been making about it. then he will not feel obligated to submit one as a result of the language in this pending constitutional amendment. It needs to be spelled out so he is required to do it. just as the Congress is required to adopt a balanced budget. So I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 1 stand before the House today. to show my total support of the highly successful Head Start Program. as the House commemorates its 20th anniversary and Congress reaffirms its commitment to the program. Originally designed as an 8 week project under the Economic Opportunity Act. Head Start is now a yearround program of comprehensive services to address the health. nutrition. social. and educational needs of some of the Nations poorest children and their families. Head Start has provided services to over 9 million disadvantaged youngsters since 1965. and has proved to be one of the most popular. cost effective. and enduring of the Federal Governments antipoverty programs. Head Start gives disadvantaged children a better chance as they enter school and helps parents become more actively involved in their childrens education and development. A followup of 820 Head Start children showed gains in school performance lasting as long as 13 years. With regard to key parental involvement. onethird of all Head Start staff are parents of current and former students. For every 15 children participating in Head Start. 10 parents provide volunteer services to the program. The need for continued support for Head Start is evidenced by the fact that less than 18 percent of eligible children are being served at this time. Over 430.000 children participated in the program last year. In my own district. the Head Start Program has been a tremendous success. serving the needs of more than 40.000 deserving children. Next week I will again voice my support as I attend the first annual Combined Head Start Graduation in Ville Platte. LA. where I will witness at first hand the benefits of such an essential program as I speak to the graduates and their families. Mr. Speaker. again I am proud to show my support for the Head Start Program as I pledge to ensure that such programs remain intact and continue to develop.",

House Concurrent Resolution 132. to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Older Americans Act. This bill was introduced by my colleague. Congressman MARIO BIAGGI. together with 73 original cosponsors. I understand a number of additional Members have since joined in supporting the measure. House Concurrent Resolution 132 commemorates the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Older Americans Act of 1965. and acknowledges the many contributions of workers. both paid and volunteer. who have successfully implemented this act. The measure also reaffirms Congress commitment to maintaining the independence and dignity of older individuals. I have always believed that governments prime role is to promote. defend. and enhance human dignity. Meals on Wheels and other Older Americans Act programs certainly enhance. promote. and defend human dignity for they enable many people to remain in their homes rather than in convalescent or extended care facilities. In addition. these programs enable many others to be active contributors to their communities. The Older Americans Act has more than lived up to its purpose of developing new and improved programs to help older persons. The aging network created under the act provides a full range of services and programs to meet the needs of older people in their own communities. In specific terms. in 1985: More than 212 million meals will be served in senior centers and delivered to those homebound. More than 9 million older individuals will receive home health visits. transportation. and other important services. And 62.500 title V workers will be making important contributions in childrens hospitals. senior nutrition centers. State parks. libraries. and other community sites. At the time President Johnson signed the Older Americans Act into law. he stated the act \"clearly affirms our Nations high sense of responsibility toward the wellbeing of older citizens.\" This program has long enjoyed strong. bipartisan support. I urge that we reaffirm that support on this 20th anniversary. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

The act embodies the key Federal programs servig the social and nutritional needs of our Nations elderly. In just two decades. a network of nutrition and social services has emerged as a result of the Older Americans Act. This network of services now touches the lives of senior citizens in nearly every community in the Nation. The Older Americans Act has been recognized as one of the most effective pieces of legislation to be developed by Congress. In the reauthorization of the act last year. I had the opportunity to review the full range of services and programs which have evolved under the act and which continue to meet the needs of older people in their own commumties. These programs serve to maintain the Independence and dignity of our senior citizens. The act is designed and has been a critical element in helping to avoid unnecessary and premature institutionalization for those elderly who can receive services in their homes and communities through a network of service providers. The Older Americans Act has enjoyed bipartisan support of administrations and Congresses since its inception.

I rise today in strong support of this resolution to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Older Americans Act of 1965. This resolution will reaffirm our commitment to the wellbeing of older Americans. The Older Americans Act has provided important social and human services to older individuals. It has improved the lives of older Americans in the areas of income. health. housing. employment. retirement. and community services. One of the most important features of the act is the establishment of an aging network which consists of State and area agencies on aging. as well as congregate and home delivered nutrition providers and other supportive services. This network is providing more than 9 million older Americans with a variety of supportive services. For example. 212 million meals will be served during this year. The title V Community Employment Program currently supports 62.502 employment positions in childrens hospitals. senior nutrition centers. State parks. libraries. and State and local governments. And the title VI program assists 83 Indian tribal organizations to better serve their older members. With an ever increasing older population. it will be even more important for us to analyze and acknowledge the needs of older Americans and to provide services and programs which will ensure their heolth and wellbeing. I believe that the Older Americans Act has done an exceptional job at meeting many of these needs. This can be shown by the strong bipartisan support this act has received from my colleagues over its 20year history.*",

The Council was created to advise us on policy issues related to the travel and tourism industry. As a member of the Advisory Council.

I also expressed my view that these types of amendments should be carefully considered in the authorizing committee. after adequate hearings and committee deliberations. At the time funding for the title X program was deleted from the regular HHS fiscal year 1986 appropriations bill.

It is obvious that if we decide to aid UNITA. UNITA will be less dependent upon South African support. South Africas help to UNITA is a red herring. The core opposition to UNITA aid stems from certain sectors who believe in coddling the Communist regimes in southern Africa and ignoring the gross human rights violation within those dictatorships. and putting pressure solely on South Africa for internal reform.

But. as I stated before. it is the only industry in the United States. the only one. that pays a windfall profit tax. And in many cases. in some years the windfall profit tax was a very substantial amount of the total corporate income tax for all corporations. In looking back. in 1981. the total windfall profit tax was $23.4 billion. That equaled 38 percent of all the corporate income taxes for that year. In 1982. the windfall profit tax was $18.5 billion. That is 37 percent of all the corporate income tax that was paid that year. And I might mention. Mr. President. this is in addition to those oil companies paying corporate income taxes. This is windfall profit tax on top of their corporate income tax. In 1983. oil companies paid $12.2 billion. Now when I say oil companies. I am also mentioning oil companies. independent companies. large companies. small companies. and even royalty owners. The total corporate income tax for that year was about $37 billion. So that was 33 percent of all the corporate income tax that year which was paid in windfall profit tax by only the oil industry. There is no other industry that pays a windfall profit tax.

The Soviets. we all know. have developed and are testing mobile ICBMs. I think we need to proceed on both tracks.

Congressman NIcx MAVROULES. introducing an amendment to increase the funding for the development of the small single warhead mobile missile known as the Midgetman by $150 million to a total of $774.500.000.

We believe that with the passage of the amendment capping the deployment of MX. a yes vote on this Midgetman amendment will directly result. in a modernized. more effective landbased leg for our nuclear triad. and which will enhance deterrence and increase nuclear stability between the superpowers. Please join us in this most important amendment to insure an effective modernization of our landbased nuclear deterrent.",

Mr. Chairman. in this particular area I am not one who thinks that we should not at this time be adding a lot more money to the bill. and I think that probably the majority of my colleagues would agree. However. as the gentleman from Oklahoma just pointed out. we did cut over $1 billion in the MX program 2 days ago. and there would be adequate room within the bill to proceed with the gentlemans amendment of $150 million to accelerate the Midgetman Program. I think we are all familiar with the program and know the need for it. It was recommended by the Presidents Commission on Strategic Forces chaired by General Scowcroft. I might mention that at Eastertime I was in Geneva and had the opportunity to visit with Ambassador Max Kampelman on generally how things were going in the early rounds of the talks on disarnament. Ambassador Kampelman personally told me that he thought it was very important that we have a program underway. at least that we should be able to show. as we go forward into the negotiations. that we were not unilaterally stepping down and were not giving up this system or that system. He proposed at the time something that would at least replace the Titans that were being stood downand 40 or 50 MX missiles would do thatand then that we accelerate the Midgetman Program so the Russians understand our determinedness to defend this country with modern strategic systems. Mr. Chairman. I think that the gentlemans amendment falls into the pattern that Ambassador Kampelman was talking about. That is one reason I am happy to stand and speak in its behalf today. I think it is a good move.",

It is not a useitorloseit system. and it is. therefore. a disincentive for any Soviet first strike. It permits stability because it has only one warhead. If we are truly serious about arms controland I think we arethen we have no alternative but to move away from systems like the 10warhead MX and toward the singlewarhead systems like Midgetman. Midgetman pushes both sides toward arms control and in fact only makes sense with some type of limitation on the number of missiles. Mr. Chairman. if Members are truly serious about systems that promote arms control agreements. that are survivable. and that promote stability and deterrence. then they should support this amendment.

I might just point out that the Soviet Union in their development that is known and has appeared in the public press probably also violated the SALT II agreement. There is this system that the gentleman has Just spoken to. the SS24. They are also. as I understand it developing an SS23. which is very similar to the Midgetman and is well ahead of us in its development and employment. and that the next area in nuclear weapons is missiles out of silos and into the field in mobile form. whether it be the rail form as the Soviets are talking about or some other mobile form. And for us to stand back and let them move ahead of us is I think the exact wrong signal to send. Now we have not in the past matched them system for system. and we are not going to do it now. but we will certainly have a system that is modern. up to date and will be mobile.",

I would agree with the gentleman that we ought not to allow the Soviet Union to forge ahead of us. and I would agree with the gentleman totally that the Soviet Union has baslcally done everything in their power to run around every arms control agreement that we have entered into with them. including the SALT agreements. But the brutal fact of the matter is that if we are arguing for an offensive weapons systemsfar fulfilling our retaliatory capability. which I do not prefer. what we are doing is forging ahead with an $80 billion weapons system that is archaic. even before it is deployed in the 1990s whereas the Soviets will deploy a system that is MIRVd and offensive and mobile in the decade of the eighties. So if we really want to regress on an offensive basis. we have got to have a MIRVd capability that is mobile. A single warhead mobile missile simply is not going to stand up against a mobile missile that the Soviets will deploy 5 years ahead of the scheduled deployment for this system and that has 10 warheads on it. So I would agree that if we are going to keep up. first we must move ahead defensively to stop this offensive arms race. But second. for those who believe that somehow offensive retaliation is the way to keep us out of nuclear war. let us not proceed with a system that is already archaic in development. whereas the Soviets are in effect fielding or will field in the next couple of years a system that is already far superior and far more advanced.",

But the gentleman made the point that this is an archaic system. This system can basically use the same guidance system as the MX. which is certainly one of the most accurate missiles in the systems that we have today. Furthermore. when the gentleman talks about what the Soviets are doing. the Soviets have also gone to the SS25. they have gone to the SS24. We are not talking about violating the SALT II accord. We are talking about a system that when deployed in 1992 is far more survivable. We are not matching missile for missile here. I submit we are trying to avoid that. What we are talking about is having a stable. survivable nuclear deterrent. and that when you look a!. the synergistic relationship between the landbased. and seabased and our air wing. then we have a viable deterrent and that is the point in disagreement. I would just caution the gentleman also that even though this Member has worked to secure funding for research and development of SDI. the system that the gentleman is referring to is a long way down the pike and. yes. It may be the most futuristic system. but we have yet to even have an architectural design that is going to tell us how we would deploy such a system if we even develop one.

And yes. I happen to believe that 400 MX warheads do give us significant leverage against those Soviet hardened silos to get them to move to mobile systems. But to correct the record. our building a Midgetman will not violate SALT II because the testing. flight testing. came after the expiration date. Now if you do not like those kinds of legalistic distinctions and if we are going to have proportionality to our responses to what the Soviets have done. in my view. an MX and Midgetman are proportional responses to the SS24 and SS25. the 24 being a MIRVd MX system which is mobile. and the 25 is a single warhead system. I am kind of surprised that my friend from Colorado would suggest that the Soviets are not developing this kind of a system because they are developing a single warhead mobile system. the SS25. and they have deployed it.

So I guess there is a caveat that when we talk about mobile systems. I would like to see Midgetman. because it reduces the importance on each platform.

But I think that the important point to remember here is that we are trying to shift the emphasis from the MX and our commitment to the MX at whatever amount it comes out to a very different kind of system that is more consistent with arms control. I have been interested in the debate here about the MX and the gentleman from Colorado suggested that the Soviets were going to come up with a mobile 10warhead missile. That is what we thought the MX was going to be when we started out. We wanted to have a multiwarhead missile that we could move about. The problem we had was both political. and I guess. technical. On the one hand. nobody wanted the railroad tracks in their State. nobody wanted the system. and. as I remember. we went through tens and twenties of systems to try to move it about and we could not figure out how to do it. We wound up with it back in the old holes and that really was the main reason that Members became concerned about whether they wanted to spend that much money for that system. So we began to look for a better way to do it and that is why we came up with Midgetman. And the importance of this amendment is not perhaps that it is going to make it come faster. I do not think we are really going to develop it any faster than present schedules. But this is a program to allow us to be able to make sure we meet the schedule on time. And it is a recommitment to the mobile Midgetman missile. By voting for it. I think Members are making a statement that we think it is consistent with arms contrul. we think it enhances stability. we think it enhances deterrence. and I guess we are really saying that perhaps we should have done it when we were starting to talk about the MX. Having made that decision of capping at 40. let us move as quickly as we can to develop the Midgetman in the most effective manner. I yield back the balance of my time.",

It is expensive. It does not have the capability of the MX. but It is the only new missile that we have available. As far as the question of abiding by SALT II is concerned. if we are accused of violating SALT II by proposing the Midgetman. the Soviets are doubly in jeopardy with their violations. They have more than two weapons in their inventory in spite of the provisions of SALT II. I had hoped and strongly supported the MX. and had hoped that it would survive.

Since World War II. the United States has built up a network of alliances and cooperative defense agreements to preserve the peace.

American military presence on their soil all these years and additionally have agreed to deploy strategic nuclear weapons as a defense against the Increasingly ominous conventional and strategic threats from the East. The Soviet deployment of SS20s and even more accurate medium range missiles targeted at European cities has not intimidated the Europeans. Instead. they have bravely. and for the most part in a united way. agreed to deploy Pershing and cruise missiles as defenses against the SS20s. I think most of my colleagues will remember when the Soviet Union attempted to drive a wedge between our allies and ourselves with regard to the Euromissile crisis. I think we can easily predict that the Soviet Union leadership at this time is attempting to drive a wedge between our European allies and the United States with regard to SDI. Let me just say. Mr. Chairman. that we have had a number of statements by some of our very expert people to the effect that it is time to get on with the cooperation between the United States and our allies and to start working with them on SDI. We have been working together to some degree but somewhat clumsily in the past. This resolution simply urges allied cooperation on SDI research endeavors.

In summary. these conference agreements are consistent with the assumptions in the budget resolution in two areas: First. they achieve savings in DOEs Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program by reducing the minimum average annual fillrate from 159.000 to 35.000 barrels per day. Second. the conference agreement includes provisions to settle the legal dispute between the Federal Government and several States regarding the disposition of certain bonuses and rents held in escrow as of March 31. 1985.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the principal dispute between House and Senate reconciliation conferees concerns Senate efforts to include the Superfunds valueadded tax in the conference agreement. Why did the House Members wisely object to inclusion of this tax? Th- answer is simple. The House has already passed a far superior Superfund revenue provision. the DowneyFrenzel amendment. which relies primarily on increased oil and chemical feedstock taxes and a new w steend tax for funding the program. This amendment puts the burden right where it belongson the companies which generate the waste. Now I can hear my colleagues ask. \"Isnt that what we did with the VAT?\" No way. The VAT is a sneaky tax. hidden from public view but real nonetheless. Yet. it adds to the cost of every product taxes but it is hard for consumers to identify. Even worse. it risks taxing industries whose processes and products are benign. causing no hazardous waste. In contrast the DowneyFrenzel amendment adopted by the other body is perfectly straightforwardthe polluters pay. And why should they not? After all. they created the mess. But while considerations of tax fairness alone should be enough to block this provision. there are other reasons for opposing inclusion of the Superfund tax in reconciliation. First. once Congress adopts a taxing mechanism impetus disappears for cor.ferencing on other Superfund items. Unfortunately. many needed program reforms embodied in the House and Senate bills and could disappear. Even worse. we risk losing the benefit of the wisdom of those of our colleagues who know this program best. but were members of the Environment and not the Finance Committee and so did not participate in the conference.

Malakoff. required hospitalization and is expected to be in the hospital for at least 2 months. Mr. Smirnov was described in the accident report as \"apparently severely intoxicated.\" He was said to be \"incoherent.\" with \"the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about his breath.\" The Soviet Embassy. however. maintains that Mr. Smirnov was not intoxicated. Everyone involved in an auto accident deserves to have all the evidence heard. While It certainly appears that alcohol was a part of this accident. I am not going to judge Mr. Smirnovs guilt or innocence here. I am very concemed. however. about the fact that we have no recourse to take action against diplomats who are found to be drunk drivers. Under our laws. diplomats involved in traffic accidents are immune from prosecution. This is troublesome in all cases. but especially when drunk driving is involved. Mr. President. drunk driving is a serious national problem. Congress. the Federal Government. and the States have spent considerable time and effort to strengthen drunk driving laws and enforcement activities. We have made much progress. but more needs to be done. It is clear. however. that our inability to prosecute diplomats for drunk driving offenses represents a serious loophole in our drunk driving laws. A diplomat should not have the right to come to the United States. get a drivers license and car tags and then proceed to get drunk. get behind the wheel of a car. and be totally unaccountable for his actions. no matter how serious. Driving is a privilege. not a right. for everyone operating vehicle in this country. It is time that we make this point clear. Until our traffic laws are applied with equal force to all drivers in this country. the effectiveness of our recent efforts to strengthen drunk driving laws and to improve highway safety generally will be greatly diminished. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the June 21. 1985. Washington Post which describes the Smirnov incident. be included in the RECORD in its entirety.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Administration on Aging published interim final rules for the Older Americans Act on April 1. 1985. Publication of these rules was a welcome event for most of those who work in Older Americans Act programs because the regulations then in force were written for the 1978 amendments to the act. The notice of proposed rulemaking which was published in the Federal Register on March 2. 1983. and which laid out proposed rules for the 1981 amendments to the act never appeared in final form. Therefore. the interim final rules published on April 1 provided regulatory specification for both the 1981 and the 1984 regulations. Although welcome because they provide regulatory direction for the Older Americans Act amendments passed since 1978. the proposed rules have caused some concern. and not a little confusion. in the aging policy community. particularly with respect to parts of the proposed regulations dealing with advocacy on the part of the State and area agencies on aging.

This represents a significant and frightening decrease compared to earlier emigration figures51.000 in 1979. It is disheartening to those who live in freedom to hear the story I am about to tell. Even more upsetting is the fact that this is only one case in thousands. Countless refusniks are mistreated and held against their will in the U.S.S.R. because of their desire to practice Judaism. Ina Kvartina is a computer program. mer living in Moscow. She has a husband. David. and four young children.

Ina was forced to leave her Job. She and David now teach Hebrew to Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel. Employment in a classified occupation is an excuse commonly cited by Soviet officials in the detainment of Jews. Neither Ina nor David have ever held classified jobs. which makes their visa refusal particularly frustrating. They are being held for no apparent reason. They only wish to join their family and friends already living in the Jewish homelandIsrael. Concerned citizens throughout the world keep a vigil for families like the Kvartinas who are hostages of the Soviet Union.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I Join my colleagues in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from South Dakota which limits the amount of nonfarm income that can be offset by tax losses from farming operations. Limiting the deduction of farm losses against nonfarm income to the national median family income is a necessary step in assuring that family sized farm operators will not be disadvantaged in their effort to compete with higher income taxpayers with substantial nonfarm income. There is mounting evidence for the need to bring some coordination between tax policy and agricultural policy. It has become. increasingly apparent that It may be against the best interests of American farmers to have policies that encourage further outside investment in agriculture. Many of the provisions under the current Tax Code that were enacted to benefit the farmers have increased the attractiveness of agriculture to outside investors. This increased investment in agriculture has not only increased farm production. it has increased development of marginal farmlands in order to obtain the tax benefits associated with farming. The overall health of our farm economy is seriously threatened by tax oriented incentives for nonfarm investors. resulting in excess production at a time or surpluses. Congress has previously recognized that the impact of differential tax preferences has artificially stimulated production resulting in an overall lowering of commodity prices. As a result. Congress repealed rules allowing deduction of development costs for almond and citrus groves. My own amendment passed by the Senate as a part of the Deficit Reduction Act in 1984. and later dropped by the conference committee would have limited depreciation benefits for single purpose agricultural buildings such as dairy barns. hog facilities. and greenhouses. I continue to be concerned with the problems created by the unintended competitive advantages created by our tax laws to the detriment of family farm operations. I look forward to working with the good Senator from South Dakota in seeking a solution to these problems.",

In my mind. there is no question that the tax policy of the 1970s encouraged hobby farming. resulted in drastic increases in the price of land. and correspondingly increased the cost of production for legitimate farmers. I agree that we must stop giving tax breaks to \"gentlemen farmers.\" However. we have to do this in amanner which will not have adverse effects upon legitimate. fulltime farmers. I worry about the effect this could have on a farm family in which both the husband and wife have been forced to take fulltime jobs off the farm because of depressed farm prices. Additionally. as the Senator from 10778 Co Texas. Mr. BENTSEN. said earlier. this could dampen land prices.

I feel strongly our bona fide farmers and ranchers should not have to compete with individuals whose primary purpose is to shelter offfarm income rather than make a living off of the land. The measure before us today would limit the amount of offfarm income which can be sheltered by farm losses to the national median household income. approximately $24.000. Upon close examination of the amendment. I am concerned that it could have harmful repercussions on many farmers and ranchers we are trying to assist. Many fulltime Oklahoma cattlemen and farmers are incurring substantial losses from their agriculture operations. As you know. this is not a profitable time for agriculture. Some of these Oklahomans are fortunate enough to have royalty interests while others find it necessary to hold outside jobs in order to make ends meet. A farmer or rancher would be penalized under this amendment if his annual farm losses exceeded the threshold level. Changes in agriculture tax policy may be necessary to .tighten existing loopholes. One alternative would be to tighten existing regulations governing hobby losses. which are generally deductible only to the extent of hobby income. Although I support the concept of the amendment before us today. I am concerned that if enacted it could result in unsuspected hardships for Oklahomas agricultural interests.",

I say to my distinguished friend from South Dakota that I think his argument would have had a lot more weight if it had been made about 5 years ago. when you saw farm prices going up and you saw speculation in farm values. some of it brought about by outsiders and some by farmers Just buying the land that adjoined them. I understand that kind of motivation. Now. we are on the other side of the curve and farm values are in a real slide. Rural banks are in real trouble. Then to put a tax barrier in the way of these people who might went to be in farming. enter into farming. willing to take 2 or 3 years of losses to go out and make that kind of investment. I think. is a serious mistake. I think there is no question in my mind but what the farm prices would further deteriorate. I think it means further foreclosures. I think it means more rural banks in serious trouble and more of them closing their doors. I think this is the wrong kind of legislation at the wrong time. It sets farming apart from every other endeavor. Where we. as taxpayers. have always taken all of our Income and then charged all of our losses against that and paid the tax on it. we are saying. \"You cant do that any more insofar as farming is concerned. You can do it in every other type of industry. but not insofar as farming is concerned.\" I think. in spite of the very admirable objective of my friend from South Dakota. that the end result will be a disservice to farmers and will hurt the farmer and will be a very serious mistake. I. frankly. hope that it does not pass. becasue we have addressed this. addressed this to the best of our ability. in the Finance Committee. trying to stop farming being used as a tax shelter. putting the kind of limitations we put on last year in the cattle feeding operations. and having the IRS seriously police this kind of situation where they have not entered Into it for profit.

    "speech": "Madam President. one of the principal goals of a tax shelter promoter is to generate deductions which investors can use to offset otherwise taxable income. These tax shelters have been designed around various sectors of the economy! which are especially tax favored. Real estate. for example. immediately comes to mind. However. Congress has also enacted several special tax rules for farmers that can. and do. form the basis of tax shelters. For instance. the special cash accounting rules for farming may result in mismatching of deductions and income. Congress. nevertheless. has retained the cash method for farmers as an explicit incentive and because it may be simpler to apply. Nevertheless. subject to certain farm syndicate rules. the cash method can be used by partnerships designed to take advantage of the cash method of accounting. The accounting rules enacted last year as part of the Deficit Reduction Act were designed. in part. to address the problem of premature deductions in agriculture.based tax shelters such as cattle feeding deals. The jury is still out. however. on how effective those changes will be. Similarly. there is a special rule which provides an investment tax credit for certain. single purpose agricultural structures. Other buildings do not qualify for an investment tax creditthe special rule is an incentive for agriculture. However. tax shelter partnerships can invest in these buildings and pass along this special investment incentive to their nonfarmer investors. There is a strong argument that. if these and others incentives are to be retained. they should be limited to the active farmers who we intend to encourage. Of course. there are technical issues which will have to be addressed by the Finance Committee. and alternate approaches to deal with the tax shelter problem without adversely affecting the family farmer should also be explored. But. certainly. further limitations on tax shelters should be seriously consideredeven tax shelters based on tax incentives for farmers. By limiting these shelters. we will be able to further reduce tax rates and. probably at least as important. help restore the faith of our citizens that the tax system fairly taxes everyone.",

This is the first significant amendment and the first amendment offered for this side of the aisle that is designed to reduce the deficit by a significant margin.

The second amendment was to freeze defense so that we reduced the deficit by $3 billion. That was offsetting. We were back to scratch. The next amendment was to restore other retirees COLAs which added $1 billion. then there was the amendment to restore the MedicareMedicaid package which added $0.4 billion. then there was the amendment to conform the WalshHealey fair labor standards to practice beyond the Pentagon which reduced the deficit by $300 million. So we are presently in a situation where the Republican sponsored amendmentsI will state that I voted for each of them and many Democrats did. but they all started on that side. The net effect has been to add $1.1 billion to the deficit. That is where we are at this moment. Now we have the first Democratic amendment coming up which will not increase taxes. and will not increase spending but will cut the deficit very significantly.

There is a case which I think would be instructive. and that is Southern Power Administration versus Kentucky Utilities Co.. which is a 1984 proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

And in SEPA. the Commission denied the application by the Southeastern Power Administration for an order requiring Kentucky Utilities. Inc.. to wheel power generated by SEPA to eight of KUs municipal customers. But that is just looking at the question of hiring and wheeling. That is a loaded term. The opportunity of different utilities to service customers within a service territory of another utility. That was pursuant to section 211 of PURPA. PURPA has worked primarily because the whole theory of PURPA was set up on criteria that everyone could know. that are very clear and precise and well understood by people on both sides so everyone knows what the ground rules are and then seek voluntary arrangements. And that has worked. It has worked almost 1.400 times. It has failed to work five times. and two of those five were settled or withdrawn. It has only failed to work in one place where the Commission denied the application and in two cases they are still pending.

They are: Who best develops. conserves. and utilizes the water resources of the region? That. in turn. is a test contained in section 10(a) of the present act and is well understood. and it involves environmental factors as well. Second. the relative economic impact upon customers. third. the economic impact. in the case of a nonutility holder. upon the operation and efficiency of the dependent industrial facility or related activity. fourth. the ability of each applicant to operate and maintain the project in a manner most likely to provide efficient. reliable electric serviceand. reliability. of course. is a very important thing here. Finally. the need of each applicant for the electricity generated by the project to serve its existing customerssurely. a legitimate matter. Now those are the tests upon which you vie for the right to license. We give the present license holder that license only in the event of a tie. You keep the status quo only in the event of a tie.

Why in the world should the Senator from Idaho presume that a public entity responsible for the local constituency is going to export power to some other part of the country?

Today. I want to talk about the provision of the bill that establishes the new position of Deputy Chairman of the JCS. At the present time. the Secretary of Defense. each of the three service Secretaries. and each of the four service chiefs has a deputy. someone who can assist him in his duties and carry on when he is not in Washington. The Chairman Is the only key individual in the Pentagon not having a deputy. Mr. Speaker. even a platoon leader has an assistant. known as a platoon sergeant. Our intent in putting in this feature was to give the Chairman the help he needs in managing the JCS organization. He needs an alter ego. an individual who will understand the issues as they come to his desk. The arrangement that has been in effect over the past 3 years. having one of the service chiefs on call for 3 months at a time to fill in for the Chairman when he is not in Washington. is a workable solution. but it is not the best one. These four men already have two fulltime Jobsrunning their respective services and participating in- JCS deliberationsand to add a third job Is simply asking one man to do too much. The Deputy Chairman would be the second ranking officer in the Armed Forces and also be the director of the Joint staff. those staff officers from the four services who assist the joint chiefs in the performance of their duties. He would also be selected from a service other than that of the Chairman.",

I rise to alert my colleagues to a serious problem confronting our Nations transportation industries. one which I fear is going to become even more serious in the months ahead. In recent months. insurance companies have canceled insurance policies. refused to renew them. or demanded huge increases. often on the order of several hundred percent. One reputable bus company with an excellent safety record had to pay a whopping 800percent premium increase to renew its insurance. Unfortunately. this is typical of what is happening in transportation. not only in the bus industry. but also in truck. rail. and transit. Our Surface Transportation Subcommittee of the Public Works Committee will hold hearings to investigate how this could happen in a supposedly competitive insurance industry. and search for ways to alleviate this problem.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Ways and Means Committee is now in the process of marking up a tax reform bill. One of the key provisions of concern to individual income. taxpayers is President Reagans proposal to eliminate the current deduction for State and local taxes. Repeal of this deduction would have a serious impact on individual taxpayers. and on State and local governments. The deduction for State and local taxes is the oldest in the Federal system. dating back to 1913. The idea behind the deduction is quite clear: to prevent the Federal Government from engaging in the double taxation of Boldface type indicates words inserted or appended. rather than spoken. by a Member of the House on the floor. income already paid out as taxes to State and local governments. The State and local tax deduction has been characterized as one which benefits the wealthy the most. This is simply not true. Over 50 percent of households taking the deduction have incomes of less than $30.000. and 87 percent have incomes of less than $50.000. In fact. more taxpayers33 million in 1982claim the State and local deductions than any other deduction. including the deduction for home mortgage interest. Repeal of the deduction would impose a harsh penalty on States in the NortheastMidwest region of the country. Residents of our area constitute 44 percent of the Nations population. but would pay nearly 60 percent of the cost of eliminating deductibility. In Ohio. the average taxpayer claims $725 for the deduction each year. The decline in Federal funding of social services under the Reagan administration has forced States and localities to pick up a bigger share of the load of caring for those who need help. These governments rely on the Federal deduction to help their taxpayers afford the cost of the services. If the deduction is repealed or substantially curtailed. you can bet there is going to be enormous pressure on States and localities to provide relief from this double taxation by cutting tax rates themselves. So the repeal of the State and local deduction would put the squeeze on States and localities when they can least afford it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for several months. since the Treasury Departments first formal proposal last November. we have been debating the question of whether taxes paid to the State and local governments will continue to be deductible under the Federal income tax system. Both the original Treasury Department proposal and the subsequent tax plan submitted to the Congress in May would completely eliminate the current deduction. The Ways and Means Committee now has before it staff options which propose a compromise which would eliminate the current deductibility of State and local sales taxes and personal property taxes. and would allow State and local income and real property taxes to be deducted up to the greater of $1.000for a joint returnor 5 percent of adjusted gross income. While the proposed compromise is certainly a recognition of the importance of deductibility for income used to pay State and local taxes. it does not go far enough. I remain concerned about what such taxation of State and local taxes would mean. both to the ability of State and local governments to operate and finance programs. and on taxpayers. particularly homeowners. who pay these taxes in States like mine. Fundamentally. the elimination or the largescale curtailing of this deduction runs directly counter to our traditional federal system of governmentit amounts to the Federal Government discouraging State and local governments from collecting revenues in the way they chooseparticularly for States like mine. which are not able to raise revenue through exportable taxes like energy taxes. I support a strong Federal systemState and local governments can and frequently do try programs and initiatives which the Federal cannot do or cannot do as effectively. Indeed. a good deal of the change and activity in our country over the past few yearsin areas from education to resource recovery to health carehas taken place at the State and local levels. Taking away the deductibility of State and local taxes. in essence. taxing people twice. would severely discourage States like mine from undertaking these initiatives. The benefits would be short term. tho result would be the Government again being called upon to assume the responsibilities in these areas.",

Her imprint and contribution were clear on landmark laws to increase child support payments. expand tax credits for day care. and bolster research to combat the dual scourges of Alzheimers disease and AIDs. She was an effective watchdog over his agencys programs and on many occasions her sense of compassion triumphed over others whose passion was simply to cut.

Although there has been considerable success in this area. particularly in many State and local jurisidictions because of the assistance of devoted volunteers groups. much remains to be done. On the Federal level. both the Congress and the executive branch have taken steps to assist crime victims. The Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 authorized Federal courts to order restitution to crime victims and mandated the establishment of Federal Guidelines for the Fair Treatment of Crime Victims. which are currently being implemented. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984. Chapter XIV of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. created a Victims Compensation Fund in the U.S. Treasury. comprised primarily of criminal fine payments. to finance aid to the States for victims compensation and assistance programs. The President appointed a Task Force on Victims of Crime and the Department of Justice has established an Office for Victims of Crime.

In this past Sundays New York Times Education Survey. he spoke out forcefully on the administrations budget proposals for student financial aid in an article entitled. \"Bell Criticizes Assault on the Private Colleges.\" In this excellent article. Bell states: Money for student financial aid is a highpriority investment of the taxpayers dollars. It helps students to help themselves by making them productive. Intelligent and selfsufficient. It represents an Investment that makes taxpayers out of potential tax eaters. The return to the taxpayer over the years is very high. In short. the studentaid program is good public policy. and the radical changes currently proposed are not justified. Former Secretary Bell also makes several other important points. He notes that the primary burden of the administrations cuts in student aid will fall on students attending private colleges and universities. This could result in substantial enrollment shifts from the private colleges and universities to the less expensive public institutions. This would mean shifting costs from Federal taxpayers. who have been providing student aid to enable students to attend more expensive private institutiens. to State taxpayers. who provide a substantial State subsidy for each student enrolled in a public institution. Worst of all. the drastic cuts proposed by the Reagan administration would indicate that we are abandoning the policy of trying to \"nurture an aristocracy of academic excellence.\" allowing talented but lowincome students to \"reach the outer limits of their ability.\" We will return instead to the policy which foolishly barred the doors of many of our best institutions to all but the wealthy.

President Reagan was asked whether or not he intended to include a visit to Dachau as part of his upcoming trip to Europea trip dedicated to commemorating VE Day. The President responded by pointing out that few German citizens alive today were involved in the Second World War. Therefore. he suggested. a trip to Dachau would be inappropriate. President Reagan apparently believes that no purpose is served by a visit to the notorious death camp that is universally recognized as the symbol of the Holocaust. The Presidents thinking betrays a startling lack of understanding. and I am convinced that omiting a visit to Dachau would be a serious mistake. First. public recognition of the Holocaust has nothing to do with the number of German citizens alive today who were involved in the Second World War. Those individuals guilty of personal participation in the genocide of 6 million Jews must be brought to justice. and a visit to Dachau would reaffirm Americas commitment to the purpose. But more important. we must not be lulled by the passage of time into forgetting the horror of Hitlers final solution. The German people are now our friends and allies. and I hope will always remain so. Recalling the Holocaust. however. is not intended to shame our friends. Instead. it is a humble way of paying respect to those who died In the camps. and to those still living that continue to suffer from that pogram. And by paying these respects. we renew our commitment to preserving human rights. our condemnation of wanton murder.

I think if it were saving 2 million barrels of oil a day as of 1975. it would be possible to conclude that the number of barrels saved now would be in excess of that. I would also point out that with respect to traffic safety the statement of the Secretary of Transportation is based upon 1983 figures. According to the letter of the Secretary of Transportation to the majority leader dated On the basis of 1983 figures. daylight saving time in April would reduce traffic deaths nationwide by a minimum of 22. injuries by a minimum of 1.525. and societal costs from auto accidents by a minimum of $28 million.

We are now driving automobiles that get more miles per gallon. All these things have never been factored in. No one has ever talked about the 55mileanhour speed limit that will save lives and has saved lives. They never factored that in to offset. They have given all the credit to daylight saving time. Not only is it going to bring in billions of dollars in 3 weeks. but also. it is going to save 22 lives. thousands of injuries. and all thatjust for daylight saving time. It is somewhat ironic to me that in making these statements. they leave out major important factors. One of the major factors they leave out is the consideration of the children as they go to school. I am reminded of the small child walking to school in the dark who fell in a manhole.

The amendment would change the Uniform Time Act of 1966 to provide that daylight saving time start each year on the first Sunday in April rather in the last Sunday in April. Many Americans and many industries feel the need for additional hours of sunlight during the early springtime. In addition. I have a particular reason to support this amendment. The national headquarters for the National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness is maintained in Baltimore. MD. Victims of RP suffer from night blindness. a condition which robs them of the ability to see after the sun sets. More than 400.000 RP sufferers are forced to postpone the simplest outdoor activities until the Sun rises again. Daylight saving time grants extra hours of productivity to these people. This is a good amendment with a good purpose. People in all parts of the Untied States will experience the benefits of expanded daylight saving time in many forms. including lessened crime and increased energy savings. It is for these and other reasons that I add my voice of support to the amendment and urge my colleagues to do likewise..",

It takes longer than 1 day and it takes a day that is a little bit longer than starting at 3 or 3:30 in the afternoon. the second daytomorrowbeing a day in which Senators are striving to conclude action so they can depart or whatever their plans are for the recess. I do want to point out that on the question of the Philippines assistance. while $150 million is part of the package that the administration has been talking about for the past 2 months. a part of the package that the administration has been talking about is not in this urgent supplemental. That has to do with section 416 of food assistance. Those commodities for the Philippines are wheat and milk. both of which are in huge surplus here and in Federal storage and which we cannot properly use in the Philippines until that part is in the package. along with some recognition of the sugar quota issue. I think we would be wise to hold off. But we do have time before the urgent supplemental will be taken up later on in June. when we come back from the recess. hopefully to work this out with the Department of State and with the Agency for International Development. Because it is something that those of us who are familiar with the Philippines and are familiar with the agricultural trade programs that we placed in the recently passed farm bill do expect and do anticipate fully. that the implementation of some of those programs will come about in the Philippine package because that is the type of friendly country that I think we can rely on to give us a good opportunity for great expansion with them.

It is my thinking that if we are going to make these extra sums available. the money ought not to be used by the new Government of the Philippines to buy things from Japan or any other foreign supplier but. rather. should look to the United States or reduce the existing indebtedness. If they need the funds for debt service. that is a matter that apparently has strong support. at least in the Appropriations Committee.

The distinguished Senator from Mississippi is one of our best members on that committee. I might say.

DC 20510: DEAR SENATOR GORE: Thank you for your letter of January 24. 1986. to Secretary Hodel. transmitting a petition from citizens concerned about coal mining in Tennessee and the policies and programs of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE). In carrying out a Federal regulatory program in Tennessee. OSMREs objectives are to implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and regulations with consistency and to ensure that coal mining operators receive fair and evenhanded treatment. OSMRE believes its objectives are being achieved. If I could depart from the letter a moment. I would note the irony in the Acting Director sending a letter to a U.S. Senator saying that the objectives of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement are being achieved. What does this man who sits in the chair of Acting Director think the taxpayers of this country are paying him to do? They are paying him to follow the strictures of the statute. Continuing on with this letter. the Acting Director says: You also expressed concern about funds collected from Tennessee coal miners which remain unused in the abandoned mine land program. Our records indicate that $15.4 million have been collected from Tennessee coal operators over the life of the Abandoned Mine Land Program. Of this amount. 50 percent. or $7.7 million. represents the States share. Two million dollars have been returned to Tennessee through grants prior to the States relinquishing primacy. So he clearly admits on the face of this letter that Tennessees contributions to the Abandoned Mine Land Program. some $5.7 million. are sitting idle in the fund. He continues on in the letter by saying. \"We are concerned about the Abandoned Mine Land problems in Tennessee. * * *\" Again. I note the irony. Mr. President. If he is concerned about it. why does he not do something about it? But he says in the letter: In the absence of an Abandoned Mine Land Program administered by the State. the Office of Surface Mining. Reclamation. and Enforcement will continue to undertake emergency projects in the State. using moneys from the Secretarys discretionary share of reclamation funds. Then he ends it with the bureaucratic catchall: If we may be of further assistance. please let me know. Sincerely. Jed Christensen. Acting Director.",

Civil rights became a reality for millions of oppressed Americans because men like PETER RODINO were guided by the light of reason and strength of personal conviction.

Sochors teams have not lost an NCAC conference game in 4 years. Although most fans around the country know the UCDavis Aggies as the team which produced NFL players such as Ken OBrien. Rolf Benirshke. Be Eason. Mike Moroski. Casey Merrill. and Rich Martini. local fans recognize the Aggies for winning consistently without the help of athletic scholarships. Academic excellence is as importantand as consistentas winning for the Aggies. The football success of the Aggies has also drawn attention to the overall excellence of UCDavis. revealing to many that a school formerly known only for its agricultural programs has blossomed into a fullgrown and diverse campus of the University of California. known nationally for its programs in agricultural economics. engineering. English and biological science. and for its professional schools in law. medicine. and veterinary medicine. Mr. Speaker. I Include in my remarks Council Resolution No. 7. passed unanimously by the executive council of the Associated Students of UCDavis. congratulating the Aggies on their success. Those of us in the Fourth Congressional District look forward to many more years of success from the Davis Aggies. The resolution follows:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the late 1970s the Romanian Government promised to allow an American Christian group to import 20.000 Bibles into Romania. Indeed. during the Senate hearings on renewal of most favored nation [MFN] trading status. the Romanian Ambassador cited Romanias willingness to receive these Bibles as evidence that there was no religious oppression in the country. MFN was renewed. but the Bibles seem to have disappeared after their delivery. Just over a year ago. it was discovered what happened to them: The Bibles were seized by the government and sent to a papermill plant. There they were manufactured into toilet paper. I have seen this toilet paper. and there can be no doubt that it was in fact made from Bibles. Unfortunately. this type of incident is not uncommon. rather. it seems to be the norm. Many clergymen and Christians have spent years in jail for the mere crime of possessing Christian literature. And yet the Romanian authorities insist that there is complete \"freedom of religion.\" Dissidents disappear or are sentenced to lengthy prison sentences. organized groups of thugs. paid and directed by the government. kill or terrorize those who dare to speak out against the government. And yet. in spite of the abysmal human rights situation there. the United States continues to grant privileged trading status to the ruthless dictatorship that keeps the Romanian people under its thumb. How is it that Bucharest continues to manipulate opinion in Washington so consistently in its favor? Why do we continue to pour dollars and technology into a country that uses all the means at its disposal to oppress and intimidate its population? Some here in Congress still seem to cling to the naive belief that by so doing we can wean Romania away from the Soviet Union. or that they will at the least moderate their actions. But a recent article from the Wall Street Journal. written by Ion Pacepa. the former personal adviser to Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu. should be mandatory reading for anyone who supports continuing MFN for Romania. He details the inner workings of the Ceausescu regime. and explains why MFN should be revoked. I hope my colleagues will take time to read his comments. [From the Wall Street Journal.

Joy undertook the pay equity concern with ferocious determination in 1981. To settle a complaint by the American Federation of State. County. and Municipal Employees [AFSCME]. Picus researched several areas where pay discrepancies existed for entry level positions in occupations predominantly of one sex. She also cochaired the Task Force on Womens Pay Equity to negotiate with elected officials in Los Angeles on the available methods to implement equitable changes in entry level salary discrepancies. After 4 years of research and negotiations. formal meetings had begun with the AFSCME group in November 1984. Joy was an integral component in the development of the first pay equity agreement to successfully take place in a major city. Her diligence and candor have led her to assist 3.900 employees to a $12 million pay adjustment over a 3year period. Joy should be honored today as a woman who has successfully fulfilled roles as wife. mother. and career woman. She did not begin her political career until her children were fully grown. Elected to represent Los Angeles San Fernando Valley district in 1977. Picus had previously done community relations work for the Jewish Federation Council and developed her political acumen with her involvement with the League of Women Voters. I would like to join in a richly deserved tribute to Joy and wish her good luck for the future in serving our communities for the progress of our democratic society.",

This legislation would authorize the National Park Service [NPSJ to enter into a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. the State of Ohio and the affected local governments to initiate a land treatment program to reduce erosion in the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area [NRA]. Since the establishment of the Cuyahoga Valley NRA. soil erosion within its boundaries has been a major problem. Every year. large amounts of soil from former farmland is washed into the Cuyahoga River and carried downstream to Cleveland Harbor. Clogging federally maintained ship channels. The erosion problem requires annual dredging by the Corps of Engineers at a cost of $4 million per year. Although the amount of the sediment attributable to the NRA is disputed. it is clear that an erosion problem does exist and should be addressed. H.R. 934 would authorize Federal appropriations of $4.75 million through fiscal year 1989 for erosion control programs. Although I am concerned about the expenditure of new Federal funds in view of the Federal budget deficits our Nation is facing. H.R. 934 may be the best solution to the problem. However. I would urge that all of the possible alternative solutions to the Cuyahoga erosion problem be thoroughly examined and considered. including the administrations proposal to enter into an interagency agreement with the Department of Agriculture to work with the private landowners to reclaim the eroding sites.

Not only did he hold early hearings on H.R. 934 this year. but he also made a site visit to see firsthand the magnitude of the problems in and along the Cuyahoga River. Mr. Speaker. it is clear that this legislation is needed: Three Federal agenciesthe Army Corps of Engineers. the U.S. Geological Survey. and the U.S. Forest Servicehave studied the sedimentation problem in the Cuyahoga River. They have identified the Cuyahoga River drainage basin between Indpendence and Old Portage stationsbasically the northern and southern limits of the Cuyahoga Valley NRAas the major source of sediment. Lands within the boundaries of the park are estimated to be generating well over half of the sediment in the area. Unfortunately. little has been done. beyond initial planning. to deal with this problem. The National Park Service has yet to make the kind of continuing commitment needed to control erosion from those park lands identified as sources of sediment. And. although the Park Service testified that it has plans for financing the control of erosion on privatelyheld lands lying within the boundaries of the park. no action has been taken to formalize a program for private lands. It appears that if Congress does not act. the Park Service will not be able to do the complete Job. for there is no incentive to the owners of private lands to do or finance the work themselves. Mr. Chairman. this legislation could save an estimated 30 percent of the Corps of Engineers cost of dredging the Cleveland Harbor each year once erosion controls. such as plantings. take hold. This is a potential annual savings of more than $1 million. year after year. Clearly. this legislation. after the initial $4.7 million investment. can save the Government money. And. beyond the monetary benefits accruing to the corps and the improvement we can expect in the scenic quality of the Cuyahoga Valley. the Cuyahoga Valley NRA will be able to address the nagging erosion problems which are threatening other resources within the park.

Head Start provides comprehensive communitybased services to address the health. nutritional. social. and educational needs of some of the Nations poorest children and their families.

We really minimize the need to spend dollars later on for remedial educational programs. We found out from experience the children who participate in the Head Start Program are generally promoted grade by grade as time ordinarily would have their promotion take place. Head Start has provided services to more than 9 million disadvantaged youngsters since 1965. It has proved to be one of the Federal Governments most popular. effective. and enduring programs.

Since it began in 1965 as an 8week summer preschool program enrolling 561.000 children. Head Start has served more than 9.1 million children and families. With a fiscal year 1985 budget of $1.1 billion. Head Start is currently serving 442.100 children in 9.000 centers nationwide. The program also serves nearly 60.000 children with handicaps. In addition. 23 programs serve children of migrant workers. and 36 parent and child centers focus on families with children under the age of three. Extensive studies have documented the effectiveness of a preschool program. Head Start children score higher on standardized tests. they perform better in school and are less likely to require special education. Studies show that every $1 spent on Head Start saves $2.36 that would otherwise be spent on special education and remedial services. One of the more unique and most successful aspects of Head Start Is Its emphasis on parent involvement. The program reinforces parents commitment to their childrens wellbeing and education. Head Start also enjoys strong comunity support.

House Concurrent Resolution 95 commemorates the twentieth anniversary of the Head Start Program. On May 18. 1965. President Johnson announced the establishment of the tremendously successful Head Start Program. a preschool child development program conceived not so much as a Federal effort. but as a neighborhood effort. Children of poverty get a \"head start\" on their future under the program by receiving preschool training to prepare them for regular school in the fall. They get medical and dental attention that they badly need and parents receive counseling on improving the home environment. Head Start is clearly one of the most successful. costeffective and popular programs ever established by the Federal Government. Todays resolution reaffirms Congress commitment to this outstanding program. What began in the summer of 1965 as a 68 week demonstration project was soon transformed into a program which has served some nine million low income preschool children since its creation. Today. more than 400.000 children are enrolled in Head Start programs throughout the Nation. On the 15th anniversary of Head Start. one report indicated that when such factors as reduced cost of special education and remedial services were considered. Head Starts benefits outweighted its costs by 236 percent. The students score higher on mathematics and reading tests. and tend to show stronger achievment orientation than nonHead Start children. Mr. Speaker. on this 20th anniversary of Head Start. It is prudent to recall the words of President Johnson when the program was established. \"Fiveand sixyearold children are inheritors of povertys curse. and not its creators.\" he said. \"Unless we act. these children will pass it on to the next generation. like a family birthmark.\" And in paying tribute to Head Start volunteers. President Johnson said that \"the bread that they cast upon these waters will surely return many thousandfold.\" Today. we commend these volunteers and this program for its benefits over the years.

Based on the theory that early childhood is the most critical period of a childs education and that young children growing up In poverty would learn better if their basic emotional. medical. nutritional. and educational needs were met. Head Start was designed to provide that opportunity. Originally just a summer program serving over half a million children. it has grown in funding from $96.4 million to almost $1.1 billion. Despite rugged times in the past. Congress last year overwhelmingly granted Head Start a 2 year reauthorization. Even this administration. which has been openly critical of a number of social programs. has come to recognize the importance of Head Startwhich now serves 448.250 students. 90 percent of whom are below the poverty line. Yet. there remain over one thousand counties in the United States who do not participate in Head Start. primarily for reasons of inadequate funding. In my district of southwest Washington for example. an area with record level unemployment and obvious need. three of the most desperate counties are without Head Start programs. Start up funds for new programs are simply inadequate. The opportunity to make up for the disadvantages of background. fundamental to the idea behind the Head Start Program. is being lost for those children and for thousands of others around the country. because of poorly considered budget priorities. Twenty years ago. Lady Byrd Johnson. honorary chair of Project Head Start. speaking about these children of poverty. said: \"There is no more important task in our communities than for such children to hear a voice say. Come take my hand!\" I hope that over the next 20 years we can still make that hand available to needy children and in an even more generous way than we have been able to do so far.e",

In recent years. it has become fashionable to attack many of the social programs that were enacted -in those days. Some of those programs have perhaps outlived their usefulness. others may need to be modified. But for 20 years Head Start has lived up to and exceeded the expectations we had when we inaugurated it in 1965. There is a popular notion now that the Federal Government cannot effectively administer programs that deal with the social needs of the people. The new wisdom says that. only the private sector or government on the most local level should deal with matters of health. education. and social welfare. For two decades Head Start has been proving this theory wrong. Unquestionably. some matters are better left to private groups and local government. but this should not exclude the Federal Government from playing a role in this area. Study after study has shown that children from disadvantaged backgrounds who participated in Head Start Programs. have scholastically outperformed their peers who did not. Certainly in light of our huge Federal deficit. we need to reexamine all federally funded programs and make reductions in all parts of the budget. We must be careful however. not to dismantle the many worthwhile programs that have consistently paid dividends over the years. We should also not shy away from new programs. Government can play a role in helping its citizens improve their quality of life. Head Start is a shining example of what government can do when it applies its resources thoughtfully and imaginatively to the social needs of the society.*",

Our Nation rightly prides itself on its dedication to the principle of equal justice under law. Everyone in this countryregardless of wealth. race. or creedhas the right to due process of law. that is. everyone except the very people who have fought and sacrificed a very important part of their lives to protect this and other freedoms enjoyed by American citizens: our veterans. The current law precluding veterans from judicial review for benefits claims was enacted in 1933. when our Nation was reluctant to provide benefits for veterans. Since then. the United States has been involved in three major wars and the veteran population has multiplied. Those still reluctant to provide Federal benefits to veterans are clearly a minority. but sadly. our laws do not reflect this. What we still have is an archaic. closed system which provides very little of the assurance of justice that most citizens enjoy when bringing their cases before a court of law.

Mr. DASHLE. and Mr. EVANS. for reserving this special order and allowing me to publicly voice my support for H.R. 585. the Veterans Administration Adjudication Procedure and Judicial Review Act. I am quite concerned that. presently. veterans are not afforded the same rights to judicial review as those involved in other Federal programs. It seems less than fair that a veterans claim for benefits is decided within the closed system of the Veterans Administration when. for instance. Social Security recipients are able to receive a review by the courts on unfavorable decisions. Presently. if a veteran disagrees with the decision passed down by the Board of Veterans Appeals. he has to reopen his claim again by submitting new and material evidence and. thus. begin the long. arduous process all over again. I feel strongly that the veteran. if he disagrees with BVAs decision. have the option of judicial review of that decision. I want to again thank my colleagues for reserving this special order. I certainly hope that this legislation receives the prompt. successful consideration it deserves so that our Nations veterans can finally have \"their day in court.\"",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Chair. At Mr. LEVINs request. the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the winners and losers in this bill. For 55 percent of the income group over $200.000. the average tax cut is $53.000. That is double the total median income of family taxpayers in this country. I do not believe that the American people feel that this group of 359.000 tax filers need a tax cut of that size. In a study done last year. the Joint Tax Committee found that 152.000 taxpayers in the $200.000andabove income group used tax shelters to reduce their taxes by $6 billion. That is an average of $41.000 on each tax return. This bill nails up the condemnation notices on tax shelters and sends in the bulldozers to sweep them out. I applaud that. But as the Government begins collecting revenues on the taxes now sheltered. it should use those revenues to assist all Americans. and especially should the middleincome taxpayer receive benefits that will relieve him of the lions share of the burden that he now bears. The middle class. in fact. has been bearing the burden of extra taxes because so many of the very highincome individuals in this country have used tax shelters so extensively. The committee bill improves the takehome pay of the middle classes less than it does of the income group over $200.000. I am not just talking about dollar increases. which could be expected. I am talking in terms of percentage increases in takehome pay. which should not be the case. To correct this inequity. we should assure that every sector of the middle class gets a percentage increase in takehome pay that is at least equal to the average increase in takehome pay for all highincome taxpayers. . Mr. President. I believe that middle America is entitled to a better tax break.",

BOWSHER: This weekend I visited the space shuttle launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base. California. The purpose of my visit was to review the status of construction approved by the Subcommittee on Military Construction. I made this trip after I received a staff report which alleged a number of specific problems affecting the ability of these facilities to safely support West Coast shuttle launches. Because of the magnitude of the issues being raised. I request the General Accounting Office to undertake an immediate review of each of them. as well as additional issues which may require investigation. Specifically. the Congress needs to know the history of construction and testing at the Vandenberg STS facility. The GAO should seek to provide the Congress with an evaluation of the ability of the facility to support shuttle launches in the future. I also request that GAO provide me with information which outlines the savings which would accrue to the U.S. Treasury. if a decision were made to place SLC6 into mothball or caretaker status. In addition. I request the GAO to review planned shuttle military missions to ascertain if any of these missions can only be accomplished by manned flight. As the Congress begins a thorough evaluation of the future of manned space flight. such a GAO report will be of tremendous value. GAO should also address the need to build a fourth orbiter. if shuttle flights from Vandenberg are cancelled. I request GAO to draft the report in a manner which provides the Congress with an unclassified response to this request. Any classified information which the GAO feels should be submitted to the Congress in support of such a report. should be submitted as a separate annex to the basic report.

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier. I spoke about the adverse effect that the pending tax bill will have on the basic industries of agriculture. mining. and forest products. I have noted that we will be offering some corrections to the bill. hopefully to pass and enact into a part of the bill some way of dealing with those very inequitable provisions affecting the basic industries. However. this morning. I think I should comment on three other groups that should be examining this tax bill and seeing how it directly affects them. whether they will be paying more taxes or less taxes. First. I want to talk about the young people. the very young people below the age of being out on their own but who are living with their parents or who are students in one of our colleges. trade schools. or universities. They should be looking at this bill because. in many instances. they will find that the provisions in the bill will require them to pay more taxes. That is not generally what we think of as good legislation. or good tax policy. but unfortunately. it is true that in the bill. in some instances. young people earning $4.000. $5.000. or less or who are earning about $7.000 or $8.000 will find that their taxes are increased. Each individual. I warn the public. should be looking at this tax bill in a very private way. in a very intimate way. on just how it affects them. I believe it is poor tax policy to garner more taxes. force young people just starting out to pay more Federal income taxes. The next group that I would like to refer to is the socalled middleincome earners. many of whom are married couples where both have gainful employment. both have paychecks coming in to support themselves. In a great number of instances. these young people will find that their tax liability has been increased if this bill becomes law as it now stands. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed an article from the Wall Street Journal that comments on this feature in the bill. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD. a description of a couple of instances of where the youngsters will be finding themselves paying more taxes if the tax bill is enacted as is.",

I do not think that is wise tax policy. because it is double taxation. I vigorously object. Mr. President. my constant advice to the taxpayers of the United States is this: Look at this bill and how it affects you. Do not take it for granted that it is all rosy. Do not just assume that because good things have been said. mentioning significant features in the bill. it automatically means that your taxes will be reduced or that you are treated in an equitable and fair way.

And I do not know what an average taxpayer is. I do not believe taxpayers do. either. But I will just cite an example of a very young person who works full time on their own and under current law as it stands now with an income of $11.000. with a personal exemption of $1.080. with a standard deduction of $2.480. with allowable deductions typical of such a young person. has a taxable income of $6.490 with a Federal income tax obligation of $801. That is under current law. Under the Senate bill as it now stands. that same person with an income of $11.000 would have a personal exemption of $2.000. a standard deduction of $2.000. a taxable income of $6.530. and a tax obligation of $993 in 1987. That is a 24 percent tax hike. In 1988. the same person with $11.000 income would pay $900 Federal taxes. just 13 percent higher than current law. But in both years and forever. a single person will be taxed more. Now. there is no Porsche. there is nothing unusual about it. It is somebody working who earns $11.000. presumably on their first. second. or third job. presumably trying to get ahead. And this young person would actually find a tax obligation increase by 24 percent the first year. 13 percent the second year and beyond. That is not what we are talking about as good policy. Perhaps single taxpayers are in the minority. But I do not think it is good that some young person making $11.000. on their own. finds that through our actions here have had their tax obligation increased. That will happen. unless this bill is changed. It is happening under this bill. And I want to point that out because I think we move so fast on tax changes and tax policies that we get ahead of ourselves and we certainly get ahead of the taxpayers in this country.

Those rebates result from excessive reserves that accumulated in the program. In order to reduce these reserves. the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] authorized carriers in 1985 to pay rebates to currently enrolled subscribers. Rebates were authorized as a method for reducing the 1985 contributions of subscribers. Eleven carriers announced plans to make rebates to their 1985 subscribers and set aside reserves from which the rebates would be made. OPM determined. however. that annuitants cannot receive the rebates because the present law does not authorize OPM to reduce the contributions of annuitants. Rebates to employees and annuitants were delayed pending consideration of this corrective legislation. Employees. annuitants and the Government contribute to the health benefits plans and should share proportionately in any rebates. This act amends 5 U.S.C. 8909(b) to give OPM specific authority to use excess contingency reserve balances to reduce the contributions of annuitants as well as the contributions of employees and the Government. Section 101 of H.R. 4061 will be effective upon enactment. but rebates to annuitants will be authorized even if made to annuitants enrolled in a plan as of a specific date in 1985 in order to permit annuitants to share with employees in the 1985 reductions.",

I stand in the particular debt of the majority leader. the minority leader. the Senator from Colorado . and the Senator from Tennessee for the work they have done in really bringing into focus the issues that are involved in this somewhat complex issue of televising the proceedings of the Senate and providing for radio coverage of Senate debates. The compromise which has resulted from their deliberations will not satisfy everyone. I do not know that it is possible to make any arrangement that would be totally satisfactory to every Member of the Senateindeed. fully satisfying to any Member of the Senate. But it seems to me this has resulted in some modest changes in the rules which would improve the efficiency of the work of the Senate and has provided more specifically for the procedures under which television and radio coverage would actually take place. We live in a very complex world. It is difficult to understand the issues that dictate the course of our lives even under the best of circumstances. If we deny ourselves this important educational tool. I think we will be depriving the American people of a very important method of understanding the elements of Government that affect their lives. There is. of course. a strong historical factor here which is provided for in the substitute. the storing of the tapes of these proceedings. Some of them. I am sure. will be extremely dull. Some of them will be so dull that no one will ever put them on their television screens. But some of them will be of great and fascinating interest and of real importance in understanding the history of this era. So. Mr. President. I am again grateful to Mr. DOLE. Mr. BYRD. Mr. ARMSTRONG. and Mr. GORE. I hope that at the end of this long period of considerationwhich really is longer than just the current debate. it goes back for several years.

Reverend Ezell married Edna Watkins. a young woman who shared his faith in God and devotion to His service. Following an evangelistic tour in the Midwest. the Ezells settled in Torrance to continue their ministry. In 1946. Reverend Ezell established Boulevard Assembly of God in Wilmington. but he has spent the last few years witnessing the remodeling of the Harbor Christian Center. a structure he had built in the late 1940s which can no longer accommodate the standing room only crowds which flock to the Centers services. Reverend Ezell does not limit his ministry to the Harbor Christian Center. He founded the Halo Ministries to Mexico and has recently organized and conducted twiceyearly tours of the Holy Land. He also devotes a great deal of his time to civic responsibilities. such as speaking at local schools. participating in ecumenical events. and assisting in the urban renewal efforts of the Wilmington/Los Angeles Harbor area. In 1980. Reverend Ezell was justifiably named Wilmingtons Citizen of the Year. My wife. Lee. joins me in congratulating Rev. Herbert W. Ezell on this momentous occasion.

Mr. LEACH. for whom we have a great deal of respect. I think this is important legislation and legislation with which I have been concerned about during my 26 years in Congress. I am from Rhode Island where imports have hurt many of our industries to a degree or to an extent to where we have lost quite a few of our basic industries. I wish that a long time ago we would have given the administration the assistance that we do in this particular piece of legislation. This legislation would establish a tied aid credit war chest to fight the subsidies that are given our foreign competitors and which they have unfairly used over. lo. these many years. If this legislation had been enacted earlier. perhaps many more plants in Rhode Island would be operating today. Unfortunately. many of those mills have now been converted to other purposes. Again. I thank my colleagues for their diligent work and hope that this conference report will be adopted unanimously because it is a giant step in the right direction.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 5548. which reauthorizes the programs of the ExportImport Bank. In addition. it includes a new mixed credit program within the Bank that will be used to combat similar financing used by many of our competitors. This program will give our exporters an opportunity to compete with mixed credit financing aggressively used by many of our trading competitors to capture new markets. The record trade deficit of last year will soon be eclipsed by the trade deficit for this year. Therefore. it is important that we reauthorize our major trade promotion programs in Exim. This process has been long. arduous. and sometimes acrimonious this year. I have often disagreed with the majority of my colleagues on the Banking Committee over the mixed credit program. The compromise provided for in the conference committee meets the concerns of both sides of this debate and I strongly support it. By reauthorizing the Exim. we will do much to assist our exporters to compete with foreign competition. Most of the major trading countries have substantially larger programs to assist their exporters. These include new programs established by some of our trading partners to offset the effects of the falling dollar. Our competitors are serious about capturing and maintaining other markets. By reauthorizing the ExportImport Bank. we affirm our commitment to expanding our own exports and competing for the international markets. Before concluding my remarks. I would like to address one of the usual objections to funding the Eximbank. We often hear that it is an unnecessary Government subsidy for a few very large companies. Without considering the essential need to give our exporters financing tools similar to those of their competitors. we should recognize that the benefit of the program reaches substantially further then is readily seen. For example. General Electric uses these Exim programs to export locomotives. airplane engines. and turbines. These three product lines alone involve 9.000 suppliers located in 44 States. Clearly. the economic impact and benefit is national in scope and much broader than it appears on the surface. I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report and commend the gentleman from North Carolina and the gentleman from Iowa for their efforts in crafting a conference report that is responsive to the pressure on our exporters and should help reduce our trade deficit.",

I want to compliment the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Nealul and his ranking minority member for the outstanding job they have done in conferring and coming up with reasonable compromise on this very important export facility. As has been indicated by several of the previous speakers. unless we have financing capability which is fully competitive with any in the world. U.S. exports are not going to be able to penetrate markets. and we are not going to be able to create the kind of highpaying. highquality jobs we want for ourselves and for future generations. I think the compromises in this conference report are entirely reasonable. and I compliment those who have negotiated a reasonable program. Mr. Speaker. in supporting the reauthorization of the ExportImport Bank. I want to make one observation about a provision in the bill which affects the multilateral development banks which are in the jurisdiction of the subcommittee of the Banking Committee. which I chair. The provision having to do with U.S. voting policy in the MDBs on commodities in surplus on world markets is a reiteration of existing law. In appropriations measures since 1978. the Congress has made clear that the United States should not vote for loans for commodities in world oversupply. The House conferees did not accept Senate language which would have extended existing law and which. in the view of House conferees and. I might add. in the view of the administration. would have been bad policy and would have adversely affected the U.S. role in these multilateral institutions. We accepted only this reiteration of existing law. With that as an explanation and a further history as to what has happened and what was agreed to with respect to the U.S. support and vote on the multilateral development banks. I want to again express my support for the conference report. I urge the Members to vote in favor of this conference report.",

For a number of years now. the administrations representatives to a number of these development banks have been voting for loans that go to a long list of countries around the world that are used to develop textile mills and other businesses that then compete with our products.

Certainly it is appropriate that the MDBs support loans to countries who are trying to industrialize and trying to upgrade their own economies. However. almost similar to the comment I was just making about agriculture and commodities. it ought to be. and is. in fact. the stated policy of the United States not to encourage the development of economic entities in these lesser developed countries which are in oversupply around the world. In other words. if you already have too much steel capacity or textile capacity. it does not make very much sense to get these countries further involved in something which will not result in the greatest prosperity to those countries because there is already an abundance of competitors out there. The idea ought to be that the United States should support loans to industrialize those countries maybe where there is competition with our own companies. to be sure. or other developed countries. but only where there is not an oversupply of total capacity in the world. That is a judgment that I think our directors and our representatives to these banks have to make. I agree with the gentleman from North Carolina. We should be certain not only in our own interests. but in the interests of these lesser developed countries. that we not be encouraging them in areas such as textiles where clearly there is a worldwide overcapacity.",

Now. I wonder if the administration has been abiding by that law by voting for all these projects. I am thinking specifically of textiles where we have lost some 400.000 jobs over the last 4 or 5 years and where our textile imports have doubled. I am just curious.

The new Soviet leader. with Chernenko barely laid to rest. belligerently threatened to topple Pakistans Government If the United States continued military pressure on Nicaragua. Was concern for an amiable environment at Geneva the reason for the relative silence about the coldblooded murder of the American Army official in East Germany. and for the lack of response to Gorbachevs bullying?

This retail discount chain has grown very rapidly over the last 20 years. and there are now 753 stores nationwide. Recently. Mr. President. WalMart took an important step In an effort to help the apparel industry In the State of Arkansas. The company. headquartered in Bentonville.

Father Lawrence Jenco. Father Jenco is a 51yearold Catholic priest and native of Joliet. IL. He was the director of Catholic Relief Services in Beirut prior to being abducted on January 8. 1985. Just a few days ago. more than 10 of Father Jencos relatives flew all the way to Washington. DC. for meetings at the State Department to discuss his plight. During their visit they came to my office to inform Congressman GEORGE OBRIEN. Senator PAUL SIMON. and me about their discussions with members of the Foreign Service. Without going into any sensitive details. I think it is fair to say that the situation is not entirely optimistic. Our Government is in constant contact with officials of the Lebanese Government. as well as with representatives of other nearby states. The critical problem is that very little is known about Islamic Jihad. other than it is believed that its members are proIranian Lebanese Shia extremists. It is extremely difficult to obtain accurate information about this group. and even more difficult to penetrate. Yet. I believe the Jencos were heartened to be assured that the administration has been engaged in Governmentwide efforts to obtain the safe release of Father Jenco.

Madam President. several weeks ago the President announced that there would be no request on the part of the United States for an extension of the voluntary restraints on the shipment of Japanese automobiles into the United States. That announcement came immediately following the release of the trade statistics for 1984. The 1984 trade numbers showed that the United States ran a bilateral deficit with Japan of approximately $37 billion. The estimates of the effect of limiting the voluntary restraints on automobile imports are that this will mean an increased level of Japanese auto sales in the United States of somewhere between $4 billion on upthe highest figure I have heard is about $10 billion. This concurrent resolution would have been a bill except for a procedural problem. The procedural problem is that the House takes the position that trade bills have to originate in the House. The Finance Committee has not yet received a House bill on which to put this proposition. and therefore the best we could do was a senseoftheCongress resolution. The thrust of the resolution is that the $4 billion plus additional sales of Japanese automobiles must be offset by at least that amount of additional sales by the United States in the Japanese market. The theory of the resolution is that it focuses on results rather than promises. The resolution focuses on numerical results. If the Japanese are going to be shipping x number of dollars of additional cars into markets. we are going to have at least x numbers of dollars of additional sales into the Japanese markets. Failing that. the resolution calls on the United States to retaliate. Madam President. let me say what this resolution is not. This resolution is not a message directed to the Japanese. I do not think transmitting messages does very much good. Rather. the resolution is designed to establish a policy in international trade. a policy which will be the policy of the United States. and that is that $37 billion is too much. that the $37 billion is not going to be increased by increased sales of automobiles. and that the United States deserves equal treatment by the Japanese. and if we do not get it. we will act to retaliate.",

I must say that even if this were a bill. I think it scarcely meets the test of taking the kind of action and achieving the kind of performance on the part of Japan that is needed at this time. We know that we have a serious trade problem with Japan. but what is less well known is that. as serious as our problem is. the problems of other countries with Japan are worse. Where their currencies are relatively weak and the yen is strong. as was the case of Korea and Germany. they have even less success penetrating the Japanese market than we do. in spite of our strong dollar and. relative to the dollar. the weak yen. What is the problem? The problem is that the Japanese nation has become the most protectionist nation on Earth. It is not new. It started many years ago. even before the Meiji period. but today what we see is a policy that protects infant industries. It is a policy that protects declining industries for decades. It is a policy called industrial targeting. which continues to this day. part of which is to protect those industries that are targeted while they are growing.

Second. stop subsidizing dumped goods coming from Japan. and for that matter from every other country. Earlier this week I was in Pittsburgh. PA. meeting with some 200 unemployed workers who are in a desperate circumstance looking for an extension of unemployment compensation benefits. and their plight can be significantly traced to unfair foreign predatory trade practices of subsidized .dumping coming into this country partly on steel. partly on automobiles. partly on many. many other goods. Mr. President. this a very m.ild resolution which I do 3upport. but let it be a signal that unless there is some restraint and sorne sensibility on the part of the Japanese this Congress may soon come forward with legislation on domestic content which has a tremendous amount of support. something that I have not been willing to sign onto. Quota legislation that was introduced last year on steel is gaining adherents. and. if there is not reciprocity. in the absence of subsidies and dumping.

It has been the policy of the South African Government not to do business with nations that impose sanctions against South Africa. Mr. President. Foreign Minister R.F. (Pik) Botha made his governments position quite clear on September 16 following economic sanctions imposed by the European community. when he said: Now that further punitive measures have become a reality. the South African Government will consider appropriate measures in defense of the sectors affected and in the interests of the country as a whole. So it was no last minute \"bombshell\" as described by the media. Nor is there anything unreasonable about South Africas position. The sanctions bill vetoed by the President proposes to ban totally the importation of South African agricultural products. Who would be so naive as to expect the South Africans to continue buying large supplies of corn and wheat when the U.S. Congress votes to ban South Africas commodities? Mr. President. the United States has been exporting far more to the South Africans than we have been purchasing from them. So it is obvious who will be loser in the area of agricultural trade.

Indeed. that must be accomplished by South Africansboth black and white. I believe that South Africans will do just that. The shoulders of South Africa are not broad enough to continue to carry this heavy burden called apartheid. It is important. Mr. President. that. the people of South Africa know that the people of the United States of America no longer support the cruel stateenforced segregation which is inflicted on the black citizens of South Africa.

Blacks in South Africa have suffered for 40 years under the yoke of apartheid. they have indicated a willingness to suffer some more in the interest of freedom. The administration has responded to each new outrage from Pretoria with cosmetic replies. The current response is simply to name a black ambassador to South Africa. The problem has been not with the messenger but with the message. The message to the South African Government in the Congress is that a change in their policies must come.

Under the circumstances. a vote to sustain the veto would constitute a vote to condone not only a failed policy but continued adherence to that failed policy. Mr. President. we can all fail at our appointed tasks. but we owe it to ourselves and to our country to recognize those failures and to change our course. The strong recognize their own failings. the weak persist in ignoring them. I cannot close Mr. President. before commenting on one broadly held opinion. namely. that this Government should not act because the South African Government is determined to reform itself. Anyone who believes this. Mr. President. should study State President Bothas (Boatas) statements of this week.

For example. it may be necessary for the United States firm to provide funds to a controlled affiliate in South Africa to provide severance payments or other financial support to employees laid off or separated by reason of business curtailment or a sale to other parties. Another illustration is one in which a business in South Africa is to be sold to its local employees. The U.S. parent company may find it necessary or appropriate to provide funds or credit. directly or indirectly. to help finance the sale. It is not the intention of the Congress in enacting this legislation to prohibit loans or investments that facilitate orderly disinvestment or curtailment of activities in South Africa.

In June of this year. the EPG issued its thoughtful and compelling report. concluding that \"while the South African Government claims to be ready to negotiate. it is in truth not yet prepared to negotiate fundamental change. nor to countenance the creation of genuine democratic structures. nor to face the prospect of the end of white domination and white power in the foreseeable future. Its programme of reform does not end apartheid. but seeks to give it a less inhuman face.\" In the same Eminent Persons Group report. they stated: It is not whether economic sanctions will compel change. it is already the case that their absence. and Pretorias belief that they need not be feared. deters change. The administration condemns this package of economic sanctions because they would hurt blacks. The sanctions will hurt blacks. there can be little doubt about that. but blacks are infinitely more hurt by the repugnant system of apartheid.

It sounds to me as if he is confusing what we are doing here with deferrals with the program we have had in a variety of areas in the past of loan forgiveness. Under the great education bill signed by President Eisenhower in 1959. we said to school teachers. \"If you go out and teach. for each year you teach up to 5 years. we will forgive 20 percent of what you owe on your student loan.\" This provision does not do that. This provision merely says you do not start making your payments so long as you are teaching. for up to 3 years. The obvious purpose of this is to recognize that \"A Nation at Risk.\" the report of the Presidents Commission that triggered instant attention across this country. we forewarned and all the figures tell us that this is proving to be true: That we have a tremendous teacher shortage facing us. It is hard for people to believe. in times when we have been reducing the number of classroom teachers. that in many places. including my own State of Michigan. where there has been a reduction in the number of classroom teachers in the last 6 years by 12.000. that we are facing a dreadful shortage before the year 1990. the end of this reauthorization. In the case of Michigan. primarily because we have laid off all the lowseniority teacher. we now have older teachers who are going to be retiring during this period of time. Across the country. we will need more than a million new teachers between now and 1991. When we take a look at what is happening. we will discover that young people are not opting",

But on a serious note. let me observe this to the gentleman: I know of no State that recognizes any contradiction to the common law that has held that once people become married. even females become emancipated from the responsibilities by and to their parents. Even in the days when we did not give women other kinds of civil rights. the act of marriage emancipated them from the control of the parents.

Mr. Chairman. the name of this amendment. livability and employment. aptly describes the series of statutory changes aimed at improving the living environment and the delivery system of housing to lowincome persons. This amendment provides flexibility to local housing authorities. rewards good management. and offers tenants greater freedom of choice and encouragement to gain employment. Among the amendments most significant provisions is portability of vouchers. Portability meaning that a public housing tenant who is compelled for job or family reasons to move within a metropolitan area does not have to relinquish his or her assistance to make the necessary move. The provision which would allow public housing tenants to apply for section 8 vouchers is an excellent way to provide mobility for tenants. Providing a choice of housing assistance allows tenants options to improve their lives by being able to live closer to attainable jobs. Similar improvement to public housing programs include. a gradual phasein of rent increases occasioned by improved employment opportunities gained by tenants. An additional provision makes HUD less intrusive into the daily operations of public housing activity.

I would suggest to the gentleman that perhaps we are in a jam with public housing and have been for a long. long time. We have some 36 percent of the current units that are substandard. We have tenants and residents that tell us they want to live under better conditions and we have residents that tell us one at a time that sometimes the Federal laws themselves get in their way of getting a job or buying or house or living better. I think we are in a jam. I think that the residents have told us. and that is where these amendments came from. from tenants and residents. how to get unstuck out of that jam. It is not easy. There is no easy answer. There is no panacea. but the residents will tell us that they want to get jobs. that they want to be able to manage their own units and own their own units and that they want to essentially be provided an opportunity to live under better conditions. Let me go through some of this section by section and tell the gentleman what they mean. Portability of section 8 certificates and vouchers means simply this. It means that when a person has a section 8 certificate and lives in one city that is a jurisdiction. it does not matter to that resident what jurisdiction he lives in. That resident wants a job and if he were to get a job across town up the freeway in some other \"jurisdiction.\" he or she needs to be able to move close to the job. Right now the Federal Government sets up all kinds of barriers to just simply moving to another place where the tenant wants to live. This removes the barriers.

I think are a major improvement in the situation. but I think the gentleman from Michigan raises a more fundamental question in his comments. No. 1. we have made a decision on this floor this week not to construct any new public housing units. to use those resources for the rehabilitation of existing units. We think at least that rehabilitation is important. but we also feel there should have been some 5.000 units of new public housing provided. because they represent the best buy in terms of meeting the needs of low income folks. and I voted with the gentleman to maintain those 5.000 new units because we need them. We need balance. We need adequate resources to deal with modernization and rehabilitation of existing units. because they represent one of the best investments for taxpayers. So the gentleman from Michigan is right in that particular sense in my view. but the House did not agree with our view this week. I guess we lost on that. so we are not going to construct any new ones. Last night in an amendment we decided to sell off much. or at least some of the public housing. at least to make that a possibility. The problem is. I share a lot of optimism with regard to the economy. but I think in the 1990s we still may have some lowincome people in our society who deserve the same opportunity that lowincome people have today. as limited an opportunity as it is. to live in some lowincome housing and some lowincome public housing. as a matter of fact. Now. today. of course. the other point I wanted to mention is that the gentleman from Michigan is correct in terms of the demolition amendment. All of us are looking for flexibility.

The President has to submit no fewer than 25 names during this 4year process. as the background of each was examined with a microscope and every conceivable objection that could be raised about the candidates was raised. This is not to say that no legitimate inquiries were made during committee consideration of the candidates. But we have long since passed the point when we should have said enough is enough. Administration of the LSC suffered for the lack of a confirmed board. And the primary victims were not the nominees. but the constituency the LSC serves. the poor. Four years is a long time. but in this case. the saying \"Better late than never\" aptly describes the vote we are taking today. By confirming these nominees. we will finally allow the Legal Services Corporation to get on with its business. free of uncertainties about who will be at the helm. I expect each of. the nominees to do an outstanding Job in their longsought positions. I respect them for sticking with it and congratulate them on their confirmation.",

It has been 4 years since the LSC has functioned with a confirmed board. Although I may differ with several of the nominees over issues facing the LSC. I believe it is important that the LSC be allowed to operate with a confirmed board as Congress intended. In my support for the nominees. however. I would like to make it clear that I am not endorsing any change in policy which would affect the operation of existing staff attorney programs. In my experience. I have found the four LSCfunded programs in Oregon to be excellent organizations. They are operating in a manner consistent with the original goal of Congress to provide high quality legal services to the poor. They have proven to be an efficient and costeffective method of providing high quality representation. Mr. President. I trust that todays vote will mark the beginning of a renewed commitment by both the Congress and the Legal Services Corporation Board of Directors to ensure that our Nations poo- have full access under law to comprhensive and effective legal services. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I certainly will renew my commitment to that end.",

Mr. HATFiLD. that the staff attorney programs in Oregon are of the highest quality. I strongly support the local boards of directors and feel they are responsive the local needs. The existing staff attorney programs also have the strong support of the Oregon State Bar. The original intent of Congress. when we voted to establish the LSC. was to provide quality legal services to the poor. The four LSCfunded programs in Oregon are performing that very function. Offices are geographically located throughout Oregon to allow reasonable access to legal services for both urban and rural lowincome people. Based in local communities for many years. these offices have ewred the respect of the legal community. The Oregon programs serve in excess of 25.000 lowincome families each year in problems ranging from domestic violence to difficulties in securing Social Security benefits. I trust the new Board of Directors for the LSC will continue to fund the current method of delivery of legal services to the poor.",

The past formula that we have had has taken that into account. It seems to me the change now proposed by the committee adds considerably more for the smaller States in a new threetier system that works out in a way that is extremely unfair to some of the larger States. Under the formula adopted by the committee. California stands to lose $180 million In Federal funds over a 5year period. This would result In 15 California communities which need to build sewage treatment facilities not receiving funding. These communities would have received Federal funding under the current allocation formula which gives 7.29 percent to California. less than we would be entitled to on a per capita basis. The revised formula is based on needs in the core treatment categories. This hurts California because it does not take into account significant needs in San Francisco to correct combined sewer overflow problems. These projects are necessary to meet the enforceable requirements of the Clean Water Act. Additionally. just in terms of what the general formula proposals would do. the revised formula increases funding to 32 States which. as of April 1. 1985. have unobligated fiscal year 1985 grant fund balances averaging 68 percent. Ten of the States that would receive increased funding under the new formula have unobligated fiscal year 1985 grant fund balances of 90 to 100 percent. Moreover. many of the benefited States have not obligated all of their fiscal year 1984 funds. California. on the other hand. has obligated 83 percent of its fiscal year 1985 Federal funds and essentially all of its fiscal year 1984 funds. It seems grossly unfair to transfer grant funds from rapidly moving States such as California to States with high percentages of unobligated funds.

Senator Magnuson is responsible for landmark legislation in many areas. As chairman of the Commerce Committee. I personally admire his tremendous achievements in several areas under the committees Jurisdiction. His accomplishments in consumer protection are responsible for current Federal policy in this critical area. The list of major consumer laws which he authored is truly remarkable. In 1974. he was author of the MagnusonMoss Warranty Act which required manufacturers to make warranties clear and to live up to their promises. In addition. he was author of the Flammable Fabric Act which set flammability standards for fabric. draperies and. more importantly. childrens sleepwear. The numerous other laws which Senator Magnuson authored include: The Poison Prevention Packaging Act. the Toy Safety Act. the Truth in Lending Act. the Truth in Packaging Act. the Truth in Labeling Act. and the Highway Safety Act. Senator Magnuson was also a leader on environmental issues within the Commerce Committees jurisdiction. For instance. he authored the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 which established stringent standards for the construction and operation of tanks. In fact. the Senator is often referred to as \"Mr. Oceanography\" because of his role as a prime mover in the field of oceanrelated legislation. Senator Magnusons concern for the rights of American fishermen against foreign interlopers is well known. In this regard. the Senator authored the Magnuson Fisheries Management and Conservation Act. legislation that set a 200mile limit on foreign fishing ships. As a successor to the former chairman of the Commerce Committee. I am inspired by his accomplishments. Be it health. consumer protection. transportation. communications or the environment.

This provision of the Revenue Code (section 190) will expire this year. Since its creation in 1976. it has been renewed on three occasions. Section 190 provides an option whereby business persons can deduct from taxable income those expenditures made for accessibility. instead of depreciating the capital improvements over a number of years. The maximum allowable income tax deduction is $35.000. thus the annual revenue cost of this proposal is slight. Income tax incentives constitute an effective way for btiness and the Federal Government to work together for the voluntary removal of architectural barriers that prevent disabled and elderly citizens from gaining access to places of commerce. housing. recreation. and employment. Section 190 is the only fiscal inducement to private business operators to make their facilities accessible. Individuals with disabilities must have access to and safe use of the humanmade environment if they are to enjoy the same rights and opportunities as other people to participate fully in everyday living activities. The limitations imposed on persons with disabilities by architectural barriers severely affect their efforts to secure education and gainful employment. It reduces their access to needed health care and presents a serious deterrent to their participation in community life. Over the last several decades America has strengthened its commitment to full equality for all of its disabled citizens by expanding educational. health. and job opportunites and by passing and enforcing landmark civil rights legislation. Nevertheless. many handicapped persons continue to find themselves in situations where their rights are effectively. if inadvertently. denied due to architectural and design barriers. If the Federal Government fails to provide an incentive such as an income tax deduction or credit. business operators may not be inclined to bear accessibilityrelated costs. Because accessibility is so important to Americas handicapped and elderly citizens. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the extension of the beneficial provisions of section 190.

It has no army. It does not seek to protect itself with one. Rather. in the turbulence of contemporary Central America. Costa Rica seeks to protect its vital interests with wisdom. not warriors and weapons. This is no easy task. There continues to be serious tension on the Costa RicaNicaragua border. The recent incident at the Costa Rican Embassy in Managua is wellknown. I take a back seat to no one in my support for Costa Rica. my sympathy for the delicacy of its situation and my desire to see Costa Rica continue as a secure and sovereign nation following its independent course in Central America. Therefore I. too. am concerned about tensions between Costa Rica and its neighbors. But there are some in this country who are willing to let their concern for tensions between Costa Rica and Nicaragua override their perceptions of Costa Ricas position and intentions regarding Central Americas conflicts. Costa Rica has announced it intends to be neutral. The United States should take Costa Rica at its word. The United States should support that small nation in this wise decision.*",

She realized that her status as the first congresswomanat a time when most women were still not permitted to votemarked her for special attention. however much she strove to be just another freshman member of the Sixtyfifth Congress. Jeannette Rankin was not a woman who shrank from hard and difficult tasks. Covering every Inch of her vast Montana district. much of it on horseback. spending more time in kitchens and parlors than in meeting halls or political headquarters. she had entered without fear In the heretofore allmale world of politicsand done it successfully. Along with most of her colleaguesand President Wilson himselfshe had successfully campaigned on a position of nonintervention. She was a pacifist who In those less complex days did not resist the label of \"isolationist\"-and she did not believe that this war would end all wars. The New York Times editorialized that her vote was \"almost final proof of feminine incapacity for straight reasoning.\" While she was the object of scorn. she was indeed a tower of strength. She proved to America that women in public office could be strong in their convictions. powerful In sentiment and firm in belief. And she proved that they could not be pushed around.

He won a Statesupervised recount by 418 votes. Yet. on those occasions you said that it was too close. Indiana law is too confusing. and you said most of all. count all the ballots. We have Just heard today where 10 ballots were counted and yet 32 more. similarly situated. ballots were not counted. and Mr. Shumway himself said those ballots should have been counted.

Because of its membership being basically those who were survivors of a particular event in history there Is no opportunity for that membership to expand and continue on a perpetual basis. Whether such charters should be granted is open to some question as a matter of policy for this House and the other body to decide. This is a worthy organization. Its purposes are good and sound.

I think. however. we ought to be looking a lot more closely at whether charters should be granted to organizations that are bound to reduce in size and at some point in time be inactive or become inactive. for all practical purposes at any rate. The question then is what do we do to clean up the record.

Mr. Speaker. the Daughters of the Union Veterans of the Civil War 18611865 is a nonprofit organization which was organized in Massillon. OH. on May 30. 1885. It was incorporated as the National Alliance for Daughters of Veterans on December 12. 1885. In 1944. the corporation changed its name to the Daughters of the Union Veterans of the Civil War 186165. This organization is among the oldest veteran and patriotic societies in the country. Membership in this organization is open to women descendants of Union soldiers. sailors. and marines who were honorably discharged. killed. or missing in action. Members must be at least 8 years of age. This organization has a membership of over 20.000. The objects of the organization are to promote this Nations history and to perpetuate the memories of the men who sacrificed their lives and wellbeing to preserve the Union. This organization has built and maintains a museum and library in Springfield. IL. which is dedicated to Civil War memorabilia. The organization has established scholarships at the State and national level to encourage educational achievement in U.S. history. It also provides scholarships. awards. and gifts for young men and women who serve in the Nations four military academies. This organization has been active in efforts to construct and preserve monuments which commemorate the Civil War. Members also serve as volunteers to help veterans in medical centers. homes. and other institutions. It is the recommendation of the Judiciary Committee that H.R. 1806 be passed by the House.",

I thank the gentleman from Texas for his support of this measure which. in fact. does afford the opportunity for members of the organization to provide comfort and services to veterans. regardless of their geographic origin. As the gentleman from Texas has pointed out. the organization now known as the Daughters of the Union Veterans of the Civil War 18611865. Inc.. is an organization that began its life back in 1885. We have had ample opportunity to see the kind of services they provide through their 34 departments organized State by State. Each department consists of three or more tents or local organizations at the community level. And through this network or organizational elements the members of the Daughters of the Union Veterans of the Civil War reach out to veterans all over this country. Perhaps the most important service rendered by the organization is its support for the U.S. veterans administrative volunteer service. This charter might be differentiated from the previous one. and I think it may be in order to comment to that effect since we are talking about an organization based on history that is more remote in point of time. However. the potential for the membership of this organization to grow rather than to shrink is what differentiates the two. The prior organization. Survivors of Pearl Harbor. of course. are a finite group. The Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War. of course. Increase in number as the years go by. barring unforeseen circumstances. I would strongly urge the support and passage of this measure granting a charter which. again. contains all of the safeguards that are included in Federal charter provisions in recent years under the rules that are followed by the Subcommittee on Administrative Law of the Committee on the Judiciary. I think we can Join in strongly supporting this measure. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

I would just like to point out that we have two options under GrammRudman. and that is to legislate or sequestrate. GrammRudman and the farm bill were two of the very last pieces of legislation that we acted upon in the last Congress. The farm bill. the new farm law. is the first piece of legislation to feel the impacts of GrammRudman because of the process here. I mean. the law was the last one passed. and the regulations. if I may say to the gentleman from Massachusetts. are just now being implemented. That is why agriculture is here up front. I am not necessarily saying it is the first to be felt. We are in a particularly difficult bind because we are beginning to implement the law with regulation. So I think the Agriculture Committee has done the responsible thing here. There is a twist here that needs some attention. We are trying to legislate it rather than to let the automatic sequestration take effect. I dare say. and I say this in all sympathy to the arguments of the gentleman from New York. that we are going to face situations like this many times this year. It just happens. if I may say to the gentleman. the gentleman complains that there has been a lack of sympathy in the past for our not acceding to new programs. I think we are going to see a lot of it this year. I would hope that the gentleman. in the spirit of amity and compromise here. in the hopes of some of the rest of this coming around this year later on some of the programs that the gentleman is interested in. might see his way clear to letting us deal with this problem which is of such serious consequence to so many people in the agricultural community.",

If we report that someone has been sequestered. we do not expect that that means he or she will never be heard from again. unless maybe they are in South Africa or Afghanistan. This is not a sequestration. People who say this is sequestration do not know the difference between a couple years in jail and capital punishment. But that is the least of the ignorances which the authors of GrammRudman have inflicted upon us. The point is that on March 1 everybody is going to feel the pain. A lot of things are going to get cut back. not just agriculture. I understand that agriculture has a particular March 1 deadline. but everything gets cut back And I want to be very clear why we are here. We are here because the majority of both Houses voted for and the President signed a dumb bill. I did not vote for the dumb bill. I would like to change it. The gentleman from New York is right. I cannot agree to the underlying legislation which says: Change the thrust. and not in a minor way. but in a major way. I want to repeat. the gentleman from Vermont. a great expert on dairy. says. \"If you do it the way GrammRudman calls for. you will have a downward pressure on dairy prices.\" Well. people who voted for that should have understood that is what they were bringing about. And he says if you do it the other way. you will avert the downward pressure on dairy prices. I am not prepared to avert the downward pressure on dairy prices. I do not like this legislation on its merits. I do not care what you are doing for other things.

It was not there. Something else was there. The gentelman from New York. who talked so. so eloquently about housing programs which I have been a supporter of. I cannot understand in my heart at all as to why you want thousands of dairy farmers to join those people that do not have adequate housing. who will be thrown out of their homes. who will be required to go through bankruptcy. and that is what the difference is here. We are not trying to get out from under GrammRudman. we are trying to do it in a way to prevent a large number of people from joining those ranks of those people who have been thrown out of their homes.",

When I went to the Budget Committee hearings with the gentlemen from Washington and Florida. I was appalled to find one of the authors in this House of the GrammRudman legislation handing out a press release saying he was for restoration of the 3.1percent cut for Federal retirees and for NASA and for 7 other programs that made like a roadmap of Florida. If what he did in Tallahassee was the same thing that is happening today here on dairy and tomorrow on other issues. then we can resolve this. gentlemen. There is not an impasse. As the gentleman from Missouri said before. maybe we should all get together and resolve that each committee or each area of jurisdiction can make changes within the confines of GrammRudman. But the basic problem is to the gentleman from Wisconsin and the gentleman from Vermont. we have to do it together. We cannot say. well. we will pass this and we will deal with it tomorrow because there are lots of other people out there. Gentlemen. in my view. and I care about those dairy farmers. I really do. but I would be betraying the constituencies that I care about if I let this cow out of the barn. never to be sure or without working out all of the other problems. GrammRudman. in my opinion. should be repealed no matter who gives milk.

I sent out \"Dear Colleague\" letters to every one of you and was told that the Speaker of the House would not go along with it. that the chairman of the Rules Committee would not go along with it. and some of the leadership on this side would not go along with it.

Where were you on the Walker motion to recommit back when the House Administration Committee instructed the standing committees to cut administratively. but to set priorities?

In my recollection and understanding of the GrammRudman process before we came to a final vote was that it was the gentlemans amendment that caused the 1986 cuts with the $172 billion target set for fiscal year 1986 and we had no choice but to make blind cuts. because we could not get to the $172 billion target for fiscal year 1986.

International terrorism is a scourge all nations must unite against to guarantee a measure of civility in international affairs. Those who attacked the Achille Lauro. whom the PLO admits came from their on ranks. claimed their actions were justified by a political cause. I am sorry. People who kill an innocent aged cripple deserve nothing except their due punishment in a court of law. it is therefore Incomprehensible how Egypt could have negotiated safe conduct for Leon Klinghoffers four murderers. The Egyptian Government asserts it did not know the terrorists had killed Mr. Klinghoffer. This does not excuse Egypts conduct. especially when we .pnsider how the Egyptians gave the Jnited States Government false infornation regarding the status of the terorists whereabouts. President Mubarak of Egypt understands the insidious threat that international terrorism poses to everyone. His very predecessor. Anwar Sadat. was gunned down by Islamic fundamentalist terrorists.

This documentary. \"Hirelings and Accomplices.\" is an excellent example of the virulent antiSemitic propaganda the Soviet Union has been issuing under the guise of antiZionism. The title alone explains a great deal about the level of this propaganda. The Soviet Union has been pursuing policies which seem to be designed to destroy the last remaining remnants of Jewish culture in the U.S.S.R. Emigration to Israel has dropped drastically over the past few years. from a high of 50.000 in 1979 to less than 1.000 last year. The KGB has threatened persons requesting to emigrate and has even placed some in psychiatric hospitals. Over 20.000 Jews have applied to emigrate and have been refused. Some families have been waiting as long as 10 years. Who knows how many wish to emigrate but are afraid to apply? The Soviet Unions most concentrated effort has been against Hebrew teachers in an attempt to eliminate Jewish culture and education. Soviet authorities have arrested Hebrew teachers. sent them to labor camps. and even tortured them. The police and other authorities have planted drugs and weapons on teachers in an effort to discredit them. Many teachers have been fired from their Jobs and. when they cant find work. they are arrested for \"parasitism.\" The United States should condemn this systematic destruction of Jewish culture.

Our real interests should be with our farms. law practices. businesses or whatever we did before being elected to this body. Our Senate work would be best approached as though we were skilled amateurs. What makes this myth so attractive is that It has a grounding in American history. Thomas Jefferson was not only a great President bu also a farmer. Whenever he was in Washington. lie always wanted to return to his native Virginia. That view of Jeffersonthe skilled amateurhas a continuing hold on our imaginations. But is it a realistic view of Jefferson. even during his time. and does it apply to todays worlda far different place. To begin with. politics. a very practical politics. were never far from Mr. Jeffersons mind. He extolled the virtues of agriculture not only because he loved to farm but also because small farmers were an important constituency. During his time. he could best advance his political interests by being away from Washington. But he wrote letter after letter explaining his politics. justifying his position on the issues. Those letters were as effective a political instrument as this country has ever seen. Such an approach would fail today. In Jeffersons time. the Nation had a population about the size of a mediumsized State today. Where Jefferson could speak to one person. todays politician must reach 50. Working with newspapers and televisionthe mediahas allowed us to adjust to this exploding population. Mr. President. one other hurdle stands in the way of a parttime legislatorconflict of interest. In Jeffersons day. society was simple and so was the Government. Even so. many a parttime legislator was up to his neck in scandal. In fact. if we apply todays standards. many of the Founding Fathers were truly founding finaglers. Imagine the potential for scandal today. What lawyer. what businessman. what farmer can do business today without an intimate involvement with the Federal Government?

One of the first things that an elementary school child learns about the U.S. system of government is that all persons are considered innocent of a crime until proven guilty. It is the rock on which our system of justice rests. But Mr. Meese has his own theory of justice. In the interview. Mr. Meese was asked: You criticize the Miranda ruling. which gives suspects the right to a lawyer before police questioning. Shouldnt people. who may be innocent. have such protection? Here is his amazing answer: Suspects who are innocent of a crime should. But the thing is. you dont have many suspects who are innocent of a crime. Thats contradictory. If a person is innocent of a crime. then he is not a suspect. Mr. Meese goes on to say that he opposes the Supreme Courts Miranda decision because it prevents police \"from talking to the person who knows the most about the crimenamely. the perpetrator.\" That is the new \"Meese system of Justice\"-you are guilty until proven innocent. This would be troublesome if it was uttered by any member of the legal profession. It would be offensive if said by any public officeholder. For that mqtter. it would be of concern if stated by any private cltizen. But for the Attorney General of the United States to hold to such a code of criminal justice is irreconcilable with the oath of office for that position. Mr. Meese owes the Nation. the administration. his legal profession. and the American people not only an apology for making such an outrageous statement. but also must give an unqualified assurance that \"innocent until proven guilty\" remains as the hallmark of Justice in this country.

I think the record should be very clear on his reference to the South Fork of the Salmon River. Mr. President. it is true that there were some roads put into the South Fork of the Salmon River and there was a siltation problem. What was not brought out was that the same siltation of the Salmon River took place in the winter of 1905 and silted the river up and it took a few years for the river to clean itself out again so that the Chinook salmon could come back up the river. There were no roads in the area in 1905. but the weather and climatic conditions caused the siltation that went into the river. These points need to be made clearly. We are captives of the Federal Government in those national forest communities. The Federal Government on one hand has programs and policies that have implications on interest rates. on home building. et cetera. On the other hand. we have a Government monopoly that has control of the soft wood timber supplies in the Pacific Northwest and then they make it difficult. by the land laws we have passed. for the private enterprise wood processors to be able to bid for the timber. There are two sides on this. Mr. President. this amendment would be clearly discriminatory and hostile to jobs and to peoples ability to have homes and access to the national forests for all kinds of circumstances.

Nothing shall limit judical review of activities on management units of the National Forest system. provided. however. such challenges are not intended to invalidate in its entirety any existing land and resource management plan developed under authorities other than section 6(c) of the NFMA.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment arises out of a provision in the bill which deals with the status of the management of Forest Service units that have existing plans that have not been restated in the adoption of the new plans required by current law. That language appears on page 50 of the bill. There was some concern that the language used by the committee was less precise than we had believed it to be and there were those who suggested that a change should be made to eliminate any possibility that the language might inadvertantly. or some might have felt intentionally. impinge upon the enforcement of provisions of the Endangered Species Act and a variety of other independent statutes. It was never the intention of the committee to do so. There has been ongoing discussion over the last several days and intensive discussion in the last several hours to try to arrive at an accommodation that more clearly expresses both what was intended and what was not intended with respect to that provision. This amendment which has now been offered encompasses that agreement. I hope that all the parties who are involved are satisfied with what is a genuine attempt to come to an agreement on what the language should say. Senator BAUcus has been particularly helpful. He and his staff have worked very difficult language through the discussion process. Senator EvANs and Senator GORTON have also been very directly involved in those discussions. as have their staffs. There are others also who have been involved. I think this is a good agreement of a potentially contentious issue and I believeand hopefully I state as a factthat it has removed the contention. I urge the adoption of the amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in 1978 I sponsored legislation authorizing the purchase of a historic property in southern Maryland known as Habre de Venture. This was the home of Thomas Stone. who. as one of three Maryland delegates to the second Continental Congress. signed the Declaration of Independence on July 2. 1776. In 1771. Thomas Stone built his plantation near the thriving river town of Port Tobacco. He lived in the house throughout his most politically active years. and on his death in 1787. was buried next to his wife in the family graveyard near the house. Shortly before the legislation authorizing the propertys purchase by the National Park Service was passed. tragedy struck Habre de Venture in the form of a fire early on New Years Day 1977. severely damaging this historic house. Since then. the property. now officially known as the Thomas Stone National Historic Site. has been deteriorating and is now in danger of being lost. I bring this to the attention of the Senate because I feel it would be a grave error if the National Park Service allowed this historic property to decay beyond the possibility of restoration. I hope the Senate will encourage the Park Service to undertake expeditious efforts to restore this property and to open it to the public for educational and cultural purposes.",

But I Just wondered today how many Members of this body or those who might be listening can remember the days when we had to use the kerosene lamp. I wonder how many of you have had the chore of filling up the lamps at night so that you might have illumination during the evening. I recall one of the comments that President Johnson used. to say that that kerosene lamp caused him to have more ambition than almost anything he had to do except milking the cows. And that one of the almost hateful tasks he had was each night he had to somehow get that kerosene 5gallon can and empty it out into the lamps. He said always the kerosene would get on your hands. Usually we had lost the little stopper on it and you would have an Irish potato and that sufficed. You could just slap that old potato on there and that held it pretty good. But I will tell you. when you go to pour it out from that can into the lamps or into small buckets it always spilled over. it got on your hands. your hair. on your clothes. you would smell it all night. You would go inside the house at night and you could not get the wick lit just right. you would either get too much wick or too little wick to too much air or not enough kerosene. The lamp would get colored and sometimes you would have to blow it out and clean it and start all over again. I imagine many a young man took a vow that \"If ever I can get away from the kerosene lamp I will try to make something out of myself.\" I say that kind of facetiously but there is a lot of truth in it.

Do they need this seat? They do not need this seat. My colleague from California [Mr. DoRNANI has pointed out that we are going to have a close vote today. Votes do count. We have seen them decided just in this Congress by one or two votes. so yes. this seat is important. it is important that Rick McIntyre be here. But it goes beyond partisan politics. It goes beyond whether or not the Republicans have one more seat and the Democrats have one less seat. They run the House. They control things. They set the agenda. They tell us when bills are coming up. They have every committee chairmanship in this House. They have every subcommittee chairmanship. They decide if bills come out. We had a special order last year about school prayer. Do they bring that out? Do they let us. the peoples representatives. vote on that? No. they do not bring that out. It is an arrogance of power. and it is the utter disregard for this institution that causes them to act that way. It is just absolutely. absolutely unbelievable.",

This House shall be composed of Members chosen by the people of the States. That was simple in 1787 and it is simple today. Yet in these past 3 months. we have seen this very ferocious effort in this very House to cloud that simple idea of our Founding Fathers. We are called by the Constitution the House of Representatives. We are officially called Representatives. And yet again I have to point out that a substantial number of Members of this House have worked these several months to take away that proud title. I think we all have to question how proud we are.

That is the only reason there is a slight increase in cost for this provision. This is a reconciliation bill. It is really the only time we can do anything in Medicare and Medicaid by way of program improvements. But. we stayed within the budget limits. and that is the important thing. The provision to allow people to go to an optometrist as well as an ophthalmologist was authored by a Republican member of our subcommittee. Mr. WHITTAKER. along with Congresswoman MIKULSKI. who is a Democrat. This whole bill received bipartisan support in the Committee on Energy and Commerce.

Current law would have allowed an increase of more than 5 percent.\" I also read here where it says: \"Responding to recent reports of insufficient emergency treatment of uninsured patients. the committee includes provisions requiring participating hospitals to provide an appropriate medical screening examination for patients with emergency conditions regardless of their insurance status.\" and then it stipulates what the penalties are for a hospital if they do not do this. Parenthetically let me say I do not have any argument with requiring the hospitals to do that. It is an additional expense for them. however. Then I read where it says the bill reduces supplementary payments to teaching hospitals which otherwise would compensate those hospitals for their generally higher costs by revising the calculation formula. So Just very quickly. there are two very substantial hits on hospitals. limiting the increase in payments to hospitals to 1 percent next year rather than the minimum of 5 percent that would have occurred. while asking them to provide these additional emergency services. and reducing the payments to teaching hospitals. All of that is being done to hospitals who are the primary providers of health care in this country. so that we can expand these programs to do these new things that otherwise would not be done.

Now. those are big savings items. What we have in our bill for optometrists is a relatively small amount of money and. without it. people who are covered and eligible for vision care would go without that care because they may not have an ophthalmologist near them in order to provide those services. In Medicaid. we would provide for low income. pregnant women to get prenatal care. We are going to pay far more to take care of their lowbirthweight babies if they do not get prenatal care. The Institute of Medicine indicated it saves $3 for every $1 we propose to spend if we were to end up paying for those lowbirthweight babies. CBO does not give us a cost saving on it. because they only look at the immediate savings.

I am concerned about provisions to increase the black lung benefit coal tax by $680 million. I also believe it is ludicrous to approve over a billion dollars in increased welfare spending in a bill to reduce the deficit. However. there is one provision of this bill which is of particular interest to my district because it Impacts the Tobacco Program. H.R. 3128 would continue the Federal excise tax at 16 cents a pack for 5 years instead of allowing it to end as was originally intended in 1982. One cent of this tax will be earmarked for the Tobacco Program for 5 years. I view this section of the bill with mixed emotions. On the one hand. tobacco producers are facing great difficulties due to a surplus of tobacco which they are financially responsible. Assistance with that financial burden would be helpful. However. this suggestion also offers a troubling precedent which may pave the way for earmarking of this tax for other purposes. Large increases in the Federal excise tax could reduce demand for cigarettes and thus reduce demand for Kentucky burley tobacco. There is a tobacco provision in the reconciliation bill under consideration by the other body which would make changes in the Tobacco Program without resorting to earmarking excise taxes. This plan. originally introduced as S. 1418. has been endorsed by a number of Kentucky agriculture organizations and is the plan I have endorsed as my first choice. Tobacco producers are seeking changes to their program. If I had both plans before me I would choose the plan embodied in the reconciliation bill considered In the other body. However. that is not the situation at hand. I believe the proposal In H.R. 3128 is better than continuing the current program with no changes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman I would like to take this opportunity to call to the attention of the House a situation in my State of Oklahoma which is currently a1ffcting a number of elderly nursing home residents. The problem was brought to my attention after the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committe3s passed their health provisions in this bill. The homes of elderly patients who are permanently committed to nursing homes must be sold to cover their expenses before Medicaid takes over. The Department of Health and Human Services requires that the home be sold within 90 days from the time it becomes apparent that the owner will be in the nursing home permanently. If the home has not been sold in 90 days. patients are forced to leave the nursing home. Because of the poor state of the economy in Oklahoma. 90 days is not always a long enough period in which to sell a home at fair market value. The homes are sold at a loss. and Medicaid is forced to begin paying the patients costs at an earlier date than if the houses were sold at fair market value. Also. there is the possibility of unscrupulous individuals buying the homes from the owners at rock bottom prices and then selling them for a large profit. My fellow Oklahoman. Senator DAVID BOREN. offered an amendment to the Senate reconciliation package. which the Finance Committee accepted. which eased this problem by putting a 1year moratorium on the 90day sales limit. The gentleman from California whose subcommittee has jurisdiction over Medicaid. across with my position and is positively desposed to accept this amendment. Then the problem will be eased over the short term. However. a more permanent solution will have to be worked out. On behalf of the 2.000 Oklahoma nursing home patients who will benefit from this provision. I would like to thank Mr. WAXMAN for his cooperation on this problem.",

What we have done now is this: Only If there is an increase much like the costofliving increase. only if that has happened would they be subject then to any sequestering. The reason it was kind of confusing is that it is a very unique entitlement program. They do not get an automatic CPI unless Congress votes it in each year. So we did not want any misunderstanding that In the sequestration. it could be cut. What we are now saying is if everything that got a CPI is frozen. then it can be sequestered if it got an increase by act of Congress.

I cannot tell what percentage is now available. but it is a lot greater than the 80 percent that was not available before. So I think that from the viewpoint of the Senator from Colorado. in trying to say we want to subject it to a broader base of defense. so that it would not fall as heavily on readiness and items such as manpower and training and spare parts. this certainly goes in that direction. and I think it helps accomplish that.",

The result is that \"trends in environmental indices appear to respond to trends in sulfur emission on a regional basis.\" In short. longrange transport is not \"necessarily unimportant\" (indeed. interregional transport near the boundaries of the regions \"will be important\"). but the regional aspects (i.e.. local regional sources) are more important. There are no provisions in H.R. 4567 aimed at recognizing these trends. Issue: H.R. 4567 will cause Job LossesIn both phases of the bill. the emission rates will require a mixture of switching from high sulfur coal to low sulfur coal or scrubbers. The choice will be primarily in the hands of the Governors. Coal State Governors may choose scrubbers over switching. But noncoal State Governors may not. To the extent coal switching occurs. the bill will undoubtedly trigger early termination of existing longterm 2030 years coal contracts. using \"force majeure\" clauses which are disruptive and result in job loss. Many such contracts expire nationally late in the next decade or later. The United Mine Workers say that H.R. 4567 will result in displacement of about 130 million tons of annual coal production with the loss of 38.000 direct coal mining jobs. That loss will be on top of job losses already occurring in this industry. It will be harmful economically to communities and will have a ripple effect on small business. Because of the historical nature of coal mining. miners will not move from the East to the West or even to low sulfur mines in the same State (which. in the case of West Virginia and Kentucky. are already in trouble due to job losses). Also. coal switching could result in increased coal exports from foreign countries. such as Columbia and South Africa which now supply coal to U.S. That means exporting jobs.

The bill contains several measures urgently needed to correct abuses identified in 5 days of public hearings and during a 11/2 year investigation by the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. The legislation will protect consumers from the obvious health and safety threats posed by substandard. impotent. adulterated. and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Manufacturers will benefit from provisions that will eliminate a serious source of fraud and lost sales currently resulting from the reimportation of brand name drugs. And wholesalers and retailers can compete in a marketplace free from unfair competition in the form of below wholesale priced drugs diverted from health care institutions or charities. The only people who will oppose this bill are the fast buck artists and shady dealers who now profit enormously from these various nefarious practices. In the last 2 years. the pharmaceutical industry has been stunned by revelations of corrupt practices and counterfeiting. A joint StateFederal investigation in Atlanta.

My bill would restrict all Federal employees from lobbying the Federal Government for 1 year after they leave Government service. and 2 years if they work for a foreign entity. Further.

Jeremiah Ball. persuaded the Michigan Huron Institute to settle in Kalamazoo as well.

Mr. Speaker. the members of the First Baptist Church of Kalamazoo take understandable pride in its historical commitment to an ecumenical spirit and to its involvement in social issues confronting the wider community. The sesquicentennial celebration commemorates the churchs founding. It is a very special event. reflective of the churchs sense of its own history and its confidence in its future.

This measure is intended to encourage a United States led. focused effort by all nations to understand and document the existing state of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. and the potential for future changes. in order to develop strategies so that we may ameliorate their detrimental effects. Man is presently conducting an unintended. global experiment which may affect our own as well as many future generations. Human activities. such as the burning of fossil fuels. deforestation. and industrialization. are releasing gases into the atmosphere and oceans which are likely to cause global temperatures to rise steadily from now into the distant future. A recent meeting of international scientists observed that an \"appreciable\" greenhouse warming may have already occurred and that the rate of warming may \"accelerate in the future.\" Among the gases of concern are: carbon dioxide. methane. and chlorofluorocarbons. Some of these gases are increasing at rates ranging up to 7 percent per year. some of them have lifetimes of hundreds of years. and all of them can contribute to global warming. The problem of increasing greenhouse gases and their expected effect on global temperatures is directly related to many other major environmental issues such as climate change. acid rain. ozone depletion. deforestation. and the melting of glacial ice. The potential impact of this global warming will directly affect almost all aspects of our national economy. ranging from the effects of changes in rainfall patterns on agricultural productivity to the consequences of sea level rise on our coastlines.

Four and a half years into a 5year program. less than 10 percent of the Nations priority sites have received Federal cleanup funds. Estimates of the Federal Governments share of the total cleanup costs that still lie ahead of us range from $23 to $39 billion. Last year. the House passed by a vote of 323 to 33 Superfund reauthorization legislation which established a $10.1 billion funding level for a second 5year installment of the program. The need to increase the size of the program has led some to advocate a broader source of revenue for the cleanup effort. Currently. the Superfund is supported by a tax on 43 basic feedstock chemicals. Including crude oil. The chemical Industry has argued that it should not be forced to continue to bear the primary burden of supporting Superfund both because the higher taxes needed to support an expanded fund will have a detrimental economic impact on the industry and because other Industries also generate the wastes found at Superfund sites and therefore should share the tax burden. The chemical Industry has advocated adoption of a broadbased corporate tax as the primary source of future Superfund revenues. While the chemical industrys argument that other wastegenerating industries should help to support cleanup has considerable merit. others have noted that. depending on how a broadbased tax is structured. such an approach could shift the tax burden to the general taxpayer rather than to other industries. The following editorial from the Washington Post reflects such concerns and I would urge my colleagues to keep such issues in mind as we renew our consideration of potential Superfund revenue sources.

I think it is a fair settlement to the Federal Treasury and that it gives to the Federal Government somewhere between $4.3 billion and $4.48 billion to help reduce the deficit to the Federal Government. with the States getting 27 percent. The States originally fought for 50 percent. so a 27percent settlement. I think. is fair. it is certainly equitable. It is substantially less than what interior States already get from Federal lands and I cannot believe that anyone would think that coastal States should somehow be treated less fairly than the interior States of the United States. I think this is a good settlement and we should not open it up. The rule is a good rule and I strongly support it.",

I think. ironically a vehicle for avoiding Jurisdictional rules of the House involving not only the committee upon which I serve. the Ways and Means Committee. but other committees of the House. This is the first time that I have ever been opposed to a rule from the Rules Committee. but I think this is the most irresponsible request for a rule thpt has been my experience to see since I have been in the House of Representatives for 21 years. For example. parts of H.R. 3500 clearly are within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee. Yet when our committee asked the Committee on Rules to make it in order under the rule. either as an amendment to strike the language in question. or substitute preferred language. we were turned down. That. of course. is the prerogative of the Rules Committee. But I submit to you. Mr. Speaker. that it was not a decision in keeping with the spirit of the rules of this House. It particularly runs counter to the rights of other legislative committees as well as our own to have some control over their own Jurisdictional areas. I want to emphasize that my objections in this matter are more procedural than substantive. In cases where committees have inserted revenue items or other items not within their jurisdiction. arguments on merits should be conducted on another plane. Each of these items. Mr. Speaker. are very important. But if this rule were to pass. I think many committees in this House could say goodbye to their jurisdiction in the very near future.

Congress said that the Federal Government should share with the States in a fair and equitable manner all revenues derived from the socalled 8(g) zone. The States thought fair and equitable was 50 percent. because this is what the Federal Government shares on its onshore property with the States as well as all its mineral leases. This money. billions of dollars. has been held in escrow since 1978. This year. as part of this budget reconciliation. Congress agreed with the States. and the States agreed to accept 27 percent. The gentleman from Arizona said that the States will receive some $6 billion over future years. In order to reach this number. one has to project out 30 years. and one has to assume that production is 20 times greater than what it is today in this offshore zone.

You have also found that the Appropriations Committee is going to lose jurisdiction over spending out of the trust fund. so that there will be a direct dip out of certain of our Federal trust funds under the jurisdiction of only one committee. My problem with this rule is it sets a precedent which allows every committee of the House to sweep out its broom closet of pet projects which it cannot pass in the normal run of legislative affairs. And it will then attach them to the reconciliation bill which those committees know must ultimately pass. The Rules Committee is meant to be the guardian of these Jurisdictional disputes. It has failed its responsibility in that regard. The Ways and Means Committe has a series of objections. The most important one is that the Rules Committee has invaded our Jurisdiction and given a pension matter exclusively to the Education and Labor Committee. This matter of law that the Ways and Means Committee has shared since 1974 is ERISA. At that time. we passed a complicated law knowing we would lose thousands and thousands of pension systems. but at least we knew what was going to happen. Now we have a complicated new law presented by the Education and Labor Committee attached to the reconciliation bill. not germane. in my judgment. to reconciliation at all. which will probably cost many more pension programs. They will go out of business or they will never start in the first place. Education and Labor is justly interested in protecting the PBGC. and so it has given us some amendments which help large. wellfunded pension funds and the employees of those funds. It. however. causes a heavy reliance on other private pension sources because we are certain to lose new companies and shaky employers from the pension system. and thereby place heavier pressure on Social Security.

This legislation contains provisions designed to shore up the financial status of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGCJ. the Federal agency which was established in 1974 under title IV of ERISA to ensure workers pensions. Since May 1982. the administration has been asking Congress to take action to restore the PBGC plan termination insurance program to solvency. First. the premium paid by plans to finance the insurance program needs to be raised. Second. the singleemployer pension plan termination insurance program itself needs to be reformed to close certain loopholes in the law. It is the committees conviction that the premium and the reforms are inextricably linked and that each is needed to put the PBGC on a sound financial footing. This year the Committee on Education and Labor was directed in the budget resolution to raise substantial revenues by enacting an increase in the premium paid to PBGC. When the committee marked up our portion of the reconciliation bill. we unanimously reported both the premium increase and the programmatic reforms necessary to meet our reconciliation targets. Those same provisions had been unanimously reported by our committee only 10 days before as separate legislation.

I believe the Rules Com mittee has struck the right balance By providing for a comprehensive amendment by the gentleman from Ohio the rule does pro. vide an opportunity to vote on many of the programs which have been characterized as spending addons. At the same time. the rule does recognize the value of preserving the actions taken by the committees. Mr. Speaker. I am a believer in the committee process. I believe the actions taken by committees. after consideration. after Members have had a full opportunity to vote. should be respected. We should not lightly cast aside those decisions.

In particular. I support the actions taken by the committee of which I am the ranking member. the Interior Committee. I believe the committee met its budget reconciliation instruction in the only manner which could have resolved the OCS dispute. If we are going to impose a settlement on the States. we owe it to them to apply a formula which is fair and consistent. It seems fair and logical to divide revenues with 73 percent going to the Federal Government and 27 percent to the States for all revenues in the 8(g) zone. Since the language of 8(g) applies to \"revenues\" in that zone. it is not logical to apply the 27 percent to bonuses and rents. but not royalties. It is worth remembering that the States had requested 50 percent of revenues and did ask to have this issue withdrawn from the courts to be made a part of the congressional budget process. We need to settle these suits with the States in a way that addresses at least some of their concerns. A bipartisan majority of the Interior Committee refused to exclude royalties from the settlements. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support the rule reported by the committee.

Yet In the past year. this record has been extended an additional 2 million work hours. This superb safety record began on October 4. 1982nearly 1.000 days ago. Twice during the 2% years since that date. Shell workers have worked over I million consecutive hours without a recordable injury. Overall. the frequency rate for recordable injuries is now the equivalent of one for each 385.000 hours of work. By contrast. the comparable rate for all of manufacturing is more than 6 accidents for each 200.000 hours worked. That is why today the Shell complex in Martinez is recognized as the safest refining complex in the Nation. And that is also why the Shell complex has received awards recently from the National Petroleum Refiners Association. the National Safety Council. and the Chemical Manufacturers Association which honor this exemplary record. The safety achievement of the workers and management at the Shell complex deserves the highest praise. I commend the Martinez complex and its employees for this outstanding effort.*",

I guess we could sell off the national parks if somebody wants to do that or we could sell off the Russell Building or we could sell off the White House or we could sell off something else. but the reality is we are digging ourselves deeper and deeper into debt. The interest on the public debt is growing greater. The situation is getting worse and we are ignoring the problem. We are just basically ignoring it. That is what we are doing. That would be bad enough. but to that we have added in this reconciliation bill. which I really think was a charade when it left the Senate. a huge increase in the national debt. which makes it even worse. In fact. that is the predominant feature of this legislation. It is called a reconciliation bill but the predominant feature in terms of its actual impact and substance and content as it comes before us tonight is not reconciliation. or spending cuts. or assets sales or whatever they are. it has just increased the national debt by. oh. I guess $189 billion. Now. Mr. President. I am not going to vote to do that. I am going to vote against it.

No. 1. we never had GrammRudmanHollings either. and as we move through the remainder of the year it gets exceedingly more difficult to add new appropriated account money. We can do it but it gets pretty tough. because we are already up against the ceiling. We are getting better at estimating the program expenditures than we have been in the early part of this budget process. It looks like the economy is stabilizing a little bit as compared to the first part of the year. But I am willing to say it will not be $149 or $151 billion come the end of September of next year. but do not forget it is $230 billion this year. If it ends up at $170 billion. which I think the Senator speculated may be at the low end of his assessment. if that is it. it will be the largest reduction in the deficit in 1 year in real terms or nominal terms in the history of the Republic. Not low enough certainly because we are still plenty high. but that will be quite an achievement. from $230 billion this year to $170 billion. I think that is about right. Now. frankly. I say to my friend. he can vote against this because it has debt limit extensions in it. he can vote against it because it is not enough reconciliation.

To suggest. either in so many words or by implication. that I was urging all of this come out of the appropriated accounts is completely off the mark. I think we have done a pretty good job on the appropriated accounts. which as the Senator pointed out correctly is the smallest end of the budget. Threequarters of all the Federal spending. of course. is in nonappropriated accounts. So for my part I am ready to take on the entitlement programs any way. any time.

I hope everybody that has listened to either how well we have done or how poorly we have done will understand that we still have for 1987 a deficit. somewhere between $151 billion and $175 billion. and that results. even though defense spending is growing at seventenths of 1 percent negative. not even inflation. Appropriated accounts are growing at negative 5.4. well below inflation. Entitlements are only growing at fivetenths of 1 percent negative. less than inflation. So I ask the question: How are you going to balance the budget? How are you going to balance the budget? You still have that much deficit and this year you have effectively done more than ever on the those accounts. and there are many who say defense needs more. not less. There are many who say entitlements cannot be cut. and I believe the discretionary accounts have been cut as much as you could and you have to pay your debts to arrest interest. It floats up and down with interest. But it is going to be $2.3 trillion come May 15 of next year. You are going to pay interest on that much debt.

A few years ago. the National Commission on Excellence in Education released a dramatic report on the state of American education. The commissions thoughtful report cited few successes and numerous problems. and offered a variety of recommendations to improve educational performance. The commissions overriding conclusion was stated loudly and clearly: The goal of achieving excellence in education cannot be reached without the active participation of teachers and the educational communityatlarge. Rather than blaming teachers for the state of our educational system. we should look to them as an invaluable resource in our effort to correct its deficiencies. And we must recommit ourselves to providing the support. the training. the compensation. and the resources teachers require to do their job. Mr. Speaker. it is not surprising that the commission recognized the vital role that teachers will play in addressing the future challenges that confront American education. It is the classroom teacher who is challenged daily to reach out to enormously diverse student populationscomprised of diverse backgrounds and abilitiesto provide the assistance and guidance necessary for full intellectual development. It is the classroom teacher who immeasurably influences the lives of every student. and therefore plays a major role in determining the future quality of life in America. Indeed. it is the classroom teacher that provides the foundation upon which our democratic institutions rest. Mr. Speaker. Im not much for bumpersticker philosophy. but Im reminded of one sticker you see quite often that says: \"if you can read this. thank your teacher.\" It wouldnt fit on a bumper. but the sign could just as properly say: \"If you have a sense of citizenship and participation in our Nations future. thank your teacher.\" Mr. Speaker.

Thanks to the heightened attention being given to Embassy security by the Department of State and sound security procedures at the Embassy in Lisbon. the terrorist plot was foiled with no loss of lives nor damage to the Embassy. More security. not less. is what is needed for our facilities around the world. According to information provided by the Department of State. the head of the Marine detachment assigned to protect the Embassy was returning to the building at 7 p.m. In accordance with the strict security procedures in effect at the facility. he stopped his vehicle after entering a screening zone at the main gate leading into the Embassy compound. In checking the inside of the hatchback vehicle. a Portuguese national security guard. who is employed by the Embassy. noticed a strange case which the marine driver was unable to identify. In carefully checking the container which apparently had been placed in the vehicle by terrorists. the marine and local guard noticed wires and other suspicious items. In accordance with existing security procedures. the area around the vehicle was quickly cleared of all personnel. A few minutes later. the car exploded. The force of the explosion totally destroyed the vehicle. but. thanks to good procedures and alertness on the part of the concerned guard and marine. nobody was hurt. The Embassy was not damaged. The Embassy in Portugal was built a few years ago and incorporates relatively modern security systems and design. The modern vehicle screening area at the main gate of the compound has a vehicle arrest system and the Embassy is set far back from the main road. With the increase in terrorism in recent years. good security features of this kind are being built into new structures. Embassy personnel are more conscious of the importance of good security and regional security officers",

During the war in Vietnam. his caustic criticism of United States involvement there stung many in our country. Who is this man who presumes to lecture us? We learned later from his work on the Palme Commission that peace was his passion and disarmament his means. The rift between north and south. east and west. was his constant concern. His latest project. the fivecontinent peace initiative. is a bold effort of six nationsSweden. Mexico. Tanzania. Argentina. Greece. and Indiato stop nuclear weaponstesting and to prevent the heavens from joining the nuclear arms race. He made Sweden a force for peace. Millions on this planet share his view of the future and grieve this champion of reason.

The Reagan administration continues to cry wolf when it comes to our Nations trade status. The administration continues to claim that good and prosperous times are indeed just around the corner and that there is light at the end of the tunnel. but these continued dismal trade statistics seem to indicate the contrary. and indeed. the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of international trade is a freight train headed squarely toward the jobs of Americans all across this Nation.",

Flush with victory from its stand in the Philippines. the administration is now going to make the argument that. if we must aid democracy when authoritarians of the right are in charge. then we must also aid democracy when authoritarians of the left are in charge. But there are three questions that this administration has never fully answered. questions which must be answered before we vote a single nickel of military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. First. who are we aiding? The Contras. as our own studies have shown. have an uncomfortably high percentage not of democrats in their ranks but of former Fascists from the Somoza regime. These are not people we want to put into power. Second. when should we use armed force? We certainly did not in the Philippines. The will of democracy came from the bottom up. from the people. and that is what toppled Marcos. not a ragtag army funded by U.S. aid. covert or overt. Third. even if the first two questions could be adequately answered. for what end are we doing this? Can we win? For the last 3 years the administration has told us we are near victory. Yet current reports show more than 60 percent of the Contras are ensconced in Honduras. not waging war at all.

I say that as a former district attorney. having some experience in this area. it looks like up until this point we are throwing money in every direction without any concrete plan of effectiveness. What this does here is. and I understand in other legislation. call on the President to come up with a plan. Here I also call on the President with the help of those folks who are interested in this in Congress and those folks in law enforcement. that they get together with a concrete plan so that they are working in the same way. Otherwise there are so many gaps in what we have done up to now. we will not have the effectiveness that we should. Also.

The drug initiative which you have heard discussed here. may I say again. the primary difference is it calls attention to the $1.200.000.000 that we have available in the 13 regular bills in addition to whatever else we make available in title II of House Joint Resolution 738. Not only that. but we make it possible for the President to call up a plan. We say. in effect. talk to the Congressmen working with this. the agencies handling parts of this. law enforcement agencies. too. because when we get through spending these billions of dollars. we hope to have handled the problem.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2005. to reauthorize the Superfund toxic waste cleanup program for 5 years. As you know. the Superfund program was established in 1980 to address the growing problem of abandoned hazardous waste sites. Since that time. it has become clear that the problem of abandoned toxic dumpsites is much larger than anyone had first imagined. In fact. the Office of Technology Assessment estimates that there may be as many as 10.000 toxic hot spots scattered across the country. And the cost to clean up these sites could be as high as $100 billion. This legislation we have before us today is a step in the right direction in tackling the problem of cleaning up these many hazardous dumpsites. Although there are many fine provisions in the bill which I could highlight. I am particularly pleased with the community right to know program. This important provision insures that communities who happen to be located near chemical plants and hazardous facilities will be provided needed information on the types of chemicals produced. handled and stored at these facilities and information on how to deal with emergencies. Thus. in the future. chemical companies must provide communities with information about everyday releases of toxic chemicals and about the location and use of such chemicals. It also requires emergency notification and response planning in the event of a serious release in the environment. In conclusion. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask that the President reconsider his veto threat of the bill so we can get on with the business of cleaning up the thousands of toxic wastesites across the United States.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing legislation to extend until December 31. 1990. the seasonal suspension of the tariff on fresh cantaloupes imported from Mexico. This suspension applies to the period between Janauary 1 and May 15. when the United States has no production of fresh cantaloupes. I first helped pass this legislation in 1982. and it has worked well since then. It has given U.S. consumers an offseason source of fresh cantaloupes and has allowed distributors to make more efficient use of marketing facilities. It has helped border communities that derive significant income from cantaloupe trade activities. It has not hurt U.S. growers. and may in fact boost demand for cantaloupes by assuring a continuous and reasonablypriced supply. Cantaloupes are produced extensively throughout the United States during the summer months. but this output virtually ceases by the last week in December. Market shipments are not resumed until midMay when volume production again commences in Texas and California. During the period between January 1 and May 15. supplies consist almost entirely of imports from Mexico. Accordingly. it is clear that the imports during the January 1 to May 15 period covered by the bill cause no harm to any domestic producing interest. Suspension of the 35percent tariff during this period will result in lower prices to consumers and greater demand for cantaloupes. Mr. President.

But. due to the intense lobbying efforts of a number of trial lawyers associations in their attempt to preserve the current contingency fee system. it has been increasingly difficult for individual States to pass the sought after reforms.

Such preferential treatment of specialinterest projects which do not rank high enough on the State priority list to receive funding through normal grant allocations is inequitable and contrary to the method of fairly distributing Clean Water Act project money by formula. That is the main reason for the opposition here.

Mrs. CATHY LONG. for introducing H.R. 5218. which will allow National Guard technicians who must involuntarily leave their jobs. for reasons other than performance. to transfer into the competitive civil service system. National Guard technicians are not only civil servants. but they also must be members of the National Guard as a condition of employment and are expected to mobilize with their units in time of war. Because of this dual status of military and civil service. they are not part of the vast majority of civil servants who are in the competitive service. They are in a special class known as excepted service. They are also subject to involuntary separation from their jobs if they are unable to meet certain military requirements. such as remaining physically fit and below a certain weight. maintaining flight status. and holding a drivers license. If a technican is separated from the National Guard and wants to work for the Federal Government. he or she must apply to the Office of Personnel Management. After he is certified by OPM and placed on a register he must compete not only against other Federal employees. but against other applicants from outside the civil service. Federal employees in the competitive service only compete against each other. The result is that it is very difficult for former National Guard technicians to continue to work for the Federal Government. It is important to note that employees removed from their jobs because of insubordination and poor performance will not be affected by this legislation. Only those \"excepted service\" employees who must leave their jobs for nonworkrelated reasons will be affected. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5218 has been amended by the Civil Service Subcommittee to make It acceptable to OPM and the National Guard Bureau. It is sound managment to retain employees who are proven performers. One beneficiary would be the National Guard itself. which could bring to Washington qualified technicians who have worked throughout the country and who would normally be forced to leave Government employment. Their knowledge of the Guard and their experience in the field makes them valuable assets. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

This legislation does affect a number of individuals and with the concurrence of my distinguished minority leader. I would like to pay special tribute to the major sponsor of the bill who was absolutely patient. but very forceful in encouraging all of us to not only have a hearing where he brought down many of his own constituents. these very dedicated women. to testify. but also very. very helpful in seeing this day. getting this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker. out of respect for his hard work. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kansas for an explanation of the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I support passage of the bill. but I believe it is important that we recognize a distinction between the cadet nurses and a number of other groups who are seeking civil service retirement credit for various types of nonFederal service. These cadet nurses were part of the war effort during World War II. and were one of a number of groups that. while not strictly Federal employees. were essentially working as a part of the Government during the national mobilization at that time. Based on available information. it appears some 500 current Federal employees would be eligible to receive civil service credit for approximately 3 years of service during World War II. They would be required to make a deposit to the civil service retirement and disability fund of an amount equal to what would have been withheld from salary if the service originally had been creditable. Over the years a number of groups have been granted civil service retirement credit. This bill would simply provide equitable treatment for the former cadet nurses. This is quite different from providing civil service retirement credit for ongoing groups of individuals for service which is clearly and unarguably nonFederal. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

Mr. MYERS of Indiana. who is also very responsible for this bill. We have several bills. We have done such a vast number of bills. but there is the retirement bill. which I do not think there could have been a bigger issue for our committee to work on over the last 3 or 4 years. and we do have a couple of bills that passed expeditiously out of the House. The direct access bill that would allow health providers to be reimbursed. a variety of them. and the pay study bill which means so much to women who serve in the Federal Government. and minorities. along with the men who are part of their families. So I am hoping the Senate will see to it that these two bills are acted on. They still have time to do it. It would be an absolute tragedy if they just languished over there and they sat on these bills as they have in the past. I am hoping they will have enough good sense to do that.

I may be in a position different from most of my colleagues who are Members of this House of Representatives. having been one who lived and reared a family at least for awhile in the public housing developments in Chicago. and having been one who represented people as a leader of a labor union where contracts and conditions under which they work are so awfully important. I must say that there is one thing about these amendments that sort of leads to the tenor of discussion as I hear it that distrubs me a little bit. Tenant management. while it is a new approach. is by no means a cureall for the problems as they exist today in the whole area of public housing. I happen to represent a district that has some 70.000 residents who live in public housing. Unemployment among them ranks somewhere in the area of at least 40 percent. and it is greater than that among the youth who live there. Many of the people who are residents are single parents and exist as people on public assistance. I do not want us as representatives of the Federal Government or Members of this House to draw any public conclusions. any conclusions at all. which even indicate that the responsibility of the Federal Government to help in the maintenance of these housing developments is any less than it has been in the past. As a matter of fact. we need more help from the Federal Government. I have more vacant apartments in some of the housing developments in my area.

We have heard discussed several of the controversial issues within this proposal. and I now have at the desk an amendment which. I believe. will put the Nehemiah program under an economically viable targeting formula. My amendment is very simple. What it would do is lower the income ceiling for eligibility for the Nehemiah Homeownership program from 115 percent of median income to 90 percent for all except those of median income. The effect of this change would be to target the Nehemiah program to those families that we should really be trying to help with our scarce housing resources: The lower to lower middle income families. Now. at the start. I want to be very clear about this one thing. By authorizing Nehemiah for \"such sums as may be necessary\" and leaving the funding decisions to the Appropriations Committee. we are insuring that the money to fund Nehemiah will come out of other housing programs. In other words. dont think that you are getting something for nothing here. During committee markup of the original H.R. 1. the number that was discussed for Nehemiah was $150 million. You know. and I know. that when the Appropriations Committee starts working on housing legislation. that $150 million is going to have to come out of lowincome housing programs. vouchers. section 8. Mr. Chairman. it just does not make sense to create a new housing program that is going to subsidize homeownership for middleincome familiesfamilies that can afford to own their own homes without any Federal subsidy. Let me run through a few statistics here that are quite revealing. As currently drafted. the Nehemiah eligibility ceiling of 115 percent of median income or national median income. whichever is higher. would permit families in Boston earning almost $40.000 per year to receive a $15.000 Federal subsidy. Can you imagine? Subsidizing a family whose income is $40.000 per year? On top of this. the State of Massachusetts already offers belowmarket interest rate mortgages to firsttime homebuyers. There are similar State- or cityrun programs in Connecticut. the District of Columbia. Baltimore. and Cleveland. The list goes on and on. Another interesting dilemma. A HUD field economist from Baltimore estimated that the 115percent median income ceiling covers 60 percent of Baltimores population. How are we to",

Therefore. while it was true that if you read the letter of the law and would find amounts of a certain few individuals could have actually incomes at quite a high level. it seemed to me it was worth doing to bring a few of those people into the projects. But the gentlewoman from New Jersey has pointed out that that number could actually cause Nehemiah to lose support in many various places. and therefore reluctantly I will go along with her amendment. I do not think it damages the program. The program will go forward. It will mean that certain people in certain cities who were slightly above the median income will not be available to Nehemiah. and they will have to find housing elsewhere. But Nehemiah. while they might have been the icing on the cake in a Nehemiah type project. it might have been the local drug store owner or the local school teacher who. I feel. would be quite important to live in that project. the viability of the project. since the project will start out in an experiment mode. let us go with this as the gentlewoman from New Jersey has suggested. and if it does not work. we can always come back later and change it.

The Florida lands would then be sold to the South Florida Water Management District. with the proceeds to be used for land acquisition in U.S. wildlife refuges in Florida. This land exchange would appear to be good for all concerned. Aerojet would gain land it needs to proceed with rocket development for our Nations defense. the Department of the Interior will obtain revenue for the purchase of lands necessary for the preservation of endangered wildlife. and the State of Florida will become owner of property immediately east of Everglades National Park which could otherwise have been subject to development.

In fact. it is no exaggeration to state that no one has done more for this cause than have George and Gladys Brooks of New Windsor. NY. George and Gladys became involved in the cause of our POW/MIAs during the early 1970s. in fact. while the Vietnamese conflict was still in progress. They kept the issue alive before the Nixon administration. and at that time cofounded the National League of Families. It was through their efforts that the majority of American prisoners were freed in Janaury 1973. Throughout the Ford and Carter administrations. the Brooks continued their commitment. traveling to and from Washington at their own expense to remind our Nation of the need for a full accounting. They even travelled to Southeast Asia to follow any and every lead. Those were frustrating times for all of us involved with this issue. but the hopes and determination of George and Gladys Brooks have kept their faith alive in all our hearts. Although George and Gladys own son. Nicholas. was missing in action in 1970 in Southeast Asia. it was not his capture that initially prompted their involvement in this issue. A full year prior to the disappearance of his own son. the Brooks became involved in the quest for Joseph Mobley. a friend and classmate of their son. As it turned out. Joe Mobley came marching home. but for 12 long years the Brooks did not know the fate of their own son. Nick. who was shot down over Laos. It was March 1982 when the long wait ended for George and Gladys Brooks. The remains of their son were finally returned to them. But their commitment did not end. George remained as chairman of the board of the National League of Families. and they both continued to devote themselves to the cause of our POWs and MIAs since. In great part. the calm. reasoned yet determined leadership of the Brooks have led our current administration to give top priority to a full accounting of our missing American heroes.",

Four members of a fire fighting crew from the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico were killed August 24 when a National Guard truck carrying the exhausted crew back to base camp went off the road and overturned. Two other members of the crew suffered major injuries. and seven were moderately injured with fractures. The Indian crew had been fighting an 18.000acre fire in the Boise National Forest. The newspaper USA Today said of the four that they \"died upholding the long tradition of Native Americans serving as the elite of the USAs wildfire fighters.\" The 2.000population Jemez Pueblo was in mourning August 25 and outsiders were barred from entering. Fire fighter Al Waque commented. \"If one family grieves. we all grieve because were all related to each other. We are all brothers and sisters.\" More than 2.000 of the 16.000 fire fighters battling blazes in six northern western states in August are Indians.

They seem to have a better level of endurance.\" He added. \"They are a lot more tied to the earth.

I am pleased once again to introduce a resolution that designates the week of October 12 as \"Myastenia Gravis Week.\" This resolution is for the recognition of a most serious health threat that as yet has not been conquered. Many of the Members of this most honored body supported this resolution last year and I would urge them to do so again. Myastenia Gravis. also known as ErbGoldtam disease. is a neuromuscular disease which has affected up to 300.000 Americans of both sexes. all ages and all races. MG affects neither the muscle nor the nerve. but the synapsethe gap between the nerve and the muscle which conducts the electrical current from the nerve to the muscle. Myastenia Gravis can strike any area of the body at any time. Because Mr. Speaker. it is such an unpredictable disease. it is often misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue. which allows the disease to progress until the victim is in severe danger. Until recently. MG has been fatal for 85 percent of its victims. There is still no prevention or cure. but significant progress has been made. The establishment of Myastenia Gravis Week. from October 12 to 18. will call attention to the serious problems MG victims face each day. This increased awareness will not only make potential victims more sensitive to the symptoms and the dangers of this serious disease but will also lead to increased research in the quest for a cure. The successes that we have been experiencing in solving the problems attendant with other such diseases should give us all heart that resolutions such as this. do make a difference in the fight against these diseases. I hope that all of my colleagues will join me in approving this resolution.",

I would like take a moment to commend all of them for their unwavering commitment to this most worthy cause. These and thousands of other senior citizens are sending a clear message to Congress that the present inequity in Social Security benefits will not be tolerated. The \"Notch Babies\" continue to have my full support on this issue. Because of the notch provision. workers born between 1917 and 1921 receive significantly lower benefits than those born before those years. In some cases. the differences in benefits can add up to more than $1.000 a year. For American retirees on fixed incomes. this situation is flatly unfair. That is why I have consistently supported legislation which would correct this injustice. The notch provision is a result of changes made in 1977 to the Social Security benefit formula. The 1972 benefit formula overcompensated for inflation. However. the 1977 amendments underestimated inflation and ignored the postage 61 earnings of the \"Notch Babies.\" Those affected by the notch provision have been unfairly penalized as a result of the 1977 amendments. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of H.R. 1917. which would eliminate the notch problem and insure that all our senior citizens will be fairly compensated for their lifetime contribution to our great Nation. I realize how important these benefits are to millions of Americans. Our senior citizens deserve our utmost respect and support. They are calling on all of us here in Congress to take action to correct this unfair situation. Lets join together to repeal the Social Security notch provision.",

Brookville. with a population of 4.500. impressed the selection committee for a number of reasons. It has a nationally recognized Main Street project which generated $3 million in private investment and created 30 new jobs. It successfully completed a $1.19 million drive to build a new hospital. It raised over $600.000 of private money to refurbish the local YMCA. making Brookville the smallest community in the Nation with a full service YMCA. Chamber officials said they were impressed with Brookvilles ability to use small amounts of public capital and larger amounts of private investment to \"stimulate new projects and revitalize the downtown. preparing their community for the future.\" according to an editorial in the DuBois CourierExpress.

Due to a variety of factors. not the least of which is congressional opposition. the Reagan defense modernization program has become a mere shadow of its former self. The evidence for this claim is conveniently assembled and convincingly presented in the following article by David Trachtenberg of the Committee on the Present Danger. As Mr. Trachtenberg demonstrates. the Strategic Modernization Program has been virtually checkmated by continued Soviet strategic modernization. while the Soviet/Warsaw Pact conventional forces continue to expand at an alarming rate. In response to this grim prognosis. the Congress returned the defense budget to a negative growth rate for 1986 and appears poised to compound the error in 1987.

Senator MCCONNELL and I had intended to offer an amendment to the tax bill dealing with a problem unique to Kentucky under the uniform capitalization rules in the Finance Committee bill. We have decided that this issue Is better left to be worked out in conference. and so will not offer the amendment to this bill. The bill provides that all indirect costsincluding interestincurred in the production of real or tangible personal property must be capitalized. While I support this concept generally. it has come to my attention that this provision could have a significant negative impact on utility rates in Kentucky. The Kentucky Public Service Commission allows regulated public utilities under its Jurisdiction to include in the rate base property under construction. This allows utilities to earn revenues currently on this property and to currently expense the production costs of that project. Kentucky is the only State which includes 100 percent of these production costs in the rate base. Over time. this procedure has resulted in significantly lower rates for Kentucky utility customers. The Finance Committee bill would require this expense to be capitalized. This could result in a mismatch of expenses and related income for the utilities in my State. I am deeply concerned that the practical effect of this provision may lead to higher rates for utility customers in Kentucky. Our amendment would have avoided this result by permitting the deduction in those cases in which the Kentucky PSC has included property under construction in the rate base. I have discussed this issue with the distinguished ranking minority member of the Finance Committee. Senator LONG. and he has agreed to raise it in conference.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to bring to the attention of my distinguished colleagues a provision in the current bill which I believe is unfair. The bill eliminates cash or deferred arrangements for State and local government employees. These arrangements. also known as 401(k) plans. allow employees to defer receipt of cash compensation and have this amount contributed to a qualified plan. Under a 401(k) plan an employee is not taxed on the contribution until it is actually distributed from the plan. The current bill would eliminate 401(k) benefits for State and local government employees but retain them for the private sector and nonprofit organizations. The recently enacted Federal Employee Retirement System Act of 1986 provides Federal employees with benefits similar to those of 401(k). Therefore. if this bill is enacted. every employee in this country will be able to benefit from section 401(k) except for those employed by State and local governments. There is no logical explanation for the exclusion of State and local government employees from 401(k) benefits. It is unjust to discriminate against this one group. If we decide that it is a desirable policy to provide tax favored savings to employees. then I believe all employees should be able to share in the benefit equally. It is inconsistent with the goal of fairness and tax reform to provide a tax subsidy to one group of employees and to deny it to another without justification. Moreover. denying public employees 401(k) benefits it makes it far more difficult for a State or local government to attract and retain quality employees. We must not subsidize the private sector at the expense of public employers and their employees. State and local governments should be able to continue to offer 401(k) benefits to their employees. It is wrong to single them out for discrimination. I hope all t..y colleagues will Join with me in urging the conference committee to reinstitute 401(k) benefits for public employees.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. many employers. large and small. currently maintain retirement arrangements which provide for after tax employee contributions that are matched by company contributions. These arrangements have been wellreceived by employees and are successful in covering a broad range of employees at all compensation levels. The success of these arrangements is explained in part by the company matching feature. However. employees in all compensation ranges are usually willing to participate. in part. because under present law they have access to their own contributions. The Senate and House tax reform bills would restrict access to employee savings under retirement plans. Under the proposed bills. some or all of the amounts withdrawn from a qualified retirement plan may be treated as taxable and subject to an additional income tax of up to 15 percent of the amount withdrawn if such withdrawal occurs before the earlier of age 591/2. disability. or death. These changes are necessary to ensure adequate retirement income. but may have a chilling effect on emnployee savings. Anecdotal evidence makes clear that limiting access to an employees contribution can discourage participation. One company that testified in the Finance Committee RIPA hearings. which I chaired. noted that participation in its conventional thrift plan prior to 1973 was 75 percent. however. when the plan was amended in 1975 to preclude withdrawals. participation dropped to 55 percent. Another company testified that when it added a pretax contribution feature to its savings plan in 1984. aftertax contributions to the plan continued at twice the rate of pretax contributions. largely because of the difference in the withdrawal provisions. Although I am not offering an amendment to the tax bill at this time. I hope that in reviewing the basis recovery rules and the additional tax on early withdrawals in the pension area. the conferees will recognize and appreciate the need to encourage the participation of younger and lower paid employees in qualified plans. To increase participation among these groups.

These Infringements. if unchecked. may. in time. bring into discredit those rules of law and universal principles which the States Parties to the Conventions laid down to provide human beings with a better defence against the evils of war. From its experience the ICRC Is conscious that Increasingly numerous violations of International Humanitarian Law have invariably placed insurmountable obstacles In the way of peace negotiations. even when all belligerents wished to end the conflict. For example. recent conflicts have been needlessly prolonged because no agreement was reached on rrangements concerning prisoners of war. The ICRC thus calls upon States working towards the restoration of peace in the region to consider most carefully the problems which will inevitably arise because of the infringements of the Geneva Conventions by the belligerents. In particular. the ICRC would ask States. in the course of their dealings with each of the two parties to the conflict. to broach the humanitarian questions which are hereby submitted to them. The States are also urged to lend their active support to the ICRCs efforts to help the victims of the conflict which is strictly within the terms of the humanitarian mandate assigned to the ICRC through the Geneva Conventions. Finally. the ICRC hopes that discussions will be held to designate Protecting Powers willing to undertake the tasks encumbent on such states by the Geneva Conventions. Naturally. the ICRC would wish to work closely with the Protecting Powers. The ICRC is convinced that the States Parties to the Conventions are aware of what is truly at stake in the steps proposed. and that it will be their desire and Intention to translate into action the commitment which they undertook In adopting Article 1 common to the Four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.",

This legislation will take the United States closer to war in Nicaragua. and it will seriously hamper the efforts to achieve peace and freedom for Namibia in southern Africa. My reasons for opposing further assistance to the Contra forces fighting to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua are well known. This legislation authorizes the expenditure of an additional $38 million for assistance to those forces. I believe that this policy has failed in the past and has no hope of success in the future. It can only lead to wider war inside Nicaragua and expanding war throughout the region. I have also stated my reasons for opposing the repeal of the Clark amendment. This legislation. as amended by the full Senate on the floor. contains such a repeal. In my view. this aligns the United States with the Government of South Africa and prevents our Government from playing an effective role as an honest broker in the effort to achieve independence for Namibia.

I would have continued to support this bill if it were basically the same one we had reported. but it is a sad fact that it !s not. We have adopted a provision providing for a continuation of a war in Nicaragua that violates our commitment under the charter of the Organization of American States. Whether we call it humanitarian aid or military aid. the bottom line is that we have voted to sustain the Contras. whose military command structure is dominated by former Somoza people. The Contras are a terrorist force. and we should not dignify them by calling them freedom fighters or the democratic resistance. I am also deeply troubled by the provision. added not in the committee. but on the floor that would repeal the Clark amendment relating to Angola. One Nicaragua is enough. and I dont believe that we advance our countrys interests by generating a perception that we are about to intervene once again in Angolaa perception that. in my judgment. will jeopardize our effort to secure the removal of Cuban forces from Angola. There is an old saying that goes: \"If It isnt broken. dont fix it.\" Angola has not been causing trouble in the region. it has been moving toward the West. and its cooperation is vital if U.S. efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in Namibia are to succeed.

This resolution was passed unanimously out of the Subcommittee on Aging. of which I am chairman. and out of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. As I said when this resolution was introduced by Senator HEINZ on May 7. the Older Americans Act is one of the most important pieces of legislation designed to assist older Americans. As such. it enjoys broad and deep support among our citizenry. The last 20 years for the Older Americans Act network and programs have been years of constructive growth and change. The programs authorized by the act have grown from around $6 million in 1965 to approximately $1 billion today. The decentralized nature of the Older Americans Act structure and administration of its programs has allowed State and local needs and interests to be well accommodated during this period. Now the Older Americans Act network and programs are in a period during which it seems clear that there is. and will continue to be. considerable ferment and change in their environment. Cost containment efforts in the Federal health programs seem to be increasing the need for the kinds of services the Older Americans Act programs offer. Tight Federal budgets for the foreseeable future. make expansion of the existing programs an unlikely prospect. In these circumstances. questions may be raised about the appropriate priorities as between and among the several programs authorized by the act. Indeed. questions may even be raised about the appropriate role of the Older Americans Act network: Should it be direct service provision. should it be planning. coordinating and stimulating the provision of services on the part of others. should it be case management designed to help older people make their way though the confusing array of community services? Whatever the answer to this set of questions as we go forward with the Older Americans Act. the last 20 years indicates that the Older Americans Act network will adapt and change in ways which will enable it to continue to serve the varied needs of our older citizens.",

He acknowledged that this was basically a courtesy call. but noted his ministers would look to any specifics that we raised. It happened that under Mr. DOLES very thoughtful arrangements. at each of the different meetings. each Senator would be assigned a specific subject to raise. Sometimes the meetings were such that only one or two of us would speak. on other occasions there would be more. On this particular occasion. it fell to me to speak to the question of the relations that the United States and the Peoples Republic enjoy in multilateral settings. which is to say places such as the United Nations or the International Atomic Energy Agency. which is a specialized agency in the U.N. system.

Now let me add this: They have similar agreements already in place that they have agreed to with the Japanese. the Brazilians. and Argentinians. and those were worked out. But somehow our negotiators said that the Chinese were adamant on making a similar arrangement for us. I think we just did not push hard enough. This is certainly the bare minimum we should do. and all I am asking for with this amendment is that the President certify that there will be IAEA safeguards on their equivalent attached to our nuclear exports to the Peoples Republic of China. Let me also say this: on the question as to whether we should demand safeguards of the Chinese when they are a weapons state and do not need our technology to make a weapon. I just respond that it is not true that our equipment and technology would not be useful in the Chinese weapons program.

I think we know the depressed conditions in agriculture and that is particularly true in the cattle industry. Of all industries. this is one that has been hard hit and unfairly hard hit. Over the past few years the cattle industry producers themselves have voluntarily thinned their herds as a way to get supply and demand back in line. Just about the time they were to see daylight. to see a better future. they were hit first of all by the announcement of the Secretary of Agriculture of the whole herd dairy buyout program that depressed prices. That was immediately followed in the minds of most cattlemen by the effect of the futures market having on further depressing cattle prices. Studies have been made by the CFTC. by the GAO. and what this amendment does is to direct the Committee on Agriculture to conduct a study and specifically to determine the economic effects of such trading on the cattle industry and whether or not any manipulation is occurring.

Madame Cheng. a native of China. and now a naturalized United States citizen. has taken the initiative to bring an understanding of American business and economic policies to China. through her unique and exciting television series. \"The Global View.\" Madame Cheng. who is the chairman of the United StatesChina Investment & Trade Corp.. Chicago. IL. came to this country from Hong Kong in 1967. In the recent 7 years. Madame Cheng has acted as a onewoman liaison between major United States corporations and the leaders of China to promote strong trade and investment relationships. Madame Cheng has also traveled throughout this country and China. lecturing and gathering insights that are becoming increasingly important to the building of economic ties. \"The Global View\" program is only the latest in her efforts to promote United States and Chinese relations. Through her belief that understanding is the key to strong economies. Madame Cheng has been able to put together a series of informational television programs that are being aired in China. that share the insight and foresight of some of the most progressive minds at the cutting edge of our strong United States economy. Through her commitment to a dream of building reciprocal trade and economic ties between the United States and China. Madame Cheng has been able to capture on tape the management philosophies of the leaders of such American business institutions as United Airlines. headquartered in my State of Illinois. AT&T. Bank of America. Hewlett Packard. Polaroid. Intel. Ampex. and Data General. the American Electronic Association. the Stanford Research Institute. and Sears. Roebuck & Co. The importance of bringing this project into the homes of China is that it is a significant step toward a stronger world economy. and improved trade and business relationships between the United States and China. It is an exciting proposition to see U.S. business take the initiative under committed leadership such as that of Madame Cheng. Mr. President. I take extreme pleasure and pride in commending Madame Doris Wan Cheng for her pioneering initiative working to increase two powerful nations. the United States and China. closer to the economic harmony and friendship.9",

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier this year. I brought to the Senates attention a flagrant tax loophole through which large agricultural corporations take advantage of an accounting technique intended to benefit family farmers. In the final weeks of the 99th Congress. I considered offering an amendment closing this loophole by denying use of the socalled cash method of accounting to agricultural processors with annual revenues exceeding $100 million. Cash accounting allows businesses to buy supplies and incur other expenses at the end of one year and immediately deduct those expenses from income. By repeating this practice year after year. an expanding business can defer taxes virtually indefinitely. Family farmers are permitted to use cash accounting because it is less complicated than the alternative accrual method. under which costs are not deducted until the resulting income is received. Enactment of an amendment barring agricultural processors with revenues topping $100 million from using cash accounting would save the Treasury an estimated $500 million over 5 years. Understandably. talk of eliminating this tax break brought loud protests from the affected corporations. chiefly mammoth poultry producers eligible to use cash accounting because three or less families control 50 percent of their stock. This qualifies them as \"family farms.\" In the end. I chose not to offer my amendment this year. Acting otherwise would have risked tying up the tax reform bill or other key legislation being considered in the sessions final days. I felt it was important that these measures move ahead. I was pleased. however. to see a number of newspaper and magazine articles highlight the inequity in the use of cash accounting by giant agricultural corporations. There is something terribly wrong with allowing processors with hundreds of millions of dollars in sales to qualify for \"family farm\" benefits. While it was not possible to close this loophole this year. I firmly believe the time has come to make this change. I look forward to working in the new Congress with all concerned to minimize disruption as we move in this direction. Mr. President. I ask that 12 news articles concerning the use of cash accounting by large agricultural corporations be printed in the RECORD at ths point. The articles follow: [From Forbes. May 5. 1986]",

The House thoroughly debated the question of COLAs during or consideration of the first budget resolution. The House strongly rejected an attempt to deny Social Security beneficiaries their COLA. I think the Houses position on the questions of COLAs is clear. and it is appropriate for the House conferees to remain faithful on this question In light of the strong feeling in this body.

I have been an advocate of costofliving adjustments since the process began. We know that the issue is critical at this point. We know it is a bone of extreme contention. But to ask the seniors once again to assume the responsibility of sacrificing on their costofliving increase is. I think. unconscionable. Let us call this issue straight. The Senate budget resolution calls for a freeze. A freeze means simply no COLA in 1986. If the cost of living as passed by this House in an overwhelming fashion is not provided for the seniors. we will drive some 400.000 seniors into poverty. We called upon the elderly of our Nation once before. in 1983. during the great Social Security reform. to make a sacrifice. and they did because of their concern about the larger picture. which was the preservation of the Social Security system itself. Happily. we were successful in that effort as a House and as a Congress. Now the Social Security system is secure for another 50 to 75 years. bxt to attempt to link the budget defici. and the COLA in my mind is a fundamental sham. Clearly. the issue can be resolved.

I thought the Senator was going to offer an amendment of an entirely different nature. I would not ordinarily advocate that we pass something of this magnitude in the fashion we did. even though I supported the Senators motion to waive because people are suffering. But. Mr. President we still have the time in conference to consider it. I hope that the majority leader will be on the conference. We have the time in the conference to consider all these things. For example. whatever presentation someone can develop overnight to show defects in the measure could certainly be considered in conference. I do not think any of us want the sort of things the majority leader warned us against. I would think that. among the conferees. he would be the first to suggest that we did not have in mind. when we passed the amendment. to have someone claiming the benefit 10 times and things of that sort. While. of course. this is a hasty way to do it. the things about which we are being warned are not the kind of things that need to be agreed to in conference. We do not go to conference tonight. I assume there will be a few days before we finally act on the measure. Should it pass the Senate. we will have an opportunity for those in the department. as well as those on the committees. to study it. The Secretary of Agriculture knows he can give us advice. So I really do not think we need to take something as poorly considered as this at this moment with the thought that it cannot be changed in the conference.",

I would like briefly to respond to the question posed a moment ago by the chairman of the Budget Committee. who wondered why it might be that the amounts were not included in the Department of Agriculture account if the authority were already vested in the Secretary on a discretionary basis. The answer is that the Congressional Budget Office did not have any way to anticipate this drought and its severity when the calculations were made earlier..As a result. the amounts that would be called for under the discretionary authority to deal with the unexpected. unanticipated drought were not scored against that account. The opinion here. let me say again. is very simple. We have had an unprecedented disaster in the Southeastern part of the United States. The question before us is. are we going to help or are we not going to help? If you want to help. vote \"yes.\" If you do not. vote \"no.\"",

What I would also like to do tomorrow is offer the Mattingly amendment and get it also adopted. then let them go to conference and let them pick out the good parts and the bad parts. I think possibly the method we may have structured will cost considerably less and be directed more toward 1 year as we have crafted it. Also it says it is supposed to stay within the bounds of the fiscal year 1987 or the moneys already currently in the bill and cannot exceed those amounts in that bill. My thinking right now is probably to offer that amendment tomorrow and have them both adopted. let them both go to conference. let CBO or OMB or whoever else is going to score these things try to come up and maybe we can try to craft something that is really going to be necessary. I think the bottom line is that we have a disaster in the agriculture area. It is not only in the agriculture area but other areas where the drought has happend. If we had an earthquake. we would send aid. If we had any other kind of disaster in this country. we would try to help. Hay is being sent down South. but the cattle down there cannot tell whether it is a Republican bale of hay or a Democratic bale of hay. They do not care. I think we should not care in this body either. What we should care about is trying to structure something that is going to help the farmers. that is going to help agriculture. that is not going to destroy the taxpayer at the same time. I think that we should go ahead and adopt this amendment and tomorrow morning I will offer the Mattingly amendment also and hopefully the chairman of the committee will take them both over there and see if they will not consider them.",

I want to offer congratulations to the administration on what I understand is a successful conclusion of its intensive talks with the Japanese on the issue of semiconductors. USTR has announced today an agreement by which Japan has committed itself to a substantial increase in United States access to the Japanese semiconductor market. In addition. the Japanese have agreed that they will not engage in the dumping of semiconductor products in either the United States or third markets. U.S. high technology exports are critical to our international trade capability. They represent an area in which we excel and in which our products are extremely competitive. That we have enjoyed only about an 8percent share of the Japanese market instead of something closer to 20 percent had caused serious skepticism about the willingness of Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. At the same time. the charge that Japanese semiconductor products were being dumped in the United States was a cause of great concern to a U.S. industry already in distress. This agreement gives us an indication of the administrations willingness and ability to employ trade law and its own adept negotiating abilities to assure freedom and fairness in international trade. It is my understanding that the industry supports this agreement. If so. its a good precedent for the types of agreements were going to be looking for in many other areas.",

I Just want to clarify some of the confusion about the cost per barrel and per gallon since the esteemed gentleman from Texas seems to have confused those two quantities of measurement. The 11.9 cents per barrel translates in terms of gasoline to 9.3 cents in the price of a gallon of gasoline or home heating oil. Since 0.3 cent is not a usual commodity of exchange. we can translate that to about a $1.50 increase in gasoline price for every 10.000 miles driven. not a very great increase. For those people who are heating their home with oil. and the gentlewoman from Rhode Island pointed out that that is true in her area. and it is certainly true in mine. the person who uses about 950 gallons per heating season. which is about average. will wind up paying $3 more as a result of this change. So this is modest. it is small. and it is something. frankly. that I believe consumers. while they do not like to see increases in prices. when they understand that it goes in large measure to clean up the toxic waste sites that may or may not be in their community. can understand and can also live with.

An excise tax on manufacturer products may be called a SET or a VAT. but in reality it is a national sales tax. What this means is that the consumers will pay the cost of toxic waste cleanup. rather than the industries that created the problem. The DowneyFrenzel amendment will discourage industry from indiscriminantly creating hazardous wastes because it contains a provision for a \"wasteend\" tax. DowneyFrenzel calls for a revenue raising mix that includes taxes on chemical feedstocks. waste disposal. and petroleum. Some general revenue is included in the package. but the cleanup costs would be funded primarily by polluters rather than already overburdened American taxpayers.

Now. if you really want the polluters. those who are contributing the waste. to those streams that are causing Americans such problem. today. you really need a broaderbMed tax. Now. either the Duncan proposal or the Ways and Means proposal aims at accomplishing that. The Downey proposal says that you are going to tax again the originators of the products that were used by these polluters to make products we have all enjoyed.

It does seem fair to me that a waste end tax should fall on those who are creating the waste. and under the committees version of the bill. that that occurs as well. The Committee on Ways and Means proposed also seems fair because there is a tax on gasoline. Damage caused by leaking underground storage tanks will be paid for by that small tax. Finally. it seems fair to me that the broad cross section of industries. other than the oil and chemical industry. many of which are indeed responsible for causing existing dump sites. should help pay for their cleanup. For these reasons. I am compelled to again oppose both alternatives to the committees package and would hope on Tuesday next that we would have an opportunity to defeat them and vote for the committees proposal.

Unfortunately. under the wording of the final version of this provision. nonhazardous water would be taxed if it became mixed with a hazardous waste even if the mixing occurred immediately prior to injection. As the author of this amemdment. I can assure the House that that was not my original intent. I must say that my position did not prevail in its entirety. In most cases. mixing the hazardous waste immediately prior to disposal can be avoided only by spending a considerable amount of money on additional equipment. including pumps. to keep the two liquid streams separate. There seems little environmental benefit to such separation. it would simply be an additional expense for unnecessary equipment.",

First. it is unfair. second. it would cost jobs. and third. it would drive the oil and chemical industries offshore. On the unfairness issue. the EPA has identified over 100 companies that contribute to the pollution at these sites. Why should just two be cited? In addition to that. we have got cases where a national fund has been established. and in the past what did we do about those companles that have polluted in the past that have simply disappeared? By increasing the feedstock tax we further damaged the trade imbalances between domestically produced feedstocks and imported goods made from those feedstock building blocks. The 71 statistic is therefore a bit unfair. These are the reasons why this must be rejected but I do think that the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Minnesota have studied this issue carefully. they have contributed tremendously to ensure that Superfund is done adequately. but regrettably this is not the way to do it.",

This country is not ready for a VAT. It has not been discussed in the Congress. It ought not to be approved as part of this Committee. Second. I can well understand why Congressmen representing oil States or States with large chemical companies would want to support this bill. I cannot understand why Congressmen from other States would want to do so. why they would want to ask all of the large corporations in their districts. whether or not they produce toxic wastes. to pay the freight for those companies that do. I cannot under. stand that. Third. I would ask Members to keep in mind that the bill that we voted on last year overwhelmingly in this House dealt a higher level of taxation on chemical companies and petroleum companies than does the DowneyFrenzel substitute. Last year in the bill that we passed. we assessed $6.7 billion of the cost of Superfund cleanup against chemical feedstocks and petroleum. The DowneyFrenzel substitute assesses only $1.5 billion. This is not a new and onerous burden which we are putting on companies in the chemical and petroleum areas. Finally. just in relation to chemical companies. let me point out that in 1983. according to a study that I commissioned. the effective income tax rate of chemical companies as a group was -1 percent. They should hardly be complaining about a small increase in the Superfund tax when they can wind up with a negative effective income tax rate which they had in 1983.

While the focus of the world centers upon the Middle East and Central America. the strife in Northern Ireland continues to be a major world problem. Up until the late 1960s. violence was only sporadic since the division of Ireland in 1921. In 1969. the year that British Armed Forces were again stationed in Northern Ireland. the level of violence escalated dramatically. Over 2.300 men. women. and children have been senselessly killed and another 20.000 have been seriously injured. The United States has a unique bond with the nations and the communities involved in the conflict. The United States has also had a history of offering its diplomatic services in troubled areas of the world. The turmoil in Northern Ireland justifies close attention by our Nation. The problems of this area between allies must be solved by the nations involved. We can. however. offer our assistance in reaching accord. The political stalemate in Ireland is becoming an enduring tragedy. The seeds of hostility are deeply rooted in Ulster. The United States can play a vital role in fostering negotiations for this troubled region. Senate Concurrent Resolution 4 would recommend to the President that he appoint a highly qualified and appropriately experienced special diplomatic envoy to investigate and report how best the United States could actively assist the governments involved in solving the conflict in Northern Ireland.

The issue of our concern is the lives of those Americans among us who have what is called Downs syndrome. a genetic defect that causes varying degrees of mental retardation and physical handicaps. George Will has a fine young son who has Downs syndrome. For the past several years. I have been the author of a resolution supported by a vast majority of Congress to designate a week in the year to focus on those who have Downs syndrome. Last year. I was happy to Join George Will at the White House with President Reagan for the official signing of Downs Syndrome Week. A constituent of mine. Thomas ONeill. of Fort Wayne. IN. who is president of the National Downs Syndrome Congress. was also in attendance. I have visited a special school in Fort Wayne. where Tom ONeills young son is receiving the kind of personal education that can help him live in our society as a productive person. And that is the issue. I think George Will is addressing. For many years now. my wife Charlene and I have been involved in supporting the March of Dimes in Indiana to fight birth defects. Char has even started a special fund in her name to direct more attention to the fight against birth defects in our State. Yet while we continue our efforts to end birth defects. many children are born in our country with them. These children and adults as they grow older are full members of our Nation and deserving of all the rights and privileges of all Americans.

I think everyone will agree that the original Senate bill. for all practical purposes. has now been made a part of the Executive order. So what I was suggesting this morning. for those of us who feel strongly. as does the Senator from Kansas. the Senator from Massachusetts. and others. is that we ought to postpone consideration of the conference report. make sure the administration lives up to the terms of the Executive order and. if not. we will have the conference report before us.

What we are talking about is a basic and fundamental question upon which this country was built. the equality of all persons. The House of Representatives has responded to this issue. they have voted. As I gather from the majority leader. he is making a request that we vitiate the opportunity for the Senate to fulfill its legislative obligation to speak on this issue at this time and to rely solely upon an Executive order than the benefit of legislation on an issue of fundamental importance and a principle upon which I think this country stands. If we represent anything to ourselves and to the countries of the world. it is equality of individuals. Apartheid runs contrary to that. I think it is imperative we speak to that issue. We have debated it in the Foreign Relations Committee and the Banking Committee. They have done outstanding work. I paid tribute to Senator LUGAR and the members of the Foreign Relations Committee. As the leader has pointed out. we have had a strong bipartisan effort. and I wish we would have that same effort when we pass this legislation. and hopefully the President will find that he would be able to sign it.

It is absolutely essential on a moral issue such as this that the United States speak out loud and clear. In essence. what we do with the adoption of the Executive order is to weaken that message. It is to allow the advocates of antiapartheid here in the United States to be the administration that has dragged its feet on the issue of being against apartheid. The House and the Senate have both spoken very clearly. There is no mistaking the words or the intent of the statute. Now we have something less before us. Granted we are not going to go ahead and change the laws of South Africa. This was always the matter of symbol. and a matter of perception.

Embedded in the tradition and the national conscience of the United States is a deep concern for oppressed people. whether they reside within our borders or halfway around the world. It is thus our duty and privilege to speak out in defense of those whose basic rights are denied by governments that do not share our regard for the dignity of all human beings. Foremost in these efforts should be our advocacy for Soviet Jewry. for whom conditions have progressively worsened in recent years. One such example is that of Igor Gregorovich Malishev. He and his wife. Anna. and their son. Stanislav. first applied for visas in January of 1980 in order to join Igors sister in Israel. They were denied. Subsequent applications were submitted every 6 months. These visa applications were also denied. Although Annas mother gave her written permission for them to go to Israel. they were refused on the pretext that they should not split the family by leaving a parent behind. Until 1979 the Malishevs lived in Kiev where Igor worked as a math lecturer at the university for 11 years. After Igors dismissal from the university. Malishevs moved to Riga where Igor worked as a relief teacher until 1982 when he was forced to resign in order to submit his sixth application for an exit visa. Since then he has given private tutoring in mathematics. The continued repression of the Jews in the Soviet Union must be stopped. The Malishevs are only one of the thousands of the Soviet Jewish families wishing to flee the Soviet Union. but who are not permitted.

I believe this legislation deserves the highest priority of every Member of this body. As laid before you today. this bill is a longoverdue reauthorization and updating of the Safe Drinking Water Act. It was approved overwhelmingly in the same form by this body last fall. I am extremely pleased that the authors of this measure have again included a section to establish a demonstration project to develop management plans for the protection of solesource aquifers. leading to a comprehensive national policy for this muchignored resource. For far too long our Nations supplies of clean ground water have been overlooked in national legislation and policya problem \"out of sight and out of mind.\" In my district on Long Island. 2.3 million people are totally dependent on an underground supply for their drinking water. Nationwide. 90 percent of our rural citizens. and millions in our urban and suburban centers. also depend on aquifers. rather than on surface waters. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that ground water reserves are 50 times that of our annual flow of surface water. Clearly. protection of such a vast and critical resource is in the best interests of all. The dependency of ground water Is clearly a national concern and is not unique to New York. Besides the Nassau/Suffolk aquifer. the Environmental Protection Agency has designated aquifers from Florida to Guam and from Texas to Montana that would be eligible for special protection status and the demonstration project created by this measure. While not meaning to slight our efforts to control acid rain and clear our skies of pollutants. we must provide the resources to ensure that our communities and homes enjoy a clean and safe drinking water supply. All of the major sections of this bill share that common goal. Mr. Speaker. the ground water concepts contained in this bill are the seeds of a farreaching and critically needed national policy and I am optimistic that the 99th Congress will bring them to fruition.9",

The Community Patrol Officer Program has fostered a fruitful alliance between the Bronx police force and the community it serves. By walking the beat. patrol officers are beginning to realistically understand problems adversely affecting the quality of life of many Bronx citizens. Establishing a comfortable relationship between these two parties has resulted in a mutual friendship with increasingly favorable results. Prior to the development of radio car technology. a patrol officer walking the streets of the Bronx was a common sight. But unfortunately the technological development of the 911 emergency call system inevitably has resulted in a situation in which efficiency is given priority over an acceptable level of rapport between the police force and its community. The Community Patrol Officer Program is a commendable one as it has restored good relations between the two parties. By reincarnating the practice of cops walking the beat. it has successfully filled the vacuum created by the departure of officers from the streets. The program has restored public faith in the police force by demonstrating that cops can provide service to the \"good guys\" instead of always being caught up in making arrests. The idea of uniforms in the street has translated into a much greater sense of security for the people of the community. Undoubtedly the program is a step in the right direction toward fostering a resurrection of the attitudes of the citizens of the Bronx toward the officers who enforce its law.

Except for the interest on the national debt. we would spend no more in 1986 than we do in 1985. In the Presidents proposal. there are some increases in spendingparticularly In national defenseand there are some decreases In spending. Some programs are targeted for elimination. One program President Reagan would like to eliminate is revenue sharing. On the surface. revenue sharing sounds like a great idea. The Federal Government. through grants. gives money to State and local governments to use as they please. This year. the Federal Government will spend $4.6 billion on revenue sharing. But. revenue sharing was enacted in 1972. when there were immediate prospects for a budget surplus. Now. there is no revenue in the Federal Treasury to share. So. in effect. we are deficit sharing with our local governments. rather than revenue sharing. Local commu.-ities simply do not get back the money they send to the Federal Treasury. Therefore. local citizens pay taxes to the Federal Government. Then part of the money Is used to pay bureaucrats to decide where the money will be used. Finally. partonly partof the money the local citizens sent to Washington comes back to the local community. It is. of course. money. Thats why town and city governments all over the country have been screaming loudly not to eliminate revenue sharing. Its the same storyeveryone wants to cut the deficit. but no one is willing to sacrifice their portion of the Government pie. This attitude simply must stop. Somewhere along the line. we all have to bite the bullet and say. \"OK. Im willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep our country economically sound.\" The town of Davidson. NC. has that kind of courage. Recently. Mr. Speaker. the town board of commissioners and the mayor passed a resolution calling for an end to the Revenue Sharing Program.

Ms. Isaacs said: Each year there are a number of competent first novels published. Perhaps it has something to do with the proliferation of creative workshops and Masters of Fine Arts programs. but there seem to be more and more authors capable of creating a perfectly polished sentence. every word a Jewel. But Elizabeth Benedicts writing is more than merely wellwrought. Its alive. Benedicts debate is auspicious because she goes a step beyond craftsmanship. She creates people who are touching. human. and memorable. It sounds like Lizs work is what Red Smith had in mind when he talked about successful writing.*",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last week an editorial appeared in the New York Times entitled. \"Americas Pregnant Children.\" This piece. based on a study just released by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. details the distressing rates of teenage pregnancies. births. and abortions in the United States. The Times reminds us that these occurrences are far more frequent in this country than most other developed countries. even though American adolescents are no more sexually active than others. The study also dispels the myth that welfare serves as an incentive to outofwedlock childbearing. The Times suggests. and I agree. that we are in the position we are in because we will not sufficiently counter. with education and counseling for teenagers. the enormous influences of a society undergoing a sexual revolution. Why else would we have higher rates of teen pregnancy. abortion. and childbearing? Why else would U.S. childbearing rates be much higher than Sweden.\" France. England. Canada. Wales. and the Netherlands? Among subjects studied by the Select Committee on Children. Youth. and Families during the last 2 years. the multiple crises associated with teenage pregnancy have received top priority. Over 1 million teenagers each year will become pregnant in the United States. and over onehalf million will bear children. In fact. Wendy Baldwin. of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development. has told the select committee that among girls now aged 14. 40 percent will experience a pregnancy before they reach age 20. and onefifth will bear a child. We know a lot about how to solve the problem. But as the New York Times so aptly editorialized. \"Consensus. and commonsense. become Impossible.\" when we try to institute preventive strategies that include sex education in the schools. or when we try to discuss teenage contraceptive use. The results of our policy failures are clear: unprecedented numbers of abortions among teenagers. and more teens with infants risking the relentless cycle of welfare dependency and poverty. The time has come to use what we know to reverse this trendone that is unparalleled in other developed countries and which has dire consequences for our most vulnerable youth. I hope my colleagues will take the time to read this important editorial:",

According to a NIOSH official. the study showed that workers exposed at the current OSHA limit for worker exposure of benzene run more than 30 times the risk of leukemia than employees who are not exposed at all. The article further points out that estimates show 600.000 U.S. workers are exposed to benzene in the workplace. I consider these findings most alarming and further proof that Federal standards may not always be tough enough to protect workers. Recently in New Jersey a district court knocked down provisions of the States \"Worker RighttoKnow\" law on the grounds that Federal law had preempted certain sections of the act. The law would have established stricter standards than OSHA. I have recently introduced a bill to deal with this problem. This bill would allow any State to pass worker righttoknow legislation whether or not the State has an OSHAapproved plan to take over regulation In the area. so long as the standards In the State law either provide more information or are otherwise more protective of worker health and safety than the OSHA standard. In effect. the bill would establish OSHA standards as the floor. and not the ceiling. for State efforts in this area. States that enact laws with more stringent standards than OSHA should not always be preempted. I commend this thoughtful column to my colleagues attention:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. its my pleasure to insert into the RECORD for the benefit of our colleagues a recent oped piece by the nationally syndicated columnist. Joseph Sobran concerning the reception given Secretary of State George Shultz during his recent testimony in the House. Mr. Speaker. the whimpering and whining about McCarthyism by liberals every time someone mentions communikm is simply a slightofmind whos challenge is long overdue. In his usual lucid manner. Mr. Sobran points out that liberals. \"with sterotypical predictability\" perform a public relations function for Communist regimes in each phase of their creation. This is not only predictable. but inevitable because as Michael Polanyi pointed out back in 1958. Marxist totalitarianism is largely erected upon the weakness of liberalisms foundational beliefs. Commandante Ortega offers up a patented peace offensive and liberals react as if the chairman of the board of E.F. Hutton just spoke at a Georgetown pool party. To hear everything a Marxist says is an exercise. to believe everything is a strain. our liberals are blue with straining. For instance. would American liberals ever consider the question: Could Daniel Ortega. like Fidel Castro. be a lunatic who sees himself as Creator and Redeemer of his world. one who can not see that he is turning Nicaragua into Hell instead of Heaven. where instead of angels only flies fill the air? No. to the contrary. as the Republican Study Committees Frank Gregorsky has demonstrated. the evidence of history measures only an empty inch between the American liberal and the Marxist/Socialist. First. their world views are equally complete and equally crippling in practice. Second. these two seekers after the social superman are most often looking for him in the looking glass. Finally. like Marxists. the modern liberal is a thourough materialist. in the Biblical word. worldly. It was G.K. Chesterton who reminded us that. \"worldly people never understand even the world. they rely altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not",

This legislation is needed to put the central Midwest compact into effect. and I hope Congress will act expeditiously on this matter. In 1980. Congress enacted the LowLevel Waste Policy Act. which established the Federal policy that each State must be responsible for providing the capacity for disposing of the lowlevel radioactive waste generated within its borders. This law also recognized. however. that such waste can be best managed and safely stored if done on a regional basis. Accordingly. the LowLevel Waste Policy Act authorized States to enter into regional compacts to develo.p regional disposal facilities for lowlevel radioactive waste. The legislation I am introducing today is the regional compact that Illinois and Kentucky have entered into. This compat will not become effective. however. until it has been ratified by Congress.

I am proud to note that the New York City Department for the Aging in cooperation with the mayor and other city agencies as well as private and voluntary organizations have established an important partnership committed to providing genuine assistance not only to victims of Alzheimers but also support help to their families or those providing care. Perhaps the best example of this working partnership was the establishment of the New York City Alzheimers Resource Center operated by the New York City Department for the Aging with a tremendous assist from the Brookdale Foundation. Together they have initiated the first and only municipally funded center of its type in the Nation. Alzheimers disease is a progressive. degenerative brain disease. It afflicts between 1.2 and 4 million Americans a year and is now the fourth leading cause of death. The cost for caring for a victim of Alzheimers is estimated at between $17.000 and $50.000 a year. Most of this cost is borne by family members. As we work on a governmental response. we must combine our efforts both at funding research to work at uncovering the causes on this disease but we must also provide adequate funds to provide critically needed support services for victims and their families. New York City has demonstrated great leadership in this regard and I would like to now insert excerpts of the Alzheimers conference for the review of my colleagues.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have this week introduced legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. My amendment would exempt the use of certain emergency vehicles from taxation as a fringe benefit. The current regulations of the IRS will tax the drivers of police cars and other emergency vehicles whenever the IRS deems the vehicles to be used in an offduty capacity. I believe this distinction leads to unfair taxation. Policemen. for example. are never truly off duty. They are subject to being called to duty 24 hours a day. When they are called to duty. they are required to carry their responsibilities in vehicles equipped for that duty. In addition. many police officials conduct official duties even when they are not formally at work. They serve process papers. assist stranded motorists. and even risk their lives in sudden emergency occurrences. It is not fair for the IRS to define these situations as appropriate to fringe benefit taxation. It is not fair to tax our police and emergency personnel for using. or being prepared to use. a vehicle required for their duty. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I propose.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. 1 year ago today. the Supreme Court handed down its decision in the case of Grove City College versus Bella ruling which set civil rights enforcement in America back by 20 years. By limiting the coverage of title IX. the only Federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education. the Court closed the doors of opportunity for millions of young women across the Nation. If this were not damage enough. this ruling may have a similarly restrictive effect on three other key civil rights statutestitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for minorities. section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for the disabled. and the Age Discrimination Act for the elderly. As title IX now stands. colleges and schools are free to discriminate in programs or departments which do not directly receive Federal funds. and. for the unlucky students. there Is no legal recourse. This is a result which I find appalling. We have seen terrific progress for women since title IX was enacted in 1972. Female enrollment in medical. dental. law. and veterinary schools have more than doubled. The number of women participating in intercollegiate athletics has jumped from 16.000 to over 250.000. Blatant discriminatory practices. such as requiring girls to have SAT scores 30 to 40 points higher than their male counterparts. have disappeared. Yet. unless Congress takes action these advances will fade before our very eyes. In the 12 short months since the Grove City decision. the Department of Education has dropped investigations of 61 civil rights complaints. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Civil Rights Restoration Act. legislation which will restore broad coverage of these four statutes. We must make clear. once and for all. that where taxpayer dollars go. taxation sanctioned prohibitions on discrimination must follow.",

From hi. tc.timony it is clear that the Secretary fails to understand what his Agricultural Adjustment Act would do to the American farmer. By the passage of the farm credit bill by the House yesterday. it is clear to me that the House feels that the Secretary does not understand the plight of the farmers. I questioned the Secretary at length about the Sugar Loan Programa program that is important not only to the farmers in my district but also to farmers in States where sugarcane and sugar beets grow. The reality of the program he has proposed for sugar is that simply will not work. With world sugar prices depressed to 31/2 cents per pound due to the price dumping policies of the Common Market. the proposed sugar program would destroy the domestic sugar industry. I have no doubt that if the Presidents proposals are enacted. there would not be a single acre of sugar cane or sugar beets by the end of this decade. What is most disturbing is that this administration. which prides itself on reducing the cost of government. is proposing a new program which will cost far more than the current Sugar Loan Program. At our hearing yester. day. Secretary Block admitted to me that since the current Sugar Program was implemented. it has not cost the Federal Government 1 penny to operate. What he is proposing is a new. expensive program which offers deficiency payments to growers. At a time when the Federal Government is looking for ways to cut Federal spending. I can see no reason why Congress should replace a program that operates at no cost with one that will be an expensive burden on the taxpayers.",

One key issue before this subcommittee. which also falls within the jurisdiction of my other committee. the Committee on Banking. Finance and Urban Affairs. is money laundering. As current events so tragically demonstlrcte. this multibilliondollar activity finances organized crime through financial institutions at the expense of the American people. Money laundering is the lifeblood of organized drugirafficking and the bill that I am introducing today. the Money Laundering Act of 1985 is designed to strike at the heart of these financing operations. Mr. Speaker. the Money Laundering Act of 1985 creates for the first time. a criminal offense for laundering money from illegal activities and stiffly punishes these acts. Secondly. the act provides summons authority to the Secretary of Treasury for more efficient and effective enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act. Third. money laundering is made subject to authorized Federal wiretaps. and finally. protection from civil liability is provided for banks which notify the Federal Government of unusual and suspicious money launderingtype activities. The Money Laundering Act of 1985 completes the law enforcement picture for drug trafficking cases. To be effective. we must take the profit out of crime. and for this reason.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing the \"Steelhead Trout Protection Act.\" which proposes that States be able to enforce bans against commercial steelhead fishing within their Jurisdictions. This legislation is important because it would restore steelhead fish to the status of \"game fish\" rather than \"commercial\" for the first time in over 10 years. It would correct inequities that were created by the Federal court Boldt decision in 1974. It would implement the will of the people of the Stute of Washington. as expressed by a majority vote last November in favor of Initiative 456. Steelhead trout has traditionally been considered a game fish. In 1974. however. the rug was pulled out from under the sports fishermen when the Federal Government initiated a lawsuit which resulted in a U.S. district court ruling that treaties entered Into between the U.S. Government and various Indian tribes entitled those tribes to more than half of the steelhead trout harvest. The court ruling permitted tribal fishermen to use gillnets. a commercial fishing technique. and to sell steelhead commercially. I have believed for a long time that this Federal court decision. which was in response to a federally initiated lawsuit. Intend to guarantee Indians their treaty rights. resulted in ot her inequities to nonIndian fishermen. I object to the nonIndian fishermen of the Pacific Northwest being forced alone to shoulder the burden for a Federal treaty entered into in the name of all American citizens. Furthermore. I believe that by allowing tribal fishermen to use glllnets. the Federal court is damaging the future prospects for a healthy steelhead fishery. It is for these reasons that. in the 97th Congress. I cosponsored legislation that was similar to the bill I am introducing today. Our legislative effort was not successful in the 97th Congress. and It has dim prospects in this Congress as well as supporters of Initiative 456 have acknowledged.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this past Friday. April 19. preeminent author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel received the Congressional Gold Medal from President Reagan for his tireless efforts to remind us of the Nazi concentration camps. Mr. Wiesel has moved the world with a simple eloquence which captures the darkness of that era. forcing us to confront a past which must never be repeated. As a survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps. Mr. Wiesel opens a heart filled with torment and Irrepressible anger. but it is also a heart filled with hopethe hope that the human community can move forever away from such evil. not by forgetting but by remembering. In his acceptance speech. Mr. Wiesel speaks of the dangers of failing to act against such atrocities: I learned from the perils of language and those of silence. I learned that in extreme situations when human lives and dignity are at stake. neutrality is a sin. It helps the killers. not the victims... I have learned the danger of indifference. For the opposite of love. I have learned. is not hate. but indifference. This theme of taking an active role to prevent further actions of genocide is seen throughout Mr. Wiesels writings. and is in large part responsible for his receiving the Congressional Gold Medal. We as a nation must assume the responsibility of taking an active role in the prevention of genocide. I urge my colleagues to formalize our commitment by ratifying the Genocide Treaty. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the acceptance speech by Elie Wiesel be printed in the REcoRD.",

The Vietnam Veterans Delayed Reentry. Psychological Readjustment and Vocational Rehabilitation Assistance Act will accord the Veterans Administration the necessary authority it requires to resolve the unique psychosocial problems affecting Vietnam veterans within the parameters of existIng VA resources. All provisions of the bill have precedent in the comprehensive psychological readjustment assistance accorded World War II veterans by the VA.

The Delayed Reentry Act will provide Vietnam veterans who are suffering from psychological readjustment problems related to their military service or readjustment therefrom with priority treatment within the mainstream VA mental health resources. The act gives serviceconnected disability status. at a noncompensable level. to Vietnam and other eligible veterans who experience mental health problems which are determined by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist to require mental health services to facilitate successful readjustment to civilian life. This means that these veterans will receive priority in treatment and access to the VAs mental health resources before the 75 percent of veterans whose mental problems have no connection to their military service. but who are receiving mental health services from the VA. These veterans would not be subject to income limitations imposed upon nonserviceconnected veterans. They would receive no priority medical treatment other than that required to resolve their psychological readjustment problems. Veterans Administration psychiatrists and psychologists would be required to make special efforts to determine if Vietnam veterans psychological problems were incurred or aggravated in the service. or are a posttraumatic stress disorder. thus warranting a service connection for a disability.

Such review will be carried out in consultation and cooperation with the Secretary of Human Services and the Directors of the National Institutes of Health and Mental Health. With the exception of the $100 million in research being carried out on agent orange. there is very little relevant activity in areas of potential health care detriment to Vietnam veterans. The vast majority of PTSD research is surveying the symptomsnot seeking the solutions to the problems that affect potentially onehalf million veterans. There Is little in medical schools and psychiatric training. or in much VA medical training to prepare VA personnel to handle Vietnamrelated problemslet alone provide the comprehensive and empathetic counseling and treatment that Vietnam veterans suffering the consequences of their military service deserve and require. Less than 10 percent of the patients the VA will see In a given year will be Vietnam veterans experiencing medical or psychological problems that are a consequence of their military service. This legislation would require the VA to provide appropriate training to Its personnel in the counseling and screening. testing. evaluation. treatment. therapy. readjustment. and rehabilitation of the unique psychosocial needs of Vietnamera veterans. As I have stated. the review of prior activities in the PTSD area is to be carried out by the VA Administrator.

This joint review will prove particularly beneficial as we attempt to dig deeper Into the problems and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.

To survive 100 years as a private secondary school with a commitment to excellence and high moral values. and a widely recognized superb reputation for educating young adults is an even greater feat. Yet. Howe Military School in Howe. IN. has done just that and has still flourished over the years. Howe Military School has been celebrating its centennial throughout this current school year. 198485. and certainly deserves such an ongoing acknowledgement of the schools achievements and the achievements of its graduates. Howe Military School has graduated over the years hundreds of young Americans with superb academic backgrounds. high personal standards. and a strong sense of patriotism. Howe embodies what private education is and should be. Its superintendent. General Scott. its faculty. board of trustees. alumni. and supporters are dedicated to providing the students a foundation based on the principles that guided the creation of our Nation. Howe Military School has always provided its students with a traditional education and has never swerved from its path when other secondary schools were trying to make their students happy by adding all sorts of new and experimental classes. Howe has had strong ties with the church also. which has helped guide the school and has contributed to the classic and moral education of the students. For the most part. private schools have been able to attain greater academic quality. generate more concern for moral values. and offer a generally better disciplined classroom atmosphere than have public schools. Private education. like that offered at Howe. continues to exist because of the demand for its services. It meets the needs of a pluralistic United States because parents exercise more influence over its policies and because it combines high academic achievement and respect for traditional moral and spiritual values. Howe Military School offers all this as well as high quality military training to its students. Ninety percent of these students go on to college or to our service academies. They are wellprepared. committed. and patriotic young adults. With the graduation of its students. Howe is performing a service to Indiana. the Midwest. and our Nation. Howe has performed this service for 100 years already. I feel certain that Howe Military School will continue to teach. lead. and prepare our youth for another 100 years.e",

The current funding level of this program is such that the obligations are running higher than any other program within the Defense Department. but the spending is running lower than any other program within the Defense Department. Obligations versus spending. As of March of this yearthis is not obligated. this is spentonly 8.7 percent of the program funds had been spent. Now. it seems to me that our judgment is not to worry about whether we gut one or two portions of these experiments. if those experiments have a more negative impact of gutting the ABM Treaty. The larger issue is. Should we be spending the money for them in the first place? Now. that is what we ought to be voting for. I think a 23percent Increase to almost every aspect of this program is more than a generous increase when every other area of the Defense Department and every other area of Government has been either gutted or significantly cut. And so I think the judgment we ought to be making is the overall impact. Now. I should like to ask the Senator from Virginia. because I asked this question of Mr. Nitze before the Foreign Relations Committee and Mr. Kampelman. and they did not say It was and have not to this dayis the potential future deployment currently on the table and being negotiated against a reduction of current land forces and ICBM forces?",

I spoke with the President of MIT the other day. who said. You ought to see them. They are buzzing around MIT like vultures trying to find professors who want to do some SDI research so they can say. \"Wow. we have an MIT professor doing SDI research.\" This from the president of the university. We will know what happens then. We obligate contracts without knowing for what the heck they are spending the money. We are going to spend money for these things for many years and build momentum. with everybody having a piece of the pie. And finally. when it comes time to make the considered judgment of whether or not this is really what we want to do. everybody is going to stand here and say. \"We cant pull back now. We cant do this now. Look what the Soviet Union is doing now.\" It will be too late. It is exactly that kind of decision by default that I think we ought to be considering. My distinguished colleague answered my question as I thought he would. They have not yet put the issue on the table. As long as SDI is not on the table. you cannot have an agreement in Geneva because the Soviet Union would be mindless. mindless to begin to agree to reduce their landbased missiles. which are 70 percent of their force. while we are building a defensive system that totally renders that force useless. They are not going to do it. We know they are not going to do It. Until they do. arms control talks are not real. So.

UT. Mr. Gondor is a fifth generation rancher in this area. His great grandfather was one of the first four settlers to settle this valley and homesteaded his ranch in the 1880s. Though Garrison has been settled for sometime. it is a remote area which only received telephone service this summer. If the Senate language is not adopted. Mr. Gondors operation will become inoperable. as he will lose the ability to grace his cattle on summer range. and as the Forest Service and BLM have indicated. there are no replacement lands available. I point this out to my colleague not because he is unfamiliar with this situation. but to state the situation in such a way that it will be clearly recognized and understood by conferees on the bill.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 107 which expresses the r nse of the Congress that the President take action to reduce unfair Japanese trade practices. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with the world has reached historic heights. over $123 billion in 1984. Onethird of that total deficit is solely with Japan and exceeded $37 billion in 1984. with motor vehicles alone exceeding $19 billion. In fact. between 1983 and 1984. there was a 7percent increase in the trade deficit with Japan. The trade deficit with Japan has continued to grow progressively regardless of fluctuations in the yendollar exchange rate over the same period. At the same time. Japanese markets. as well as those of certain other nations. have remained restricted to many U.S. products in key merchandise areas. The economy of this Nation is seriously jeopardized by the continued deepening of this imbalance in international trade and its implication for further job losses in the United States. It is estimated 3 million Jobs in the United States have been lost since 1981 due to the trade deficit. Because of the particular severity of our trade imbalance with Japan. and its implications for retention of key manufactures in the United States. immediate attention should be given to the causes of. and the means for redressing. that imbalance. especially in view of the fact that although the President recently lifted and the voluntary restraints on motor vehicles. the Japanese gave no commensurate concessions with respect to the closure of their markets to American telecommuncations. steel. textiles. agriculture. timber. finished wood. pharmaceuticals. medical equipment. and financial services. In fact. the Japanese Government has already announced it would increase its auto exports by 25 percent more in 1985. bringing just the Japanese U.S. market share in automobiles to over 25 percent of the entire U.S. auto market. Though Congress must take strong additional steps to bring back fair trade. this resolution calls on the President who has sufficient authority to undertake immediate action and use his full authority to do so.",

Our economic policy is a disaster. It is rapidly decapitalizing the farms and factories of America. You cannot run the kind of fiscal deficit that we are running in this country and expect anything to happen other than what is happening today. Our dollar is not overvalued. it is just highly inflated. We are drawing in money from all over the world to pay for the interest on our national debt. We are living on borrowed capital.

Simply put. America has been too generous for too long. As the United States continues to keep its doors wide open to Japanese products. the Japanese have slammed their trade doors closed and turned the key. The numbers tell the story. While the U.S. trade deficit with Japan swelled to $37 billion in 1984. Japans trade surplus with the United States reached $4.2 billion in Februarythe highest level since last Julys $4.7 billion gap. The result: Japanese businesses get rich and American workers lose their Jobs. by the thousands. In January. there was optimistic news from the White House. President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone had apparently agreed that Japan rhould open its markets to competitive American products. A cause for celebration? Hardly. As a goodfaith gesture. President Reagan lifted a voluntary restraint agreement on Japanese auto imports shortly after his January meeting with Nakasone. In turn. the Japanese proceeded to increase its auto shipments to the United States by a whopping 25 percent. rationalizing that this would represent a 2.3million unit \"limit.\" Knowledgeable observers tell us that this socalled \"limit\" is actually Japans full productive capacity. So much for goodfaith gestures. To add insult to injury. Commerce Department officials tell us that Japan has agreed to only two of nine U.S. objectives designed to assure U.S. access In Japans telecommunications market. and negotiations to open Japans markets in three other areassophisticated electronics: wood and paper products. and pharmaceuticals and medical equipmenthave yet to begin. Mr. Speaker. today we are considering a nonbinding resolution that sends a strong signal to the President that retaliatory measures are necessary to force the Japanese to end their unfair and totally unacceptable trade practices. The passage of this legislation is clearly action worth taking. Yet. for the sake of the American work force. whose jobs are at stake.

For the past 8 years. we have seen many high level talks. and very little concrete action. Today. we consider a resolution that I would have termed \"extreme\" a few years ago. Now. however. I do not view this resolution as extreme. but instead I find this proposal a reasoned response to the tremendous obstacles American firms face in Japan. When I talk with firms in my district. firms who have spent millions of dollars and years of effort to get into the Japanese market. they are frustrated. They are disappointed. They see nothing good on the horizon unless and until our country forces Japan to be fair. And that is what this resolution offers us today: A statement that the United States seeks fair trade with the world. This resolution states that we can no longer tolerate the oneway street. a street running from Japan directly into American markets. that have characterized past JapaneseAmerican trade relations. This resolution seeks fair trade. fair trade means goods and services must move down both sides of a twoway street. I support this resolution as a statement of the Houses intent to deal seriously and resolutely with the Japanese trade situation. We can no longer accept promises of further highlevel talks. we can only accept specific. concrete alterations in Japans trade barriers.

The GrammRudmanHollings Deficit Reduction Act would almost guarantee that Federal military. and railroad retirees will not receive cost of living adjustments (COLAs) whenever sequestration is invoked for automatic deficit reductions to meet deficit goals. The provision requires that these COLAs be reduced until the deficit target is met or until the COLA reduction has contributed a maximum 50 percent of the required deficit reduction. This provision was invoked in fiscal year 1986 and resulted in no COLAs being awarded to these groups in fiscal year 1986. Since then. numerous Pennsylvania retirees. and their organizations. have contacted me to protest this situation. Federal military and railroad retirees have been seriously injured by this provision. While veterans and Social Security recipients COLAs were correctly left untouched. the abovementioned retirees have had their COLAs eliminated. I have always maintained that COLAs for retirees should be treated equally.

Social Security COLAs are now exempt while the COLAs of Federal civilian and military retirees. railroad workers and others can be reduced or eliminated. as they were in fiscal year 1986.

Furthermore. after such a suspension. the Secretary would be required: First. to reimburse the fund for any investment lost as a result of the suspension and. second. to invest uninvested assets of the fund in a manner which. to the extent practicable. would make the fund whole. as though such suspension never occurred. Moreover. the amendment would allow the Secretary to disinvest assets of the fund when the fund is holding uninvested assets due to the public debt limit. but only when necessary to ensure timely payment of amounts authorized to be made from the fund.",

I had the honor of working with and watching this brilliant man as he played his many roles on the national and international scene. He played them all with unfailing skill. wisdom. wit. and personal charm. Born to great wealth and privilege. Averell Harriman did not turn to public service out of need. or any lust for power. Instead. he was drawn to a lifetime of service through true commitments. an unerring sense of duty. and real devotion to his country. His death has occasioned many recitals of his long career. I will not list his accomplishments here. Let me simply say that he was more in tune with his times than any man I have ever known. He lived through the most turbulent times in modern history. He was present at the birth of the world as we know it today. And throughout these great changes. he never failed to understand the course the times had taken. He had a clear sense of history. and near prescience concerning events to come. The giants of three generations sought his counsel. and he served them well. Along with his great understanding. he demonstrated great ability. He excelled as a statesman. diplomat. Governor. negotiator. administrator. businessman. sportsman. No assignment he accepted ever defeated him. I like to think of Averell Harriman as one of the last true gentlemen our brash young country ever produced. He was born in a milder age. before the First World War. Throughout the turmoil of the succeeding years. he retained the manners and dignity of a bygone time. I grieve with his wife. his children and grandchildren. But I know they take solace in the knowledge that few men have lived lives as meaningful as his. Few men have reached out to the world in times of crisis as he did. W. Averell Harriman made his mark on the world. It will never be erased.*",

In a minute I will r ask that a table be put into thE RECORD to make that precise. The information. I will say to my friend. collected from these different I sources have tracked one another very closely down through the years. For instance. the data that I have used comes variously from three reports of this sort. in addition to the testimony received from the witnesses. highly respected witnesses. I will repeat. to whom I referred earlier. The first is. as the Senator knows. a USDA farm finance survey conducted in 1979. The second source is a consensus of agriculture conducted in 1982. The third is the farm cost current survey conducted in 1984. So they are not going back and getting figures from some year in the past. They have done this each year over a period of time and brought them up to date.",

A $250.000 sale out of a feedlot. even on an Iowa feedlot farm. is not a big amount. If they had $96.000 in profit. their corn from that same farm that they put through those cattle or hogs must have been worth about $88 a bushel. We would not have to monkey around with target prices and deficiency payments. Target prices. after all. are based on the cost of production. They are not meant to show a profit. The deficiency payment. by law. does not guarantee a profit to any producer. no matter how much they produce. The chairman was just speaking about no matter how much you have. how many bushels of corn. bushels of wheat or hundredweight of rice. the deficiency payment applies to every bushel. The deficiency payment. when it is paid. indicates that the market conditions are such that the cost of production was not even met in the marketplace.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. for a number of years. Americas agriculture and maritime industries have disagreed sharply over the application of U.S.-flag shipping cargo preference requirements to Governmentgenerated agricultural export programs. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 mandates that 50 percent of the cargoes owned. financed or donated by the U.S. Government must be transported on U.S.-flag vessels to the extent such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates. This act reflects recognition by Congress that a strong U.S. merchant marine and a privately owned maritime industry are vital components of our national security. As important as the maritime industry is to our economic and national security interests. so also is Americas agricultural industry. Our Nations farmers are the backbone of our economy and our standard of living. and literally serve as the leading supplier of agricultural commodities to the worlds hungry. They also are a vital component of our international export . capability. . It has become all too apparent that these two vitally important industries suffer many of the same problems. - Both try to compete against heavily subsidized foreign competition. restrictive foreign trade policies. and nontariff barrierswhile handicapped by an overvalued dollar. As one Member who believes that both industries are essential and worthy of support. I believe it is time to resolve the highly charged. controversial issue of cargo preference in a manner that benefits both industries and in a manner that is fair to both sides. It is time to clarify the scope of cargo preference and to make its application more efficient. To that end. I have offered this amendment to the farm bill. which embodies the longterm compromise worked out by representatives of the maritime and agriculture industries. These two groups worked for more than 2 months to reach an agreement which I believe will help promote American agricultural exports and strengthen the capability of the U.S. merchant marine. Mr. President. I have a list of cosponsors of this amendment. and I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the RECORD.",

Those costs could go into the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. depending upon the kind of lending credit or export PIK or BICEP or other kinds of promotional or concessional sales programs that could be administered through CCC or the Department of Agriculture. The fact of the matter is there are going to be increases in cost whether this amendment is adopted or not. There will be less increase in cost if this amendment is adopted than if it is not. So the Senator should not confuse the issue by saying this amendment is going to cost $40 to $50 million a year and suggest that if you vote for it you are voting for increased cost.

It represents very little concession on the part of those who oppose it because. as I stated. if the moneys are not available to the Secretary of Transportation in a manner similar to that made available to the Commodity Credit Corporation. made available by the Congress. then this compromise falls and the exports are not subject to the cargo preference requirement. That does not mean that those of us who support cargo preference would be quiet at that time. I might add. I would expect that future Department of Agriculture authorization and appropriations bills would have substantial problems.

The impact of what I am saying. Mr. President. is this: We saw that during the oil embargo. We lost control over tankers that were carrying oil destined for our shores. We have lost control over vessels that otherwise would have been calling on our ports to pick up our exports. And they could well include agricultural exports in the future because of disagreements in foreign policy. So it is not totally a defense policy it is a total policy of the United States. I think. that ought to be in favor of maintaining a viable merchant marine. We maintain the farm economy at considerable cost. I say to my friend from Oklahoma. I remember the PIK days.

I think we ought to have the Secretary of Defense certify they need XYZ ships and say this is an integral part of our national defense instead of being Just a big subsidy. One final point that I think is important to make. The Senator mentioned the PIK Program and that the cost of the PIK Program ballooned up to $18 billion. One problem in the PIK Program is that we did not have a limitation. I regret that we were not able to put language in that would put a limitation on what anybody could receive under PIK. We should have had a limitation of $50.000. We had some who receive millions of dollars. That is the same thing we have with cargo preference. We have a handful of the companies that makes $7. $8. $9. $10 29436 Co million a year in cargo preference subsidies today and if this amendment goes through. you can increase those numbers substantially. Perhaps we ought to have a perfecting amendment and if this amendment passes. perhaps we should look at some limitations on Individual companies. possibly limitations on what they might be able to receive from Uncle Sam.

Our Heavenly Father. 120 years have passed since the guns fell silent at Appomattox. It was altogether fitting that they did so. In a place devoted to the cause of law. For You gave us. Father. the power to birth this Nation. and endow it with law for personal freedom. justice. and liberty. We came so close then. in our civil division. that we nearly destroyed it. Little did we know. scarcely did we realize. that America would once again stand upon the brink. not just of national dismemberment. but within a world family that chose to approach the brink of nuclear extinction. Some would approach this brink by disarmament alone. letting history take the consequences. Others would approach that brink only with sheer superiority of arms. Still others would approach that brink by equity of measurable strength. None would however. cease to approach the brink. And so the brink came. Our prayer. Father. is for those who labor for peace in this room. We ask a threefold blessing and our own anthem of resolve: Give them a sense of their dignity as lawmakers. The purpose of law is Justice. Justice seeks no confrontation. Thus no one is threatened. Bless them with a clarity of vision for truth alone. In it there is nothing to fear. and relieves that narrowness of mind that is partisan. greedy. and selfish. Grant them courage to work only for the freedom of each human being. his right to have it. and the liberty to express it. If You grant this blessing. then the peace and serenity of Appomattox will endure. and the vindication of these lawmakers will lie not in knowing they were right. but in the fruits of peace obtained for another generation and an age as yet unborn. To this purpose. let them resolutely dedicate themselves once more to pledge their lives. their fortunes. and their sacred honor. This time. they dare not fail. Father. this is our prayer. May there be peace in this land. Make us a people of peace. Let it begin with me. Amen.",

Throughout its life. both before its formal founding and since. Hampton has played numerous important and historic roles. In 1609. it was the site of Americas first outpost. Fort Monroe. It was the site of Americas first trading company. the first Anglican parish. the first free school. and it was the first community in which an organized effort was made to teach blacks. Hampton has long been a city vital to our national defense. It was in this community that the British and Americans first engaged one another in Virginia during the Revolutionary War. The first planned land battle of the Civil War took place in Hampton. The Civil War ironclads. the Monitor and the Merrimack. first clashed near Hampton. President Theodore Roosevelts great white fleet called Hampton its home port. and today Hampton is the testing ground for the Navys modem day submarines. and headquarters for the Armys Training and Doctrine Command and the Air Forces Tactical Aviation Command. Throughout much of its life. Hampton has been referred to as first from the sea. because of the landing in 1607 of the ship Godspeed. at what would later become Hampton and because Hampton served as the headquarters to the first Virginia Navy and the first shipyard in America. But Hampton was also the first to the stars. by being the first home for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. now known as NASA. home to the first seven Mercury astronauts and the central training site for all subsequent astronauts. including the Apollo crew members who walked on the Moon. and todays space shuttle astronauts. To commemorate the citys 375th anniversary. Hamptons citizens are planning numerous events including a visit by the Godspeed during its reenactment voyage. This is indeed a momentous occasion for the people of Hampton and for all Americans as well. The Senator from Virginia and others extend to these citizens our best wishes.

I represent the First Congressional District of Oregona diverse area stretching from the high technology corridors of Portland to the high production farms of the Willamette Valley and the Oregon coast. Oregonians know that sustained economic recovery depends on economic diversification. And something more. Longterm recovery means that while we work to promote new industry. weve also got to work to protect our rich natural resource base. Thats why in my testimony to the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this year. I asked that the committee reject administration plans for deep cuts in a number of important agriculture programs. Im pleased to see that the committee said \"no\" to the White House. and provided adequate funds for Cooperative Extension. Soil Conservation. Agri. cultural Research and Cooperator Export Promotion Programs. Passage of this bill is a first step toward assuring that the Soil Conservation Service wont have to implement plans to lay off 24 employees in Oregon. that wheat exporters can continue using the Cooperator Progam to increase sales to the Pacific rimand reverse a 50percent drop in overseas sales of Pacific Northwest White Wheat. The bill will also assure that the 4H. Nutrition and Education Programs run by the Cooperative Extension Program can be used to better prepare the coming generation of farmers for the new challenges ahead. This bill also provides funds to met the soil erosion problems of Oregon nurserymen. the fastest growing agriculture industry in the State. It will allow the Oregon Soil Conservation Service to continue an innovative Animal Waste and Water Quality Program in Tillamook. OR. and ensure that the ASCS has the funds it needs to implement Federal farm pro. grams in a timely fashion. Oregon agriculture is a $5.4 billion industry Unfortunately. this legislation wont solve the problems of oversupply and shrinking foreign markets now pressing Oregon growers. But it gives us the tools we need to make wise decisions about solving these problems in the future.",

This bill lists 1986 budget authority at 49 and 1987 at 41. $7.4 billion of additional budget authority would be required to create a freeze. I have no interest in adding expense. Nevertheless. I have little confidence that H.R. 5177 will save any money. On the contrary. major entitlements seem to be seriously underfunded. The committees normal procedure is to underfund mandatory spending and then meet obligations by passing a supplemental appropriation next year. Supplementals may have become a way of life for the committee. but to me they are a wretched way to appropriate. The Commodity Credit Corporation for instance seems to be seriously underfunded to the tune of more than $2 billion. Although the bill is supposed to be $7.4 billion less in budget authority than last year. but if CCC appropriations were the same as last year. H.R. 5177 would be larger than last year. The Food Stamp Program is funded at a level less than last year. as are all nutrition services. More billions may be required in a supplemental here. My preference would be for realistic estimates of actual spending rates. so that Congress would know what to expect. For the reasons noted I have little confidence in this bill. I shall vote against it not because I question the spending levels. but because I do not believe H.R. 5177 represents realistic budgeting procedures.",

Last year in the fiscal year 1985 supplemental we had 341 Senate amendments. In the recent supplemental bill. they added 224 amendments. If we go to conference having limited ourselves to the Senate provision. there is no need to go to conference. If we are going to tie our hands.

Second. all of that positive development with respect to economic conditions notwithstanding. there is no evidence whatsoever that those constructive economic changes which have occurred within those few firms involving those few workers have had the least impact upon political liberalization. In fact. at the very same time we have seen the process of industrialization continued and extended. at the very same time we have had Sullivan Code companies that attempt to enforce workplace conditions that obviously are progressive and make sense. we have seen intensified repression and a growing commitm. nt on the part of the Afrikaners to resist any fundamental change. My con...rn is that we not mistake economic and social changes occurring within the workplace situation as somehow leading to the kind of inevitable process toward elimination of apartheid.",

Newfoundland. which took the lives of 250 members of the 101st Airborne Division. including 2 young soldiers from my State of Mississippi. is being felt by families throughout the Nation. This increase in insurance benefits would not replace the departed loved ones. but could help provide for those families now facing an uncertain future. Each and every day. American soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines risk their lives for their country. Major tragedies such as the Gander crash and the Beirut bombing focus our at. tention. but there are lives lost by service men and women almost daily which do not receive the Nations attention. The loss of the surviving families. however. is just as real. On August 19. 1981. two Navy F14s from the U.S.S. Nimitz were attacked and subsequently shot down two Libyan fighters. The F14 squadron commander and lead pilot was Comdr. Hank Kleeman. A 1965 Naval Academy graduate. he had served his country wherever he was needed. and when called upon this August night. he did not hesitate.

Hank Kleeman was killed in an aircraft accident.

Delivered on November 21. 1985. in Brussels. it reviews the potential economic benefits to Europe of participation in the strategic defense initiative. I. myself. as most of us in this body. have concentrated primarily on strategic military and political reasons for SDI. This address adds an important new dimension to discussions of the benefits of research into strategic defense technologies. While his arguments are meant to apply to Europe. they are very relevant to the U.S. economy. A Chase Econometrics study in 1976 made the following estimates on the economic impact of the U.S. space programs: For every billion dollars invested in space research and exploration. the American gross national product increased by $23 billion. more than 800.000 new jobs were created. and the money multiplier effect was between three and eight. Extrapolating on the technology development resulting from NASA space programs. Mr. Agnelli forecasts major technological benefits to the economy from SDI. Primary economic benefits derive directly from the transfer of SDI technology into the industrial base. Mr. Agnelli gives likely examples from across the spectrum of the SDI research program. One from the directed energy area is adaptive optics in the mirror systems used to focus lasers and compensate for atmospheric distortion. This technology can be used in industry to control lasers as cutting tools. to permit the use of lasers for longdistance communications. and to develop microscopic imaging systems for the design and inspection of microelectronic circuitry and other miniaturized components. Secondary benefits result from activities needed to implement the results of basic SDI research and could be even greater than the primary ones. They derive from the necessary space infrastructure which would support largescale industrial development in space. Finally the tertiary benefits accrue. There are alloys. composites. and crystals which can only be manufactured in microgravity. There are pharmaceuticals which can be produced in purities and quantities required only in space. As an indicator of the magrtude of potential benefits. Mr. Agnelli refers to studies estimating revenues for satellite communications alone in the range of $50 to $100 billion annually. with growth rates of 20 to 40 percent. I hope my colleagues will look carefully at the reasoning and examples that Mr. Agnelli uses. They will be very relevant during the review of the 1987 SDI funding requests.",

The Washington Post reported today that the U.S. will confront the Soviets w\"tli their treaty violations next Monday in Geneva. In particular the Post stated that Secretary of State Shultz would charge the Soviets with constructing a new large radar in violation of the SALT I AntiBallistic Missile Treaty. and encrypting the electronic telemetry from missile tests in violation of the SALT II Treaty. These are illustrative and conclusive cases from a list of 21 Presidentially confirmed violations. I agree with your statement that \"compliance with arms control agreements is fundamental to he arms control process.\" I thereure hope that the reports are true. and that you will instruct Secretary Shultz to give the Soviet Foreign Minister a chance to demonstrate Soviet good faith by deedsstopping at least these two conclusive violations. I believe that the Soviets should be given this opportunity to demonstrate their sincerity. good faith. and reciprocal interest in equitable arms control. I hope that they respond favorably. I believe that frank and open discussion of these issues with the Soviets will immeasurably strengthen the publics confidence in the security benefits of arms control treaties by restoring full Soviet compliance. With warmest personal regards. Sincerely.",

Morever. sea trials for the seventh trident submarine are not scheduled to begin until late 1985. I.e.. during FY 1988.

The U.S. will careully evaluate both the International situa. ion and our own national security requirenents in reaching such a decision. Question. Is it true that the U.S. Is considering revoking its \"no undercut\" policy for SALT II? Answer. The Presidents policy on interim restraint has not changed. We are continung to implement this policy with respect to he SALT interim agreement and the unatified SALT II agreement. and we are proTATE February 25. 1985 ceeding to implement the Presidents strate. s. gic modernization program.

The issues - this event raises regarding the SALT I and SALT II agreements will be addressed at the appropriate time.

The chief purpose is to discuss and promote an understanding of the twoparty system of government in the United States. Since 1966. 17 Taft Institute of Government Seminars have been held in my State of Tennessee. I participate in three of themin 1973. 1974. and 1975when I was State Democratic Party chairman. Similar sessions have enriched the understanding and knowledge of more than 12.000 teachers in all 50 States. In Just 1 year. 12.000 teachers can affect the lives of 2 million students. The real guarding of our free system of government are our strong. competitive two parties. Each party tries to gain or maintain power by offering the best solution to the problems confronting the country. The checks and balances of our twoparty system are to be valued. The realities of this system just cant be captured in the textbook. This traditional training is compliL mented by the opportunity to meet with practical politicanssuch as law. makers from every level of government. lobbyists. the mayor. the local newspaper publisher. the Chairs of the two State parties. and community activists. The Taft Institute provides the setting for these meetings. I am a cosponsor of S. 434. legislation to reauthorize the Robert A. Taft Institute for Two Party Government for the years 1986 through 1988. The Institute was founded in 1961 as a tribute to the late Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was dedicated to the principle that each citizen should have the opportunity to contribute to government and politics. The money provided is matched by money from private contributions. This funding has enriched the educational experience of thousands teachers who then have shared what they have learned with millions of students throughout the country. I am pleased to state my support for this worthwhile program to improve education..",

    "speech": "Mr. President. recent discussions I have had about agricultural issues have made it apparent to me that many people are not fully aware of the tremendous difficulties farmers face in trying to export their commodities. The world market presents several challenges which make it harder than it was a few years ago for our farmers to compete with those in other countries. The Soviet grain embargo shattered confidence in the reliability of the United States as a food supplier. The global recession crimped the purchases of many of our best customers. High interest rates hurt farmers directly by substantially increasing their debt servicing costs and also indirectly by compounding the economic difficulties of heavily leveraged Third World agricultural customers. To cap it all off. the value of the dollar has risen some 30 to 40 percent against major world currencies. This has resulted in price increases (in local currency) to countries that buy from us even while our own farmers have been faced with generally declining prices. In some instance. U.S. price support levels have now become higher than prices in other countries. Thus. U.S. grains often sit in Government controlled storage while other countries sell to export markets at prices lower than our exporters can offer. As a consequence. our current Government farm programs may be providing far more benefits to farmers in other exporting countries than the programs provide to farmers here in the United States. To illustrate the problems our farmers face. I ask that an article from the Journal of Commerce of January 24. 1985. be printed in the RECORD.",

All of which makes Congress and DOD sensitive to cost overruns. However. this past year a military program reached fruition under cost. on sched. ule. and without fanfare. I believe this program could easily be described as the single greatest enhancement to combat readiness in recent yearsthe M16A2. combat rifle for our infantrymen. The M16A2 program Is a textbook success story from the standpoint of identifying the requirement and executing a program at minimal cost. In 1979 the Marine Corps saw the need to commence a program that would ultimately lead to the production of a new service rifle. replacing the aged M16AI. The significance of this program lies in the fact that the real users of the weapon executed the program. Although the program fell under the administrative parameters of the Joint Services Small Arms Program. the U.S. Marine Corps took the lead with support from Army personnel during the operational tests and evaluations. The close cooperation between the Marine Corps. Army. and Colt Industries allowed the military to design. test. make changes. and test again until the final product was approved for service use by both the Army and the Marine Corps. The importance of this program lies in the fact that there Is only one single weapon capable of seizing and holding key terrain and that Is the soldier or marine armed with his rifle. I would like to recognize with all our service men and women those key individuals of this highly important and successful program: Lt. Col. Charles Pyle. USMC. Lt. Col. David Lutz. USMC. Maj. Michael Smith. USMC. CWO Bruce Wincentsen. USMC. G. Sgt. Edwin Martin. USMC. S. Sgt. Philip Stover. USMC. Of course there were many other dedicated soldiers. marines. and loyal. hard working civilians at Colt Industries that made this program a success. These individuals demonstrated selfless devotion to a Job that was paramount to safeguarding our Nations defense by developing the finest combat rifle for our soldiers and marines..",

Northeastern University was founded in 1898 with the guiding principle that the opportunity to acquire quality higher education should be available to all who desire it. As an extension of this basic philosophy. the cooperative education program was formed in 1909. Since a significant portion of its student body was unable to devote their time to fulltime study. the \"earn while you learn\" concept was developed in an effort to serve their special needs. Over the years. Northeastern University has grown to become one of the leading institutions in the world offering cooperative education. each year placing approximately 9.500 students with over 2.700 employers. The tremendous success of the program has led to the expansion of cooperative education to include a number of graduate and professional curricula as well as programs in University College. I am honored to have this opportunity to congratulate Northeastern University on the 75th anniversary of cooperative education. and do wish them continued success and good fortune in the provision of an exceptional educational experience to those who desire it in the years to come.e",

Mr. Chairman. I have no intention of offering an amendment at this time or unnecessarily prolonging debate on an issue that we all know very well.

This provision is discriminatory on the basis of sex. It intrudes into private decisionmaking on the part of these women. It is a tremendous burden potentially to the average middleincome person who works for the Federal Government. pays 40 percent of their health care costs out of their own pocket. and is deprived of the full use of their total compensation for the health care that they derive as part of their benefits as an employee of the Federal Government.

It would seem as though we have abandoned the single most important goal for which we were sent to Congress last November. The deficit is out of control. This continued irresponsible spending is swiftly and tirelessly rotting the fabric of the American economy. Yet we have gone beyond losing our selfcontrol. Congress even seems to be willing to abuse its legislative powers and flaunt the very laws under which it operates in order to break all previous records for budget deficits. A day rarely goes by when we do not pass a rule waiving points of order against the illegal appropriation of funds in the absence of a budget. If the laws of this land cannot restrain our spending. I ask you: What sort of coercion will ever produce a balanced budget? On Tuesday. the House passed the Water Quality Renewal Act. which contained an appropriation 77 percent above last years levels in defiance of our commitment to reduce the deficit. The bill also contained $2 million needed for sewage treatment in Naco. AZ. a town in my district. I am committed to helping my constituents in Arizona. but their primary concern is for a balanced budget. and so I voted against the act. I could not justify impaling our efforts to balance the budget in order to win this funding for my district. Were all on a train heading full steam over a cliff. And Im ashamed of the passengers on the train who are unwilling to cast aside a little of their personal baggage. their pet projects. in order to stop the train and reverse its perilous course. Will we be able to tell our children that we have done everything in our power to protect their future if none of us is willing to make a sacrifice to build our economy on solid ground?",

MI. as it celebrates its centennial anniversary on September 6. 1986. The company had its beginnings 100 years ago as the Grand Rapids School Furniture Co.. founded by Gaius Perkins. who was at that time the president of the Grand Rapids School Board. Concerned about the comfort of the public seating in schools. the company made its start with school desks and chairs. By 1888. the Grand Rapids School Furniture Co. had multiplied sevenfold employing 350 workers. and by 1892 it ranked as the top seating manufacturer in the world. By 1899. the company merged with 18 of the largest manufacturers of seating in the United States and was renamed the American Furniture Co. A consolidation in 1920 resulted in changing the company name to the American Seating Co. Most recently. American Seating has concentrated its efforts on its rapid expansion in the office furniture business. and is now a leading supplier of interior systems furniture for the office and technical markets. Over the past century American Seating has experienced tremendous growth. and has created employment opportunities for a great number of people. In 1886. the company employed approximately 50 workers in the Grand Rapids area. and today it employs over a thousand people distributed over most of the 50 States. Canada. and other foreign countries. The philosophy of the American Seating Co. was developed in 1920. and is still valid today. Superiority in products and in service. absolute dependability in every article sold and in every statement made in selling it: these are the foundations on which American Seating is built... The highest loyalty of every member of the organization lies in faithfully guarding these foundations. American Seating is a company which has developed a reputation for serving its customers. shareholders. and employees with high commitment. Mr. Speaker. and colleagues. I ask you to join with me in congratulating the American Seating Co. for its success over the past 100 years. and in wishing them another 100 years of good fortune.",

In a country where people often forget about helping others. it is important to recognize those who risk their lives for the safety and health of others. I. therefore. would like to commend Mr. Malicki for his brave and courageous actions. Mr. Malicki. a resident of my district. exhibited true bravery by rescuing two people involved in a potentially explosive car and truck collision. After sighting the collision and recognizing the emergency. Mr. Malicki used proper judgment and awareness in rescuing a truck driver. who was trapped inside his vehicle. after the truck collided with the car and proceeded to careen into an electric pole. Mr. Malicki then went to the second vehicle and decided to not make any attempt to remove a woman from her car fearing any action might result in additional injuries to the driver. Instead. he quickly removed the battery cables in order to eliminate a possible electrical short which might result in an ignition spark. Hollywood Fire Rescue arrived and removed the victim from the vehicle. Hollywood Fire Chief Jim Ward praised Malicki for acting with intelligence and sensitivity. Mr. Ward also said that: A hero isnt someone who happens to be at the right place at the right time. A hero is someone who performs an act of courage by doing the right thing at the right time. I feel Mr. Malicki deserves special recognition for his actions. The quick. clear. and precise actions taken by Walter Malicki are exceptional.

We are all fully aware that this country is facing a crisis with out trade imbalance and it is clear that action must be taken to reduce this damaging deficit. The uncertainty arises over what should be done in order to reduce this imbalance. I do not believe that H.R. 1562 is the answer. I believe that this bill is a shortterm measure that would invite retaliation from our trading partners. I believe that an aggressive approach is needed on the part of the U.S. Government to enforce Americas rights under the existing and future trade agreements. The recent textile trade agreements between the United States. Hong Kong and Taiwan and the renegotiation of the MultiFiber Arrangement in Geneva. Switzerland. represent an opportunity for the administration to start over with a clean slate. If the provisions in these agreements are strictly enforced by the administration. then I believe that we can get the trade deficit under control. Agreements are only as good as their enforcement. Those of us who are voting to sustain the Presidents veto of H.R. 1562 are doing so with the hopes that these new agreements will be strictly enforced. It is my belief that the trade imbalance. if not corrected. could be the Achilles heel with regard to our economic future and manufacturing capability.

Once again American citizens are in danger because of the act of mindless terrorists and In fact the sloppiness of airport security within another nation. I will be presenting to my colleagues today a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to join with me in antihijacking amendments. Under this new bill the Secretary of the Department of Transportation would be directed to immediately suspend all U.S. airlines from landing in a nation where a hijacking has taken place and to close direct travel from said nation to this Nation. If security Is not improved within 48 hours. the Secretary of the Department of Transportation. in consultation with the Secretary of State. would prohibit all foreign commercial airlines which have stops in said nation from landing in the United States.

My interest in this comes from the fact that there is almost a years time between foreclosure and resale on those homes. Additionally. there is a $10.000 loss to the Federal Government on each foreclosure. When you consider there are presently 30.000 of these homes. the lost revenue becomes significant. Essentially. my legislation would provide a substantial discount on the price of a home for the veteran. first time home buyer. If the home has remained idle for 3 to 6 months. a 20percent discount would be provided. 7 to 12 months. a 25percent discount. over 1 year. a 30percent discount. I strongly believe that rapidly reselling these homes at discounts would increase the flow of cash to the loan guaranty fund and diminish the need for the Congress to appropriate funds. while also reducing the need for an increase in the loan origination fee.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. during the 98th Congress. this body passed legislation creating the Martin Luther King. Jr. Federal Holiday Commission. The charge of this Commission is to advise and encourage appropriate activities for our countrys first national holiday commemorating the birthday of Martin Luther King. Jr. on January 20. 1986. As one of four Members of the House appointed to this Commission. I would like to take this opportunity to report to my colleagues on the progress of this Commission. Mrs. Coretta King and Hon. James Thompson. Governor of the State of IllILois serve as chair and vicechair respectively. The 31 commissioners are representatives from government. business. religious. labor. and entertainment. and their diversity reflects this bodys commitment to encourage Americans from all walks of life to join in this celebration. The Commission has set forth a plan of action which is intended to facilitate its task of uniting the Nation in this commemoration of Dr. Kings life and work for civil rights. We intend to promote activities in education. among youth. through the various forms of media. and a variety of other events at the State and local level. Recently. the Commission established \"Living the Dream\" as the theme for the 1986 holiday. In selecting this theme. the Commission desires that all Americans celebrate on January 20. 1986 and continue after that day to reaffirm their commitment to the ideals of freedom. Justice. and opportunity for all. As cochairman of the legislative committee. it is my task to encourage each of the 50 States and the U.S. territories to enact State holidays in conJunction with the Federal holiday. Another committee is calling upon State Governors to create State holiday commissions which would plan celebrations in the States. Today. I am calling on each of you. as you travel to your home districts. to encourage your States to enact such holidays and then to take part in State holiday celebration activities. Let us Join together in making the first celebration of the Martin Luther King. Jr. holiday a success.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. trade deficit was $30 billion in the first quarter of 1985. Following last years $101 billion deficit. the United States has been transformed into a debtor nation. In 2 years. the United States has frittered away our position as the worlds largest creditor nation. By the end of 1985. we will be the largest debtor nation in the world. substantially exceeding Brazil and Mexico. The effect of this trade deficit on the U.S. manufacuring sector has been devastating. The overvalued dollar means that producers and workers now face the equivalent of a 40percent tax on their exports and must compete with a 40percent subsidy on foreign goods and services sold to Americans. No industry is being spared. including our once dominant computer industry. as illustrated by the recent layoff by Apple Computer of 25 percent of its employees. This problem cannot be blamed on anyone else. It is caused by our failure to balance the Federal budget. My hope is that with or without the Presidents leadership. the Congress will take the initiative and enact a significant deficit reduction this year.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am introducing legislation today designed to provide mid- and latecareer professionals who already possess backgrounds in math and science with the training to become classroom teachers. With the shortage of math and science teachers and an expected 25 percent drop over the next dozen years in the number of 18 to 25 year olds. I believe we must look to nontraditional sources for our teachers. The MidCareer Math and Science Teacher Program uses mid- to latecareer professionals with an interest in teaching to improve education at the precollegiate level. The program provides teacher training to individuals with an educational background and experience in math and science. The Harvard Graduate School of Education developed this innovative approach to teaching. They have been astounded at the number of applicants. Many potential participants are eligible for early retirement or voluntary severance plans. Depending on the industry and the employees status. good pension plans are available. For many individuals in the midto latecareer category. the two most significant financial expenses of their careersmortgage payments and college tuitionsare well behind them. With potential tax advantages and changing financial requirements. a new career in teaching may not be as economically constraining for a midcareer professional as it would be for a young college graduate. Teaching also enables many of these professionals an opportunity to servea way to fulfill a dream. My legislation would create a 2year pilot project geared to encourage growth in finding teachers from nontraditional sources. One institution would be chosen from each of the 10 Federal regions based upon competitive application. The programs are intended to assist the mid- to latecareer professional in changing to the teaching profession. Participants would need a degree and job experience in mathematics or science or both. The institution would be directed to design a program which includes a screening mechanism to choose individuals who would be likely to succeed as classroom teachers. The active participation of qualified classroom teachers would be required as well as followup assistance. Upon completion of the intensive study. individuals would be certified teachers. This program would provide desperately needed teachers who would present a new perspective to the precollegiate level of math and science. i urge my colleagues to cospopsor this innovative approach to education. Please join me in encouraging this novel and worthwhile approach.",

The terrorists have separated Americans with Jewishsounding names from the other passengers. just as. at Entebbe years ago. a German woman bearing a submachine gun separated nonJewish hijacking victims from Jewish ones a few of whom still bore the 30yearold tatoo marks of the concentration camps. The hoctages in Beirut are now in the hands of a Muslim militia leader who is fiercely opposed to any Israeli influence in Lebanon. but who never attacks the Syrian troops who hold so much of that country. Finally. the condition for the release of the Americans is the Israeli release of their Shiite prisoners. Once again. Mr. Speaker. we have a terrorist attack aimed at the United StatesIsraeli bond. This linksentimental. moral. financial. political. militaryhas been the avowed target of scores of major terrorist attacks all over the world in the last two decades.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as you are well aware. we are now well into day five of the odyssey involving TWA flight 847. As I speak. more than 40 innocent American tourists continue to be held hostage by Shiite Moslem fanatics in Beirut. The pictures of this unfolding drama which we have seen on our television screens provoke feelings of fear. frustration. humiliation and perhaps most of all. anger. Since the State Department began keeping statistics in 1968. there have been many thousands of international terrorist incidents. And. unfvrtunately. American citizens and U.S. interests remain a primary target of many of these violent attacks. Today. I intend to reintroduce legislationwhich I first introduced 7 years ago when I chaired the Subcommittee on Aviationto help protect Americans traveling abroad. My bill requires the President to compile a list of countries which actively support international terrorism and to impose specified sanctions against such countries. These sanctions include the elimination of assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. other than international disaster assistance. and refusal to sell any defense articles or services. or to extend any credit. under the Arms Export Control Act. The bill also requires the Secretary of Transportation to assess security measures at foreign airports. If these airports do not meet internationally established standards. the Secretary must give notice to the traveling public and the Secretary is authorized. with the approval of the Secretary of State. to revoke the operating authority of United States and foreign air carriers which use the foreign airport to provide air service to the United States. Further. the bill sets criminal penalties of up to $10.000 in fines and 20 years in prison. or both. for the hiJacking of an aircraft. Another provision of the bill requires the tagging of carsensitive explosives with a material which can be detected prior to detonation and which would allow identification of the source of the explosive following detonation. Although there is no single solution or answer to deal with this difficult and deadly problem. I think my bill will help protect millions of innocent Americans who travel through airports at home and especially abroad.",

They are totally innocent. They are as innocent as any group of hostages ever has been and their safety has to be our first goal. Everything we do should be focused on their safety. I want to point out some of the unfinished business that we left behind after Iran. Earlier this year I introduced a hostage relief bill at the request of the hostage families from the Iranian era. People are not aware of the fact that they never got any remuneration for the fact that they were kept for over 400 days. Our Government never reimbursed them. Second. I think many people are not aware of the fact that this Government held to the Algiers agreement which prevented our hostages or their family from being able to sue the Iranian Government for damages after the incident had occurred. So they were absolutely shut out from pursuing any suits against Iran in international courts. although most people felt they would have had a very good case since this was clearly statesupported terrorism. What has happened in these awful hostage situations is that when they are over we are so relieved they are over that we never go back and think what we can do to prevent future instance. I hope we learn from that. I hope we finally pay the debt owed to the people who are in Iran and move forward to do everything we can in working with other countries to try and prevent the type of circumstances that would ever allow this type of thing to happen again.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise this morning to share with this Congress my pride in a Hoosier profile in courage. One of the hostages on the hijacked TWA flight 847 was Clinton Suggs. a young man from my district who is now stationed at Norfolk with the U.S. Navy. He was on the underwater construction team with young Robert Stetham who was brutally beaten and murdered by the hijackers. Because he is a military man. he was singled out to be the next to die. A sudden turn of events that diverted the hijackers attention and the inter. vention of a flight stewardess saved Clintons life. None of us will ever really know the thoughts racing through his mind as he prepared to follow his close personal friend and fellow seaman. Robby Stetham. But we do know this. He faced that moment with a square jaw and guts and grace. And what I find even more inspiring Is that he came out of this ordeal more committed than ever to serving and defending America. I can only speculate that In those fleeting moments when he prepared to die. he realized freedom sometimes requires that kind of awful sacrifice because It Is the most precious of our commodities. both as individuals and as a nation. Mr. Speaker. most of us go about our daily business taking that freedom for granted. My guess is that Clinton will never take it for granted again. and I think we should follow his example. With America now the direct victim of 40 percent of the terrorist attacks around the world. we must remember that freedom isnt something that is ours just because we won It 209 years ago. Freedom. because Its so precious. is something we will have to defend for as long as we want to keep It. On Saturday. Clinton Suggs is coming home to Elkhart. IN. for a reunion with his family and for a parade through his hometown. We in Indiana are proud of our young native son. and we feel secure that our future and our countrys defense are In the firm. unwavering hands of Clinton and others like him. I ask this Congress to join me in saying to Clinton Suggs. we salute your courage in a moment of terror. and we are very glad that you regained your freedom without having to die for it.

As a matter of fact. if you take a longterm view. jobs for our children. our economy is In grave difficulty.

One thing that is within our power Is to lower the deficit. and so I rise this morning to add my small voice to those who are asking the con. ferees on the budget to take some meaningful cuts. and I will give three examples: Why not take the lowest of the de. fense figures? The lowest of the defense figures would still allow us an alltime large contribution to national defense. Why not take a cut from the entitlement programs that will not cut any checks but would stop the COLAs for a year? Or for a percent or two for a period of time.

I think the strongest voice in America for real pay equity. equal pay for equal work. has been the working women of America. who have said. \"we will do our job. we do do our Job and ask tc be paid the same for that job as anyone else.\" These women have made enormous progress pursuing true pay equity. equal pay for equal work. Today. people pretty well accept that we have eliminated unequal pay for equal work. but now we have a new voice emerging. asking for something different: A new concept of pay equity. \"equal pay for unequal work.\" is now the cry. \"We want to be paid extra even though we do not do the extra work.\" We want a woman who is working in an office. in airconditioned comfort. to be paid more. for example. to have her pay raised In comparison with a woman such as the one I saw working In Dallas last week. moving steel and working hard in the hot Sun. Because there are 70 percent of the people employed in the office that are women and less than 70 percent working out In the hot Sun. somehow it is going to be deemed that it should be a fair thing that we freeze the wages of those people working in the hot Sun moving heavy metal and instead raise the wages of those who have made the voluntary free choice to work instead in a comfortable. airconditioned office under ideal working conditions.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. after several anxious months for more than 7.000 loyal workers and retirees. the AllisChalmers Corp.. formally asked the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for authority to terminate its pension plan. AllisChalmers. a firm which has had financial problems for several years. has an unfunded pension liability of nearly $170 million. This liability is now turned over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGCJ. a Federal entity which guarantees private pension funds. Fortunately. Congress had the wisdom 10 years ago when it passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA] to guarantee pension benefits. and to protect workers from the tendency of corporate America to disregard contracts entered into with workerscontracts which guarantee the future income and wellbeing of these Individuals and their families. We have seen this happen all too often. Thanks to the existence of the PBGC. most of the pension benefits of AllisChalmers retireesmany of whom reside in Wisconsins Fourth Congressional Districtwill be guaranteed. Still. the PBGC faces a serious problem. They are \"inheriting\" a potential unfunded pension liability of $170 million. by far the largest pension plan termination they have ever faced. Whats more. this \"inheritance\" will bring total unfunded liabilities for the PBGC to nearly $900 million. In essence. the problem has been shifted from one financially troubled Institution to another. About 29 million American workers are covered by the PBGC and will rely on it should their pension benefit plans fold. It is incumbent upon the Congress to take steps to insure the solvency of this guaranty corporation. It should be noted that the Presidents budget request. as well as both the House and Senate budget resolutions. assume a premium increase for PBGC from the current level of $2.60 per participant per year. to a more reasonable level of $7.50. This premium level is the minimum necessary to eliminate the current deficit faced by PBGC over a reasonable period of time and to finance future expected claims. Congressman CLAY and Congresswoman ROUKEMA have introduced several bills which would not only raise the premium level but also institute muchneeded reform in plan termination procedures to prevent \"dumping\" of the unfunded liabilities on the Federal Government. This type of corporate welfare must cease. For the future of American workers. I urge my colleagues to take swift action on the ClayRoukema bills.",

I am speaking of the concept of comparable worth. Proponents of this concept contend that intervention in the marketplace is necessary to eliminate sexual job discrimination. The intent. social equality. is good. the result. however. will be the institutionalization of jobs classified according to sex. To me. labeling a particular job as \"female\" or \"male\" is the most sexist action I can conceive of. If people are dissatisfied with the existing world of employment. why would they want to freeze the system in its present form? Anyone who has lived for more than a decade can easily see that job categories change as society changes. Statistics show that women are entering into Jobs that were traditionally held by men and this trend will continue. By allowing men and women to exercise the freedom to chose their type of employment without regard to the sexual classification of the Job. the lines between male and female Jobs will fade away. This is progress. If comparable worth legislation were implemented and enforced. proponents will find that they may win the battle but lose the war. Such action will only relegate women to traditional roles and deny them the opportunities to move into employment fields that were once almost totally dominated by men. Mr. Speaker.

It is well known that the district courts have been the bulwark in defending the rights of the disabled in the face of administration efforts to remove them wholesale and without benefit of judicial protections guaranteed by our Bill of Rights. Before it advances very far we should serve notice that there will be no tampering with the independent juFSE 4199 diciary. and this Congress will not establish a rubberstamp court to ride roughshod over defenseless persons who have become disabled. and are only trying to collect the benefits for which they are eligible. because theyve paid into the system.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today the President will informally notify us on Capitol Hill that he proposes to sell $350 million of arms to Saudi Arabia. Mr. President. that sale is a mistake and would reward the Saudis for their behavior inimical to the U.S. interests. Saudi Arabia has not met the fundamental conditions for arms sales laid out by the administration during the debate over AWACs in 1981. They have not recognized Israel. they have not worked toward a peaceful solution to the problems that plague the Middle East. they have actively undermined American efforts in Lebanon. Mr. Speaker. the Saudis are the Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde of the Middle East. When they face America. they talk peace. when they are back in the Middle East. they create trouble. To reward them with the sale of $350 million of very sophisticated arms would make no sense. from a foreign policy point of view. In addition. one of the proposed arms sales is for Stinger antiaircraft missiles. If any of those missiles should fall into the hands of a terrorist. literally hundreds of innocent people could die because these Stingers can shoot down civilians as well as military aircraft. They can be concealed and are simply like a bazooka. they can be launched from a hand holder. So for another reason. the safety of all who travel abroad. as well as foreign policy considerations. the Saudis intransigence against peace in the Middle East. I urge that the sale be rejected by this House.",

And yet did you know that there is no law in the United States that would permit us to prosecute and bring to justice any one of those terrorists should we be able to get extradition or otherwise bring them under the jurisdiction of the United States? Therefore. many of us have introduced legislation that would do exactly that. confer jurisdiction upon our courts to deal with terrorists who would kill American citizens abroad. But there is an anomaly. In most of the legislation. the penalty that is provided for falls short of the ultimate. I have proposed and now the Subcommittee on Crime in the Judiciary Committee has accepted an amendment that I offered that would impose the death penalty in proper cases for terrorists who would kill innocent Americans abroad. and I am glad to see that the public report of the Vice Presidents Task Force on Combating Terrorism recommends exactly that. There is no excuse for the U.S. Government not going to the fullest extend to end the threat of terrorism worldwide. and we should begin at home. in our courts. by allowing the imposition of the death penality in those serious cases. especially when innocent people are killed abroad.",

As a result. many local community development projects. initiated on the reasonable assumption that cities would receive all CDBG funds appropriated by Congress. have been stopped in their tracks. Unlike other budget reductions. which are effective only when Congress acts. a deferral is effective when the President requests it. The effect of this arbitrary action is both immediate and direct. Local housing rehabilitation and economic development activities funded by CDBG now face sharp. unanticipated fund reductions. Months of hard work and planning by local officials are rendered meaningless. This may be what the President desires. I do not believe it is what the American people and their elected representatives desire.

This is a modest measure which would not increase the authorizations for the Emergency Relief Program. but would merely increase to $100 million from $30 million the amount which can be made available to any State in connection with a single disaster in 1986. As such it reflects the continuing congressional policy of keeping the program up to date in terms of the needs placed upon it. In the same vein. we have extended eligibility for assistance under the program to the territories. with a maximum collective annual cap of $5 million for emergency relief to the Virgin Islands. Guam. American Samoa. and the Commonwealth of Northern Marlana Islands. This provision has long been urged by the delegates from the territories and we agree that it has merit. Another provision would simply increase to $40 million from $30 million the annual level of funding for small flood control projects undertaken by the Corps of Engineers. at a maximum cost of $4 million each. without specific congressional authorization. Mr. Speaker. I mentioned that we attempt to keep this program abreast of needs. In fact. the committee report makes clear that we will initiate further legislation as necessary if funds available to the program prove inadequate to meet needs arising from future disasters. Finally. it is my hope that the other body will take up this bill in a timely manner. I recognize that there is some interest on the other side of Capitol Hill in making modifications to the Emergency Relief Program. I would hope. however. that we could agree on this temporary measure and defer any major modifications until we take up our multiyear authorization bill. Mr. Speaker.

Mudslides. flooding. and washed out bridges have caused damages to Federalaid highways that may approach $75 million. according to the California Department of Transportation. Virtually every county in the northern half of our State has been impacted. As of this morning. Gov. George Deukmejian has declared a state of emergency in 36 counties. and the White House has approved Federal disaster assistance for 34 of those counties. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4240 would remove the existing $30 million per disaster cap on the emergency relief fund. and raise it to $100 millionso that the devastation to roads and bridges can be adequately addressed. The emergency relief fund derives all of its revenue from the highway trust fund. and it was set up specifically to assist States struck with disasters that wreak havoc on the Federal aid system. States are only eligible if there is a Federal disaster declaration. and only if they can prove to the satisfaction of the Federal Highway Administration that the road damage was directly attributable to the disaster. It is our hope that we can remove unnecessary restraintsat this critical timeso that the emergency relief fund can be used for the purpose for which it was intended. H.R. 4240 also makes territories eligible for highway relief due to storm damage. and raises from $30 million to $40 million the amount the Army Corps can spend for flood control without congressional authorization. On behalf of the residents of California. I want to especially thank Chairman HOWARD. Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. SNYDER. and Mr. SHUSTER for their expeditious treatment of this emergency legislation.",

I remember back in 1982 California was struck by severe flood damage. The road repair bill alone was $150 million. At that time. I introduced a bill very similar to the one we are now discussingfortunately that relief bill was approved by Congress and California was able to reconstruct previously closed roads in over 27 counties statewide. The bill we are debating is very important to help affected States recover from 1986 catastrophies. Already. the estimates from Californias transportation agency place the cost of repairing the damages to State roads and highways in the $75 million range. Other States. including Utah. Colorado.

Much of todays discussion will pertain to the costly floods California has endured and that is certainly understandable.

I believe we will all agree that the hardships our people have faced. and are currently dealing with. are our primary consideration. Many individuals. families. and entire municipalities have been impacted by the recent flooding in Nevada. Much of their hope for the future is tied to the Federal assistance available to them. H.R. 4240 seeks to expand that assistance for such projects as rebuilting roads and establishing flood control projects. We have little control over natural disasters or catastrophic failures. and their occurrences know no borders.

For the past 60 years AMIT Women have been bound together by an abiding sense of social responsibility. a proud belief in the need for a dynamic spiritual life and an understanding of the common heritage of American democracy and Jewish traditions. Today. AMIT Women numbers some 80.000 members. encompassing career women. housewives and community leaders of all ages. and is organized into 45 chapters in 38 States and the District of Columbia. AMIT Womens educational and social welfare projects in Israel include a network of schools. childrens villages. community centers. settlement houses and other child care and social welfare institutions. Many of these were the first of their kind in Israel. Thirty years ago. AMIT Women has the foresight to teach and train Jewish children from Ethiopia. who then returned to their country to instruct other Jews. Today. a generation later. AMIT youth villages are home to close to 200 Ethiopian children who recently arrived in the homeland they had always dreamed of reaching. AMIT Women is involved in a variety of issues confronting todays American Jewish community and is active in local community relations councils. Jewish federations and other communityminded groups.

Much has changed in 5 years. The Nation now consumes less energy. gasoline prices have stabilized. and oil supplies are abundant. In the course of our present debates on the budget resolution. attacks are being made on the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. To take such action against the program of synthetic fuel development this Nation has begun. including shale oil development. is shortsighted in terms of the energy security of this country and our people. While the immediate urgency of the Nations quest for energy security has lessened. its importance to our national wellbeing remains as great today as it was in 1980. For almost certainly. if we fail to continue our present program of energy development. todays glut will turn into a serious energy shortage within the next 1015 years. Mr. Speaker. Conoco. Inc.. released recently its annual forecast of energy supply and demand. Its findings present a strong case for continued Government involvement in the development of reliable alternate energy supplies. According to Conoco. world oil demand will grow from the 1984 rate of 46 million barrels per day to 54 million barrels per day by the year 2000. An increasing concentration of this additional supply will come necessarily from the Middle East. a historically unstable part of the world. The bottom line of Conocos forecast should be cause for concern to all my colleagues. Conoco believes the U.S. oil and gas industry will need to invest roughly $300 billion over the next 5 years to provide sufficient energy supplies to last through this decade.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday I introduced legislation to ensure that the Department of Transportation will be able to carry out its responsibilities to require that airlines serving the public are \"fit\" and can provide service which is safe and protects the rights of consumers. Recent efforts to gain control of Trans World Airlines have highlighted the problems DOT may have in implementing its responsibilities. The legislation I have introduced. the Preservation of International Air Service Act of 1985. H.R. 2575. will establish a framework for DOT to deal with the TWA problem. At a later date. we will be considering legislation to deal more generally with this problem. Under existing law. before an air carrier can start operations. DOT must find that the carrier is fit. willing. and able to provide the service proposed in its application and to comply with applicable requirements of law. The DOT fitness evaluation includes an evaluation of the general management capabilities of an applicants top management. the adequacy of the applicants financial plan. and the record of the applicants owners and top management in complying with State and Federal laws and regulations. This evaluation helps ensure that the applicant will operate safely and that the consumers will be protected against dishonest or incompetent operators. Existing law further provides that the requirement of fitness is a continuing requirement and that in appropriate cases DOT may start a proceeding to determine whether a carrier holding a certificate continues to be fit. If DOT finds that a carrier is no longer fit it may modify or revoke its certificate. In the case of the proposed takeover of TWA. a petition has been filed with DOT raising questions as to whether TWA would continue to be fit If the",

After years of overcharging 1.5 million Federal employees. the company now proposes to return $289 million to policyholders and $465 million to the U.S. Treasury. Nothing could be more preposterous.

Often when we have talked spending on the House floor and we have talked budgetbusting and we have talked about all the horrors of big deficits. we have heard many Members come to the floor and say. \"Take it out of defense spending. That is where we ougltt to find the cuts we need in order to do things.\" Well. what do we have coming before us now? We have a rule coming before us that busts the budget on the issue of defense. The budget that we passed the other week is being busted. Section 311(a) of the Budget Act is being busted with regard to pay. We are providing new spending authority in the bill for pay. and as a result we have another budgetbuster. Now. the Rules Committee is not really telling us that in the rule. They have just given a blanket waiver on everything. Instead of being able to specify in this rule that we have a budgetbuster. we cannot do that. Instead. what we have is just that all points of order against the conference report are waived. and that includes the Budget Act. So what we have before us is another attempt to break the budget. another attempt to bust the budget and to do it in this case in defense. I really seriously question whether or not anybody in this body who is concerned with these rules is really concerned about the Budget Act. because nearly every rule that we have brought out here since the Budget Act was passed in August has had some waiver of the Budget Act in it. There has been a wholesale abandonment of the budget process. There has been a wholesale attempt to simply say that the budget process around here does not matter anymore. If ever there is an argument for moving toward the GrammMack approach in attempting to come up with some kind of a system for the President to sequester funds. it has been our performance on the Budget Act. We have one more example before us right now. We are attempting here once again to pass a rule that permits the Budget Act to be waived. Mr. Speaker. I would urge a vote against that kind of rule.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we consider this conference report. I would like to address several misconceptions about the procurement reform measures agreed to in conference. It is obvious that some Members believe the conference agreement weakens or \"guts\" the significant provisions of the House bill. It has also been said that the House conferees were not committed or did not understand the provisions adopted by the House. Nothing could be further from the truth. The House conferees were stalwart in their attempts to maintain the House position. and even went so far as persuading the Senate conferees to allow the House sponsors of various measures to address the conferees. After many hours of discussion and deliberation. it was apparent that both Houses would have to concede on some issues in order to reach an agreement. We believe the conference agreement represents a compromise between the two bills in which the House won. not 50 percent of the battles. but at least 80 percent. As in any other conference agreement. we were not able to retain 100 percent of the House measure. One cannot just compare the conference report to the House bill. one must also look at how many provisions in the House bill were not included in the Senate bill and. in fact. were adamantly opposed by the Senate. Each time we were able to retain a House provision which had no Senate counterpart. we achieved a victory. In addition. the conferees retained the most stringent of the Senate provisions. thus strengthening the House bill. Although everyone hopes to see \"a provision they believe in\" adopted as written. the nature of the democratic system dictates a process of compromiseand for this we cannot be faulted. The conferees spent literally hours upon end debating these provisions. The conference followed countless hearings on the issue of procurement reform by the Armed Services Committee of both Houses of Congress. We believe that the conference agreement reflects that attention to detail which is necessary to craft provisions which will strike at the heart of the problems within the Defense procurement process. I invite you to review a brief summary of the 17 procurement provisions in the bill which I will make a part of the RECORD today.",

Not only do we need it because defense in real terms declined. but also because of the Soviet threat and the increased Soviet threat. Even after a trillion dollars increase in authority. and even after only an inflation increase in this bill. we still are at historically low levels in defense spending. with defense only making up somewhere around 25 to 26 percent of the total budget when it was about 50 percent of the budget under JFK. and as a percentage of GNP we are still significantly lower than where we have been historically.

This is the section dealing with postemployment restrictions on Department of Defense personnel. Allow me to clarify who is covered. It was our intent during the conference to include both civilians and military employees of the Department of Defense in this section. After the conference some people suggested that the language applied to only a handful of civilian personnel. This is not correct. The Department of Justice and the Congressional Research Service agree that the phrase \"Presidential appointees in Federal employment\" covers all persons who hold an office. position. et cetera. from the President and that this includes military officers. So any military officer who is a program manager. a test officer. or in any other position where he is a negotiator with a defense contractor. can no longer retire and immediately go to work for that defense contractor. This provision also covers civilians who are Presidential appointees. for example. assistant secretaries of the services. This is what we intended in conference and I am glad that the Department of Justice agrees. I would like to enter for the RECORD the opinion of the Department of Justice and the opinion of the Congressional Research Service. This provision is not adequate to deal adequately with the problem of the \"revolving door.\" however. For that reason the original amendment which the House attached to Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 398 to 19. is now part of the Appropriations Act.

This compensation to veterans who suffer from wounds or other disabilities that resulted from their military service has neverI repeat. neverbeen taxed. In fact. the compensation rates have been developed over the years based on the fact that they are not taxed. For the life of me I cannot understand the logic of saying to veterans with serviceconnected disabilitiesveterans who have lost a leg or an arm. who have been paralyzed or blinded during warthat they must now face the indignity of paying taxes on compensation for which they have already paid such a terrible price. We may need to reform our Tax Code. Mr. Speaker. but we should not in the process treat VA disability compensation like it is just another tax loophole to be closed. Let me also speak out against the administrations plan to consolidate 58 regional VA offices into just three locations. The plan seeks to concentrate all administrative and adjudicative functions related to the processing of veterans claims and appeals. But the current. decentralized system of VA offices is absolutely fundamental to a system that guarantees veterans due process. Take away the offices. make them less accessible to veteran claimants. and you virtually wipe out even the pretense of due process. While my resolution addresses only the tax issue. I urge the administration to abandon both of these proposals. They are bad for veterans. and that means they are bad for the country.",

It embodies the administrations proposal to establish the administration for enterprise and development opportunity in place of the SBA to cut government spending and reduce the Federal deficit. Given that 99.8 percent of our Nations small business dont rely on the SBA for credit. the agency is clearly a luxury we can do longer afford. I have heard from numerous small business owners in my district and their reaction to the proposal has been overwhelmingly positive. As an example. yesterday I received a letter from a businesswoman. Rosemary Tucker. who owns a tire company in my district. Rosemary was given the award of \"Small Business Person of the Year by the Senate of California in 1978. and she placed third in the Nation that year in a similar contest sponsored by the Small Business Administration. Knowing what she now knows about the SBA. she has given her total support to my efforts. As Rosemary and many others have told me. small business do just fine without the SBA. Their interests are better served by reducing the deficit and creating a better economic environment in which all small business can flourish.",

He believes that the arms talks advisers are going to Geneva in order to buy $25.000 BMW motor cars at a 20percent discount. Truly. they have set an important example for all of us. One example they have set is to demonstrate their firm and continued support for the endangered free enterprise system in this country. Because you see. Mr. Speaker. these Presidential advisers used their temporary diplomatic passports to purchase nine $25.000 BMWs at. yea. a 20percent discount. Then they plan to bring the cars back to the United States so that they can sell them for a profit. This is a wonderful example for all of us. And they also found a few minutes in their spare time to set up the armstalks in Geneva. Mr. Speaker.

You know. we argued in this place about the Panama Canal for most of my first 10 years here. The Panama Canal was like a sore to most Central Americans and we made it a bigger and bigger sore. Now every time some radical kook. some Daniel Ortega. some person of that ilk stands up and says. \"Look at the United States.\" he seems to be proven right by our very actions. It is wrong not to exhaust all diplomatic channels before exercising a military option. We are. by our actions. by our statements. and by our movements. making more Communists in Central and South America than Mr. Ortega can possibly make. We also are being distracted from bigger problems. I happen to love Mexico. I think it is a beautiful. beautiful country. but it has monstrously big economic and internal problems. and we are being distracted from those problems. Then I have to ask myself who am I being asked to back? Who? The three gentleman that used to be with that great Nicaraguan by the name of Mr. Somoza that visited my office? I am told that these are freedom fighters. Freedom for who? The Contras do not have the popular support of the Nicaraguan people. Who elected them? And who do they represent?",

The extent of the modifications is not known at this time. So. of course. the cost is not known. Next. that facility would need to be equipped with much new equipment to bring it up to VA standards for furnishing firstrate medical care. Again. we do not know what those costs would be. Then and finally. Mr. President. the VA would begin to operate the hospital in fiscal 1987. That would require approximately $35 million per year for operation of an approximately 300bed VA hospital that would then exist in Mobile.

The amendment does several things. Mr. President. but it focuses on one thing: Making as perfect as we know how the GrammRudmanHollings balanced budget plan that this Senate approved by a 75to24 margin just last month. The Senate approved the DomeniciChiles substitute to the GrammRudmanHollings legislation by a large vote. That substitute merely built upon the good work and the originality of the authors. It contained 25 perfecting and clarifying amendments. not an unusually large number considering that the legislation itself ran more than 40 pages. The legislation Senator PACKWOOD and I have now put before the Senate continues the perfecting and clarifying process. It contains an additional 50 amendments to GrammRudmanHollings. but keeps intact the basic concepts of the authors. Now. 50 amendments may sound like a large number. However. as my colleagues who have worked on such legislation as the Clean Air Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act with me remember. 50 amendments of a technical variety occur on any bill of substance. And. of the 50 amendments Senator PACKWooD and I now offer the Senate in the substitute. fully 20 of them are purely technical and another 9 are procedural or related to the Budget Act and its operation. Only 9 of the amendments are of a major. substantive category. and another 12 are substantive. but of less Importance. Mr. President.

    "speech": "I have been most interested these past few weeks in the issue of disinvestment or redemption of the securities in the Social Security trust funds due to Congress failure to extend the debt limit. I had planned to offer an amendment to the reconciliation bill that would make the trust funds whole. but am pleased that the issue has been addressed in the modification to the GrammRudman bill. My concern. Mr. Chairman. is this: I have reviewed the language passed by the House on this issue. which is identical to the language I would have used in my amendment. and believe that it is favorable to the modifications now contained in the Senate version of OrammRudman. Mr. Chairman. this issue of redemption of the Social Security trust funds has been widely misunderstood. Essentially. there are two issues: the first is actual interest lost to the funds. The Social Security trust fund is protected for some lost interest due to the way Treasury transfers FICA tax receipts to the Social Security trust funds. However. the other trust fundscivil service retirement and military retirement. for exampleare losing millions of dollars. This problem is taken care of in the House language and in the Senate language. The second problem. however. is more completely addressed by the language adopted by the House. That problem has to do with the fact that longterm securities with higher interest rates have been redeemed that otherwise would not have been redeemed had we not bumped up against the debt limit. In order to be certain that those securities are reissued at the same interest rate and with the same maturity. it is my understanding that the Treasury Depzrtment must be directed to do so. and that legislative language simply instructing the Treasury to pay back the interest does not assure the Congress and the elderly Americans of this Nation that the Social Security portfolio will be put back in the same condition as it was before. Mr. President. the language adopted in the House version was suggested by officials at the Treasury Department. It is for this reason. Mr. Chairman. that I would urge the Senate conferees to adopt the House language on making the trust funds whole in order to ensure that the trust funds are fully restored.",

I stated then my concerns with this sweeping change in the way we do business around here and I want to renew that statement of concern today. A distinguished American military leader. commenting on the nuclear age. said that we have suddenly become technological giants. while we remain ethical pygmies. I hold a similar concern for the ability of the Congress to measure up to our obligations in the postGrammRudman era. We are about to create a budget process which consolidates considerable power in the Budget Committees and the OMB. and compresses the time in which Congress must make extremely important decisions. What we will have when this measure eventually passes will be a process. what we still need is a policy to carry out our goals. The people of Minnesota didnt send me here to act as an observer. who watches as a mechanical process grinds out a Federal budget. I am here to protect and manifest their hopes and aspirations as Americans. That is the policymaking mandate that we all have in this body. to which the systems and procedures of this body must be subservient. Those who heave a sigh of relief at the passage of this amendment. who feel we have \"solved our deficit problem\" thereby. could not be more mistaken. We are ushering in a period of intense and prolonged policy debate. such as we have not seen in decades in this body. At best. this amendment will succeed in putting everything on the bargaining table. including defense. revenue increases. and entitlement reform and getting everyone. including the President. to that table. It is with that hope that I support this amendment. It is my fear. however that this exercise may serve as a confirmation of Wendell Wilkies wise words: \"That a good catchword can obscure analysis for years.\" Unless the policies we formulate and implement are wise. this process will do more harm than good. That is the challenge we accept with the passage of this amendment. In closing. I remind my colleagues of the old joke about where a 300 pound gorilla sits: Anywhere he wants to. It Is up to us to detemine responsibly what kind of animal GrammRudman will be and where in the final analysis it will sit.",

Of course. complaints about the constitutionality of GrammRudmanHollings can still be heard. They were heard on this floor today. And they will continue to be heard for years to come.

Since November 1. hun. dreds of consumers all across the country have been deprived of transportation service for lowcost natural gas. These consumers are being required to pay more for natural gas. in some cases as much as 100 percent more. because interstate natural gas pipelines do not wish to transport natural gas for others on a nondiscriminatory basis. The purpose of this resolution is to let these pipelines know that this House does not look with favor upon the decisions they have made. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined last May that the transportation programs being carried out by interstate pipelines violated the Natural Gas Act because only certain pro. ducers and consumers could use those pro. grams.

Thanks to a spirit of compromise and the hard dedicated work of both members and staff. the report before us was made possible. In particular. I want to commend the excellent work of the conferees and the outstanding contributions of Senator LUGAR and Chairman FAsCELL. Also. the dedicated work of committee staff directors Jeff Bergner. Jack Brady. and Everett Bierman. and their associates contributed significantly to achieving this commendable agreement. For the first time in 4 years. we have been able to agree to a foreign aid authorization bill. the levels of which are below the 1985 freeze levels. We have been able to put this bill together in spite of a lack of cooperation on the part of the Department of State. It is obvious that many in the bureaucracy misread the will of the American people regarding excessive spending. This conference report clearly expressed Congress sensitivity to the high budget deficits and the concerns which many people have regarding unreasonable amounts of foreign aid. The conference report also represents a commitment on the part of the conferees regarding the importance of maintaining the authorizing function. a key element in the democratic process of this institution. The conference committee resolved important issues affecting the security of America and our friends and allies around the world. In particular. we agreed to ease some of the congressional restraints on the Presidents power to conduct foreign policy by providing assistance to freedom fighters in Nicaragua. Cambodia. and Afghanistan. as well as lifting the Clark amendment ban on assistance to the freedom fighters in Angola. Progress was also made in the area of Presidential flexibility in dealing with Jordan and the Philippines. Ways to better combat international terrorism were also addressed by the conferees. In particular. new and firm approaches will be taken by our Government toward countries with inadequately secured international airports. Although I still have reservations about some provisions which tend to micromanage the foreign policy process. I do support the conference report before us. With these concerns in mind.

I have a heartfelt sense of frustration that this legislative body has shirked its responsibilities to the American people. both within the United States and throughout the Western Hemisphere. The funds provided for socalled humanitarian aid to Contra forces fighting the government of Nicaragua is. n reality. nothing but blood money stained and tainted by the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians it will help murder. The citizens of the United States do not want to be a part of this ruthless and unprovoked CIA war. and so I have therefore voted against the foreign aid bill on these moral grounds. I stand by my record and will continue to work vigorously in support of the programs that provide relief and assistance to those nations that are attempting to overcome the hardships that are associated with modernization and/or poverty. It is clear that I have actively promoted funding for health programs. indigenous energy resource efforts and educational and human resource development. These are the tools of peace and the cornerstones of democracy. And in pursuit of these ideals I have not shyed away from the fact that. in their defense it is at times necessary to resort to military aid. This is the case in our relationship with the State of Israel. But the important point. not to be missed is that this assistance is coupled with intense and ongoing negotiations at the highest levels of government. No doubt that if the administration was consistent in its foreign policy endeavors and the Sandinistas were treated on an equal par as the Syrians. the war in Nicaragua would not have escalated to this dangerous point.*",

That is a commendable effort toward holding down the deficit. And it is in keeping with my strong support for an acrosstheboard freeze on all Federal spending. Second. the conference report takes a strong stand against repressive regimes around the world which engage in press censorship. commit outrageous atrocities against their own peoples. and repress basic human rights. Finally. the bill contains provisions designed to counter international terrorism and reduce illicit narcotics traffic. Shocking events throughout the world underscore the fact that we in America are not isolated from the worlds troubled spots. nor. as weve witnessed in recent terrorist acts. can we pretend to be apart from these problems. This measure gives our country more tools to shake loose the terrorists grip on the world and to help those peoples who strive for the freedom and democracy that we cherish.

Mr. Speaker. most of us serving in the House today were not even elected to Congresss when the last major public works authorization bill was passedthat was in 1974. Since that time. the distinguished members of the Public Works Committee have tried admirably to pass major water projects bills. each time their efforts failed. The consequence. of course. has been a tremendous deterioration in our Nations infrastructure and a regrettable avoidance of funding for vital project needs. We are now skating on thin ice. Mr.. Speaker. If we do not do something now we may never be able to regain lost ground. Having pared the number of projects down to the most essential. we have a responsible package which will work in the best interest of the entire Nationit deserves my colleagues support. Let me cite Just one example of the need for these projects. The Oliver lock and dam on the Black WarriorTombigbee Waterway at Tuscaloosa. AL is the only lock of its dimensions on the 429mile river system. The prewar dimensions of this lock mean inordinate delays. averaging almost 3 hours3 hours to negotiate one lock. One can imagine the backup and congestion this delay creates. The obstruction arises from the Oliver locks antiquated chamber size. causing barges unusual manuevering and slow downs. A new lock authorized in this amendment would accommodate the typical sixbarge tow. with a single lockage. and would significantly reduce delays.

    "speech": "Speaker. House of Representatives. Washington. DC. USA. My DEAR Tip: I am writing. as Foreign Affairs Spokesman of the Labour Party. to convey my concern at the requests made by the Reagan Administration to Congress to increase humanitarian aid. and provide military assistance. to the Contra forces in Nicaragua. There is great concern in Europe at this proposal and at the announcement of help for UNITA. In the opinion of many of us these actions will seriously Jeopardise the prospects for regional stability In these areas. I have to say that the policy of the U.S. Administration toward Nicaragua continues to place a heavy strain on the Western alliance. The rejection of the Corabelleda declaration and allegations that the U.S. government has violated the Boland amendment have fueled the belief that the American government has no serious interest in a negotiated solution to the problems of Central America. Such an approach not only jeopardizases the prospect of a negotiated solution but impedes those forces within Nicaragua who most strongly support the development of a more pluralist society. I urge you and your colleagues to reject the requests of the administration. With best wishes. Yours sincerely. DENzs HEALEY. [From the Associated Press. March 20. 1986] While the House debated. the eightmember Contadora group of Latin American countries made a fresh appeal to avoid the use of force in Central America. Speaking at a meeting of the Political Council of the Organization of American States in Washington. Venezuelan Ambassador Edilberto Moreno said it was necessary to reiterate the obligation of all member states of the OAS \"to solve their controversies exclusively by peaceful means and to abstain from the use of force directly or indirectly.\" Moreno said he was speaking for Argentina. Brazil. Colombia. Mexico. Panama. Peru. Uruguay. and Venezuela. Chiles new ambassador to the OAS. Javier lManes. declared his countrys \"decided support for the Contadora peace efforts.\" C3 1420",

Democracy. and Development in Central America: A Democratic Alternative.\" This report attacks President Reagans policy toward Central America and states that the administration seeks only a military solution. However. the report ignores the fact that the current United States policy toward Nicaraguas Sandinistas was charted during the last months of the Carter administration. Indeed. I am sure that you are aware that ZbignIew Brzezinski. President Carters National Security Adviser fully supports the $100 million aid to the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. Further. the Democratic report states that the United States should negotiate with the Sandinistas about their aggressive external policies. but forget about the Sandinistas internal policies simply because they are Communists and will not negotiate about such things. This is very strange logic. Why would the Sandinistas want to talk about anything? They have everything to lose. Absolute totalitarians cannot talk about powersharing nor of coexistence with their democratic neighbors. Meanwhile. while we cannot pressure the Sandinistas for Internal reforms. the Democrats wish to use military pressure to force President Duarte to continue peace talks with the Communist guerrillas in El Salvador. If Duarte doesnt talk. no military aid. But. it was Duarte who has sought talks all along. I dont understand how some of my distinguished colleagues believe that they can have this both ways. Abandon the Nicaraguan freedom fighters because the Sandinistas will not negotiate. and abandon El Salvador if the legitimate Government cannot bring the Communist guerrillas back to the negotiating table. We must stand up to totalitarian Communist aggression and we must do it now. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the $100 million in aid for the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.",

This urgent supplemental is crucial in the agricultural sectors of this country. Our farmers are waiting for us to pass this bill so that provisions in the 1985 farm bill can be fully funded in timely fashion. Among other things. this will enable them to receive 40 percent of advanced deficiency payments from their local ASCS offices.

This will allow a better assessment of CCC needs to complete the year. I also would again like to point out that it is extremely difficult to estimate future needs due to the fluctuations in participation and weather. Also most important. this supplemental points out that at least $1.7 billion is available for insured FmHA operating loans in 1986.

This treaty I should note was ratified last week by the Senate by a vote of 8710. I am critical of this treaty for several reasons. The most Important of these is the fact that it eliminates the socalled political offense with respect to cases involving those the British seek to extradite back to Northern Ireland. This political offense exception Is common to almost 100 other extradition agreements we are party to with other nations. It was also upheld by several recent U.S. court decisions. One of the most eloquent criticisms I have yet to see about the treaty was contained in an article in the New York Post earlier this week by Beth Fallon entitled \"Disgrace All Around on Ulster.\" I urge my colleagues to read this article and join with me later when I sponsor legislation to reinstate the political offense exception to our extradition policies with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",

There are a lot of reasons for my support. but there is one in particular that I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues. In a time when we are attempting to reign in out of control Federal spending and get our fiscal house out of the red. we have a provision in the House package that would increase the size of the welfare state. bringing more people onto the welfare rolls. rather than trying to reduce those numbers. This change would cost 25 States a total of $187.4 million each yearand would cost the State of Texas alone $23 million. The provision would mandate that as of January 1. 1988. States would have to provide AFDC benefits to twoparent families with dependent children in which the principal wageearner in unemployed. Participation in the two parent AFDC Program has historically been an option for States. Many. including Texas. opted out of participation. Now we are saying. in the House passed versionthat States must participate. Texas must. the law says. now spend as much as $23 million on a program it has chosen not to be part of. This. Mr. Speaker. is not the kind of quality control on welfare that the American people want. In fact. it is just the opposite. The Senate amendments delete this unnecessary provision. returning the AFDC Program to its original state. The Senate amendments leave States rights and State decisions where they belongin the State. We must remember that we are tryingthe American people are demanding that we dowe are trying to reduce this Nations deficit. This does not mean that we can shift burdens onto our State and local governments. This does not mean that we should be increasing the scope of our welfare system. We must remember.

This bill is in direct response to a decision made by the Department of Education to revise the formula under which funds were distributed to the States. In approving this legislation. New York will avert a staggering 60percent reduction in funds for consumer and homemaking education services. In 1985. New York received $2.129.936 for consumer and homemaking education. Without passage of H.R. 4841. our share would have plummeted to an astonishing $876.384. Clearly. this bill is vital if we are to continue an able and effective homemaking education program in New York. and many other large States who were severely affected by this change in formula. During this time of budget tightening and budget constraints. we need every dollar to promote a quality education across this Nation. H.R. 4841 will specifically limit reductions for all States to no more than 4.3 percentthe overall GrammRudman reduction. No one State would gain in funds at the expense of others. However. this bill would not be inequitable to small States. inasmuch as it would lock in the increase that those States have already received during fiscal year 1985. It is clear that passage of this bill is fair and equitable for all States. But even more importantly. it will allow and permit the continuation of responsible homemaking education services throughout the Nation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4841 makes a small but urgently needed revision in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act. This amendment rectifies a problem that has arisen in the allocation for the consumer and homemaking education program authorized by that act. This legislation must be enacted by July 1. Otherwise. the $30 million appropriated for consumer and homemaking education for fiscal year 1986 will flow to the States in a very irrational and inefficient distribution pattern. with some States grants increasing twentyfold and others dropping by twothirds. This problem has occurred due to the interaction of the March 1 GrammRudman cut with various hold harmless provisions and other factors in the programs formula. We had no way of anticipating this situation when we passed the Perkins Act in 1984. Without this bill. we will see hundreds of good programs discontinued and thousands of educators out of jobs in a majority of the States. For purposes of legislative history. I would like to state that the insular areasthe Virgin Islands. Guam. American Samoa. the Northern Mariana Islands. and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islandsare not subject to the onehalf of 1 percent minimum provision. but instead. have their own minimum allotments of $200.000 for the sum of all the programs under the act. This legislation has support from both parties and from every geographic region. The bill was noncontroversial in committee. The legislation is supported by the State directors of vocational education and the American Home Economics Association. I urge my colleagues to join me and speedily pass H.R. 4841.",

I will be pleased to respond to the gentleman from Texas by saying that this bill is necessary to correct a crossreferencing error in Public Law 99194. signed into law on December 20. 1985. In drafting the legislation that became Public Law 99194. the list of items that describes the activities the chairpersons of the arts and the humanities endowments are directed to support was altered. In the arts. the list was increased from five items to eight. In the humanities. the list grew for seven items to nine. These listings are contained in sections 5. arts. and 7. humanities. of the act. In section 11 of the act. a reference is made to the items listed out in sections 5 and 7. Unfortunately. staff failed to make the change in section 11 so Public Law 99194 is not correctly crossreferenced. This bill simply corrects this oversight and changes the language in section 11 to reflect the fact that the list of authorized activities described in sections 5 and 7 are increased from five to eight in the case of NEA and from seven to nine in the case of NEH.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania . You know. there has been increased discussion in recent months about the merits of the 55mileperhour speed limit. While surveys show that a majority of Americans support the limit. there are those who think it ought to be repealed. And there are others who feel that on certain highway segments. and after extensive review. the limit should be increased. But let me point this out. Even if the limit is increased in general. or if it is increased on certain highway segments. the law. whatever it is. will still need to be enforced. Whatever the limit is. it has to be enforced. The amendment before us simply fails to recognize this fact. Should we not protect the public by citing violators who travel at speeds of 75. 85. or 95 miles per hour? And let me pont out another problem I have with this amendment. We are a people of laws in this Nation. Right now. whether your like. defend it. abide by it or not. 55 is the law. And we have in this Nation also. an executive branch of the Government which is charged with enforcing the laws of the land. Now. if you dont like those laws. you ought to try and change them. But we shouldnt handcuff Federal or State agencies whose job it is to enforce them. That is simply not the way this issue should be addressed. If we have laws. like them or not. they need to be enforced. Again Mr. Chairman. we are a people and a nation of laws. This Congress should not make a mockery of that notion by inhibiting a laws enforcement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. and I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. this amendment is not really an attempt to increase our efforts with the Drug Enforcement Administration. There is $370 million in this legislation for the Coast Guard in that effort. and I am sure that at the proper time and in the proper way. should amendments come up to increase that amount. the Members of this body will vote to increase it. This is an attack on the 55mileperhour speed limit. which we have had now for 12 years. and which probably has directly saved more lives in this country than anything else the Congress has ever done in its history. Not only are we saving several thousand lives each year with 55. but we see. as a result of the 55mileperhour speed limit. that we have a decrease of tens of thousands of paralyzing back injuries in the Nation and we have a 70percent decline in traumatic head injuries. This is the result of 55. But people may say. \"But people dont go 55. The average has gone down from 68 or 69 to 61 or 62.\" That is true. But let us say we have a 20mileanhour speed limit. Do the people average 20 miles? Or 30 miles? No. they do not. There is always a certain leeway. So with the 55. we have an average of maybe 61 miles an hour. If we were to raise it. as some people want. to 65. we would have 71 miles an hour as an average. If you are in an accident at 55 miles an hour. your chances of being killed are only 1 in 30. At 70 miles an hour. your chances are 1 in 2. it is even money that you die. The problem that we have with 55 and the fact that it is not down there. according to the law enforcement officials all over this country. is that we do not have enough enforcement money. They would like to have more. So let us not abandon this effort now.",

If we were to do something to increase the speed limit or just let it go up due to lack of enforcement. we would be increasing the range. and that would cause even more deaths. People say. \"But after all. the highways are built for 70 miles an hour. The automobiles are built for 70 miles an hour.\" But we are not built for 70 miles an hour. It is at this high speed that we lose control of the vehicle. One can even talk about the rural areas and say that there are not very many automobiles there and. therefore. we ought to be able to go faster there. Most of the causes of death by auto accidents in this country are from single vehicles running off the road and hitting something. not crashes between vehicles. So that really does not carry any weight. So. Mr. Chairman. I would suggest that what we do here is show our support.

Id like to shed some light on what we are doing today. The budget authority required by the fiscal year 1987 budget resolution calls for $1.093.350 million in spending. That amount is so large that we cant fully comprehend what it means. But for the 109 million working Americans. it means a Government burden of $10.030 each. This spending bill today is just one step in the process of creating that $10.000plus burden per working American. As reported from the Appropriations Committee. this bill will cost those 109 million working American about $94 each. Of that amount $81 will come from taxes and $13 will come in new debt. The package of amendments Im offering today would reduce this bill by $126 million ($126.023.900). My amendment would: Reduce the $50 million in capital construction funds for the Washington Metropolitan Airports (National and Dulles) to $7 million. Reduce Amtrak funding by $61.3 million or 10 percent. Reduce funds for Washington Metros rail construction program by $21.7 million or 10 percent.

This bill is free of imminent danger in that regard. but it is a first step in that direction.

Congress will come back and take the next step. and the next. until the threat that the Senator from Oregon and I. and others. fear the mostinterference with the personal freedom of our citizens to work and travel freely in our society. will materialize. The use of employer sanctions as a vehicle to enforce immigration laws is the critical first step. I hope that the step will never be taken. The \"discretionary\" employer sanctions in this bill will inevitably invite employment discrimination. but they will not be effective to deter illegal immigration. Those employers who depend on them will not. under the sanctions in this bill. stop hiring them. Employers will be burdened. but the sanctions are not strict enough to be effective. Only by increasing the burdens on employers can the sanctions be made more effective. I am not suggesting this. I am merely pointing out one of the internal problems of this bill.

I wish it could be handled differently. but in this situation it could not be. I assure the Senator. and it is obvious. that we are going to have a joint hearing on the issue of discrimination based on alienage. When we have it. it will be the first time in the history of the United States that we have held it. I have culled the records of the House of Representatives and I have culled the subcommittees activities and the committee activities of a group of Congressmen of both parties. for whom I have the deepest respect. true civil libertarians. and there are about four paragraphs of references in the last 20 years to anything about discrimination based on alienage. So it needs a full hearing. and it will have one. The House will have it before they proceed with immigration reform. and I know they will. because Representative RODINo has a bill. Representative LUNGREN has a bill. and Representative ROYBAL has a bill. and there are other bills they will process. They will deal with it. It will be the subject of conference activity. and it will be the subject of my activity. because I have assured Senator LEVIN that we will do something with it at the conclusion of the hearing.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I can assure you that that will come into play simply because of the confusion of terms. When we talk about discrimination based on alienage. people think we are talking about discrimination based on national origin. We have a most extraordinarly welldeveloped record on discrimination based on national origin. ethnicity. and color of skin. That is what we have been up to. That is what I have been up to for 41/2 years. I have had 10 hearings or more. held by the subcommittee in the last 41/2 years. that deal with discrimination based upon national origin. ethnicity. and color of skin. It has been part of the civil rights debate for many years before I came here. There is no question about that. Information about a job applicants alien status is not relevant to employer sanctions. only the employees illegal alien status is what we are talking about with employer sanctions. If an applicant can show citizen status. the employer will not be subject to sanctions for hiring the applicant. However. neither will the employer be subject to sanctions if he hires an applicant who can show legal alien status. That is what the bill says. That is what is here. Therefore. knowledge of an applicants alienage will not cause an employer who has no desire to discriminate against illegal aliens to begin to do so. But I assure my colleague that I will keep that in mind and embrace that as we go on into the hearing process in future legislation. I thank the Senator from Michigan.",

H.R. 1202. both in an individual capacity and as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities of the Committee on Armed Services. As my colleague from Mississippi has Just stated. the intent of this act is to improve the July 29. 1.985 management of fish and wildlife on military installations. First enacted in 1960. the Sikes Act has accomplished much of that which Congress intended. H.R. 1202 would require that a priority in any contracting out for managing fish and wildlife resources on military installations be given to Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies in order to secure the service of trained professionals in dealing with the conservation and management of fish and wildlife. Mr. Speaker. let me assure my colleagues that of course the military missions come first and are foremost. This bill. as amended. would require that professional fish and wildlife personnel be included in the management of wildlife resources in a way that the future harvesting of timber on military installations would not. and I repeat. would not adversely affect the wildlife in those surroundings. I would like to commend the chairman and members of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for their diligent and concerned efforts on this jointly referred legislation. and also the efforts of my colleague from Alaska. Mr. YOUNG. who came in front of our subcommittee and made a very. very excellent presentation. Mr. Speaker.

I would also like to take this opportunity to commend my colleague and friend. the Honorable DON YOUNG. who initiated the proposed changes to the act. The Sikes Act. as passed by Congress in 1960. authorized the Secretary of Defense to carry out a program of planning. development. maintenance. and coordination of wildlife. fish. and game conservation on military lands pursuant to cooperative plans agreed to by the Secretary of the Interior and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency. To date. more than 19 million acres have been covered by these cooperative plans. In 1974. Congress amended the act to include development of cooperative plans to manage fish and wildlife resources on other public lands. such as Forest Service lands. H.R. 1202 would extend the current annual authorization of $1.5 million for the Secretary of Defense and $3 million for the Secretary of the Interior through fiscal year 1988 to carry out the provisions of the Sikes Act on military lands. It also extends the current annual authorization of $10 million for the Secretary of the Interior and $12 million for the Secretary of Agriculture through fiscal year 1988 to carry out the provisions of the Sikes Act on other public lands. Amendments to the act would further strengthen it by requiring that plans be developed for each military reservation in cooperation with all the appropriate State and Federal parties and that Federal and State agencies with expertise in fish and wildlife management be given priority in any contracting. Finally. the legislation would modify the existing timber reserve account to permit all proceeds received from the sale of forest products to be used for management of all natural resources. rather than just forestry. This legislation was reported by unanimous voice vote by both the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the Armed Services Committee. It is a good. solid piece of conservation legislation which I urge my colleagues to support.#",

H.R. 1406. would reauthorize the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980. or Nongame Act. through fiscal year 1988. This act is designed to promote the conservation of fish and wildlife species which are not normally subject to harvest for recreational or commercial purposes. These socalled nongame species make up about 90 percent of the Nations vertebrate species of fish and wildlife. The Nongame Act reflectsa a StateFederal partnership approach in the management and conservation of our valuable fish and wildlife resources. Under the act. States develop comprehensive and coordinate plans for fish and wildlife conservation. When such plans are approved by the Secretary of the Interior. the States are then eligible for partial reimbursement of the expenses associated with plan development. revision and implementation. The Nongame Act is intended to complement other existing programs. such as the WallopBreaux Program. which promote efforts on behalf of game species of fish and wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that over 93 million Americans enjoy nongame related activities each year. and that those citizens expend over $1 billion annually on recreational activities associated with nongame species. Whether this recreation takes the form of bird watching. nature photography. or simply a stroll though the woods which is made more enjoyable by the prospect of viewing wildlife. it is important that these opportunities be maintained through the wise conservation of our fish and wildlife resources. The bill before us today would authorize appropriations of up to $5 million annually for the next 3 fiscal years. This represents a freeze of this program at the fiscal year 1985 authorization level. The States have made great progress In developing dedicated funding sources to meet their portion of the costs which would be associated with this program. Thus far. no Federal funds have been appropriated under the Act. However. I believe that the existence of this act provides needed visibility for nongame programs and an incentive for continued development of comprehensive fish and wildlife conservation efforts.

Mr. Speaker. the next bill is H.R. 1544. the National Aquaculture Improvement Act of 1985 which was also unanimously reported to the House by the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. I believe this legislation represents a wellplanned and fiscally cons.rvative investment in what is a very promising U.S. industry. The U.S. aquaculture Industry has enormous potential for providing high protein food. augmenting natural fishery stocks. and for supporting various commercial enterprises such as bait and pet suppliers. Aquaculture has also begun to provide a much needed supplementary Income and viable alternative to many traditional farmers facing a very uncertain economic futre. Confronting an apparent shift in Federal agricultural assistance policy many farmers in my home State of Louisiana. for example. are rapidly shifting production from rice to crawfish and catfish. Because this infant industry is so diverse and is comprised of many smallscale operations. H.R. 1544 would establish a National Aquaculture Information Center to serve as a clearinghouse for information and as a central contact point for the industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture would operate the Center and would be designated as the lead agency in the previously established Interagency Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture. H.R. 1544 would also ensure that the status of the industry is monitored and that priority research is continued within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. In order to ensure that aquaculture development in the United States is achieved in the most constructive manner. the bill further directs that studies be conducted to assess the relationship between aquaculture production and more traditional means of seafood production. and on the effects of introducing exotic species into U.S. waters. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 1544 would provide for the authorization of $1 million each for the Departments of Agriculture. Commerce. and the Interior for each of fiscal years 1986. 1987. and 1988. These expenditures represent a minor Federal investment which will help diversify and promote significant returns to both the agricultural and fisheries sectors of our economy. Expanded domestic aquaculture production may also contribute to the reduction of the $5 billion annual trade deficit we currently generate in fisheries products.

It is probable that any number of factors will lead to more unemployment. with or without a sanctions bill from the U.S. Senate. But. Mr. President. let me Just simply direct the Members attention to the fact that this amendment calls for the end of the bill if unemployment rises by 40.000.

In other words. investment is possible only if a firm is owned exclusively by black South Africans. We are trying to encourage economic development in the black sector. an objective which in a sense runs contrary to the prohibition on new investment. The amendment before us represents an effort to facilitate that development. and it has been changed to ensure that it will serve that objective only.

Due to the fact that during the 1960s and 1970s thrifts originated as much as twothirds of conventional mortgages. the availability of mortgage money depended heavily on their deposit flows. However. there was a regional mismatch between these deposit flows and the demand for mortgage credit. Through its purchases of mortgages in the faster growing regions and its sales of mortgages in the slower growing regions. the secondary mortgage market redistributed the available mortgage money by transferring funds from capItal surplus to capital deficit areas. Recently. Freddie Mac has aided small or rural lenders who previously did not process the volume or expertise to tap outside capital through the secondary market.

In the Compact of Free Association. negotiated over a period of 15 years. the United States was able to protect our security interests by agreeing to tax. trade. and aid provisions designed to foster American investment in the freely associated states. By upsetting this carefully balanced agreement. the Ways and Means Committee amendments undermine the prospects for approval of the compact and thereby jeopardize important security interests of the United States.

It is a challenge most easily understood in terms of the need to maintain a wellrun. comprehensive industrial basea prerequisite for any great economic power. And it is a challenge which directly affected our ability in the future to increase per capita incomes and our standard of living through high levels of productivity growth. Many other factors aifect competitiveness. but productivity is perhaps the most important single variable. And in the last 4 years. even including the recovery 1983 and 1984 years. U.S. productivity growth has lagged growth abroad. We are losing the competitive challenge. and we will continue to slip behind our international competitors until we deal with our trade gap. The legislation I introduced last Wednesday. S. 1449. the Trade Emergency and Export Promotion Act. is designed to move the world back onto the path of free trade.

Indonesian forces have systematically tortured and killed residents of the former Portuguese colony since the Indonesian invasion in 1975. The book details allegation of killing of hundreds of civilians. the disappearance of prisoners. the torture of prisoners taken into custody. and the imprisonment of people without charge from 1975 through 1984.

During the recent debate on the foreign aid authorization bill.

H.R. 2401 requires any agency. except the General Accounting Office and the Department of Defense. report to the House and Senate 120 days in advance of any personnel actions incident to a change or termination of any function performed by a Federal field office. The bill specifies the particular Information to be included in the report. Persistent rumors have circulated in several areas of the country that the Federal offices in a town. city. or State will be shut down. Many of the plans to close Federal field office are based on OMBs management 1986 report which accompanied the fiscal year 1986 budget. OMB is trying the management side of its function to its budget responsibilities. The aim is threefold: increase productivity by contracting out services under Circular A76. improve Governmentwide information technology and communications systems. and to improve delivery by changing the Federal field structure. OMB left it up to each agency to determine how it will achieve its management savings. Each agency submitted a management improvement plan in April. 1985. The improvements are to take place over the next several years. H.R. 2401 provides only for notice of planned changes in the Federal field structure. I am concerned. however. that Congress will use appropriations riders or restrictive language in authorization bills to prevent agencies from exercising their management prerogative over Federal field structure. We must be very careful after the enactment of this legislation to see that the proper balance between management control over the efficiency of Federal Government operations and the delivery of services to taxpayers is maintained. It is not the intent of the sponsors of H.R. 2401 nor the intent of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee that Congress use this legislation to stop agencies from reorganizing. Thank you. I would like to engage the gentlewoman from Colorado. the sponsor of this bill and chairman of the subcommittee. in a colloquy. if she will answer these questions.

Mr. Speaker. this is an important bill. and one that does service nt only to those citizens receiving Social Security benefits. but to the Federal employees who administer this program. Recently. I was talking to my friend Lou Harris. who measures public opinion. and he advised that there is no job in America which is appreciated less than that of the Federal employee. Federal employees as a group are not appreciated very much by the American people. Therefore. the Jobs that they perform are easy prey for a President or a Cabinet member who wants an excuse for reducing the deficit or cutting down on Government expenses in order to close Federal offices. Generally people support that idea: Close all the offices. cut down on the cost of Government. and so forth and so on. Of course. this is a disservice to the beneficiaries of these programs and it is a disservice to millions of people receiving Social Security benefits who are dependent upon that program for their income. There are Government services that are absolutely essentia. to the functioning of this country. C .derly access of Social Security offices vnd Federal offices that administer other programs is vital. Certainly the orderly closing of those offices. if they are to be closed. is a part of that functioning. I rise in support of this bill today. I compliment the gentlewoman from Colorado.

In view of the overwhelming workload and delivery of programs through the States and local governments. it is critical to maintain onsite personnel and supportive services directly to all our constituents. Whether we are dealing with major Federal Block Grant Programs to all our States and jurisdictions or with the thousands of Social Security offices and contact stations which provide direct vital services to American citizens. it is essential to maintain these field offices on a continued basis.

I want to compliment the gentlelady from Colorado and the distinguished gentleman from New York and all members of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee for bringing this bill to the floor. I believe Congress must receive essential data and information from the executive branch so that we can make rational decisions relating to major consolidation and closing of regional offices and other service centers located throughout the country. In 1981 the administration proposed to consolidate the 58 VA regional offices into three centralized locations. Such consolidation would have made it extremely difficult for veterans to receive benefits and services currently available to them through at least one regional office in each State. Our committee recommended legislation (which later became Public Law 9766) requiring the Administrator to submit a detailed plan and Justification for such action under certain circumstances. The legislation gives our committee time to review such plan before it can be implemented. Mr. Speaker. the gentlelady from Colorado has assured me that the enactment of this bill will not be in conflict with the provision of law we enacted in 1981 (section 601 of Public Law 9766). As I understand the bill. H.R. 2401 would simply require all agencies covered by the bill to provide Congress with 120 days notice prior to making any significant change in their field office structure that will adversely affect Federal employees. With that assurance I am in support of the bill. I dont think Congress should interfere with executive branch reorganizations as a general rule where such reorganization can be justified. however. the Congress has a right to review any plan to consolidate functions of offfices. the closing of offices or service centers and other related activities where service to our citizens and employment of personnel are concerned. In conducting such reviews. Congress must have appropriate information from the agency involved. We have witnessed too many occasions where in the name of reducing Federal employment unwise and costly decisions are made without proper planning and Justification. Again. I commend the distinguished gentlelady from Colorado and other members of the committee for bringing this bill before the House.e",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a cosponsor of H.R. 2401. 1 highly favor the effort to require the administration to provide Congress with timely notice and Justification regarding Federal field office closings. Out of all 50 States in the Nation. Rhode Island has the third highest concentration of elderly people. Within the northeast region of the State and lying in the heart of my congressional district is a city called Woonsocket. Woonsocket is a wonderful city. It is best characterized by its extremely high population of senior citizens. Recently there have been rumors of a White House proposal to close Woonsockets Social Security Administration field office. I use the term \"rumors\" because of the lack of hardcore information currently coming from the administration on this matter. Lack of genuine facts and solid information in any field leads to dangerour problems. A respected doctor does not operate before questioning the patient on possible allergies and explaining the justification of surgery. A football quarterback who is not prepared with scouting reports on the opposing teams defense is destined to be rudely greeted by the turf come Sunday afternoon. H.R. 2401 would guarantee a communications line between the administration and Congress that would adequately fill the present information void regarding office closings. The bills timely notice and justification provisions are crucial to the futures of those depending on continued service from Woonsockets Social Security office. I believe that such criteria would be a deterrent in the closing of offices such as the one in Woonsocket. Consolidation does not necessarily mean saving money. If the administration is forced to provide a detailed Justification for the closing. I am confident the Social Security office will remain in this Rhode Island city for a long time. The reasoning is simplethere is no justification to detail. As a resident of Woonsocket. which is also the home of my parents. I cannot overstress the importance of keeping informed by the administration regarding its plans for office closings. An atmosphere heavy with uncertainty and light with facts is an unhealthy atmosphere to live in. I therefore urge my fellow colleagues to join in support of H.R. 2401. Its passage could mean a better future for many of our constituents.*",

It is an honor for me to share with you in the proud feelings that surround this joyous occasion. The Childrens Theater has always been a special Interest of mine. It was conceived in 1952. and 7 years later. the theater was established as a notforprofit theatrical and educational organization. Since then. I have observed a flourishing cultural concept that has greatly enriched the community. Expansion and growth have been a key factor in the overwhelming success of the Childrens Theater. The first classes were held in a rented garage with a 65student capacity. the students attended classes after school from September to May. Several moves occurred within the following years and in 1970. the theater converted a building in Fort Lauderdale into a fully equipped studio theater with classrooms. Today the program enrolls 300 students from Miami to Palm Beach. and has established itself as a quality theatrical facility. Certain aspects of the Childrens Theater have remained intact since its beginning. A great emphasis has always rested on education in the theater arts. concentrating or individual potential and the development of selfconfidence. poise. discipline. and selfexpression. The program also instills a community awareness and responsibility in the students. and performs for festivals. hospitals. senior citizens. libraries. the Broward Arts Council. and the county school system. In 1985. the summsr touring company became a new facet of the Childrens Theater. Last summer. the company appeared in 27 locations and this year. is performing in 45 locations in Broward. Palm Beach. Dade. and Monroe Counties. The company members must audition for the job and are paid for their employment. The program is funded by the South Florida Cultural Consortium and National Endowment of the Arts. and is a unique opportunity for students and south Florida. As we celebrate the addition of the new Lenzen room. I want to extend my warmest wishes for success in all your future endeavors. And I would like to thank you for the doors you have opened for young actors and actresses. and for the joy you have given south Florida.",

Most of you have heard his name. but I doubt that many of you know much about Terry Anderson. In tribute to him I am submitting an excellent article from Sundays Washington Post. This article. written by a friend of Terrys. allows us to become acquainted with a man in captivity. It reveals his high character and dedication to his career as a journalist. Please take a moment to read this article. We cannot forget Terry Anderson and the other hostages still in Lebanon. [From the Washington Post. Aug. 10. 1986]",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise In support of S. 1888. Public Lands Cleanup Act. This bill Is directed at establishing for the Nation a national. volunteerpowered. public lands cleanup program similar to one which has been phenomenally successful in Arkansas for more than a decade and a half. Concerned about the tons of trash blotting the landscape around Greers Ferry Lake. in my district. and the shortage of public funds to clean up the recreation areas visited by millions of people annually. Carl Garner. a dedicated and determined public servant. went into action. Carl is the resident engineer for the U.S. Corps of Engineers at Greers Ferry Lake. He originated the cleanup day in 1970. And. despite stormy weather. about 50 volunteers joined him in that first effort. Their goal was to clear away 6 years of trash that had accumulated along the lakes 300 miles of shoreline. Each year. since the first one. the volunteer effort has grown. As one who has regularly participated since that first year. I am proud to say that our corps of volunteers now numbers in the thousands as each annual cleanup day arrives. Now. in addition to the efforts at Greers Ferry Lake. there are annual cleanup days on 13 lakes and along the Arkansas River which are lead by the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the Keep Arkansas Beautiful Association. The Arkansas effort has earned national recognition. including multiple first place awards from Keep America Beautiful. Inc. I believe that S. 1888. Public Lands Cleanup Act. can help spread the volunteerpowered.",

Of the States. 12 receive these funds and 38 States fall on the short end of the stick. If you take the same formula or the House formula on the highway dollars and the 8 cents. and if we go to conference with the other body. and are not able to negotiate a formula that will seem to be fair to these other 38 States. Senators that come from States that have a greater geographic area with less people. we will have a hard time getting a highway program also. As I said. none of us believe that we were ever going to come back from a conference with what we asked for. But there is a problem here that the Senators who are lodging objections today happen to be in the position where their constituents would favor the formula that is in the House which is totally unacceptable to the Senators from the Plains States and in the Western Rocky Mountain States where we have huge geographical areas and fewer people and further distances for people to travel. So I think maybe something can be accommodated here. and I think we should move forward on the highway bill. I believe now maybe would be the time for all parties to see what we can work out and get the majority leader and the minority leader and work out something. If it is possible what I would like to see us do is work out some other agreement. Maybe it would be some other place that would be appropriate. There are those of us who feel the allocation of 1 cent that goes to mass transit is not fair. and others feel it is fair. Some accommodation could be made at another place. but we should move this highway bill because I think it is more important to commerce. to business. and to the economy of the American people. that we have a continuous Federalaid highway program without work stoppages or slowdowns. so we can fix roads and maintain the safety program and the bridge program.",

First. this amendment would mark a significant departure from the spirit of cooperation that resulted in the passage of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982. which required that 1 cent of the 5cent increase in the gas tax be dedicated for mass transit purposes. Second. this amendment would result in a significant windfall to many States that already receive more than their fair share of highway funds. Third. this amendment shows a compete disregard for mass transit needs in this Nation. which are glaring. and a disregard for our national transportation system. which includes mass transit as well as highways. I plan to oppose this amendment when it is offered. and I would also consider offering an amendment to achieve real fairness in the distribution of highway trust fund moneys. My amendment would limit the amount of highway funds each State may receive in a given year to 150 percent of that States gas tax payments in that year. Mr. President.
