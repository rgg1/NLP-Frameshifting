If there is one thing I have learned as a legislator. it is that we cannot achieve great things alone. It takes a willingness to come together. find common ground. and advance solutions that make peoples lives better. In that spirit. I welcome Americas new Congress. one that will chart the path towards a government that is more open. transparent. and trustworthy. To lead us on this path. the Republican Conference has nominated a man of great character and conviction. The second oldest of 12 children. he grew up mopping floors and waiting tables at his familys tavern. He ran a successful small business. He was elected to the Ohio State House and then this House. where he served as committee chairman. Republican Conference chairman. minority leader. majority leader. and Speaker. He is a reformer who works every day to make government more accountable to the people. For all of this. he calls himself a regular guy with a big job. and that job. he says. is to listen. because if we listen to the people. listen to one another. there is no telling what we can accomplish together for the future of this great country. Madam Clerk. as chair of the Republican Conference and by unanimous vote of that conference.

To our newest Members. this is a special pleasure to give you an exceptional welcome and congratulations. Welcome to our newest Members. As was indicated by the vote. many of our colleagues from the State of New York are not with us because they are attending the funeral of Governor Mario Cuomo. I extend condolences to our colleagues from the State of New York and have extended the sympathies of many in this body to Governor Cuomos widow. Matilda. and to his family. As an Italian American. I am especially proud of his leadership and extend sympathies to his family. Thank you. Cuomo family. Thank you. New York delegation. None of us would be standing here without the support and the strength of our families. Today. I am going to thank my dear husband of 51 years. Paul Pelosi. and my five children and nine grandchildren. all the Pelosis and DAlesandros. Let all of us applaud all of our families. To my Democratic colleagues and to my constituents in San Francisco. I thank you for the privilege of serving in the House. but to my colleagues. I thank you for the honor of serving as leader. but all of us should applaud all of our constituents for sending us here. So let us. again. applaud our constituents. Each one of us. Mr. Speaker. as you know. represents Republicans. represents Democrats. Independents. and others. and we should always pay tribute to the American people. The American people have called upon each of us to serve them. They have entrusted us with their hopes. their dreams. and they have asked us to address their challenges. The financial stability of a strong middle class and those who aspire to it is the bedrock of our economy and the backbone of our American democracy. We have a moral imperative to ensure that working men and women enjoy the bounty of their unprecedented productivity and to expand the purchasing power of families. To that end. today. Democrats will put forward a legislative package to put Americans back to work building our roads and bridges and meeting the needs of the American people. paid for by bringing our tax dollars back home and to increase the paycheck of Americas working families. We invite our Republican colleagues to join us in supporting the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. It is time to stop rewarding companies to move overseas and instead use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home. We ask for Republican support and action on the CEOEmployee Pay Fairness Act. legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their productivity. denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on annual income over $1 million unless they give their employees a welldeserved raise. We must have an economy that works for everyone. not just the privileged few. and we hope Republicans will join us to achieve a better infrastructure and bigger paychecks for the working people of our countrybetter infrastructure. bigger paychecks. We open this 114th Congress in the year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in our history. President Lyndon Johnson and Congress passed it. The President signed it. Reverend Martin Luther King. Jr.. and others. along with our own JOHN LEWIS. fought for it and inspired it. We must continue to inspire the engagement of every American. It is the vote that preserves our democracy. ends injustice. advances dreams. and sustains our freedom. In terms of protecting our freedom. let us recognize. salute. and thank all of those brave Americans who protect our rightsindeed. protect all of our libertyour men and women in uniform. our veterans. and our military families. Mr. Speaker. today. we are at the start of a new year and a new Congress. with fresh opportunity for the American people. Today is the Feast of the Epiphany. the visit of the magi. so let us have our own epiphany. for this moment. on this day. we are not just Republicans and Democrats. we are Americans not just in name. but in spirit. standing on higher ground than the last election. My hope is that in the inevitable exchanges and clashes that may happen in the months ahead. we will not lose sight of the truth that is as fresh as this ceremony is today and as historic as our Republic that the ideals that unite us are stronger than the issues that divide us in this House. That does not mean that we are dispensing with all disagreements in this debate. Our democracy is robust precisely because we have beliefs and we stand proudly. even persistently. for them. and our democracy endures and prevails because in the end. we are humble enough to find a way forward together. My fellow colleagues of the 114th Congress. let us uphold our deep and different convictions. but let us honor our common obligation to our country. In this Congress. we will do so under the leadership of Speaker JOHN BOEHNER. This House will continue to be led by a proud son of Ohio and a happy fan of the Ohio State football team. A man of abiding faith. great heart. and deep dedication. JOHN BOEHNER is truly a gentleman from Ohio. Congratulations to you. JOHN. to Mr. Speaker. to Debbie. to your daughters. Lindsay and Tricia. and the entire Boehner family. Thank you for sharing JOHN BOEHNER with us. God bless you and your family. Mr. Speaker. May God continue to bless the Members of the House of Representatives. This is the peoples House. This is the peoples gavel. In the peoples name. it is my privilege to hand it to the Speaker of the House for the 114th Congress. the Honorable JOHN BOEHNER. God bless you. Mr. Speaker. and God bless America.",

Let us today welcome all of the new Members and all of their families to what we all know to be a truly historic day. As we welcome all of the Members back who were reelected. we want to welcome your families as well. and I want to thank my family. I was doing pretty well on the walk over here from my ceremonial office until I ran into DEVIN NUNES three little girlsmy three biggest fansand one of them came running over and gave me a kiss. and I was a mess. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad. We rejoice that our new Members and families are here. We welcome them. We are glad and humbled to begin anew as servants of the peoples House. Here. it is our duty and our privilege to lend a willing ear to the people. to make laws in tune with their priorities and within the limits of their Constitution. In recent months. our economy has shown signs of improvement. and after difficult years. it may be a temptation to accept what I will call the new normal. But America did not become exceptional by ease. Far too many Americans remain out of work. and too many are working harder only to lose ground to stagnant wages and rising costs. We can do better. We can build an economy that furthers betterpaying jobs. more growth. and more opportunity for the Nations middle class. This is our vital task. We will begin this endeavor on common ground. both in letter and in spirit. It was actually my predecessor. Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati. who changed the order of things so that all Members now take the oath of office at the same time. He called this innovation a timesaving device. He sounds like my kind of guy. But this shared ritual is no passing formality. It is a frontier where words end and where deeds begin. The pessimists dont see us crossing this channel. They say nothing is going to be accomplished here. that division is wider than ever and so gridlock will be even greater. Frankly. fair enough. Skepticism of our government is healthy and. in our time. quite understandable. But one problem with saying it cant be done is that it already has been doneor at least started. In the last Congress. this House passed a number of jobs bills with broad support from the majority and the minority. and we will begin our work on this common ground. taking up measures to develop North American energy. restore the hours of middle class workers. and help small businesses hire more of our veterans. We invite the President to support and sign these bipartisan initiatives into law. It will be a good start. and more. it will be a sign that the logjam is breaking. and it will be a foundation on which to address the bigger challenges in the pursuit of freedom and security. No. this wont be done in a tidy way. The battle of ideas never ends and. frankly. never should. As Speaker. all I askand. frankly. expectis that we disagree without being disagreeable. In return. I pledge to help each of you carry out your duties. My door. of course. is always open. Now dont get carried away with itall right?-but it is always open. My colleagues. some things we do here will be characterized as shadowboxing and show business. but let me tell you and the American people. it is real work. It is a grind. as it should be. in striving to preserve the things that we all hold dear. Every day. you and I come out here. try to plant good seeds. cultivate the ground. and take care of the pests. and then. with patience and some sacrifice and Gods grace. there will be a harvest. Along the way. we may falter. but we Americans do not fall away from the task. We do not quit. So lets stand tall and prove the skeptics wrong. Lets make this a time of harvest. and may the fruits of our labors be ladders our children can use to climb the stairs to the stars. Thank you all. and God bless the United States of America.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. we rise today to set a new course for this Congress. though. with the record of the past Congresses. we know we have a lot of work to do. During their tenure. the majority has careened from crisis to crisis. sued the President for doing his job. brought the House to new heights of dysfunction and closed debate with the most closed rules in a single Congress in our Nations history. chased nonexistent scandals in Benghazi and at the IRS. and. since 2011. had this House vote more than 50 times to take health care away from their own constituents. This legacy of dysfunction. of partisanship and prioritizing political games over the public policy has dealt the American people a bad hand. By governing this House in such a haphazard way. the majority has closed down the process and shut out the American people. Sadly. the majority is poised to double down on their partisanship and even reinvent the mathematics of public policy. By using what is called \"dynamic scoring\" to pretend that tax cuts pay for themselves. Republicans will require the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Taxation Committee to use math that Bruce Bartlett. an economic adviser for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. called \"smoke and mirrors.\" This new math cooks the books in favor of the majority to pretend that the tax cut bills are revenue neutral. Time and time again. the falsehoods of dynamic scoring have come to light. The first President Bush even called this tactic \"voodoo economics.\" But even so. the House Republicans want to change the rules and inject their partisan ideology into even the mathematics which underlies our Nations public policy. Rising above partisanship. the House Democrats will propose today two measures that would do immeasurable good for the American people. First. giving average Americans the paychecks that they deserve. our commonsense legislation would deny CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on incomes over $1 million unless their own employees get a welldeserved raise first. This would ensure that average workers share in the fruit of the Nations productivity. not just the millionaires and the billionaires. Today. as our Tax Code stands. CEOs get a break and their workers are left out. The CEOs get the money. the deduction on taxes. and we get the bill to pay for that deduction. It is destroying the middle class. Second. Democrats will bring forward the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop rewarding companies that move overseas and. instead. use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home and rebuild our Nations crumbling infrastructure. By closing this loophole and ending the socalled tax inversions. we would raise an estimated $33.6 billion to invest in our roads. railways. and bridges which are falling apart all over the country. Last fall. I stood by a 100yearold bridge in Bushnells Basin that fell into such disrepair that firefighters stopped using it for fear the bridge could not bear the weight of the engines. It endangered the safety of the people they were expected to serve. In my home State of New York. 40 percent of the bridges have been rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. which is even worse. I wonder what the number is for the United States. This is an unconscionable state of affairs. Repairing the Nations highways and bridges is now. literally. life or death. We can do it with the Democrat proposals. We can. and we must. These are the types of bills that we hope to be bringing to the floor in this session of Congress. We will debate them and ultimately pass them. That is what Congress is about. not a legislative branch that silences half of this Nation by bypassing the committee process and bringing to Rules emergency bills that silence the Representatives of half of the people in the United States. It is my fervent hope that the new Congress will bring about an era of willingness to tackle the big problems facing our Nation. a renewed call for true bipartisanship. and a culture of enlivened debate. and I promise that our side will be a willing partner. In describing how the Bill of Rights came to be. former Supreme Court Justice. the late Harry Blackmun. said that the Founding Fathers survived a \"crucible of disagreement\" to give us a more perfect Union. Forging through that crucible is not only good for the legislative branch. but good for the Nation. Truly. it is the debate that makes us stronger. and time and time again. debate in the House has been stalled. strangling policies and solutions that could have benefited the Nation. Sadly. this is the legacy of the last Congress. I would like to insert the text of Justice Blackmuns speech into the RECORD.",

I am delighted to know that the Rules Committee will be ready and available to handle the pieces of legislation that the gentlewoman spoke of in terms of helping the American people to understand what Congress role is in working with the President to help with policies that will get this country back to work. Mr. Speaker. just a year ago. we recognized as we came back to Washington that we were at a GDP growth of a negative GDP. We had to fight out of these terrible. terrible tax increases and the things that are occurring to our economy. The American people found new footing this year because it was the Republican majority who gave new meaning and life to \"we are going to make this place. meaning Washington. D.C.. and government. smaller and make things bigger and better for people back home.\" We have now lived through what has become a reality with Republican policies on energy. for a competitive marketplace for there to be alternative fuels that are available that have dominated the marketplaces and put other countries on their heels and have given an advantage to American drivers who are here. families who are trying to make a go of it. The price of gasoline at the pump has dropped. We still have much to do. As we know of the first year that President Obama was in office. food prices began doubling. energy prices began doubling. Republicans now are giving the American people a sense that we can manage our country better. so that they cannot only have a job and keep a job. but that they can take care of their families.

I am proud to announce that in following through with that promise. which is what we have done. we now have a new. larger group of Republicans because of the hard work we have done and have sold to the American people about effectively managing their affairs in Washington. D.C. Republicans have put forth all sorts of reforms. not just in the House of Representativesmore transparency. more opportunities for debatebut the opportunity for the American people to see that what we are trying to do is to give the American people a chance to debate and to vote and to move forward legislative ideas. not just about jobs and not just about a better economy and not just about more freedom and not just about trying to take care of energy. but also to protect the men and women who protect this country. The 114th Congress is going to present also an opportunity. I think. for all of us to up our game. to work together. The House and the Senate because they are in Republican controlinstead of things being roadblocked and set aside and stacked upover 300 bills. Mr. Speaker. this past term on which we are waiting for Senatorial actioncan work together to enact legislation. We can talk with the American people. We can fashion transparency in bills for accountability. something that the American people want and need. It also represents an opportunity for us to jumpstart our economy. We are here to serve people back home. We are here to make things better for people back home. not to give away our country. but to make it stronger. a chance to empower people in their communities to make their own decisions and. hopefully. reap the rewards that come from that. Many times. it is not just about the creation of a job. but really of sustaining these families who are trying to work and make things happen and make more decisions about themselves and their futures. To begin that process today. as we open the House for the 114th Congress. we have a rules package. As we begin. I want to say lets not forget why we are here. We are here because those from our individual congressional districts sent us heremine. the 32nd Congressional District of Texas. sent me here to accomplish things on their behalfto make life better for them. to create better opportunities for people today. and a better America in the future. so that we are able to extend our lead among other nations with. I believe. American ingenuity and opportunityAmerican exceptionalism. as we say it in Dallas. Texas. Mr. Speaker. American exceptional power. Whether it is leading in the United States military or providing leadership for freedom. that is what we are best at. and we have this privilege by serving in this body. We must also be held accountable. I believe. to the Constitution. We have. all of us today. raised our hands to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. It doesnt mean certain parts of that Constitution. it means the Constitution. By our being here today. we are. once again. reaffirming that in this rules packagethe support to the Constitution. that basis of power. that is so important in that we understand the House. the Senate. the Presidency but. most of all. the power that lies with people. the rules package helps us to achieve these goals. H. Res. 5 is a continuation of the House Republicans efforts to streamline processes. to increase transparency. and to improve accountability. Specifically. it preserves the important reforms that were made in the previous two Congresses. It also adds a few perfecting amendments and orders to help further advance our twin goal of transparency and openness for all of the Members of this body. I would like to take a few minutes. if I can. to highlight some of the key parts of this rules package. Mr. Speaker. First. it builds upon the fiscal restraint imposed upon the Federal Government by House Republicans in the last two Congresses. We have seen in the last 4 years that the American economy is able to grow when the government shrinks and when less taxpayer money is used to support the government. more freedom and opportunity. We should have a smaller government and a larger free enterprise system. That is a goal. \"Limited government\" means unlimited opportunity for people back home. In 2011. the Federal Government was spending 24 percent of our GDP. and the economy was suffering. Thanks to the leadership of House Republicans. the Federal Governments spending is now down. In fact. the Federal Government now spends 19.9 percent of our GDP. which is nearly 5 percent less than just 4 years ago. This has come through fiscal restraint. This has come through making sure that we spoke to the American people about government that was getting too big. costing too much money. and had too much power. The American people understood that because the government was getting in the way. not playing its role of making life better for people but. rather. getting in the way and making onerous decisions on our economy. on peoples jobs. and. perhaps worst of all. on stifling families and the American Dream. In turn. we are finally now seeing. as a result of these 5 years in which we have held government spendingit has decreased from 24 percent of GDP to 19.9 percentan economic growth rate that the American people. I think. want and deserve. Are we where we want to be? Absolutely not. What is the approximate level? We need a GDP growth of 4 percent. We need a GDP growth not just in Dallas. Texas. but all over this country where we have people who in their homes. in their cities. and in their regions are able to take care of themselves. to sustain their economies. and to take care of their infrastructures in a responsible way. This Congress. Republicans are going to provide for fiscal discipline that restrains spending and gets the government out of the way. Getting government out of the way means you take money away from it which does one of two things: it leaves more money back home for people. or it simply gives people more opportunity to invest in the marketplace to grow jobs. This rules package will ensure that Congress has the necessary budget enforcement tools in place to continue our work that will help create jobs and grow the economy. We have a brandnew Budget chairman. He is one of the finest members of the Republican Conference. the gentleman from Georgia . Mr. PRICE has been not only a professional at his job as a physician where he healed people. but he came to Washington to do the same for us. His ascension to be the chairman of the Budget Committee will offer this country and. I believe. more specifically. this body a reevaluation of the important attributes of having a good economy through better budgeting and ways that we can restrain the Federal Government from unwanted and unnecessary spending to that which is done for the American people that makes sense. TOM PRICE will become a household name. and he will earn the accolades that he will get from his chairmanship. Second. the rules package includes a commonsense requirement for Congress when we consider legislation that will have a larger impact on our economy. In short. the House is going to require the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide nonpartisan macroeconomic analyses for legislation that costs .25 percent of projected GDP. What does this mean? This means that. now. we are going to be able to recognize on percentage basis points how close is the impact of our decisions that we make and to project them out to where we are able to actually know what the impact will be of the legislation that we pass in order to create more jobs. It is meant to err on the side of people and the free enterprise system. as opposed to stymieing what would end up going to them and erring on the side of growing this government. This means that the House will take time to analyze how legislation that we consider will really impact the American economy to where we can project what it will be as a result of including billions of dollars back into the economy for economic growth and development on the side of the free enterprise system. This is going to allow us to measure the impact of legislation. it is going to help us to use some commonsense projections on how our ideas are going to help the bottom line. Gosh knows we have been through 4 years where we saw high taxes. high spending. Big Government that caused America to fall not only in relative power to the rest of the world. but it placed on the American people disillusionment. unemployment. high taxation. people who could not pay their bills. a loss of their own identity within their own systems. Unemployment up to 23 million people unemployed and underemployed. we have now turned that corner. We will continue to turn that corner and extrapolate out how we want to get to all sectors of our economy to have a better shot at jobs in their hometown. in their region. and ones that they can keep. not have and then lose again. It is these current opportunities that lie right before us. and the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman. the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. RYAN. are perfectly suited for selling to this body and the American people why we believe that we have got to look at and change the way we authorize bills. So under one method. which would be called static scoring. which is what we have. we assume that major legislation does not change economic behavior. They just plug a new number in. and then we assume nothing really happens. But in fact we know when you raise taxes. you lower the opportunity for people not only to create more economic benefit. but you take that incentive away. Our friends. the Democrats. would leave you to believe that taxation is a zero sum game. that when rates go up. revenues always come that way. and arent we for making sure that we balance our budget? Well. let me tell you what? It didnt work that way. We were spending hundreds of billions of dollars more. Instead of an economy that was working. we were paying unemployment compensationpeople not to be employed. people to be at home. a terrible cost not only to humanity but also to our Treasury. We need people to go to work. and encouraging them to do this through our Tax Code means that people can have the dignity of work. the opportunity to make their life better. and perhaps more importantly. a chance for America to grow its GDP. We have examples over and over that we have seen about how taxation legislation affects behavior. and certainly in my home State of Texas. I remember in the 1980s and the early 1990s. when revenue was at a premium for the Democrats who ran our House and Senate in Texas. and of course they wanted to raise more revenue. and they were always looking for ways to raise revenue. I remember them looking when I was just out of high school at personalized license plates. and they looked at how much money came in for personalized license plates. I want to say it was $30 for the plates. They needed more revenue. so they just doubled that amount of money that it would cost. knowing they would get twice as much revenue. But it didnt work that way. Mr. Speaker. Not surprisingly. fewer Texans bought more license plates. But to the Democrats. it was a simple matter under static scoring of just saying they wanted more money. and they were going to increase the rates. It doesnt happen that way because the American people or citizens understand they would no longer buy something at a different rate. The same thing is true of tax rates. Mr. Speaker. We have the exact same problem. where people who are working and working hard. when you take away their money. there is less money that they can put into the economy to grow another job. to give somebody a chance at a new job. These are the things we are going to be looking at. how we can maximize through the effort of Dr. PRICE. through the effort of PAUL RYAN. the Ways and Means Committee. the Budget Committee to bring the leading edge ideas instead of saying. no. it is really a zero sum game. If you want to do something. you have to really raise taxes. you cant give money back to people because. oh my gosh. the Federal Government would be in trouble. Well. we are not. It would change from unemployment compensation to people working. and Republicans believe in work. We believe in empowering communities and people standing a chance to go from unemployment and welfare to a chance to have a job. We are going to get this done. Let me be clear. Republicans are not arguing that tax cuts always pay for themselves. They dont. But instead we are acknowledging that when it is done right. when you study what you are doing. you can make an effort to have a tax cut to grow the economy. I believe Republicans understand that the American economy and Americans are better off when they keep more of their paychecks. Lastly. this rules package defends the Houses constitutional role in our system of checks and balances by providing for continuation of legal actions against the executive branch. It will allow the House to pursue its lawsuits and to enforce subpoenas. for instance. in the Fast and Furious investigation. where we have seen guns that were sold by the United States Government and put into hands of very dangerous people all around our world. including in Mexico and other places. only to find they come back and appear where they were involved in murders in the United States. It is a lawless action that was taken by our Department of Justice. It is wrong. and we are going to continue pursuing this. So it means that we are going to look at those things that this Federal Government is doing that we believe are unconstitutional and should change also. We also believe in a lawsuit against the executive branch regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In short. this package makes it perfectly clear that our constitutional order still matters. and it is Congress job to write the law and for the President to faithfully execute it. We are not going to stand by and watch this President go and write laws and to execute them down the block. We are going to make sure we do it the way the Constitution spoke about. Certainly we know that IPAB. which is a part of the Presidents package. where he has this group of people that have unlimited power to make decisions over health care. over people as opposed to a physician. we are going to limit that authority. We believe we are within the right in doing this because the American people want and need a health care system that works. not one that we cannot afford and we cannot find a doctor. and where the government and a bureaucrat make decisions as opposed to a physician and a patient. Regardless of what one thinks about ObamaCare. all Members of Congress should be united to preserve and protect the role of the House of Representatives and our ability to make the laws on behalf of people and work with the President in that. Finally. the package is going to allow the Speaker to recognize Members for the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day through January 16. 2015. I believe it is vital. We saw this several years ago. Mr. Speaker. where we came down to the floor of the House and took turns at reading the Constitution. It is a vital part of our history. It is important that we understand it serves this great Nation that separates us from so many other countries. the rule of law and constitutional guidance. This rules package that I have outlined will better enable the House to perform our duties. It will help us with our obligations. our integrity. and transparency and accountability. and it is going to help us to make sure that we work well together with each other. Our friends. whether they are Republicans or Democrats. elected Members of this body. I am very proud to say that this resolution represents so many great things. I think it is a balanced package. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Unfortunately. I dont have time to respond to many of the representations that Mr. SESSIONS made with reference to our economy. but we can all agree that our most important responsibilities as Members of Congress is to grow this economy. create the kinds of jobs that Americans need so that they can succeed and support themselves and their families. I want to speak about a couple of things in this rules package. Traditionally. Democrats will vote against and Republicans will vote for because traditionally this is a partisan vote. I urge the Rules Committee chairman to adopt a couple of changes which I thought would make this rules package a better one. First. I ask the House to move to ban discrimination against gay. lesbian. bisexual. and transgender employees. We provide in our rules that you cannot discriminate against people based upon race. nationality. gender. and other arbitrary distinctions. We should have added this as we have in so many of our laws. Currently there are no protections for a congressional staffer fired or refused promotion simply for LGBT status. I regret that the Rules Committee was unprepared to offer such a protection to our employees. Secondly. since Republicans assumed the majority in 2011. Delegates from the District of Columbia. the U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam. Samoa. and the Northern Mariana Islands as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico have been denied the opportunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole. They can vote in committees. and the Committee of the Whole is of course a committee of the House. It is not a final arbiter. When I was majority leader. I offered that amendment in the rules. It passed. My Republican friends took it to court. and the court said that it was sustainable and sustained it. This effectively. unfortunately. denies representation to nearly 5 million Americans. Americans. one of whom is on the Republican side of the aisle from American Samoa. So this is a bipartisan concern that I have. Unfortunately. this rules package put forward by the Republican majority does not include either change. In addition. this rules package does not live up to the responsible governing the American people expect and deserve from Congress. Mr. SESSIONS spent a long time talking about scoring. static scoring versus dynamic scoring. Dynamic scoring I would suggest to the American people is a gamble. It is a gamble that your projection is correct. If your projection is not correct. as it has so often been. then you end up putting the deficit even higher because you bet on the come. The more conservative policy. I would suggest. would be to get the money first and then decide how you are going to apply it. Dont gamble on the fact that you are going to get the money. which is what dynamic scoring is. The gentleman admittedhe did not arguethat cutting taxes always paid for themselves. In fact. Alan Greenspan said exactly that in the last decade. What it means is the Republicans will be able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves. They do not. This provision will allow them to explode the deficit as they did the last time they were in charge. The last time the budget was balanced was not under the Bush administration when you had a Republican Congress. a Republican Senate. and a Republican President. It was when Bill Clinton was President of the United States. For 4 years we had a balanced budget. It also threatens to politicize the Congressional Budget Office. which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades. which makes us be honest. which is what the American public expects. Rely on the figures that are not political figures but are independent analytical figures on which we can rely. I urge my colleagues to vote against this rules package. It can be a better package. it should be. And if it is defeated. we can adopt a better. more fair package. Mr. Speaker. we are at the start of a new Congress. and we have an opportunity to right two wrongs in the rules of this House. I wrote to the Chairman of the Rules last month asking that two changes be made in todays rules package. First. I asked that the House move to ban discrimination against gay. lesbian. bisexual. and transgender employees. Currently. there are no protections for a Congressional staffer fired or refused a promotion simply for LGBT status. Second. since Republicans assumed the majority in 2011. delegates from the District of Columbia. U.S. Virgin Islands. Guam. Samoa. and the Northern Mariana Islands. as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico. have been denied the opportunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. This effectively denies representation to nearly 5 million Americans. Unfortunately. this rules package. put forward by the Republican majority. does not include either change. In addition. this rules package does not live up to the responsible governing the American people expect and deserve from their Congress. First. it includes something called \"Dynamic Scoring.\" What it means is that Republicans will be able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that \"tax cuts pay for themselves.\" They do notand this provision will allow them to explode the deficit. as they did the last time they were in charge. It also threatens to politicize the Congressional Budget Office. which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades. The rules package also extends the Benghazi select committee. placing conspiracy theories above fact. At least three committeestwo led by Republicansexhaustively investigated the Benghazi tragedy. Everything has been reviewed. a million dollars in taxpayer money last year were wasted. And. furthermore. these rules would limit the ability of Congress to reallocate resources between Social Security trust funds. making it more difficult to prevent automatic cuts to Social Security disability insurance. We can do betterand should do betterin this House for the 114th Congress. I urge my colleagues to reject this rules package. and I call on Chairman SESSIONS and his Republican colleagues to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats to enact rules that enhance the work of this House. protect LGBT employees. include all of the voices in our democracy. and set guidelines that facilitate greater cooperation. not more partisan gridlock.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank my colleague. Mr. Speaker. it is absolutely astounding that within minutesminutesof our being sworn in. our Republican colleagues want to pass a rule that will stack the deck in favor of trying to give another big tax cut not to the middle class. but to millionaires. the folks at the very top. That is what their budget does. What is equally astounding is that this economic theory of trickledown economics crashed and burned in the real world between 2001 and 2008. Our Republican colleague says that if you give millionaires these tax cuts. they are going to spend them. and a little bit will trickle down to the middle class and people who aspire to the middle class and boost everybody up. That is not what happened. What happened? Sure. the folks who got the tax cuts at the top. they did better. Nobody else did. In fact. real wages went down. What went up? The deficitand everybody has to pay for that deficit. Now. I heard the Speaker this morning say he wanted to deal with the issue of wage stagnation. That is what we should be focused on. We shouldnt be talking about tax cuts for the wealthy and a trickledown theory. We should try to build this economy from the middle class out and from the bottom up. I am glad the Speaker said that because we are going to give him an opportunity to vote for something that will address wage stagnation. I am going to offer a motion at the end of this debate. It is called the CEOEmployee Paycheck Fairness Act. and it addresses this issue. If you look back in the 1960s and 1970s. when workers were working hard. they got paid more. but beginning around 1979. they kept working hard. productivity kept going up. but their wages got flat. What happened during the same time? CEOs took care of themselves. Their pay started to go up and up and up. It used to be about 20 times that of the average worker. In other words. the CEO and the folks at the top got about 20 times what they were paying their employees. but as you can see. it has now shot up so that CEOs and the top guys get paid about 300 times what their workers are getting paid. We have a simple proposition: that corporations should not be able to deduct the bonuses and compensation for their CEOs and other executives over $1 million unless they are giving their employees a fair shake. a fair wage. Right? Why should the taxpayers be subsidizing that? Between 2007 and 2010. they took about $66 billion. thereabouts. in deductions for bonuses for performance pay when they were sometimes laying off employees and cutting their paychecks. so we say: \"Hey. okay. pay yourselves what you want. but if you want the taxpayers to allow you to deduct your bonuses and performance pay. for goodness sakes. you had better be giving your employees a fair shake.\" Over time. that would close that gap in worker productivity and wages and do what the Speaker said he wanted to do this morning. which is deal with wage stagnation. Lets help the workers. not just the CEOs. Lets vote for the CEOEmployee Paycheck Fairness Act.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to the Republican rule package and to the previous question. If we defeat that question. Ms. SLAUGHTER will offer an amendment to end corporate desertion. Over the last decade. we have seen nearly 50 American companies try to avoid taxes by moving their mailboxes overseas. but they leave their operations here. effectively renouncing their U.S. citizenship in order to dodge taxes. These companies benefit from American education. research and development incentives. and infrastructure. all taxpayer supported. but when their own tax bill arrives. they hide overseas and are no longer American corporations. They even have the temerityand this is legal under the law today. and it shouldnt bethey have the temerity then to apply for Federal contracts. but they deny their U.S. citizenship when it comes to paying their taxes. Mr. Speaker. what this amendment would do is make sure that they pay their fair share. The extra revenue goes to the highway trust fund. That trust fund runs out of money in May if we do not act. Anyone who has driven a car lately knows how badly our roads need investment. Our highways are crumbling beneath our wheels. 65 percent of our major roads are in less than good condition. and onequarter of our bridges require repair or improvements. The backlog of projects grows longer by the day. At a time when globalization is gathering pace. this state of affairs puts Americas competitiveness in jeopardy. According to the World Economic Forum. the United States has slipped from 7th to 18th in the quality of our roadways. Replenishing the highway trust fund will reverse this trend. unleash economic growth. and create thousands of good jobs that cannot be sent overseas. If we want business to invest in this Nation. we must be prepared to do the same. Instead of lining the pockets of corporate deserters. we should be revitalizing our roadways. That is the path to a better. stronger. and more sustainable economy. This amendment puts us back on the right track.",

There were many. Since 2009. the stock market has soared another 10.000 points. In 2009. our budget deficit stood at $1.4 trillion. Today. according to current projections. we have sliced that deficit to $514 billion. and we have created 10 million new jobs. the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history. When I left home yesterday. I left my wife with a full tank of gas. and I did so paying less than $2 per gallon. It was the first time I have been able to do that in 5 years. We have achieved much progress over the past several years. Now. we must get about the work of making sure that progress is shared by all. Mr. Speaker. in a few moments. we will cast some substantive votes. These votes will literally set the rules of the game for the next 2 years. They will be a very clear reflection of our respective parties priorities. While Republicans rules changes seem to rig the game in favor of the wealthy. Democrats will immediately force a vote on job creation. bigger paychecks for working families. and American competitiveness and economic growth. Democrats want to put people to work building roads and bridges that will connect our economy in the 21st century. We will ensure that every American shares in our Nations prosperity by taking away corporate tax deductions for millionaire executive compensation unless their employees get a raise as well. It is simple. Mr. Speaker. House Republicans first priority in the 114th Congress is stacking the deck for those with the highest incomes and for voodoo. trickledown economics. House Democrats first priority is to put Americans in a better place by creating jobs. standing up for working families. and growing the economy for all. The contrast could not be more stark. Mr. Speaker. House Democrats numbers may be smaller in the 114th. but we are stronger in our unity and resolve to grow and strengthen middle income Americans. Today. with our votes on the new rules.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished ranking member for the time. Mr. Speaker. I suppose I should simply take this time to say to my colleagues: welcome back. happy new year. and I missed you. Technically. we are considering. debating. and voting on the Republican majoritys \"rules package.\" but that is sort of a misnomer. The word \"rules.\" as most of us understand it. means a set of procedures that someone is required to follow. but if my Republican friends have demonstrated anything over the past few years. it is that they have absolutely no intention of following the rules of the House. They routinely waive. ignore. or break the rules of this House whenever it is convenient or politically expedient for them to do so. The gentleman from Texas says the Speaker of the House promised the most open Congress in history. I hate to remind him that the Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in history during the 113th Congress. Let me just mention a couple of the most egregious provisions in this package before us today. First. my Republican friends believe we should adopt the voodoo economics of socalled dynamic scoring. Under this fairy tale. they would have us believe that tax cuts for the very wealthy dont increase the deficit. Never mind that time after time after time in our history. those tax cuts for the rich have caused an explosion in our deficit. This rules package would have us believe that up is down and left is right. Second. this package would allow committee staff from the Ways and Means Committee. Financial Services. Energy and Commerce. and the Science Committee to take depositions under oath. Currently. only the Oversight Committee has that authority. Mr. Speaker. I served as a staff member in this House for the late Congressman Joe Moakley. Our staff members are dedicated public servants who work incredibly hard. but this provision. quite frankly. goes too far. Mr. Speaker. we ought to be spending our time on rebuilding our aging infrastructure and increasing workers paychecks rather than making it easier to conduct more political witch hunts. which the American people are fed up with. Mr. Speaker. I am honored to serve on the Rules Committee. and that word \"rules\" used to mean something.

It is deception. what some could even rightly call tax fraud. since this amounts to deliberate misrepresentation of tax data. Republicans are admitting right here on day one that they dont know how to balance the budget. When the budget numbers will not add up. when the arithmetic just doesnt work for them. they change the numbers with magical new math. Where the books wont balance with the numbers that you have got. Republicans say. \"Use the numbers you would like to have.\" All their previous talk about budget discipline and balancing budgets was really about trying to dismantle Democratic efforts to provide an opportunity ladder up for all Americans. to assure dignity in retirement. and to protect families from the risk of illnessthat ladder of security and protection that many Republicans were never for in the first place. Now. to free themselves from the hard work of responsible. balanced budgets. Republicans are compelling the House for the first time in American history to rely upon something they call \"dynamic scoring\"-That is just a euphemism for whimsy. speculation. and wishful thinkingthe thin veneer for a failed political ideology. One leading Republican expert. former Senate budget staff director Bill Hoagland. has said that instead of this scoring gimmick that they are using today. he would \"rather [they] just simply belly up to the bar\" and \"admit up front that they cant lower rates without adding to the deficit.\" Todays actions remind me of a riddle some attribute to President Abraham Lincoln: \"How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four. because calling a tail a leg doesnt make it a leg.\" And calling a budget \"balanced\" when it doesnt have adequate revenue does not make it so. Passing a budget requires hard work.

I want to speak to the issue of macroeconomic analysis as the incoming chair of the Budget Committee. The other side has said this is a gamble. that we are gambling that the projections are going to be correct. Mr. Speaker. this is craziness. That is not so. In fact. all economic projectionsstatic. dynamicall of them have a level of uncertainty. We have heard that it is \"stacking the deck\" or that it is \"cooking the books\" in favor of tax cuts. Nonsense. Nonsense. It doesnt game the system at all. All we are trying to do is make certain that Members of Congress have more information upon which to be able to make decisions. That is the kind of commonsense things that our folks back home want. Scoring. which is what we are talking about here. the Congressional Budget Office works hard to try to determine what the effect is of the kind of policies that we adopt around here. They will tell you right now that now it is inaccurate. Now it is inaccurate. What we are trying to do is simply say that if a piece of legislation is going to have a large effect on the economy. that we include that effect in the official estimate. So if you think a bill is going to help or hurt the economyhelp or hurt the economythen they ought to tell us. They ought to let us know how many more jobs are going to be created. what kind of tax revenue up or down is going to occur. Is it going to harm jobs? The people who prepare our cost estimates. I tell you. they are the best in the business. and they have been working on this issue for years. Mr. Speaker. this may come as some surprise to our friends on the other side. but they already do this kind of analysis. They already do the macroeconomic analysis. It is just that we dont include it in our cost estimate because of the rules. And we should. That is why we are offering this change today. We dont predetermine the outcome. We simply make it so that the Congressional Budget Office is allowed. the scorekeepers are allowed. to have a more realistic score. It has come as no surprise. talking to economists from around the country over the past couple of weeks. over the past couple of months. and to a person they say economic scoring. the effects of legislation that we pass. it is an inaccurate science. It is hard to do. But what we want to do is to make certain that they have greater opportunity to get that scoring correct. to give us the kind of information so we can make wiser decisions. Mr. Speaker. this isnt about cooking the books or gaming the system. This is about trying to do the hard work of the American people. trying to get the policies that we adopt here in this Congress correct so that we can get the American people back to work and get this economy thriving again. I commend the gentleman from Texas for the work that he has done and urge adoption of the rules.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. It is time to get to work. Americans dont care who won or lost in the election. They just want us to get our work done. They want us to work together to solve the problems that they see every day. They want us to boost job growth. and they want us to build an economy that works for all Americans. not just the privileged few. The rules of the road that should guide this Congress should be built on the foundation that has increased opportunities for American families over the last few yearsnearly 11 million new jobs. 57 consecutive months of job growth. the longest streak in our countrys history. There are 10 million more Americans with health insurance. which means more security for those Americans. The deficit has been cut by twothirds since 2009. What is the one piece of the puzzle that we now need to work on? In that span of time since we have seen things go better. the economy has grown 12 percent. corporate profits have grown by 46 percent. and the stock market by 92 percent. What hasnt grown? The paycheck that the average American gets day in and day out for working to do all those things to make it possible for the stock market and corporations to succeed. So it is time for us to focus on the middle of America that works hard every month and gets a paycheck but doesnt see that paycheck grow. This rules package requires Congress to use fuzzy math. socalled dynamic scoring. to make it easier to give massive tax breaks to special interests and the wealthy. Is that what the middle class wants? No. Republicans have also added a midnight change to this rules package that rigs the rules against 59 million Americans who currently receive Social Security and to the 160 million Americans who are working today to get Social Security in the future and dont know if Social Security will be there based on these rules. That is not what Americans in the middle want. Congress should be in the business of making life better. not worse. for everyday Americans. So lets establish rules of the road for this Congress that let us build on the economic progress of nearly 11 million new Americans going back to work. 57 months straight of job growth. What we dont need are rules of the road for this House that give a green light to reckless legislating that favors special interests and the privileged few at the expense of the middle class and Americas Social Security.",

So what this is. in a few words: Republicans today are extending their embrace of voodoo economics by wrapping their arms around voodoo score keeping. Again. it is not about more information. It is being able to cook the books to implement their longheld discredited notion that tax cuts pay for themselves. I think the former Reagan and George H.W.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. and I thank her for her wonderful work on behalf of the American people as the ranking member on the Rules Committee for such a long time and in such a very strong way. My colleagues. I congratulate you and your families on your swearing in today. We had a lovely ceremony earlier. Eventually it became that. after we knew the outcome of the vote. But it is clear that the election at the polls in November demonstrated that the American people are hopeful that this new Congress can work together to grow our economy and. in turn. grow paychecks for American workers. Honoring that trust. House Democrats today are putting forward a legislative package to increase paychecks for working families and put Americans back to work building the roads and bridges our country needs. paid for by keeping our tax dollars here at home. I talked about this a little bit earlier when I introduced the Speaker. What we are proposing. sadly. is in sharp contrast to what the Republicans have in this rule. The first vote that the Republicans are asking this Congress to take in the new Congress will be to advance additional tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests. When they talk about dynamic scoringwhen they talk about dynamic scoringit is a very bad deal for middleincome families in our country. In sharp contrast to them. we will bring forth the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in Americas Infrastructure Act. which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship in order to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop rewarding companies that move overseas and instead use those dollars to create goodpaying jobs here at home. Every chance any of us gets. we have to make that point. I dont see anything partisan about it. And many Republicans have voted in this manner in the past. So this was supposed to be something where we have common ground. House Democrats will also put forth the CEOEmployee Pay Fairness Act. and that is legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their productivity. denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on income over $1 million unless they give their employees a welldeserved raise. The American people are owed an open and transparent debate on these issues. Today. with this rules package. Republicans are shutting down debate for Democrats and Republicans. With their extending of the amount of time it takes for Members to put forth a motion to instruct. they are shutting down debate. They are rejecting transparency and openness. That is what the American people want: transparency and openness. In all that we do in Congress. we must keep the hopes. dreams. and aspirations of the American people in the forefront. We must be committed to do this is a bipartisan way. an open and transparent way. This bill today rejects that. Now what I want to say. and we all have been reading our Christmas cards and all the rest. but one of the ones that I want to share with you which is irrelevant to our discussion today is from my friend Jack Trout. What he said in \"A Seasonal Greeting for the Times\": To borrow a Biblical reference. the money changers have taken over the temple. What is behind all of this is a concerted effort by wealthy companies and people to protect the status quo and their vested interests. The result is the sad fact that the middle class gets squeezed while the rich get richer. This squeeze is why the consumerled economy has been so slow to rebound after the financial crisis. What people fail to realize is the simple fact that the middle class are the real job creators in America. They generate demand. which. in turn. builds markets. The middle class put \"merry\" into Merry Christmas. I mention this because the fact is that it is true that when the consumer economy. which is what we are. is alive and well and thriving. they spend money. inject demand in the economy. create jobs. and our economic recovery is accelerated. Dynamic scoring. suppressing debate. and some of the other things contained in this rule are contrary to that and antagonistic to the financial stability of the middle class. So I hope that our colleaguesand there are so many reasons to go through. But what means the most to Americas working families is their financial stability. On that subject alone. were it not even for other things in this bill which we could talk about all day that should be rejected. but just because it. again. has a negative impact on the growth of our economy when it comes to supporting the financial stability of the middle class we should vote \"no\" on this. The Democrats offer a sharp contrast. The motion that will be made to call the previous question is one that calls for us to talk about building the infrastructure of America. The motion to commit that will be put forth by Mr. VAN HOLLEN is one that is fair in terms of pay to our workers. So for many reasons. Mr. Speaker. I urge our colleagues to vote \"no.\" This isnt what was talked about in terms of ideals and values this morning. This is about putting the squeeze on the middle class. doing it in a nontransparent way. and doing it under the rules of the House. I urge a \"no\" vote.",

I just hope that it doesnt trigger 2 years of swearing at. It really does not have to be that way. Mr. Speaker. Democrats in this House will work with the majority to find commonsense solutions to ease the squeeze. to support paycheck growth for the middle class. What better middle ground than the middle class. Mr. Speaker. The problem with this rules package is it is stacked against the middle class. it is stacked against tax cuts for the middle class. it is stacked against paycheck growth for the middle class. In contrast. Mr. Speaker. here is what House Democrats are proposing. It is very simple. Number one. bigger paychecks for the middle class. Under the current rules that the majority supports. Mr. Speaker. a CEO can get a milliondollar bonus and deduct that million dollars from taxes. That shifts that tax burden to an underpaid worker for that CEO. Now. how is that fair? How is that fair? It is not. It is bad enough that middle class workers paychecks are squeezed. but sticking the middle class worker with a bill for the CEOs taxes as a result of that million dollar bonus is unconscionable. We have a better way. a better contrast. something that will grow paychecks for the middle class. Second. under the rules. in the stacked deck that the majority supports. a big corporation can ship jobs overseas. With those jobs overseas go bigger bridges. better roads. better airports. and faster airplanes. Meanwhile. in my district on Long Island. Mr. Speaker. the average middle class worker has to drive through potholes. has longer delays. slower trains. antiquated transportation systems. and delayed airplanes because all of the infrastructure is being built abroad. It is bad enough that corporations are given incentives to ship jobs overseas. It is unconscionable that under these rules those corporations are able to build infrastructure in those foreign places while America decays. Under our contrast. Mr. Speaker. we will invest in America. we will rebuild America. we will create new jobs in America. improving our infrastructure. It is bad enough to be underpaid. Mr. Speaker. but to be underpaid and have to drive through potholes. that is even worse. Mr. Speaker. on this first day of this new Congress until the very last day of this new Congress. the American people are going to want to know whose side we are on. With these two votes we clearly demonstrate and clearly establish who is on whose side. I urge my colleagues in this majority on this first day to establish for the American people whose backs they have: the special interests. tax deductions for milliondollar bonuses. foreign corporations. or rebuilding America and rebuilding American jobs.",

Chairman SESSIONS. the Speakers Office. and the other committee chairmen for working with me to hone and clarify the Judiciary Committees criminal law jurisdiction. For many years. the House rules have given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over. among other things. the judiciary and judicial proceedings. civil and criminal. and criminal law enforcement. The Judiciary Committees jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the committee in 1813. In recent years. however. we have become aware of an anomaly in the referral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Committee from obtaining a referral when a bill criminalizes new conduct without actually addressing the penalty portion of the criminal law. In other words. while the Judiciary Committee would have had jurisdiction over the underlying statute when it was enacted. it is sometimes unable to assert jurisdiction when the statute is amended in such a way as to criminalize new conduct. The result is that new criminal offenses are being created without being considered by the lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee. which is the committee best situated to provide valuable expertise in drafting and resolving potential conflicts with existing criminal law. Last Congress. the Judiciary Committee created a bipartisan OverCriminalization Task Force with the goal of examining the problems associated with a bloated. disorganized. and often redundant collection of Federal criminal offenses. The Congressional Research Service recently reported to us that there are nearly 5.000 Federal criminal laws on the books. Unfortunately. Congress continues to add to this number at a rate of roughly 50 new crimes per year. One of the recurring themes from both the witnesses who appeared before the task force as well as the members of the task force is that it is crucial that the Judiciary Committee have the opportunity to review all new Federal criminal laws. Throughout its existence. this bipartisan task force endeavored to closely examine the problems posed by overcriminalization and overFederalization. and to identify potential solutions to combat the regrettable circumstances that inevitably arise from the tangled web of Federal criminal provisions. Examples of similarlysituated defendants convicted of the same conduct under different statutes with different penalties. or individuals convicted of offenses without proof of any level of criminal intent. have been detailed in our hearings and are far too commonplace. The rules package today clarifies the committees jurisdiction over criminal matters by adding one word-\"criminalization\"-to our existing jurisdiction over criminal law. By making this change. the Judiciary Committee will have a new jurisdictional interest only in those relatively rare instances that a bill criminalizes new conduct by amending a statute that is attached to a criminal penalty without amending the penalty itself. In this instance. the Judiciary Committee will look to work with the other committee on ensuring that the new conduct is worthy of criminalization and that the attached criminal penalties are appropriately drafted. The Judiciary Committee is not looking to insert itself into the regulatory schemes under the jurisdiction of other committees. However. to the extent that another committee chooses to use the criminal justice system to enforce the regulation under its jurisdiction. we would like to be involved so that we may ask the important question together as to whether particular conduct should be criminalized. In conclusion. I believe this small clarification of the Judiciary Committees jurisdiction will allow us to address many of the problems associated with the tangled web of Federal criminal laws. Again. I would like to thank Chairman SESSIONS and his staff for working very closely with us on this issue and express my strong support. I urge my colleagues to vote for this rules package.

For many years. the House Rules have given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over. among other things. \"the judiciary and judicial proceedings. civil and criminal.\" and \"criminal law enforcement.\" The Judiciary Committees jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the committee in Typically. the Judiciary Committee either receives a referral upon introduction or has the opportunity to seek a sequential referral when a bill creates a new criminal law or criminal penalties. This allows us to ensure that a criminal provision is properly drafted. or eliminated if it is unnecessary. In recent years. however. we have become aware of an anomaly in the referral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Committee from obtaining a referral when a bill criminalizes new conduct without actually addressing the penalty portion of the criminal law.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this House rules package has a number of other provisions with which we have serious concerns. Most significantly. the rules change relating to Social Security. Late last night. the Republican rules package was revised to include a major new provision that will likely force Social Security benefit cuts. The new rule would prevent the House from considering legislation to prevent a scheduled 20 percent cut to Social Security benefits for 11 million disabled workers and their families (by creating a point of order against legislation that reallocates FICA taxes between the Social Security Trust Funds. which have a current overall balance of $2.8 trillion). unless the legislation also includes Social Security benefit cuts or tax increases. Without any substantive debate and out of public view. the rule would prevent the House from even considering a mechanism endorsed by more than 50 advocacy groups and which Congress has used 11 times in the past to address shortfalls in one of the trust funds. H. Res. 5 also extends staff deposition authority to four more committees (Energy and Commerce. Financial Services. Science. and Ways and Means). We are deeply concerned that these new authorities will be used to launch politically motivated attacks on the Affordable Care Act. Environmental Protection Agency actions. the implementation of DoddFrank financial industry reform. and IRS regulations. Democrats are disappointed that House Republicans have decided to continue their politicallymotivated lawsuit against the President over implementation of the Affordable Care Act and their partisan investigations into \"Fast and Furious\" and the attack in Benghazi. Libya. Extensions of those authorities also appear in H. Res. 5. H. Res. 5s changes to the motion to instruct also concern us deeply. Under current rules. motions to instruct conferees can be offered 25 legislative days and 10 calendar days after conference committees have been appointed. H. Res. 5 lengthens these periods. so that motions to instruct would be privileged 45 calendar days and 25 legislative days after the conference is appointed. This is clearly an attempt to weaken the Minoritys ability to participate in the conference committee process in the future. Changes to the authorizing language of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group have the potential to make it politically easier for the Majority to file additional lawsuits against the President. and this possibility disturbs us given the events surrounding the filing of the ACArelated lawsuit last Congress. H. Res. 5 contains a number of other provisions. some of which raise concerns and some of which appear to be innocuous. For example. small changes to the jurisdiction of certain committees. an increase in the size of the Intelligence Committee. an allowance for extra subcommittees on the Agriculture. Armed Services. Foreign Affairs. and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees. and allowing the Speaker to reconvene the House at a time other than previously appointed after consultation with the Minority Leader. among others.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in this resolution. we are establishing a new requirement in clause 8 of Rule XIII that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) incorporate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (Budget Act) the macroeconomic effects of \"major legislation.\" Because this rule builds on the existing requirement for cost estimates. it does not apply to appropriations legislation. By including an analysis of how major legislation will affect the economy. this rule provides the House with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional. conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy. In particular. this analysis is required to include the budgetary effects of changes in economic output. employment. the capital stock. and other macroeconomic variables resulting from major legislation. In addition. this rule requires a qualitative assessment of the longterm budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legislation. Major legislation is defined as legislation causing an increase or decrease in revenues. outlays. or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the projected gross domestic product for that year. In applying the 0.25 percent threshold. CBO and JCT are required to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation. In carrying out this requirement. the intent is that CBO and JCT review provisions in the bill that have a significant effect. Thus. the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold. or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the threshold. rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provisions are netted out. Alternately. for legislation that may not have a large fiscal effect. but would still have significant economic impacts. the new rule empowers the House to designate \"major legislation.\" For all legislation other than purely revenue legislation. the rule authorizes the chair of the Budget Committee to designate \"major legislation.\" For purely revenue legislation (i.e.. legislation that contains only provisions described in section 201(f) of the Budget Act). the rule authorizes the House Member serving as the chair or vice chair of JCT. to designate \"major legislation\" for purposes of this rule. The rule carefully preserves the existing division of labor between CBO and JCT. which requires close collaboration between these two nonpartisan institutions. When major legislation involves both revenue and nonrevenue provisions. CBO and JCT will need to work together to produce a single. integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agencys institutional responsibilities. The rule requires enhanced transparency around these budgetary estimates. Both CBO and JCT. as applicable. must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying such estimates. It is important that CBO and JCT make this information available so that the public. academic. and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pursue possible improvements in the methodologies used to develop these estimates. Distributional analyses of proposed tax changes that JCT provides as background information is another area where estimates could be improved by incorporating macroeconomic effects into these analyses. The preparation of cost estimates incorporating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates. Committees should therefore build in additional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate. Both CBO and JCT should strive to promptly produce the estimates required by this rule. To the extent it is not practicable for CBO and JCT to produce the required estimates. the rule provides an accommodation in this instance. Two possible circumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis. First. committees and the House may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for CBO or JCT to complete the analysis prior to the legislations consideration. Second. while CBO and JCT have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses. there may be situations where it is not possible for CBO and JCT to produce the required analysis.

In fact. over 9 million veterans are already getting health care through the VA. but they are not exempt. Every employer has to cover them anyway. So here is what is happening. Businesses have an incentive to turn away veterans. not because they dont want to hire them. but because it is too expensive to hire them. This is serving as a penalty to hiring our Nations veterans.

I guess. as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We look forward to working together. Madam Speaker. I support this bill. This bill encourages the hiring of veterans. The unemployment rate has continued to decline for post9/11 veterans. and these improvements are part of a larger economic recovery. In November 2013. the unemployment rate for these veterans was nearly 10 percent. One year later. the rate has dropped to 5.7 percent. the national average. yet for female post9/11 veterans. the unemployment rate remains high. above 8 percent. This bill continues as part of our national commitment to help the veterans of this country. I want to emphasize this if I might: as we legislate. we need to balance priorities. We need to maintainvery differently than just spokenthe basic structure of ACA. which is providing millions and millions of Americans with insurance and with coverage they never had. We also need to encourage the hiring of the veterans of this country who have served this Nation and serve this Nation so well. That is a supreme obligation of this institution. therefore. I support this legislation and reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker. I was a freshman lawmaker in 2010 when the Presidents partisan health care law was passed through Congress and became law. I worried at the time that it would take our health care system in the wrong direction and would lead to numerous unintended consequences that could hurt American families. Now that the law is being implemented. we can see that this is indeed true. The employer mandate penalty tax is a troublesome and confusing piece of the Presidents health care law. The American people want to see it fixed. The legislation that we are debating right now will exempt those who employ members of our Nations military and veterans from the employer mandate. Because our current and former servicemembers already receive health care from TRICARE and the VA. it simply does not make sense to force small businesses to treat these folks as if they do not have health insurance. which drives up the cost of doing business. leaving less for employees salaries. In fact. the current law effectively punishes small businesses for hiring these heroes. Madam Speaker. I was a proud cosponsor and supporter of this legislation in the last Congress. and I am happy to again stand today in support of this commonsense provision. I ask that you support it.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am rising today in very strong support of this Hire More Heroes Act introduced by my friend. the gentleman from Illinois . someone whom I have been privileged to work with and am proud to cosponsor this legislation. When he first came to me with this idea. it was a nobrainer that I would support it because of the key constituencies that this legislation serves: our veterans and our small businesses. In addition to that. I think. as we kick off this 114th Congress. it is a great message and exactly the right tone that we are focused on these two constituencies. By exempting veterans who have health insurance through the VA or from the DOD from being counted toward that 50employee limit under the Affordable Care Act. this legislation creates important incentives. It encourages small businesses to grow and expand their workforce. and it establishes an incentive to hire more veterans. Madam Speaker. there are many people who already receive insurance because of their service to our country. I used to be one of them. I was covered under TRICARE for a long period of time after both of my deployments to the Middle East. and it just makes sense that these individuals who already have great medical coverage would not have to count towards the numbers of employees that would trigger the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Most importantly. this bill is about serving veterans. Servicemembers who are transitioning to civilian life bring exceptional training. critical skill sets. and proven leadership ability back to their local communities. Unfortunately. as a country. we are facing an unacceptable number of unemployed veterans. people who are experienced. who are capable and energetic. who are coming back from serving oftentimes in conflicts overseas. These are veterans who will serve as a great asset to businesses and organizations of any size because they come with a builtin unique work ethic. a great deal of training. and realworld experience. These are people who are highly disciplined. who know what it means to work as a member of a team. They know what it means to put the mission first. and they are servant leaders at their very best. This bill provides an incentive for businesses to hire these veterans and. in turn. helps these veterans be successful in their transition to civilian life. This commonsense legislation benefits both veterans and small businesses. while also growing our economy. I urge all of our colleagues to strongly support H.R. 22.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman and Representative RODNEY DAVIS. Today I honor the 54.000 veterans in my district and 20 million veterans across America who deserve the opportunity to have a job with the Hire More Heroes Act. The bill makes a change to ObamaCare and encourages small businesses to hire more veterans by exempting veterans as long as they already have health insurance. Currently. the employer mandate under ObamaCare requires that all businesses with more than 50 employees provide health insurance to their employers or pay a penalty. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. the unemployment rate for veterans last year was 6.6 percent. for those who served on Active Duty after 9111 it was 9 percent. What saddens me about this is both of these percentages were higher than the national average of 6.3 percent. No veteran in the United States of America should be jobless because of ObamaCares employer mandate. Our brave men and women return from serving our Nation. return to civilian life while facing many challenges. Getting a job should not be one of them. This bill will ensure that employers can and will hire veterans and will not be penalized. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We must do everything in our power to ensure our finest men and women who come home have every opportunity we promised them.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank you for this opportunity today. Chairman RYAN. my colleague from the great State of Michigan. I thank you for your support for this piece of legislation. Earlier today. a new Congress was sworn in. each of us swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. A new Congress is another opportunity to do the peoples work. to further the ideas and priorities of our constituents and put our Nation on solid footing for an even brighter future. I am honored that this 114th Congress is opening with the Hire More Heroes Act. a bill that I have introduced and an idea that didnt come from Washington. D.C. It began with a constituent of mine. Brad Lavite. who is actually up in the gallery today. Brad had this idea. and as a superintendent of the Madison County Veterans Assistance Commission. I am proud to have him here today to see the culmination of what that idea has turned into and the bipartisan support that you see for this idea on the floor of the House today. Brad helps the nearly 35.000 veterans living in Madison County navigate the VA system and actually find other resources. including helping our veterans find employment. After explaining ObamaCare to veterans throughout southwestern Illinois and how it impacts their VA health benefits. he began wondering why they were subject to the employer mandate if they were not even in need of health care coverage. Brad raised his concern with me at one of our veterans advisory board meetings. and shortly thereafter we began work on the Hire More Heroes Act. This bill will help businesses hire more of our Nations veterans by making a commonsense change to ObamaCare. In just a few months. the Presidents health care law will mark its fifth anniversary. 5 years of delays. canceled policies. costly Web site glitches. and increased outofpocket expenses for hardworking middle class families. Unfortunately. the laws problems dont end there. We continue to see its lingering impact on our economy as many small businesses delay hiring. cut hours. and. in some cases. reduce payroll. In fact. the National Small Business Association found that 91 percent of small businesses have seen increases in their health care costs. and twothirds of their members listed ObamaCare as a reason for holding off on investing in people. And. Madam Speaker. I must remind everybody that investing in people is how we create jobs here in America. The Hire More Heroes Act exempts veterans already enrolled in their own health care plans through the Department of Defense or through the VA from being counted toward the 50employee limit as part of the employer mandate required under ObamaCare. By making this commonsense change to the law. we will not only provide small businesses with muchneeded relief. but also help more of our veterans find work. Despite receiving some of the best training in the world. post9/11 veterans are consistently faced with higher unemployment rates than that of other veterans. So as more and more of our veterans return home. the Hire More Heroes Act will give those who have sacrificed and served our country a leg up in a very competitive job market. Last Congress. this legislation passed this House overwhelmingly by a count of 4061. almost as bipartisan as you can get. but it was held up in the Senate. The Hire More Heroes Act is just one example of the bipartisan bills that the House will bring up this Congress. Later this week. we will further the American peoples call for greater energy independence and job creation by voting to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and by helping Americans by restoring the 40hour workweek under ObamaCare. With a new Congress. and if the President is willing to work with us. we have an opportunity to end the stagnation in Washington and make our government work for the people again. I ask all of my colleagues to defend the oath that they have just taken and help hire more of our heroes by voting \"yes\" on this piece of legislation.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker. in the fall. we made a commitment to the American people. a commitment to produce solutions that grow our economy and create more opportunity and help our small businesses and make life better for working families. Today. the new American Congress begins the work of making good on that commitment. and we start with a bill that helps two groups critical to Americas success: our veterans and our small businesses. The Hire More Heroes Act is a bipartisan bill which passed the House. as has been mentioned before. with more than 400 votes last year. It would make it easier for small businesses to hire veterans by exempting those veterans who already receive health care at the VA from ObamaCares costly employer mandate. This commonsense solution offsets the cost of hiring a veteran by addressing one of ObamaCares many failures. and there are many. As I have said many times before. I and many of my colleagues believe that ObamaCare should be repealed in its entirety. It may take awhile to do that. and so we can do some other things in the meantime. This is one of those things. a realistic thing which will actually help the American people. ObamaCare is placing tremendous burdens on small businesses looking to grow and individuals looking for work. This bill alleviates one of the many burdens ObamaCare places on our small businesses and. in doing so. helps our returning war fighters find meaningful work. Small businesses are responsible for the majority of new jobs created in America today. As the new incoming chairman of the House Small Business Committee. my goal each day will be to make life better for Americas small businesses so they can continue to innovate and create jobs for more Americans who are seeking them. Even though unemployment has come down to some degree. we need to do a lot better. The bill before us today is an important step towards that goal and towards our commitment to the American people to create more jobs. real jobs in the private sector. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.",

In my home State of Tennessee. we have over 525.000 veterans who have served our country in both war and peaceveterans. people like my son. Steve. and my husband. Dave. But today. too many of these Americans are struggling to find work. In fact. the unemployment rate among postSeptember 11 veterans is chronically higher than the national unemployment rate. I believe that we can do better. After all. our veterans have sacrificed for our country. Congress should. at the very least. make certain that Washington does not stand between them and access to a steady job. The Hire More Heroes Act will help accomplish this by exempting veterans who already have health insurance from being counted as fulltime workers under ObamaCares employer mandate. meaning that business owners can hire veterans without fear of being slapped with an ObamaCare penalty. That is why this body passed the legislation by an overwhelming vote of 4061 last year. Unfortunately. our efforts were stonewalled in the Democratcontrolled Senate. But today. we have an opportunity to start anew. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on the Hire More Heroes Act. and I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his work on this critical measure.",

We now have a new great generation. the men and women since 9111 who have bravely fought for this country and sacrificed for us are a generation of people who have developed the kinds of leadership skills. the kinds of courage. the experiences. the sacrifices their families made. and they are bringing that home to serve our country even further. They are bringing this great experience and talent and skills to our economy. We need to remove every conceivable barrier that exists that prevents them from sharing these talents with us.

We have here a very different view of the ACA than has been expressed by several. But that isnt the point of this legislation. This is about the veterans of this country. This isnt about Keystone. We will debate that some other time. We have very different views. This is no way a precedent to that. We will debate the 40hour week later this week. We have some very different views. to put it mildly. about the legislation entitled the \"40hour week.\" I should also like to point out regarding ACA that businesses. small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. arent even required to contribute to or offer insurance to their employees. This bill is called the Heroes Act because the focus of this bill is to make sure that there isnt any disincentive for anybody to hire veterans. The rate of unemployment for veterans has been higher. I had the chance in Roseville. Michigan. to meet with veterans. Vietnam veterans. some months ago. I was deeply troubled by the high rate of unemployment for those Vietnam veterans. This country has not done an adequate job in terms of making sure that veterans have a real opportunity to work. That is the tribute that we must provide. and it is more than a tribute. it is an obligation to those who have served this Nation. That is why this is called the Heroes Act. Lets not distort it. Lets not undermine what is the purpose of this legislation. Those who have served deserve as our priority any reasonable effort to provide them with the opportunity that they want. They have served.

We met with him this morning. and we can expect him back in the Senate very soon. In the meantime. it is a privilege on behalf of the Democratic Caucus to welcome our old colleagues back to work and welcome our new colleagues and their families to the U.S. Senate. I also want to wish Leader MCCONNELL. as he takes up the new duties of the majority leader. the very best. Senator Dirksen was a Senator from my home State of Illinois who served as a Republican leader of the Senate from 1959 to 1969. He famously said. \"I am a man of fixed and unbending principles. the first of which is to be flexible at all times.\" That may sound comical. even contradictory. But Senator Dirksens ability on flexible tactics and firmness on principles helped produce historic legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. one of the greatest achievements in our Nations history. I am sure we all will remember that with fondness and pride. The American people need us to work together to solve problems and create opportunities. For their sake. let us all try to remember that what we are about is honorable compromise. The Constitution of the United States and the Senate itself are the results of just such a compromise. One other point. One hundred years ago this week. an American industrialist and entrepreneur stunned the world by announcing he would start paying his workers double the industry average and cut the hours. That man. of course. was Henry Ford. He committed to pay his workers a minimum wage. As we begin this new Congress. let us dedicate ourselves to the working men and women across America. the taxpayers of this country. and the men and women which we so proudly serve. I hope that we will show flexibility and principle. We cant solve Americas challenges with the same old thinking. We have to address the problems with mutual respect and with a positive attitude. I look forward to. on this side of the aisle. working with Senator REID and my colleagues to achieve that end. Congratulations to Leader MCCONNELL.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is with a heavy heart that I rise to convey to my colleagues news of the tragic death of Sylvia Rickardone of the Nations top breast cancer advocatesa woman so full of life and joy. so deeply immersed in the science of her passion. that it is impossible to imagine this sad. sad occurrence. Sylvia was truly an amazing person who touched many lives. I first met Sylvia when she visited my office so many years ago to educate me on the need for more breast cancer research. for better breast cancer screening. and for better patient navigation. Sylvia. herself a twotime survivor of breast cancer. and later of ocular melanoma. made sure that my staff and I. and indeed all of the Utah and Idaho delegations. regardless of party. were kept apprised of the latest developments in breast cancer research. She patiently walked us through the science behind the researcha science she made it her business to know in great detail. Sylvia was such a good advocate because she had fought this dread disease. and won. Not once. but twice. Moreover. Sylvia. and her husband Rick. became friends to allto me. my staff. and to my former staffhere in Washington. and in our beloved State of Utah. She always had a smile and a hug for everyone. Sylvia made it her business not just to talk the talk. but also to walk the walk. She was a past president of the Womens State Legislative Council in Utah. a bipartisan group of women who meet to discuss issues of importance to Utah and the Nation. She also was the founder of the Utah Breast Cancer Network. and the president of the Hispanic Health Care Task Force in Utah. Sylvia became involved in building awareness at the local level. as well as the national level. Indeed. she was very proud to have been selected to be an advisor to the National Institutes of Healtha remarkable recognition of her topranked talent. She was involved at all levels in advocating for better biomedical research. better support for that research. and for a nonpartisan. commonsense approach to a disease that is now expected to affect one in eight women over their lifetimes. I recall the twinkle in Sylvias eye when top experts at the Huntsman Cancer Center in Salt Lake City sought her knowledge about eye cancer. after she was treated successfully. She had found a surgeon in another State who could treat her without the certain loss of her eye. and she helped to connect the physicians so they could learn from each other. It was a great loss to Utah when Rick Rickard built Sylvia the house of their dreams for retirement in Boise. ID this past fall. But we were all happy they had achieved their dream. I heard she was absolutely delighted to cook in her new kitchen. I am so pleased she at least got to spend a few months in their new home. one they had worked for so hard over so many years finally to achieve. So our hearts go out to the Rickard and Garcia families. to Sylvia and Ricks two sons. Richard. Jr. and David. and to the many millions of others whose lives have been made better by the significant achievements of my friend. Sylvia Rickard.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. over the past few years we have seen remarkable progress in one of the defining civil rights issues of our eraensuring that all lawfully married couples are treated equally under the law. In 2011. when I chaired the first Congressional hearing to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. only 5 States. including Vermont. recognized samesex marriage. With todays lifting of Floridas unconstitutional samesex marriage ban. couples in 36 States and the District of Columbia now have the freedom to marry. This is welcome progress. and I hope we will see similar advancements in even more States this year so that all Americans can marry the one they love. Despite this tremendous progress. there is still more to be done to ensure that no person faces discrimination based on who they marry or wish to marry. As I said when the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. \"All couples who are lawfully married under state law. including in Vermont. should be entitled to the same Federal protections afforded to all other married couples.\" Court challenges will continue this year in the remaining States that do not recognize marriage equality. But in Congress. there are several steps we can take immediately to help ensure our Federal laws treat all marriages equally. Surprisingly. the Copyright Act. which protects our Nations diverse creative voices. still bears vestiges of discrimination. A provision in the Act grants rights to the surviving spouse of a copyright owner only if the marriage is recognized in the owners State of residence at the time he or she dies. This means that a writer who lawfully marries his or her partner in Vermont or California is not a \"spouse\" under the Copyright Act if they move to Michigan. Georgia. or one of the other States that do not currently recognize their marriage. Congress should close this discriminatory loophole to ensure our Federal statutes live up to our Nations promise of equality under the law. As the Supreme Court recognized in striking down key portions of the Defense of Marriage Act. it is wrong for the Federal Government to deny benefits or privileges to couples who have lawfully wed. Today I am reintroducing the Copyright and Marriage Equality Act in the Senate to correct this problem. The bill. which I introduced in the Senate last Congress and which a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Representatives DEREK KILMER. ILEANA RoSLEHTINEN. and JARED POLIS plans to reintroduce in the House of Representatives soon. amends the Copyright Act to look simply at whether a couple is lawfully marriednot where a married couple happens to live when the copyright owner dies. It will ensure that the rights attached to the works of our Nations gay and lesbian authors. musicians. painters. photographers. and other creators pass to their widows and widowers. Artists are part of the creative lifeblood of our Nation. and our laws should protect their families equally. When I introduced this bill last year. it failed to get the support of a single Republican in the Senate. I hope that in this Congress. Republicans will consider joining this effort to correct these remnants of discrimination in our Federal laws. On the issue of marriage equality. the arc of history is at long last bending towards justice. so that all Americans one day will be free to marry the one they love. Statutes like the Copyright Act. or laws governing the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs which also contain remnants of discrimination. are no place for inequality in our country. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this important piece of legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I rise to introduce the Due Process Guarantee Act. which passed the Senate in 2012 with 67 votes as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013. Unfortunately. the amendment was taken out in the Conference Committee that year. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation again this year. and this time the House will support it so that it can finally be enacted into law to protect Americans from being detained indefinitely. The bipartisan bill I am introducing today. with Senator LEE as the lead cosponsor. is almost identical to the amendment that passed the Senate in December 2012 with 67 votes. The previous version of this bill had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on February 29. 2012. This legislation is necessary to prevent the U.S. Government from detaining its citizens indefinitely. Unfortunately. indefinite detention has been a part of Americas nottoodistant past. The internment of JapaneseAmericans during World War II remains a dark spot on our Nations legacy. and is something we should never repeat. To ensure that this reprehensible experience would never happen again. Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the NonDetention Act of 1971. which repealed a 1950 statue that explicitly allowed the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. The NonDetention Act of 1971 clearly states: No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress. Despite the shameful history of indefinite detention of Americans and the legal controversy over the issue since 9111. during debate on the defense authorization bill in past years. some in the Senate have advocated for allowing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. Proponents of indefinitely detaining U.S. citizens argue that the Authorization for Use of Military Force. AUMF. that was enacted shortly after 9111 is. quote. \"an act of Congress.\" in the language of the NonDetention Act of 1971. that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens regardless of where they are captured. They further assert that their position is justified by the U.S. Supreme Courts plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. However. the Hamdi case involved an American captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on behalf of the Taliban and was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan. The divided Court did effectively uphold his military detention. so some of my colleagues use this case to argue that the military can indefinitely detain even American citizens who are arrested domestically here on U.S. soil. far from the battlefield of Afghanistan. However. the Supreme Courts opinion in the Hamdi case was a muddled decision by a fourvote plurality that recognized the power of the government to detain U.S. citizens captured in such circumstances as \"enemy combatants\" for some period. but otherwise repudiated the governments broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens without charge or trial. In particular. the Court limited its holding to citizens captured in an area of. quote. \"active combat operations\". unquote. and concluded that even in those circumstances the U.S. Constitution and the Due Process Clause guarantees U.S. citizens certain rights. including the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an impartial judge. The pluralitys opinion stated: It [the Government] has made clear. however. that. for purposes of this case. the enemy combatant that it is seeking to detain is an individual who. it alleges. was part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners in Afghanistan and who \"engaged in an armed conflict against the United States\" there. Brief for Respondents 3. We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.\" The opinion goes on to say at page 517 that \"we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe . . .\" Indeed. the plurality later emphasized that it was discussing a citizen captured on a foreign battlefield. Criticizing Justice Scalias dissenting opinion. the opinion says. \"Justice Scalia largely ignores the context of this case: a United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone.\" The plurality italicized and emphasized the word \"foreign\" in that sentence. Thus. to the extent the Hamdi case permits the government to detain a U.S. citizen \"until the end of hostilities.\" it does so only under a very limited set of circumstances. namely citizens taking an active part in hostilities. who are captured in Afghanistan. and who are afforded certain due process protections. at a minimum. Additionally. decisions by the lower courts have contributed to the current state of legal ambiguity when it comes to the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. such as Jose Padilla. a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002. He was initially detained pursuant to a material witness warrant based on the 9111 terrorist attacks and later designated as an \"enemy combatant\" who conspired with alQaeda to carry out terrorist attacks including a plot to detonate a \"dirty bomb\" inside the U.S. Padilla was transferred to the military brig in South Carolina where he was detained for three and a half years while seeking habeas corpus relief. Padilla was never charged with attempting to carry out the \"dirty bomb\" plot. Instead. Padilla was released from military custody in November 2005 and transferred to Federal civilian custody in Florida where he was indicted on other charges in Federal court related to terrorist plots overseas. While he was indefinitely detailed by the military. Padilla filed a habeas corpus petition which was litigated at first in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. and then in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 2003 decision by the Second Circuit known as Padilla v. Rumsfeld. the Court of Appeals held that the AUMF did not authorize his detention. saying: \"we conclude that clear congressional authorization is required for detentions of American citizens on American soil because 18 U.S.C. \u00a74001(a) the \"NonDetention Act\". prohibits such detentions absent specific congressional authorization. Congresss Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution. . . . passed shortly after the attacks of September 11. 2001. is not such an authorization.\" This requirement for \"clear congressional authorization\" to detain is known as the Second Circuits \"Clear Statement Rule.\" However. the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion. finding that the AUMF did authorize his detention. It is worth pointing out. however. that their analysis turned entirely on the disputed claims that \"Padilla associated with forces hostile to the United States in Afghanistan.\" and. \"like Hamdi. Padilla took up arms against United States forces in that country in the same way and to the same extent as did Hamdi.\" Facing an impending Supreme Court challenge and mounting public criticism for holding a U.S. citizen arrested inside the U.S. as an enemy combatant. the Bush administration relented. and ordered Padilla transferred to civilian custody to face criminal conspiracy and material support for terrorism charges in Federal court. I believe that the time is now to end the legal ambiguities. and have Congress state clearly. once and for all. that the AUMF or other authorities do not authorize indefinite detention of Americans apprehended in the U.S. To accomplish this. we are introducing legislation again this year which affirms and strengthens the principles behind the NonDetention Act of 1971. It amends the NonDetention Act to provide clearly that no military authorization allows the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens or Green Card holders who are apprehended inside the U.S. Like the amendment that passed with 67 votes in 2012. the bill creates a new subsection (b) of the NonDetention Act which clearly states: \"A general authorization to use military force. a declaration of war. or any similar authority. on its own. shall not be construed to authorize the imprisonment or detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States.\" Like the previous version. this bill amends the NonDetention Act to codify the Second Circuits \"Clear Statement Rule\" from the Padilla case. So new subsection (a) will read. \"No citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except consistent with the Constitution and pursuant to an act of Congress that expressly authorizes such imprisonment or detention.\" Making the Clear Statement Rule part of subsection (a) strengthens the NonDetention Act even more by requiring Congress to be explicit if it wants to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely. Subsection (b) clarifies that an authorization to use military force. a declaration of war. or any similar authority does not authorize the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen or a Lawful Permanent Resident of the U.S.. also known as a Green Card holder. Some may ask why this legislation protects Green Card holders as well as citizens. And others may ask why the bill does not protect all persons\" apprehended in the U.S. from indefinite detention. Let me make clear that I would support providing the protections in this amendment to all persons in the United States. whether lawfully or unlawfully present. But the question comes. is there enough political support to expand this amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens and Green Card holders? Wherever we draw the line on who should be covered by this legislation. I believe it violates fundamental American rights to allow anyone apprehended on U.S. soil to be detained without charge or trial. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have proven. time and again. that they are up to the challenge of detecting. stopping. arresting. and convicting terrorists found on U.S. soil. having successfully arrested. detained and convicted hundreds of these heinous people. both before and after 911. Specifically. there have been 556 terrorismrelated convictions in federal criminal court between 9111 and the end of 2013. according to the Department of Justice. Also. it is important to understand that suspected terrorists who may be in the U.S. illegally can be detained within the criminal justice system using at least the following 4 options: They can be charged with a Federal or State crime and held. they can be held for violating immigration laws. they can be held as material witnesses as part of Federal grand jury proceedings. and they can be held for up to 6 months under Section 412 of the Patriot Act. I want to be very clear about what this bill is and is not about. It is not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and Padilla. or others who would do us harm. should be captured. interrogated. incarcerated. and severely punished. They should be. But what about an innocent American? What about someone in the wrong place at the wrong time? The beauty of our Constitution is that it gives everyone in the United States basic due process rights to a trial by a jury of their peers. As President Obama said when referring to the indefinite detention of nonAmericans at Guantanamo: \"Imagine a future 10 years from now or 20 years from now when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not part of our country .... Is that who we are? Is that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is stronger than that.\" The same questions could be asked of those who would indefinitely detain Americans arrested on U.S. soil. Is that who we are? Does that reflect the America we want to leave to our children? Now is the time to clarify U.S. law to state unequivocally that the government cannot indefinitely detain American citizens and Green Card holders captured inside this country without trial or charge. The Federal Government experimented with indefinite detention of U.S. citizens during World War II. a mistake we now recognize as a betrayal of our core values. Let us not repeat it. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. GRAHAM):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Wildlife Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2015. which I authored along with my colleague Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM. This bill will allow the Federal Government to crack down on poachers and transnational criminal organizations involved in the global trade in illegal wildlife products. Wildlife trafficking has become a global crime that the State Department estimates is valued at between $8 to $10 billion annually. This ranks it as one of the most lucrative types of organized crime in the world. along with drug and human trafficking. Besides being a major international crime. wildlife trafficking is a morally repugnant practice that threatens some of our worlds most iconic species with extinction. The most disturbing example is that of elephants and rhinoceroses. A recent study estimates that over 100.000 elephants were illegally poached in Africa from 2010 to 2012. At this rate. the African elephant is being killed faster than the species can reproduce. putting it at risk of being wiped off the face of the earth. Most disturbingly. poachers are slaughtering very young and juvenile elephants for their tusks due to the record high demand for ivory in places like China and the United States. But the illicit ivory trade is not just a threat to African elephants. it is also a problem for global security. The State Department reports that there is increasing evidence that wildlife trafficking is funding armed insurgencies like Al Shabaab and the Lords Resistance Army. The illegal ivory trade fuels corruption and violence in Africa. The rhinoceros has also been decimated by poaching due to record high demand for its horn. Conservation organizations estimate that hundreds of rhinoceroses are illegally slaughtered in Africa each year. It is deeply concerning that the poaching rate for rhinoceroses in Africa appears to be increasing. Some populations of rhinoceroses are on the brink of extinction. The population of the Sumatran rhinoceros has plummeted by over 50 percent in the last two decades due to poaching. and it is estimated that only about 100 remain in existence. It is estimated that fewer than 10 Northern White Rhinoceroses remain alive in the wild. The problem is not just confined to elephants and rhinoceroses. Tigers. leopards. endangered sea turtles. and many other wildlife species are being decimated by poaching. At its core. this legislation increases criminal penalties for wildlife trafficking crimes. The federal government needs stiffer penalties in order to go after organized and high volume traffickers. The President asked for this authority in the National Strategy to Combat Wildlife Trafficking released last year. Specifically. this bill makes violations of the Endangered Species Act. the African Elephant Conservation Act. and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act that involve more than $10.000 of illegal wildlife products predicate offenses under the money laundering and racketeering statutes and the Travel Act. Currently. each of these wildlife laws carries a maximum prison sentence of only one year for a violation. Under this bill. wildlife trafficking violations can be subject to up to a 20year prison sentence. as well as increased fines and penalties of up to $500.000 for an offense. These new penalties will allow the government to change the equation on wildlife crimes. Wildlife trafficking has increased at dramatic rates because the crime is high value and low risk due to weak penalties across the world. Under the new authorities. the Federal Government will have a full range of tools to prosecute the worst wildlife trafficking offenders and to put them behind bars with significant sentences. The new authorities will also act as a deterrent to the criminal organizations currently trafficking illicit wildlife products into and through the United States. As one of the largest markets for products of illicit poaching in the world. the United States has a responsibility to step up and help to combat this scourge. With this legislation. the United States will set an example for other countries on the need for each country to strengthen penalties for wildlife trafficking. It is critical that other nations around the world with large markets for illicit wildlife products step up to tackle this global problem. The Wildlife Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2015 will also allow fines. penalties. forfeitures. and restitution recovered through use of the bills new authorities to be transferred to established conservation funds at the Departments of the Interior and of Commerce. This will enable the Federal Government to use the monetary penalties from a wildlife trafficking conviction to benefit the species that was harmed. Thus. the bill will both act to punish and deter criminals while supporting the conservation of those species that are directly harmed by poaching. Addressing the issue of wildlife trafficking speaks to our values and morals as a Nation. We have a responsibility to help prevent these endangered species. which have existed for thousands of years. from becoming extinct in our lifetime. It is also clear that Federal laws weak penalties for wildlife crimes have been exploited by poachers and transnational criminals. I therefore ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with me to enact this legislation this year. The stakes for endangered species like elephants. tigers. and rhinoceroses could not be higher. If we dont crack down on wildlife trafficking. we will be complicit in the slaughter.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill to fully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA. and ensure that married same sex couples are accorded equal treatment by the federal government. When I first introduced this bill in 2011. only 5 States and the District of Columbia recognized samesex marriage. Today. due to a combination of actions by legislatures. voters. and the courts. 36 States and D.C. recognize samesex marriage. Florida joined the group just this week. This progress is nothing short of amazing. Over 70 percent of Americans now live in a State where samesex couples can marry. The Supreme Courts landmark decision in United States v. Windsor. which struck down Section 3 of DOMA. has caused most federal agencies to accord equal rights and responsibilities to married samesex couples. But. despite this progress. the mission of ensuring full equality under Federal law for married samesex couples is still unaccomplished. This bill will accomplish that mission. It will strike DOMA from Federal law. and ensure that legally married samesex couples are treated equally by the federal government. period. I want to thank my 41 colleagues who have cosponsored this bill. For my colleagues who have not yet supported this bill: if you believe that couples who are married should be treated that way by the federal government. you should cosponsor this bill. It is as simple as that. Two major agencies. which serve millions and millions of Americansthe Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairsstill deny benefits to some married couples depending on where the couple has lived. This bill would fix that problem. Let me address Social Security first. An example of the discrimination married samesex couples still face is the case of Kathy Murphy and Sara Barker. According to a legal filing. this couple married in Massachusetts and shared a ranch house in Texas for nearly 30 years. In 2010. when Sara was 60 years old. she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Sara went through several surgeries and chemotherapy. and Kathy was Saras caregiver. Sara passed away on March 10. 2012. As the complaint states: \"Kathy lost her partner of more than thirty years and the love of her life.\" In July 2014over a year after she appliedKathys application for survivors benefits from Social Security was denied because they lived in Texas together. and Texas does not recognize them as married. This cost her an estimated $1.200 per month in Federal survivors benefits. Veterans and activeduty military personnel in samesex marriages also are being denied equal treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Many of these brave individuals have served our country overseas or in war zones. but they may nevertheless be denied a huge range of benefits our nation grants to those who have served in the Armed Forces. A court filing by the American Military Partners Association explains that: lesbian and gay veterans and their spouses and survivors ... will be denied or disadvantaged in obtaining spousal veterans benefits such as disability compensation. death pension benefits. home loan guarantees. and rights to burial together in national cemeteries. This is wrong. Our married gay and lesbian soldiers put their lives on the line for our country the same way other soldiers do. We owe them the same debt of gratitude we owe to all other men and women who serve. and this bill would ensure that we fulfill that solemn obligation. Continued discrimination against married samesex couples is not limited to these benefits programs. Other Federal laws are not part of programs administered by agencies. but they nevertheless are designed to protect families. including spouses. Let me just give one exampleSection 115 of Title 18. Among other things. this law makes it a crime to assault. kidnap. or murder a spouse of Federal law enforcement officer. with the intent to influence or retaliate against the officer. This law protects the ability of people like FBI agents and federal prosecutors to serve the public knowing there is protection from violence against their families. These agents and prosecutors investigate and prosecute people like drug kingpins. terrorists. and organized crime figures. But. even today. it is not clear whether this vital protection for these officers covers those in lawful samesex marriages everywhere in the country. These public servants. who protect all of us. should not have to worry that they lack the full protection we provide to their colleaguesbut that is the situation we confront today. This bill would fix it. In addition. Section 2 of DOMAwhich was not expressly addressed by the Supreme Courtcontinues to pose a serious risk to legal relief received by victims of crime and civil wrongs. This bill would repeal it. Section 2 of DOMA is the full faith and credit provision of DOMA. and it has been the subject of many misconceptions. When DOMA was enacted. some claimed Section 2 was designed to prevent the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution from forcing a state to recognize a marriage from another state. But states have never needed permission from Congress to decide whether to recognize an outofstate marriage. States have done that under their own laws. subject to other constitutional guarantees like the Equal Protection Clause. Thus. repealing Section 2 of DOMA simply would not force a State. or a religious institution. to recognize a particular marriage. While it is on the books. Section 2 may have a very serious impact: it may nullify legal relief awarded to victims of crime and other civil wrongs. There is a general rule that the judgments of one states courts will be enforced in another states courts. But Section 2 purports to exempt any \"right or claim arising from\" a samesex marriage from this rule. Imagine a woman killed by a drunk driver. Her surviving spouse would have a civil claim for wrongful death. or might obtain restitution in a criminal case. But DOMA could prevent the court judgments in those cases from being enforced in the perpetrators home State. allowing him to avoid the consequences of his actions. The same problem could arise in numerous types of cases. such as assaults. batteries. and insurance claims. Samesex married couples are the only class of people who are burdened by this sort of legal disability. which hinders the court system from protecting them the same way that it does other citizens. This is wrong. and it must be repealed. As a Senator from California. I come to this bill with a strong sense of history. In 1948. the California Supreme Court became the first state court to find that a ban on interracial marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause. At the time. 29 states still prohibited interracial marriage. Prohibitions on interracial marriage then were eliminated in 13 other states. so that when the Supreme Court decided Loving v. Virginia in 1967. only 16 states retained bans on interracial marriage. I very much hope that is where we are today on samesex marriage. People of all stripes have come to believe that loving and committed samesex couples are worthy of the same dignity and respect other couples receive. Public opinion has changed dramatically. and 36 states now recognize samesex marriage. The tide has shifted. I hope irreversibly so. But here. in Congress. we still have work to do. We must end the discrimination married samesex couples continue to face at the federal level. DOMA remains on the books. where it should never have been placed. It could be revived by a different Supreme Court majority. A future administration also could interpret other laws differently than this Administration has done. potentially restricting the availability of key benefits even further. The solution is simple: pass this bill. which would eliminate DOMA and accord equal treatment under Federal law for married samesex couples. Let me again thank my cosponsors for joining me in this effort. and to urge my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation. By Ms. COLLINS (for herself. Mr. DONNELLY. Ms. MURKOWSKI. and Mr. MANCHIN):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. Senator DONNELLY and I are reintroducing the Forty Hours is Fulltime Act to correct a serious flaw in the Affordable Care Act. also known as Obamacare. that is already causing workers to have their hours reduced and their pay cut. We are pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators MURKOWSKI and MANCHIN. Our legislation would raise the threshold for \"fulltime\" work in Obamacare to the standard 40 hours a week. This is consistent with the threshold for overtime eligibility under the Fair Labor Standards Act. and the commonsense understanding of \"fulltime\" work. Under Obamacare. an employee working just 30 hours a week is defined as \"fulltime.\" a definition that is completely outofstep with standard employment practices in the U.S. today. According to a survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. the average American actually works 8.7 hours per day. which equates to roughly 44 hours a week. The Obamacare definition is nearly onethird lower than actual practice. Similarly. the Obamacare definition of \"fulltime\" employee is ten hours a week fewer than the 40 hours per week used by the GAO in its study of the budget and staffing required by the IRS to implement Obamacare. In that report. the GAO described a \"fulltime equivalent\" as: \"a measure of staff hours equal to those of an employee who works 2.080 hours per year. or 40 hours per week. ... Even the Office of Management and Budget recognizes that 30hours is not \"fulltime.\" A circular it issued to Federal agencies actually directs them to calculate staffing levels using more than 40 hours a week as a \"fulltime equivalent.\" The effect of using the 30hour a week threshold is to artificially driveup the number of \"fulltime\" workers for purposes of calculating the penalties to which employers are exposed under Obamacare. These penalties begin at $40.000 for businesses with 50 employees. plus $2.000 for each additional \"fulltime equivalent\" employee. While these draconian penalities were scheduled to begin in January of last year. we have yet to feel their full effect because the Obama administration delayed their implementation through 2014. perhaps knowing the negative impact that will result. But that artificial graceperiod expired January 1 for employers with 100 or more workers and will end for employers with between 50 and 99 employees in January of next year. Needless to say. these penalties will force many employers to restrict or reduce the hours their employees are allowed to work. so they are no longer considered \"fulltime\" for the purposes of the law. In addition. these penalties will discourage employers from growing or adding jobs. particularly those close to the 50job trigger. These are not hypothetical concerns. According to the Investors Business Daily. more than 450 employers had cut work hours or staffing levels in response to Obamacare as of September of last year. Employees of forprofit businesses are not the only ones threatened by Obamacares illogical definition of fulltime work. Public sector employees and those who work for nonprofits are also affected. I am concerned that educators. school employees. and students will be particularly hard hit. As the ASAA. the School Superintendents Association. explained in a letter in support of our bill. Obamacares 30hour threshold puts an \"undue burden on school systems across the Nation. many of [which] will struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational mission\" while complying with this requirement. For example. the school superintendent of Bangor. ME. has told me that Obamacare will require that school district to reduce substitute teacher hours to make sure they dont exceed 29 hours a week. This will harm not only the substitute teachers who want and need more work. but it will also harm students by causing unnecessary disruption in the classroom. Likewise. in Indiana. a county school district had to reduce the hours of parttime school bus drivers to make sure they do not work more than the 30hour threshold. As a result. the school district has been forced to cut field trips and transportation to athletic events. and employees who used to work more than 30 hours total in two jobs have been forced to give up one of their jobs. hurting their financial security. The 30hour rule will also affect our Nations institutions of higher education. According to the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources. Obamacares fulltime work definition has already caused 122 schools to announce new policies capping hours for students and faculty. It is troubling that the 30hour threshold will also harm delivery of home care services. The requirement will likely result in reduced access to needed services for some of our Nations most vulnerable citizens: homebound seniors. individuals with disabilities. and recently discharged hospital and nursing home patients. Information provided to my office by the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine shows that many of its member organizations will be forced to reduce work hours for employees or even to cease operations due to Obamacares definition of \"fulltime\" work. If that happens. hundreds of home care workers could lose their jobs. and a thousand seniors could lose access to home care servicesin Maine alone. Data from Maines Medicaid program show that home care services are extremely costeffective compared to alternatives. Thus. by making it harder for home care service providers to give their workers the hours they need. Obamacares definition of \"fulltime\" work will end up reducing the home care services available to seniors. depriving them of care or forcing them into costlier care. driving up Federal costs. Before I close. I would like to read a few lines from a letter I recently received from Randy Wadleigh. the owner of a wellknown and muchloved restaurant institution in Maine called \"Governors.\" Randys letter sums up what Maine employers have always told metheir employees are the heart and souls of their businesses. and are the face of their companies to the public. As Randy puts it. businesses recognize the importance of their workers \"because without GREAT employees. businesses really dont have anything. [The 30hour threshold] is hurting many of our employees. They dont understand it. they cant afford it and they just want to work more hours.\" The bipartisan bill we are introducing today will protect these workers by changing the definition of \"fulltime\" work in the ACA to 40 hours a week. and making a corresponding change in the definition of \"fulltime equivalent\" employee to 174 hours per month. This is a sensible definition in keeping with actual practice. Among the many organizations that have endorsed our bill are: the College & University Professional Association for Human Resources. the National Association for Home Care & Hospice. the American Hotel & Lodging Association. the American Staffing Association. the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. the Associated Builders and Contractors. the Food Marketing Institute. the International Franchise Association. the National Association of Convenience Stores. the National Association of Health Underwriters. the American Rental Association. the National Association of Manufacturers. the National Association of Theatre Owners. the National Grocers Association. the National Federation of Independent Business. the National Restaurant Association. the National Retail Federation. the Retail Industry Leaders Association. ASAA. the School Superintendents Association. the Society for Human Resource Management. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Regardless of the varying views of Senators on the Affordable Care Act. surely we ought to be able to agree to fix this problem in the law that is hurting workers paychecks and creating chaos for employers. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I am pleased to reintroduce the Core Opportunity Resources for Equity and Excellence Act with my colleague Senator Brown. I would also like to thank Representative Fudge for introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. This year. we will be commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Now is the time to reaffirm our commitment to educational equity. and in the words of President Johnson \"bridge the gap between helplessness and hope.\" As we embark upon reauthorizing this landmark legislation. we must ensure that our accountability systems in education measure our progress towards equity and excellence for all children. The CORE Act will help advance that goal by requiring states to include fair and equitable access to the core resources for learning in their accountability systems. More than 60 years after the landmark decision of Brown v. Board of Education. one of the great challenges still facing this nation is stemming the tide of rising inequality. We have seen the rich get richer while middle class and lowincome families have lost ground. We see disparities in opportunity starting at birth and growing over a lifetime. With more than one in five schoolaged children living in families in poverty. according to Department of Education statistics. we cannot afford nor should we tolerate a public education system that fails to provide resources and opportunities for the children who need them the most. We should look to hold our education system accountable for results and resources. And we know that resources matter. A recent study by researchers at Northwestern University and the University of California at Berkeley found that increasing per pupil spending by 20 percent for lowincome students over the course of their K12 schooling results in greater high school completion. higher levels of educational attainment. increased lifetime earnings. and reduced adult poverty. In addition to funding. there are other opportunity gaps that we need to address. Survey data from the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights show troubling disparities. such as the fact that Black. Latino. American Indian. Native Alaskan students. and English learners attend schools with higher concentrations of inexperienced teachers. nationwide. one in five high schools lacks a school counselor. and between 10 and 25 percent of high schools across the nation do not offer more than one of the core courses in the typical sequence of high school math and science. such as Algebra I and II. geometry. biology. and chemistry. We are reintroducing the CORE Act to ensure that equity remains at the center of our federal education policy. Specifically. the CORE Act will require state accountability plans and state and district report cards to include measures on how well the state and districts provide the core resources for learning to their students. These resources include: high quality instructional teams. including licensed and professionready teachers. principals. school librarians. counselors. and education support staff. rigorous academic standards and curricula that lead to college and career readiness by high school graduation and are accessible to all students. including students with disabilities and English learners. equitable and instructionally appropriate class sizes. uptodate instructional materials. technology. and supplies. effective school library programs. school facilities and technology. including physically and environmentally sound buildings and wellequipped instructional space. including laboratories and libraries. specialized instructional support teams. such as counselors. social workers. nurses. and other qualified professionals. and effective family and community engagement programs. These are things that parents in wellresourced communities expect and demand. We should do no less for children in economically disadvantaged communities. We should do no less for minority students or English learners or students with disabilities. Under the CORE Act. States that fail to make progress on resource equity would not be eligible to apply for competitive grants authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. For school districts identified for improvement. the State would have to identify gaps in access to the core resources for learning and develop an action plan in partnership with the local school district to address those gaps.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to talk about our continuing effort to change the Senate rules as we begin the 114th Congress. This is the same process Senators MERKLEY. Harkin. and I used at the beginning of the last Congress when we introduced a similar resolution. At that time. Majority Leader REID wanted to have the debate about reforming our rules after the inauguration. He was willing to work with us and protect our interests until we could debate our proposal. By doing so. he preserved the right of a simple majority of this body to amend the rules in accordance with article I. section 5 of the Constitution. I hope Majority Leader MCCONNELL will extend to us this same courtesy if he chooses to address other issues before rules reform. It has been the tradition at the beginning of many Congresses that a majority of the Senate has asserted its right to adopt or amend the rules. Just as Senators of both parties have done in the past. we do not acquiesce to any provision of Senate rulesadopted by a previous Congressthat would deny the majority that right. The resolution I am offering today is based on proposals we introduced at the start of the 112th and 113th Congresses. At that time. many called our efforts a power grab by the majority. But we were very clear. We would support these changes even if we were in the minority. and here we are today. reintroducing the reform package as Members of the minority. These changes do not strip minority rights. They allow the body to function as our Founders intended. The heart of our proposal is the talking filibuster. The filibuster once was a tool that was used sparingly. It allowed the minority to be heard. Today it is abused too often and far too easily. I have said many times that the Senate has become a graveyard for good ideas. The shovel is the broken filibuster and other procedural tactics. The system is broken. But in the last election I think the message was clear. The electorate said: Fix it. do your job. and make the government work. That is what our resolution is intended to do. Our reforms were not adopted in the last Congress. but we made some progress. Strong support for fixing the Senate led leaders REID and MCCONNELL to address the dysfunction in the Senate and make some moderate changes. Unfortunately. it did not take long for the leaders gentlemens agreement to break down. In November 2013 the abuse of the rulesand the obstructionreached a tipping point. and so the majority acted within the precedence of the Senate. We changed the rules to prevent the minority from abusing the rules and obstructing scores of qualified nominees for judicial and executive appointments. I believe that drastic step was unfortunate. but it was also necessary. The minority has a right to voice objections but not to abuse the rules to obstruct justice by preventing judges from being confirmed or by preventing the President from getting his team in place. By changing the rules. the 113th Senate was able to confirm 96 judges. In fact. it confirmed more judges than any modern Congress since 1980. The 113th Congress also confirmed 293 executive nominations in 2014the most since 2010. That is an incredible change. It was a bold but necessary action. But it also led to even greater polarization in the Senate. That polarization could have been prevented if the Senate had adopted our reforms at the beginning of the 113th Congress. That is why I strongly urge the new majority leader to continue the change that was adopted in November. It allows most judicial and executive branch appointees to be confirmed by a straight majority vote. I urge him to continue the progress we made last Congress and adopt the rest of our proposed reforms at the start of this Congress. Anyone who has watched this Senate try to legislate in the past few years knows we still are hobbled by dysfunction. We voted on cloture 218 times just over the past 2 years. To put that in perspective. the Senate voted on cloture only 38 times in the 50 years after the rule was adopted in 1917. We cannot continue down this path. The unprecedented use of the filibuster and other procedural tactics by both parties has prevented the Senate from getting its work done. The Senate needs to return to its his historical practice and function as a deliberative yet majoritarian body. when filibusters were rare and bipartisanship was the norm. We believe the proposed rule changes in our resolution provide commonsense reforms. This will restore the best traditions of the Senate and allow it to conduct the business the American people expect. We have one goal. whether we are in the majority or in the minority: to give the American people the government they expect and deserve. a government that works. We said before. and we say it again. that we can do thiswith respect for the minority. with respect for differing points of view. with respect for this Chamber. but. most of all with respect for the people who send us here. The right to change the rules at the beginning of a new Congress is supported by history and by the Constitution. Article I. section 5 is very clear. The Senate can adopt and amend its rules at the beginning of the new Congress by a simple majority vote. This is known as the constitutional option. and it is well named. It has been used numerous timesoften with bipartisan supportsince the cloture provision was adopted in Opponents of the Constitutional Option say that the rules can only be changed with a twothirds supermajority. as the current filibuster rule requires. And they have repeatedly said any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" This simply is not true. The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article I Section 5 of the Constitution states that. \"Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. punish its Members for disorderly Behavior. and. with the Concurrence of two thirds. expel a Member.\" When the Framers required a supermajority. they explicitly stated so. as they did for expelling a member. On all other matters. such as determining the chambers rules. a majority requirement is clearly implied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents. sitting as President of the Senate. on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it applies to the Senate. In 1957. Vice President Nixon ruled definitively: [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from one Congress to another. the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules. stemming as it does from the Constitution itself. cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is. in the opinion of the Chair. unconstitutional. VicePresidents Rockefeller and Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses. In 1979. when others were arguing that the rules could only be amended in accordance with the previous Senates rules. Majority Leader Byrd said the following on the floor: There is no higher law. insofar as our Government is concerned. than the Constitution. The Senate rules are subordinate to the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution in Article I. Section 5. says that each House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past. In addition to the clear language of the Constitution. there is also a longstanding common law principle. upheld in the Supreme Court. that one legislature cannot bind its successors. For example. if the Senate passed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in the future. that would violate this principle and be unconstitutional. Similarly. the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules that a majority of the Senate in the future cannot amend or repeal. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For example. in 2003 Senator JOHN CORNYN wrote in a law review article: Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote. one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power. after all. would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another. So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not \"breaking the rules to change the rules.\" It is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules. and that when there is a conflict between them. we follow the Constitution. And I would like to make clear that by moving on to other business. we are not waiving our constitutional right to amend the Senates rules with a majority vote. In 1975. when the cloture threshold was reduced from twothirds to threefifths. the reform effort lasted until March. But on the first day of that Congress. Senator Mondale introduced his resolution and unequivocally stated that he was reserving his right to call for a majority vote at a later date. Senator Mondale made the following statement on that first day: Mr. President. I wish to state. as has been traditional at the commencement of efforts to amend rule XXII. that. by operating under the Standing Rules of the Senate the supporters of this resolution do not acquiesce to the applicability of certain of those rules to the effort to amend rule XXII. nor do they waive any rights which they may obtain under the Constitution. the practice of this body. or certain rulings of previous Vice Presidents to amend rule XXII. uninhibited by rules in effect during previous Congresses. Today. I take the same position as Senator Mondale and many other reformers did over the years. I understand that Majority Leader MCCONNELL may move on to other business. but I am not acquiescing to any provision in the Senate rules that prevents a majority from amending those rules. We can. and should. take time to debate our proposal and have an up or down vote. I know other colleagues also have reform proposals. They all deserve consideration. This is not just about rules. It is about the norms and traditions of the Senate. They have collapsed under the weight of the filibusters. Neither side is 100percent pure. Both sides have used the rules for obstruction. No doubt they have had their reasons. but I dont think the American people care about that. They dont want a history lesson or a lesson in parliamentary procedure. They want a government that is reasonable and that works. I hope all my colleagues. especially the new Senators. give special consideration to reform. We do not need to win every legislative or nomination vote. but we need to have a real debateand an open processto ensure we are. actually. the greatest deliberative body in the world. We changed the rule regarding nominations. That was an important start. but it was the beginningnot the end. We still need to reform the Senate rules. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Senator FRANKEN be added as a cosponsor to S. Res. 20.",

    "speech": "Today we are at the start of a new Congress. and every new Congress provides the opportunity for a fresh start of the work we do on behalf of the American people. Congratulations to our newly elected Members and congratulations to our returning elected Members. It is appropriate at this moment. at the start of a new. 2year Congress. that we ponder how to make this institution work for the American people. work well within our constitutional framework and our responsibility for advice and consent on nominations. and work well in terms of our responsibility for legislation that will address the big issues facing our Nation. Since I came to the Senate in 2009. it has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from New Mexico. My colleague from New Mexico came to the Senate from the House. I came here from the State of Oregon but with memories of how the Senate worked many years before when I first came to the Senate as an intern in 1976. I must say. in the 1970s. this body worked very much in the manner that one might anticipate. A bill was put forward. There was no filibuster of a motion to proceed. The bill was debated. A group of Senators would be ready to call upon the President of the Senate to submit their amendment. Whoever was called on firstthat amendment was debated. That amendment was debated. and in a short period of time it was voted on and then the Senators would vie for the opportunity to present the next amendment. What I saw in 2009 when I came back as a Senator was a very different Chamber. a Chamber where long periods of time would be spent debating what bills to debate. The motion to proceed would be filibustered. So we would waste the energy of this institution not upon delving into the complexities of an issue and how to best address it but simply on the procedural issue of whether we were going to start debate on a particular bill. This situation has certainly been observed by the American public. The American publics esteem for our institution has declined steadily over the past several decades as the paralysis of this institution has increased. Observers of Congress report that the past two Congresses have been among the least productive in modern historytoo few amendments getting considered. paralysis even after a bill has come to the floor on which amendment to address first. and too many filibustersfilibusters not of the type of old in which a Senator would delay action on a bill by holding forth as long as his energies would enable him or her to stand on this floor and carry forth. but filibusters of the silent kind. the kind in which there is simply an objection to closing debate. But then this Chamber is filled with silence because no one has anything left to say on it. and no one is willing to spend the time and energy to even declare to the American people: I am here on this floor speaking at length because I want to block this bill. There is no accountability to the public in that fashionno transparency. So the silent filibuster has come to haunt this hall. Well. that is a very different Senate than the Senate in the mid1970s and one that my colleague from New Mexico and I are determined to changeto restore this Chamber to being a great deliberative body. We can have all the interesting policy ideas in the world. and we can have. certainly. insights on how to make things work better. but if the machinery for this body to consider those ideas is broken. then. certainly. those abilities are not put into their best opportunity or framework. Many folks. when we have been debating the functionality of the Senate. have said: But. remember. it was George Washington who said that the Senate should be a cooling saucerin other words. saying that the dysfunction and paralysis of the Senate is just exactly the way it was designed to be. That is certainly a misreading of the comment attributed. perhaps apocryphally. to George Washington. George Washington was referring to the fact that the Senate was designed with a constitutional framework of 6 years. of onethird of the Members rotating every 2 years. of a Chamber that was initially elected indirectly by the Statesrather than by popular electionand that this would give it more chance to be thoughtful and reflective on the issues that come before the Nation. This thoughtfulness. this ability to gain reflexion. is. in fact. exactly what the Senate should be. It is the quality that led to the Senate being described as the worlds greatest deliberative body. But the filibuster. and the abuse of it. has changed that. And certainly the inability of the minority and the majority to be able to put forth amendments in a timely fashion and to debate them has changed. I think back to what Alexander Hamilton said early in the history of our Nation. He said that the real operation of the filibuster \"... is to embarrass the administration. to destroy the energy of government. to substitute the pleasure. caprice and artifices of an insignificant. turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority.\" That phrase. isnt that what we need to restore in this body. the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority? This is all part of this cycle of a democracy in which citizens vote for an individual who they feel reflects what needs to be done in our Nation. and those individuals come to this [chainber/Chamber] and they proceed to have an agenda. That agenda. if it is part of the majority agenda or a bipartisan majority agenda. gets implemented and those ideas get tested. Those ideas that work well can be kept and those ideas that work poorly can be thrown out. But if this Chamber is locked in paralysis. that cycle of testing ideas and of citizens voting for a vision and seeing that vision implemented and tested is broken. That is much where we are now. Alexander Hamilton went on to say that when the majority must conform to the views of the minority. the consequence is \" . . . tedious delays. continual negotiation and intrigue. contemptible compromises of the public good.\" I think that is exactly what we have seen too much of in this Chamber. whether it be one party in charge or the other party in charge. As my colleague noted. this is not a partisan issue. The ideas we put forward when in the majority we are now putting forward in the minority. Isnt that the test of whether an idea is in fact designed for the good of this institution. rather than the advantage of the moment? Our Senate is broken. The American people know that. And it is our responsibility as Senators to work to change that. That is why there should now be a full debate among the Members on the best ideas on how to enable this Chamber to work better. Those ideas should come from the right of the aisle. from the left of the aisle. and ideas in partnership between colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Again. this shouldnt be about the advantage of the moment. it should be about the successful function of our beloved Senate. One of the things we have seen in the course of this broken Senate is our failure to adequately dispose of our responsibility for advice and consent on nominations under the Constitution. That responsibility is designed to be a check on outrageous potential nominations from the President. It is not designed to be a way for one coequal branch of governmentthat is the Congressto seek to systematically undermine other branches of the government. be it the judiciary or the executive. So we need to have a timely and systematic way of considering nominations. That certainly has fallen apart in the course of the poisonous and partisan nature of deliberations here over the last few years. But we can change that. Indeed. we stepped forward a year ago November to test a rule to close debate on most nominations with a simple majority. The result has been quite spectacular. The number of district judges who have been considered on the floor of this Chamber has more than doubledhas almost tripled. Judicial vacancies have been cut in halfextremely important to a fair and capable judiciary. Executive nominations roughly doubled. It should not be the goal of this Chamber. whether the majority or the minority. to disable the executive branch by preventing the positions from being filled in the executive branch. If a majority says a person is reasonable. then that nomination should proceed expeditiously. Senator UDALL and I have put forward. as he noted. a resolution that is in keeping with the package of ideas we worked on in 2011 and 2013. so we are presenting those ideas here in 2015. But my encouragement is for people to put forward their ideas. individual Senators. to add their ideas or put forward individual components that will contribute to this dialogue. One of the ideas we have. and I will be offering to this body. is to create a process to consider rule changes at the start of each legislative sessiona detailed way of addressing that. since currently we have no pattern. no guide. to holding a debate about how the Senate functions. A second will be to consider the expedited consideration of most nominations. We made a rule change a couple of years agowell. November a year ago. And also. before that. we made some minor changes in timing in January 2013. That came out of the debate just 2 years ago. Those January 2013 changes are expiring. Those timelines are expiring. So that goes away. Should those be adopted as part of the standing rules rather than simply the standing orders which expire with the change of a Congress? A third idea is to end the filibuster on the motion to proceed to legislation. Think about how this has changed. If you take the 10year period between 1973 and 1982. a 10year period that embraces when I first came here as an intern. there were 14 times there was a filibuster on a motion to proceed. If you take 10 years from roughly 2003 to 2012. that number went up to about 160more than a tenfold increase in the paralysis of getting bills to the floor to be discussed. Why should there be filibusters at all on a conference committee? If the House has put forward an idea and passed it. and the same bill has been passed by the Senate. isnt it common sense to enable a delegation from each Chamber to meet together to work out a compromise? We did make a modest improvement in this procedure. but there is much more work to be done on this. In fact. I was mystified when I came here in 2009 as to why there werent conference committees going on. First I heard: Well. it is easier for Chairs of committees to get together informally and try to work out something behind the scenes. But then. as I asked more questions. the answer became: Because there are three steps required. and all three of which enable a filibuster. and that paralysis just isnt worth entertaining the time on the floor. Well. let us restore conference committees. Let us get rid of filibusters on conference committees. And certainly we must improve floor debate by ensuring amendments can be introduced and debated. The minority has said in recent years that this is a deep disadvantage to them. But I can tell you as a Member of the previous majority that it was a disadvantage to majority Members as well not to be able to introduce and debate amendments. We also certainly must replace the silent filibuster with the talking filibuster so there is transparency and accountability to the use of this instrument on final passage of a bill. Let us not let this opportunity pass. Let us not continue on autopilot from one Congress to the next. Let us take this moment of opportunity to start on this path to restoring the U.S. Senate to being the worlds greatest deliberative body in order to address the big issues before us and for the betterment of our Nation. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to reintroduce the \"Tax Code Termination Act.\" legislation that will abolish the Internal Revenue Code by December 31. 2019. and call on Congress to approve a new Federal tax system by July of the same year. There is no denying that our current tax system has spiraled out of control. Americans devote countless hours each year to comply with the tax code and it is very clear we need tax simplification. Todays tax code is unfair. discourages savings and investment. and is impossibly complex. Businesses and families need relief from uncertainty and the burdensome task of complying with the tax code. However. the problem is Congress wont act on fundamental tax reform unless it is compelled to do so. The Tax Code Termination Act will finally force Congress to debate and address fundamental tax reform. Once the Tax Code Termination Act becomes law. todays oppressive tax code would survive for only four more years. at which time it would expire and be replaced with a new tax code that will be determined by Congress. the President. and the American people. The Tax Code Termination Act will allow us. as a nation. to collectively decide what the new tax system should look like. Having a datecertain to end the current tax code will force the issue to the top of the national agenda. where it will remain until Congress finishes writing the new tax law. This legislation has gained wide support in past Congresses and had 122 bipartisan cosponsors in the 113th Congress. In fact. similar legislation has already been passed twice by the House of Representatives. first in 1998 and then in 2000. Although many questions remain about the best way to reform our tax system. if Congress is forced to address the issue we can create a tax code that is simpler. fairer. and better for our economy than the one we are forced to comply with today. Congress wont reach a consensus on such a contentious issue unless it is forced to do so. The Tax Code Termination Act will force Congress to finally debate and address fundamental tax reform. Americas future partially depends on overcoming the impairment that is our current tax code. There is a widespread consensus that the current system is broken. and keeping it is not in Americas best interest. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and end the broken tax system that exists today and provide a tax code that the American people deserve.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the \"Stopping Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2015\" targets ruthless collection tactics employed by some student loan creditors against debtors who have sought bankruptcy relief. as documented by the New York Times in its cover story last year. Specifically. my legislation bill would empower a bankruptcy judge to award costs and reasonable attorneys fees to a debtor who successfully obtained the discharge of his or her liability for a student loan debt based on undue hardship if: (1) the creditors position was not substantially justified. and (2) there are no special circumstances that would make such award unjust. The Bankruptcy Code already grants identical authority to a bankruptcy judge to award costs and reasonable attorneys fees to debtor where a creditor requests the determination of dischargeability of a consumer debt based on the allegation that it was fraudulently incurred and the court thereafter finds that the creditors position was not substantially justified and there are no special circumstances that would make such award unjust. Although parties typically do and should pay their own attorneys fees in litigation. dischargeability determinations concerning student loan debts present compelling factors that warrant the relief provided by this legislation. Under current bankruptcy law. debtors must meet a very high burden of proof. namely. that repayment of the student loan debt will present an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtors dependents. The litigation typically requires extensive discovery. triallike procedures. and legal analysis. Unfortunately. some student loan debt collectors engage in abusive litigation tactics that exponentially drive up the potential cost of legal representation for a debtor. As a result. debtors. who may legally qualify for the Bankruptcy Codes undue hardship dischargeability exception for student loans. may be unable to obtain such relief because of the potential risk of excessive and unaffordable legal fees that the debtor may have to incur not only to meet the high standard of proof. but also to combat an abusive litigation stance taken by a wellfunded adversary. The \"Stopping Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2015\" will help level the playing field for debtors overwhelmed by student loan debts. the repayment of which would present an undue hardship for themselves and their families. It is my hope that should this measure become law. bankruptcy judges will not hesitate to award debtors attorneys fees in appropriate cases of abusive litigation engaged in by student loan creditors.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor Bob Merwin. the Chief Executive Officer of MillsPeninsula Health Services. who is retiring after a remarkable 27yearcareer there and a lifelong career in health care. Bob knew early on that hospital administration would be his future and his passion. Under his leadership for almost three decades Bob proved what he often saidthat he is not afraid of change. He led MillsPeninsula through major changes and transitions and is leaving it prepared for a long and strong futu re. Bob came to MillsPeninsula in 1987 as the Executive Vice President. rose to Chief Operating Officer and then in 1991 to CEO. One of his biggest and most recent accomplishments was the building and opening of the stateoftheart MillsPeninsula Medical Center in 2011. The 241bed. 450.000 square foot hospital features private rooms with 21st century patient life technology. electronic charting and online capabilities that allow for efficient communication. family sleeping accommodations. advanced earthquake technology designed to withstand an 8.5 quake. and a topnotch emergency department. It also has its own chef preparing sustainably and locally grown food for patients. staff and for special events for the public. Looking at the 241bed hospital today. it is humbling to remember its beginnings. Founded by Elizabeth Mills Reid. the Church of St. Matthew Red Cross Guild opened in San Mateo in 1908 with just six beds. It was later renamed Mills Memorial Hospital. Due to significant growth during the following decades. Peninsula Hospital opened in 1954 in Burlingame. In 1985. Mills and Peninsula merged into MillsPeninsula Health Services. Bob oversaw the integration of both hospitals. He was also at the helm for the next large merger with Sutter Health System in 1996 striving to further strengthening the system of care. Under Bobs leadership. MillsPeninsula developed and opened the first community hospital Breast Center with advanced diagnostic technologies. the Mack E. Mickelson Arthritis Center. the Family Birth Center. the Dorothy E. Schneider Cancer Center. the Womens Center. and a Behavioral Health facility. During the years leading up to national health reform. Bob kept his optimism and focus on building an organization that cares for its community. In his career and in life. Bob has had a strong partner equally committed to health care. He married to Jean Merwin. a nurse for Sutter Care at Home. in 1999. The two first met in the early 70s when they both worked at Long Beach Community Hospital. Bob went on to earn his Masters Degree in Hospital Administration from UCLA and become the Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. Jean moved to the Mendocino Coast and worked as an administrator for a nonprofit clinic. Nearly 20 years later. Bob and Jean reconnected at a conference on the Mendocino Coast. Between the two of them they have three children. two grandchildren and one greatgrandchild. In their welldeserved retirement. Bob and Jean are looking forward to spending more time with family and pursue their common passion for golf. Mr. Speaker. I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Bob Merwin for his remarkable career and dedication to health care. He has built MillsPeninsula Health Services into an organization that will serve patients. provide jobs and advance our health care system for decades to come.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. utility companies provide many basic and lifesaving services. such as electricity to light our homes. water to drink. and gas to heat our homes. Sometimes. however. individuals. through no fault of their own. struggle to pay for these services often in the face of devastating medical debt. job loss. or economic disruption caused by divorce. While resorting to bankruptcy provides some relief from financial distress. current law permits utility companies to force these debtors to pay security deposits for continued service even if they were current on their bills before filing for bankruptcy or if they promise to be current on their bills after bankruptcy. Utility companies typically insist that debtors pay at least two months or more of their average bills as a depositin addition to requiring that they remain current on their utility bills after bankruptcyin exchange for the utility continuing to supply service. The \"Preventing Termination of Utility Service in Bankruptcy Act of 2015\" corrects this injustice. It provides that if the debtor remains current on his or her utility bills after filing for bankruptcy relief. the debtor should not have to pay a deposit to the utility to continue service. In Detroit. for example. families across the city have seen their water rates increase by 119% over the past decade. During the same period. the Nation generally and Detroit in particular suffered in the aftermath of a global financial crisis that left oneinfive local residences in foreclosure and sent local unemployment rates skyrocketing. Fortunately. we are incrementally recovering from the Great Recession of 2008. For those individuals who must seek bankruptcy relief. however. we should ensure that their ability to pay their utility bills going forward is not hindered by unnecessary demands for deposits if these debtors remain current on their payments to these companies. Terminating a familys access to such lifesaving services that keeps the lights on. warms our homes. and ensures that they can bathe. hydrate. and prepare meals is simply wrong if these utility bills are being paid on time. This legislation is part of a range of solutions that are needed to address the still pervasive adverse impacts of the Great Recession of 2008. I continue to work with my colleagues in Congress. state and federal officials. and my constituents to defend the right to water and protect public health. I will not tolerate the notion thatin the 21st Century. in the wealthiest nation on earthfamilies should go without access to affordable public water and sanitation services.",

Robert was first elected to the council in 2009 after a 27yearcareer as a police officer in San Mateo. His experience in law enforcement made security and sustainability one of his priorities for the city. As a real estate agent for 25 years.

He started his law enforcement career as a police officer in Hayward in 1979 and transferred to the San Mateo Police Department in 1981 where he rose through the ranks to Police Lieutenant in 2003. His professionalism and proactive approach have been recognized and he has been commended on numerous occasions. For example. in the late 1980s. then Corporal Ross was in charge of setting up a task force to fight drug crimes in San Mateo. The group became known as \"Ross Raiders\" and their effective antidrug campaign was lauded by the City Council. San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. the District Attorney. the San Mateo County Trial Lawyers Association and the late Congressman Tom Lantos.

I submit the following: SUMMARY The \"Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2015\" would permit a bankruptcy judge. with respect to certain home mortgages. to reduce the principal amount of such mortgages to the fair market value of the homes securing such indebtedness. My legislation will encourage homeowners to make their mortgage payments and help stem the endless cycle of foreclosures that further depresses home values. It also would authorize the mortgages repayment period to be extended so that monthly mortgage payments are more affordable. In addition. the bill would allow exorbitant mortgage interest rates to be reduced to a level that will keep the mortgage affordable over the longterm. And. it would authorize the waiver of prepayment penalties and excessive fees. Further. the bill would eliminate hidden fees and unauthorized costs. This bill addresses a fundamental problem: homeowners in financial distress simply lack the leverage to make mortgage lenders and servicers engage in meaningful settlement negotiations. even when in the interest of all parties. My legislation would empower a homeowner. under certain circumstances. to force his or her lender to modify the terms of the mortgage by allowing the principal amount of the mortgage to be reduced to the homes fair market value. And. the implementation of this measure will not cost taxpayers a single penny. The \"Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2015\" is identical to H.R. 101 (introduced in the 113th Congress) and H.R. 1587 (introduced in the 112th Congress). It contains similar provisions included in H.R. 1106. which the House passed nearly six years ago.

On December 21st. we lost a vital asset and key individual to the Chicago Blackhawks team. with the passing of Clint Reif. In his ninth season with the Blackhawks and sixth as assistant equipment manager. Clint ensured that his team was suited up and ready to play to the best of their ability day in and day out. Arriving early and leaving late. Clint had one of the allimportant duties of maintaining and repairing equipment. And we all know how gentle hockey players are on their equipment. Because of Clints attention to detail and professionalism. no Blackhawks player was ever left on the ice without exactly what he needed. But beyond that. he was a family man. with four charming childrenFlorence. C.J.. Aislynn and Coletteand his loving wife. Kelly. He was also devoted to his community. spearheading the teams initiative to outfit the Wounded Warriors hockey team with brand new equipment this past March. The Wounded Warriors Project (WWP) aims to raise awareness and enlist the publics generosity for the needs of injured service members. Clint respected and admired those brave men and women who fought to ensure our freedoms and gave back in true Clint fashionwith hockey equipment. Another great sports influence in the city of Chicago. Phil Jackson. once said. \"The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team.\" With the passing of Clint. the Chicago Blackhawks lost an irreplaceable individual from their team. one that helped lead them to two Stanley Cup Championships. A one of a kind guy. Clint will be greatly missed by the Blackhawks. the City of Chicago and the entire hockey community. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating his life.",

Certain breaches would also be required to be reported to the FBI or the Secret Service. The bill would also require federal agencies engaged in rulemaking related to personally identifiable information to publish privacy impact statements relating to the impact of the proposed rule. One of the main motivators for cybercrime and computer network intrusions is financial gain. Intrusions into networks of financial institutions and businesses may yield information. often on a large scale. about customers such as credit and debit card numbers. Social Security numbers. birth dates. account passwords. and other personally identifiable information. Information obtained through such data breaches may be used to steal from the accounts of the customers. use their credit cards. hack into their personal communications. or the information may be sold to others who commit these crimes or compile provides about individuals which others might find valuable. With constant revelations about new data breaches impacting millions of Americans. we must take additional steps to protect the sensitive information of consumers maintained on corporate databases. This bill will provide a greater incentive for companies to provide notice of breaches consumers sensitive information such as Social Security numbers and financial account numbers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. a bill that would implement the findings of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. Since being elected to the House of Representatives ten years ago. I have introduced a version of this legislation in each Congress. Over the last several Congresses. H.R. 44 passed the House on five separate occasions. This bill would implement the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission. which was appointed by Secretary of E1O the Interior Gale Norton and established by an Act of the 107th Congress (Public Law 107333). The Review Commission. in a unanimous report to Congress in June 2004. found that there were significant disparities in the treatment of war claims for the people of Guam as compared with war claims for other Americans. The Review Commission also found that the occupation of Guam was especially brutal due to the unfailing loyalty of the people of Guam to the United States of America. The people of Guam were subjected to forced labor. forced marches. internment. beatings. rapes and executions. including public beheadings. The Review Commission recommended that Congress remedy this injustice through the enactment of legislation to authorize payment of claims in amounts specified. Specifically. the bill would authorize discretionary spending to pay claims consistent with the recommendations of the commission. It is important to note that the Review Commission found that the United States Government seized Japanese assets during the war and that the record shows that settlement of claims was meant to be paid from these forfeitures. Furthermore. the United States signed a Treaty of Peace with Japan on September 8. 1951. which precludes Americans from making claims against Japan for war reparations. The treaty closed any legal mechanism for seeking redress from the Government of Japan. and the United States Government has settled claims for U.S. citizens and other nationals through various claims programs authorized by Congress. The text that I introduce in this Congress addresses concerns that have been raised about the legislation. First. the text reflects a compromise that was reached with the Senate when they considered the legislation as a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. That compromise removes payment of claims to heirs of survivors who suffered personal injury during the enemy occupation. The bill continues to provide payment of claims to survivors of the occupation as well as to heirs of citizens of Guam who died during the occupation. The compromise continues to uphold the intent of recognizing the people of Guam for their loyalty to the United States during World War II. Further. the bill that I introduce today contains an offset for the estimated cost of the bill. I understood the concerns express by some of my colleagues in a July 14. 2011 hearing on this legislation. My colleagues expressed concern that there was no offset to pay for the cost of the bill. Guam war claims has a very simple offset that will pay for the cost of the legislation over time. The bill would be paid by section 30 funding remitted to Guam through the U.S. Department of Interior at any level above section 30 funds that were remitted to Guam in fiscal year 2012. With the impending relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam as well as additional Navy and Air Force personnel relocating to Guam it is expected that Guam will receive additional section 30 funds. Claims would then be paid out over time based off the additional amounts that were made available in any given year. Not only does this offset address payment of claims but it only impacts my jurisdiction and is a credible source of funding that will ensure that claims will be paid. Moreover. the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates in Senate report 113146 that accompanied S. 1237. the Omnibus Territories Act of 2012. that the offset ensures the bill would not cost the federal government additional funds. Specifically it states. \"any such future payments due to Guam that exceed the amount paid in 2012 would instead be paid to a new U.S. Treasury fund that would be available to make compensation payments. CBO estimates that the collection and spending of those funds would have no significant net impact on direct spending over the 20152024 period.\" Congressional passage of this bill has a direct impact on the future success of the military buildup. The need for Guam War Claims was brought about because of mishandling of war claims immediately following World War II by the Department of the Navy. The longstanding inequity with how Guam was treated for war reparations lingers today. If we do not bring this matter to a close I believe that support for the military buildup will erode and impact the readiness of our forces and the bilateral relationship with Japan. Mr Speaker. resolving this issue is a matter of justice. This carefully crafted compromise legislation addresses the concerns of the Senate and fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives. This bill represents a unique opportunity to right a wrong because many of the survivors of the occupation are nearing the end of their lives. It is important that the Congress act on the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission to finally resolve this longstanding injustice for the people of Guam.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit the following. SUMMARY When a municipality files for bankruptcy. its employees and retirees who have devoted their lives to public service such as police officers. firefighters. sanitation workers and office personnel risk having their hardearned wages. pensions and health benefits cut or even eliminated. This is why I am introducing the \"Protecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2015.\" This legislation strengthens protections for employees and retirees under chapter 9 municipality bankruptcy cases by: (1) clarifying the criteria that a municipality must meet before it can obtain chapter 9 bankruptcy relief. (2) ensuring that the interests of employees and retirees are represented in the chapter 9 case. and (3) imposing heightened standards that a municipality must meet before it may modify any collective bargaining agreement or retiree benefit. While many municipalities often work to limit the impact of budget cuts on their employees and retirees. as demonstrated in the chapter 9 plan of adjustment approved by Detroits public employees and retirees. other municipalities could try to use current bankruptcy law to set aside collective bargaining agreements and retiree protections. My legislation addresses this risk by requiring the municipality to engage in meaningful good faith negotiations with its employees and retirees before the municipality can apply for chapter 9 bankruptcy relief. This measure would also expedite the appellate review process of whether a municipality has complied with this and other requirements. And. the bill ensures employees and retirees have a say in any plan that would modify their benefits.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing two bills to help hold accountable corporations who market dangerous products and who violate the law. We rely on corporations to provide necessary goods and services to consumers and to provide jobs for our citizens. Unfortunately. sometimes corporations engage in acts that may harm us or that otherwise run afoul of the law. That is why I am introducing these measures. The Dangerous Products Warning Act concerns businesses who learn that products they are marketing are dangerous but who do not inform the appropriate federal agency or warn the public. It amends the federal criminal code to impose a fine and/or prison term of up to 5 years on any business entity or product supervisor with respect to a product or business practice who knows of a serious danger associated with such product or business practice and knowingly fails within 15 days after discovering such danger to inform an appropriate federal agency in writing. warn affected employees in writing. and inform other affected individuals. The bill imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 1 year on any individual who intentionally discriminates against an employee who informs a federal agency or warns employees of a serious danger associated with a product or business practice. The Corporate Crime Database Act deals with the concern that the public has inadequate means of learning about the degree to which companies are engaging in acts in violation of the law. and sets up a mechanism to track such violations and make the information available to the public. The bill directs the Attorney General to: (1) acquire data. for each calendar year. regarding all administrative. civil. and criminal judicial proceedings against any corporation or corporate official involving a felony or misdemeanor or civil charge where potential fines may be $1.000 or more. (2) establish and maintain a publicly available website on improper conduct by all corporations with annual revenues of more than $1 billion. and (3) prepare an annual report to Congress detailing the number of civil. administrative. and criminal enforcement actions brought against any corporation or corporate official and the final dispositions of such actions. With the enactment of these two bills. we would take important steps toward protecting our citizens from harm and empowering them to know which corporations are violating our laws.",

As an alumna of Mercy High and the mother of a daughter who also graduated from this outstanding school. this institution has shaped my life. Today. Mercy High School Burlingame. a Catholic college preparatory high school. educates 400 young women a year. with the majority coming from San Mateo County. About three quarters of the students are Roman Catholic and 90 percent of the students are engaged in at least one extracurricular activity. Mercy encourages students to discover themselves and explore their dreams. they receive an education of mind. body and spirit. This recipe and small class sizes prove to be highly successful. In the class of 2014. 87 percent matriculated to four year colleges and 13 percent matriculated to community colleges. Mercy education finds its origins in Ireland in the ministry of Catherine McAuley. the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy. Their work is marked by a special concern for the needs of the poor. in particular women and children. This tradition continues to this day. The Kohl Mansion was originally built from 1912 to 1914 by Charles Frederick \"Freddie\" Kohl for his wife Bessie. Kohl. born in San Jose in 1863. grew up in a mansion on an estate in San Mateo. now known as Central Park. His father had made a fortune as the founder of Alaska Commercial Company and so Kohl Junior was used to an opulent lifestyle. Freddie and Bessies travels to Europe further inspired them to build the lavish fourstory Tudor named \"The Oaks.\" In 1924. the Sisters of Mercy bought the house and turned it into a chapel. When the sisters moved down the hill to a new building. Principal Sister Mary Lorenzo Murphy and seven other nuns opened Mercy High School in the mansion in 1931. admitting 36 freshmen and sophomores. The old Kohl Mansion has embraced technology and modern facilities. Mercy launched its website in 1999. Over the decades. a stateofthe art athletic center with an Olympic size pool. a commercial kitchen. a new cafeteria and a multimedia center were built. among the many improvements. At every step of the way. the focus of the school was to provide its students with the best education and learning environment possible. Mr. Speaker. I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor one of the finest high schools in the country. Mercy High School Burlingame on the occasion of the Kohl Mansions 100th birthday. May this historic building remain the home of education and learning for centuries to come. E13",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing an important bill to respond to the crisis that some jurisdictions are facing with respect to hiring police officers and funding programs to enhance public safety. This bill would establish two public safety grant programs. Section 2 establishes Shield Police Hiring Grants. to be implemented by the Attorney General. to provide grants to law enforcement agencies that operate in Elevated Need Localities. An \"Elevated Need Locality\" is a county (or unit of local government which is not part of a county) which (1) has a crime rate above the national average. and (2) has had budget reductions during the most recent 5year period. These law enforcement agencies could apply to the Attorney General to receive funds to hire law enforcement officers. or to rehire officers who have been laid off due to budget reductions. Grants would last for three years and may be extended by two years at the discretion of the Attorney General. $100 million for each fiscal year 2016 through 2021 are authorized to be appropriated for this program. Section 3 establishes Shield Public Safety Enhancement Grants. to be implemented by the Attorney General. to provide grants to units of local government that has jurisdiction over all or part of an Elevated Need Locality. Local governments could apply to the Attorney General to receive funds to enhance public safety in a number of ways. such as purchasing public safety equipment. finding public safety programs. making infrastructure improvements for the purpose of enhancing public safety. purchasing and installing street lights to deter crime. funding activities related to crime labs. and funding public defender programs. Nonprofit organizations operating in Elevated Need Localities may also apply for grants under this program to fund initiatives designed to reduce crime in these jurisdictions. Grants would be for one year but may be extended at the discretion of the Attorney General. $100 million for each fiscal year 2016 through 2021 are authorized to be appropriated for this program. These programs will help enhance public safety in jurisdictions facing high crime rates and particularly acute budget issues. The programs would be available to fund the hiring of police officers and the operation of initiatives to address public safety and crime. Programs that enhance public safety will prevent crime. which will decrease the victimization of our citizens and reduce the financial costs associated with crime.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit the following. SUMMARY Throughout our Nations history. hardworking American men and women have labored to make our businesses become the most productive and dynamic in the world. Unfortunately. when some of these businesses encounter financial difficulties and seek to reorganize their debts under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. these very same workers and retirees are often asked to make major sacrifices through lost job protections. lower wages. and the elimination of hardwon pension and health benefits. while the executives and managers of these business are not required to make comparable sacrifices. We must do more to ensure that Americas most important resource workers and retirees -are treated more fairly when these business seek to reorganize their financial affairs under the protection of our bankruptcy laws. The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2015 accomplishes this goal by amending the Bankruptcy Code in several respects. First. it improves recoveries for employees and retirees by: (1) increasing the amount of worker claims entitled to priority payment for unpaid wages and contributions to employee benefit plans up to $20.000. (2) eliminating the difficult to prove restriction in current law that wage and benefit claims must be earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing in order to be entitled to priority payment. (3) allowing employees to assert claims for losses in certain defined contribution plans when such losses result from employer fraud or breach of fiduciary duty. (4) establishing a new priority administrative expense for workers severance pay. and (5) clarifying that back pay awards for WARN Act damages are entitled to the same priority as back pay for other legal violations. Second. the legislation reduces employees and retirees losses by: (1) restricting the conditions under which collective bargaining agreements and commitments to fund retiree pensions and health benefits may be eliminated or adversely affected. (2) preventing companies from singling out nonmanagement retirees for concessions. (3) requiring a court to consider the impact a bidders offer to purchase a companys assets would have on maintaining existing jobs and preserving retiree pension and health benefits. and (4) clarifying that the principal purpose of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the preservation of jobs to the maximum extent possible Third. the bill restricts excessive executive compensation programs by: (1) requiring full disclosure and court approval of executive compensation packages. (2) restricting the payment of bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation to senior officers and others. and (3) ensuring that insiders cannot receive retiree benefits if workers have lost their retirement or health benefits. This legislation is identical to H.R. 100. introduced in the 113th Congress. and H.R. 6117. introduced in the 112th Congress. It is supported by the AFLCIO and many of its largest affiliates. and the United Steelworkers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to strongly oppose the December 17 announcement by President Obama on policy changes toward the Cuban Communist regime. The Cuban regime from day one was planning on using Alan Gross as a pawn to receive concessions from the Obama administration. and their strategy worked. In April 2013. when asked about a possible swap for Mr. Gross. Secretary Kerry testified before Congress that \"We have refused to do that because there is no equivalency. Alan Gross is wrongly imprisoned. and we are not going to trade as if it is a spy for a spy.\" That turned out to not be true. President Obama unilaterally pardoned three convicted Cuban spies. These spies were responsible for the deaths of three American citizens and one U.S. resident. Carlos Costa. Armando Alejandre. Mario de la Pena. and Pablo Morales. whose Brothers to the Rescue planes were unjustly shot down over international air space on direct orders of the Castro brothers. To make matters worse. we learned that the U.S. Government used resources to facilitate the artificial insemination of one of the wives of the Cuban spies. Good grief. So the White House ignores the fact that these innocent U.S. pilots were not able to have their own families. but rewards one of the persons responsible for their deaths. Not only did the dictatorship achieve the return of five convicted spies. it was also able to attain major concessions from our President in order to support Cubas struggling economy. Cubas largest supporters. Russia and Venezuela. are struggling due to their own fiscal crises. so the Castro brothers needed a bailout from a new source. and. sadly. they found one with President Obama. By increasing tourism travel on the island. the Obama administration will be injecting millions of dollars into the pockets of the Castro brothers. The Cuban police state runs the hotels. Lets examine the Presidents announcement very closely. First. the President claims that these new policy changes will empower the Cuban people. Well. the prodemocracy advocates on the island have stated that the changes will help their oppressor. not the people of Cuba. Second. the issue is not only impacting the people of Cuba. it also poses a greater threat to U.S. national security interests. Cuba is a designated state sponsor of terrorism and is an avowed enemy of the United States. With these concessions by the administration. the Castro brothers will use some of their new economic stream to invest more funds into their espionage activities. activities that are aimed against our Nation. With the ability to garner more intelligence against the U.S.. the Castro brothers are likely to hit the black market and sell this intelligence to the highest bidder. This is not a theory. it is a fact. One example of this fact is the case of Ana Belen Montes. She was a convicted Cuban spy who worked for our U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. collecting information for Castro so that it can be sold to our enemies. Third. the human rights situation on the island has not changed one bit. The President says that he got Raul Castro to agree to the release of 53 political prisoners. prisoners who should never have been in jail in the first place. yet the White House will not release the names of these 53 political prisoners. Why not? What do they have to hide? Plus what good is it for the Castro brothers to release these 53 when he doesnt stop capturing and detaining other prisoners. which he will? What has been happening in Cuba lately in these past few weeks? Well. according to reports. more than 80 Cubans have been detained. The Cuban coast guard sank a boat recently in international waters that was carrying over 30 people. causing the deaths of some of them on board. Hezbollah celebrated President Obamas announcement after a meeting with the Cuban Ambassador to Lebanon. Mr. Speaker. this misguided policy of the President will have serious implications for the United States and sends a signal to our enemies that we will cave and we will surrender at every turn. We in the Congress must do everything we can to prevent this disastrous policy from going into effect. This is a bad deal for U.S. national security and for the Cuban opposition. and it is a sweetheart deal for the repressive Cuban regime.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is always a great deal of excitement surrounding a new Congress and a new year. One area that has been very encouraging is the focus on rebuilding and renewing America. That was where we left off in the last Congress. frustrated by an inability to produce a 6year reauthorization. largely because of an inability for Congress to address meaningfully how it would be funded. This continues a struggle of almost two decades. as we have not increased the gas tax or developed a viable. sustainable. adequate alternative. It is widely recognized that America is falling apart and falling behind. Our infrastructure. once the envy of the world. now has put us at a secondtier status. with America at risk of falling ever further behind. The deplorable state of our infrastructure is actually costing Americans far more to endure the damage to their cars and the delays to their lives through congestion than simply funding an alternative and fixing it. It is encouraging that the administration and people in both parties. in both Chambers. might be prepared to address the issue anew. There are some shortterm stopgap solutions which would nowhere near solve the problem but nudge us in the right direction. In the Senate there is bipartisan interest in and openness to a comprehensive solution including the gas tax. Senators Bor CORKER and his partner CHRIS MURPHY have been champions. Senator TOM CARPER continues his leadership and advocacy for the gas tax solution. Senator JOHN THUNE. a key Republican leader. has signaled his openness to the gas tax. which is the simplest. most logical. and most effective solution. Even the problematic proposal to use dynamic scoring to evaluate budget proposals could make a difference for the prospect of solving this huge problem for America if it would be applied in the spirit of dynamic scoring. The Standard & Poors research report. \"U.S. Infrastructure Investment: A Chance to Reap More Than We Sow.\" pointed out the overwhelming economic impact in terms of jobs created. economic benefits that actually exceeded the direct amount invested. and longterm deficit reduction of $200 million for every $1.2 billion invested. This should be one of the easiest economic decisions we ever make. In an era of low interest rates. gasoline prices falling dramatically. when there are still hundreds of thousands of people ready to go to work at family wage jobs rebuilding this country. the economic case has never been stronger. By all means. lets evaluate all of the proposals. Lets expand the discussion. Lets look at the leadership of States around the country that are stepping up to do their part. State. local. and private investment all have a role to play. to be sure. but recognize that the 25 percent of infrastructure funding that comes from the Federal Government plays a critical role. Let this Congress give America a solution that is sustainable. not one that would put us back in the same fix in a year or two or even sooner. Lets have a revenue source that is dedicated so that we can begin on longerterm projects that demand multimodal. multistate. multiyear solutions and that is large enough to give us a long overdue 6year comprehensive reauthorization. Stable. dedicated. big enough to do the jobthis is a test that the new Congress and administration should meet to revitalize our economy and rebuild and renew this great country. At a time of dramatically falling oil and gas prices. when the public is suffering from Congress dithering on our transportation and other infrastructure needs. there will never be a better time to heed the advice of President Ronald Reagan 33 years ago in his Thanksgiving Day radio address to the country to raise the gas tax and put Americans to work fixing the problem that has only gotten worse. It was good advice then. It is good advice today.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. sadly. each day we read sensationalized headlines that boggle the mind. but here is the rest of the story. In New York. headlines read a 30yearold man has been charged with killing his father who founded a hedge fund because his allowance had been cut. The rest of the story? He had been in a mental health decline for years. A friend told the press. clearly their son had serious mental illness. There were stories about strange things that he had been doing in the past few years. really erratic behavior. Another newspaper reports the man was off his medication. In Florida. headlines read a 22yearold man cut off his mothers head with an ax last week because of her nagging about daily chores. The rest of the story? This man had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been involuntarily held under the States civil commitment law but released. Despite his illness and past commitments. he was no longer in treatment because Florida. like most States. requires a person to be imminently homicidal or suicidal for treatment. In Pennsylvania a former marine killed his exwife and five of her family members last month because of \"family issues.\" The rest of the story? The marine had been evaluated and cleared of having suicidal or homicidal tendencies by a Department of Veterans Affairs psychiatrist just days before. a decision we now see was wrong. Each week there are half a dozen new reports that demand more than a sensationalized headline because the rest of the story tells the real story. Severe mental illness is a brain disease. it is not an attitude or a lifestyle choice. Psychosis. schizophrenia. and other serious mental illnesses involve disruption in typical brain functioning which translates into a very specific set of disturbing behaviors. This is not a condemnation of the mentally ill nor a criticism of those who have severe brain disorders. Hallucinations. voices. visions. and paranoia lead to actions that arent grounded in reasoned choices. For those who dont have a brain disease it is hard to understand. and it is unnerving to think about. but when we understand that behaviors are symptomatic of what is occurring in the brain. we can address them without judgment. just like other medical diseases and other lifesaving treatments. The distorted reasoning why an individual acts out in a violent manner or takes the lives of innocent victims on a mass scale are complex and not as simple as a response to a mothers nagging. Sadly. in all cases I mentioned today. the families knew there was something wrong with their mentally ill loved one but they were ignored and frustrated or turned away by a broken system of State and Federal laws that create walls and barriers instead of access to care. Parents know there is a problem. and even when they have the resources to get a child help. the family efforts are thwarted by this broken system. and they are not getting effective. evidencebased treatment. And communities rarely have the appropriate programs. resources. and doctors to deal with the most severe cases. In the face of this growing crisis. we must approach serious mental illness as a medical emergency that engages a community and medical response to help people and families trapped in this system that is misguided. in denial. and disconnected. We can change this tragic pattern. and that is why I will be reintroducing the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. My legislation makes sure the most severely mentally ill have access to treatment. It fixes the shortage of psychiatric beds. It clarifies and simplifies HIPAA privacy laws. It reforms Federal programs to focus on programs that research shows work. not feelgood fads. It helps patients who arent able to understand their need for treatment get meaningful care. We know that. for example. 50 percent of people with schizophrenia suffer from something called anosognosiathey are not even aware that they have problemsand this leads to noncompliance with treatment and helps to explain why 40 percent of Americans with serious mental illness dont get any treatment. Anosognosia occurs most frequently when schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder affects portions of the frontal lobe. resulting in impaired executive function. The patients are neurologically unable to comprehend that their delusions or hallucinations are not real. This is different than denial. this is a change in the wiring of the brain. We need to understand and respect that. The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act also ensures there is accountability for how public health dollars are being spent. We owe it to the 10 million Americans with a serious mental illness and the 5 million who are not with treatment to take meaningful action to fix the chaotic patchwork of programs and laws that make it impossible to get meaningful medical care until it is too late to do anything beyond mourning. Each day. I receive countless letters and telephone calls from parents across the country who must courageously battle a broken system when trying to help a loved one in mental health crisis. I admire their courage. their compassion. and their passion. Let their struggles be our motivation to take action of our own now. As I said. I will soon be reintroducing my Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. and I welcome all Members interested in joining me in this quest to work together as we reintroduce this to make sure we get treatment before tragedy.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. as the new Congress begins its work on behalf of the American people. I rise to address my colleagues about an issue of national importance. namely Puerto Ricos quest to discard its status as a U.S. territory and to become a U.S. State. Puerto Rico has been a territory since 1898. If Puerto Rico does not desire to remain a territory. it can follow one of two paths. The territory can become a State or it can become a sovereign nation. either fully independent from the U.S. or with a compact of free association with the U.S. that either nation can terminate. If Puerto Rico becomes a nation. future generations of island residents would not be American citizens. My constituents have made countless contributions to the United States in times of peace and war. serving in every military conflict since World War I. They fight today in Afghanistan and other dangerous locations in the same units as young men and women from States such as Florida. Texas. and New Mexico. Many of them have made the ultimate sacrifice in battle. When they do. their casket is flown back to this country draped in the American flag. It takes a special kind of patriotism to fight for a nation that you love. but one that does not treat you equally. Although Puerto Rico is home to more American citizens than 21 States. my constituents cannot vote for President. are not represented in the Senate. and have one nonvoting delegate in the House. Moreover. territory status gives Congress license to treat Puerto Rico worse than the States. and Congress often uses that license. Everyone. other than apologists for the status quo. comprehends that territory status is the root cause of the economic crisis in Puerto Rico. As a result of the structural problems this status has created. residents of Puerto Rico are relocating to the States in staggering numbers. I know it breaks their hearts to leave behind the island they love. but most see no other option. yet through the clouds. a bright sun is emerging. The people of Puerto Rico have finally said. \"No more.\" They have come to the conclusion that they deserve a status that is both democratic and dignified. They will no longer tolerate being secondclass citizens. They do not want special treatment. rather. they demand equal treatment. nothing more but nothing less. The will of the Puerto Rican people was expressed in a 2012 referendum sponsored by the Puerto Rico Government. There. a majority of my constituents expressed their opposition to territory status. Statehood received more votes than territory status. and statehood received far more votes than independence or free association. proving that Puerto Rico has no desire to weaken the bonds forged with the United States over nearly 12 decades. In short. statehood is now the predominant force in Puerto Rico. At my urging and in response to this landmark referendum. the Obama administration proposed and Congress approved an appropriation of $2.5 million to fund the first federallysponsored vote in Puerto Ricos history with the stated goal of resolving the status issue. I have proposed that the funding be used to hold a simple. federally sponsored yesorno vote on whether Puerto Rico should be admitted as a State. just as Alaska and Hawaii did. This approach would yield a definitive result that nobody could reasonably question. and it has broad congressional support. since a bill I introduced last Congress that embodies this approach had 131 cosponsors and led to the filing of an identical Senate companion bill. All that remains is for the Governor of Puerto Rico to schedule the vote. yet a year has passed. and we have seen only inertia and indecision. all talk and no action. For my part. I will continue to press for action both in San Juan and in Washington. D.C.. using any strategy and technique that will advance the statehood cause. Since none of my colleagues in this Chamber representing States would accept territory status for their constituents. I know they will understand that I will not accept it for my constituents either.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. I am honored to stand here today as a Member of the Congress of the United States of America. and I am grateful to my constituents for allowing me to serve in this capacity. My district is a very diverse one. It contains the greatest medical center in the world. the Houston Medical Center. and it contains the first domed stadium. the Astrodome. We speak more than 80 different languages. and the ballot in the Ninth Congressional District in the State of Texas is printed in English. Spanish. Vietnamese. and Chinese. We are indeed a very diverse district. My constituents are constituents not unlike those across the length and breadth of this country. There are issues of concern to them. I want to assure my constituents that as we move into the 114th Congress. I will be pushing legislation that will be important: the LAW Act. the Living American Wage Act. We have filed this bill before. and we will file it again in this Congress. The LAW Act indexes the minimum wage to poverty. It is our belief that anyone who works full time should not live below the poverty line. People should be able to work their way out of poverty. The LAW Act indexes the minimum wage to poverty such that when the poverty level rises. the minimum wage will also elevate. such that people who are working for minimum wage will continue to live above the poverty line. As an aside. I spoke to a person who is working at the wage that is paid to the persons who wait tables. the wait staff. $2.13 an hour. and one of the things that was called to my attention was that these personsgood people. hardworking peopledont always make a lot with these tips that are supposed to supplement their income. I have been told that as little as $8 in one day in tips were being made by one of my constituents. so I am concerned not only about the $7.25 an hour. the minimum wage. but also about the $2.13 an hour. I also supported H.R. 1010. which was filed in the last Congress. and it also indexed the minimum wage. not to poverty. but it did index the minimum wage. I will be concerned about comprehensive immigration reform because in my district. I have a good many persons who are the sons and daughters of immigrants who came here not of their own volition. Many of them came and discovered that they were not American citizens after graduating from high school. I support what the President has done with his executive order. I have to support what he has done with his executive order. given that I am the beneficiary of the greatest executive order ever written: the Emancipation Proclamation. It did not free the slaves. but it did pave the way for the passage of the 13th Amendment. I am honored to say that I support what the President has done. but we still must have comprehensive immigration reform because there is much more to be done. With millions of people living in the shadows. we need to know who is in the country. and we also need to make sure those who are in the country pay their fair share of taxes. that they are a part of the infrastructure that elevates the countrythe economic infrastructureand to do this. we need comprehensive immigration reform. I am also concerned very much about our veterans. This is why in the last Congress. we passed the language that was in the HAVEN Act in the defense authorization bill. Senator JACK REED. thank you so much. Senator JACK REED helped to get that through the Senate. and that language got through the Senate because Senator REED was there. Senator REED. we are eternally grateful. and I think a good many veterans are too. Twenty million dollars was made available to veterans to help those who are lowincome veterans who are injured in some way. such that they cannot use their facilities in their homes as they would without that disability. Counters are lowered. bathrooms are made accessible. and ramps are installed. Senator REED. thank you for helping us to get this $20 million. which will be matched by NGOs who will perform this service and help our veterans. Finally. we are concerned about law enforcement. I respect law enforcement. I support law enforcement. What happened to these peace officers in New York was dastardly done. The dastard that did it is a person that we can never ever in any way glorify. The people who commit crimes ought to be punished. and I support punishment for people who commit crimes. I also support having a system that prevents our law enforcement officers from being falsely accused. I believe that a camera on an officer can make a difference. and I am honored to say that my colleague. the Honorable EMANUEL CLEAVER. and I are working together on bills that we have filed to bring them together. so that we can help our law enforcement avoid specious accusations and make sure that they have the evidence of what actually occurred.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we come to begin this new opportunity of service to the American people. clearly we want to emphasize to them that we take this responsibility seriously and. as well. that we know that we represent our constituents. These are districts that are between thousands of people that are in our congressional districts. but we realize that the broader sense of what we do is to represent our Nation and the values and needs of the American people. Over the last 2 days. as we begin this legislative process. I have been concerned about two issues in particular that I believe do not. if you will. provide for the overall sensitivity to the American people. We were discussing a major financial services bill that will be coming up. Many elements are in this bill. but I want our constituents and. more importantly. our colleagues to realize that you have a bill that will diminish what we call the Volcker rule. What that is is a protection to make sure if banks want to dibble and dabble in risky ventures or risky investments. that they do so with the money that is private and separate from money that is protected by the FDIC. That is your savings accounts. That is the money you socked away. In the instance of this legislation. they want to take that protection away so that banks can dibble and dabble in accounts that are protected by the FDIC. meaning that you pay for mistakes. you pay for collapse. you pay for the wrong decisions that are made. and you lose. I dont want the American people to lose. It is something that has touched my heart because I represent a vast amount of constituents: those who are quite wellendowed. if you will. quite wealthy. such as major corporations and neighbors and others who are doing quite well. and then. of course. I represent children and widows who are dependent on something called SSI. or those who are disabled who are dependent on SSI. And I cannot. for the life of me. understand why we would pass legislation that would. in essence. indicate that we are not going to continue supporting SSI. in fact. that we may call for either the elimination or the decreasing of benefits under SSI. Do we realize. does this Republican leadership realize. that those who receive SSI are the most vulnerable. the poorest. the children who are in great need. the sick who are in great need. people who have worked and who have fallen upon times in which they need that kind of support? Why would we. in the thinking of representing the core of American values. lifting all people. believing in the equality of all. why would we do this? And so my voice is going to be heard loudly and clearly. I call upon. as my Democratic colleagues have so aptly noted. that we raise our voices and that we get in the way and that we stop this kind of intrusion on those who cannot. in some instances. speak for themselves. I want to rise today as well to acknowledge my deepest sympathy to the people of France for the heinous and tragic incident which has just occurred. When I left. there were 12 dead. including two police officers in the line of duty. We pray for their families. and we stand up against this vile act of franchise terrorism. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee. I am grateful to serve on that committee with the ranking member. Mr. THOMPSON. and Chairman MCCAUL. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan manner to confront this kind of dangerous terrorism. recognizing that we do not label people by their faith. but we label them by their actions. Might I also say that I express. again. on the floor. a sympathy for the tragic execution of the NYPD law enforcement officers. We do not stand for that. That individual has been determined to be disturbed. crazed. and does not represent any value of America. We offer our deepest sympathy to those shot recently in the line of duty. Hopefully we will continue working in the Judicial Committee to look at the criminal justice system that really involves a whole number of elements. such as the grand jury system. the special prosecutor system. the constant traffic stops in many instances that are done on a racially profiled scenario. and the uplifting of training and communityoriented policing. Mr. Speaker. we can do all of these things if we work together. but I did not come to this Congress to undermine the criminal justice system or to undermine people who are in need.",

Clint was responsible for getting the Warriors new equipment when they skated with the Blackhawks last season at Soldier Field. and many of the Warriors considered Clint an extended member of their team. This simple gesture was a fitting tribute to Clint and an extraordinary testament to these veterans who have given us all so much. My thoughts and prayers are with the Reif family and the entire Chicago Blackhawks organization during these difficult times.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. for those of you watching at home today. this is not a CSPAN rerun. I stand before you today to discuss the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act. a bill that passed this House 4177 at the end of the previous Congress. This bill is a result of long and difficult bicameral and bipartisan negotiations. But for whatever reason. the previous Senate decided that it was more important to go home a couple of days earlier rather than reauthorize the TRIA program. As a result. the program expired at the end of the year. So. today. the House will act on this important piece of legislation once again. Doing so will provide certainty to the terrorism risk insurance market and ensure that the American economy remains resilient against the threat of terrorism. Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 in the aftermath of 9111. It was intended to provide a 2year transition period in which the market participants could develop resources that would enable them to offer private terrorism insurance coverage once the program expired. For various reasons. that transition has not taken hold. Throughout the last 2 years. my subcommittee learned how evolved the terrorism risk insurance marketplace has become since the last reauthorization. Since the advent of TRIA in 2002. markets have stabilized. risk management practices have improved. terrorism risk modeling and underwriting has advanced. and the price of terrorism risk coverage has actually declined by 70 percent. But we have also learned that this evolution of TRIA has failed to keep up with marketplace realities. In fact. the program remains largely unchanged over the last 12 years. This has hindered the growth of private market participation in terrorism risk insurance and resulted in a bad deal for the taxpayers. The bill before us today is an effort to recognize and to keep pace with the market developments of the terrorism risk insurance marketplace over the past decade. The bill strengthens taxpayer protections without altering the programs fundamental functions. brings greater certainty and stability to the terrorism risk market. and lays a foundation for a more robust private market for terrorism risk. With regard to the taxpayer protection. the programs trigger doubles from $100 million to $200 million. It also decreases the Federal share of insurers losses from 85 percent to 80 percent and enhances the taxpayer repayment requirements. And for the first time. we will have meaningful data on the program to increase accountability and transparency. To provide certainty. the program is extended for 6 years but makes no changes for the first year so that the market will have time to adjust. It also clarifies it streamlines the terrorism certification process so that policyholders are better protected. Most importantly. the bill today creates a framework that will allow for a more healthy private market terrorism risk over time that slowly replaces taxpayerfunded reinsurance with private sector capital. Finally. the bill before us today includes some bipartisan reforms that will help boost the economy and job opportunities for all Americans. These DoddFrank fixes will help Americas hardworking farmers. ranchers. and business owners. They did not cause the financial crisis. and they deserve immediate relief. I am also proud of the inclusion of the reestablishment of the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers. or NARAB. which is an efficient and effective way to enable insurance agents and brokers to be licensed on a multistate basis while retaining essential State regulatory authority. I thank Chairman HENSARLING for trusting me to reform this important program. and I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on H.R. 26. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 26. the TRIA Reauthorization Act of 2015. This bill passed in the last Congress overwhelmingly 4177. I first want to thank Speaker BOEHNER and Leader PELOSI for acting so quickly to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. or TRIA. Unfortunately. this critical program expired on January 1. and unless Congress swiftly reauthorizes TRIA. our economy will be dangerously exposed if we have another terrorist attack. In fact. one of the financial rating agenciesFitchhas said that if Congress doesnt reauthorize TRIA by the end of January. they are going to start downgrading companies and major construction projects. which would hurt the American economy. The other rating agencies have made equally strong statements about the importance to reauthorize TRIA. Already. companies are having trouble getting terrorism insurance. and many companies that had terrorism insurance have now lost it because there were clauses written into their policies that said if TRIA is not there they do not have the insurance coverage. I also want to thank very much Chairman HENSARLING and Chairman NEUGEBAUER. as well as Ranking Member WATERS and the Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. for their very hard work on this bill. which represents a true bipartisan compromise. I especially want to thank my colleagues from New York. PETER KING and Senator SCHUMER. who have worked very hard on this bill. which is critical to the State of New York. and I would say every State in our Union. I believe that this compromise will ensure that terrorism insurance remains available and at affordable prices. This has always been the purpose of TRIA. and I believe that this bill will accomplish that goal. After the last terrorist attack on our homeland9/11insurers realized that they couldnt accurately model for terrorism riskit was simply too unpredictableand the market for terrorism insurance completely shut down. Without terrorism insurance. all construction stopped in New York City. We couldnt build anything. and thousands and thousands of jobs were lost. In response. Congress came together in a bipartisan way and passed TRIA. which provides a government backstop for terrorism insurance. The goal of TRIA was to make terrorism insurance both available and affordable. and that is exactly what it has done. This has come at no additional expense whatsoever or cost to the taxpayer. Initially. the House TRIA bill raised the trigger for the governments backstop by a whopping 500 percent from $100 million to $500 million. This would have forced small- and mediumsized insurers out of the market entirely and would have actually reduced the amount of terrorism insurance available to American businesses. I was strongly opposed to increasing the trigger to $500 million because it would make terrorism insurance unavailable and unaffordable to businesses all across this country. Fortunately. this compromise bill will only raise the trigger for the government backstop from $100 million to $200 million. This modest increase will ensure that small- and mediumsized insurers are not forced out of the market entirely. while also protecting taxpayers. and I fully support this compromise approach. This bill also slightly increases the amount that the government recoups from the industry after TRIA is triggered. which will ensure that taxpayers are fully repaid for TRIA if it is needed. Importantly. the compromise does not include the socalled bifurcation proposal. which would have treated nuclear. biological. chemical. and radiological attacks differently from other socalled conventional attacks. This made no sense whatsoever. and this compromise sensibly drops this proposal entirely. A terrorist attack is a terrorist attack. Finally. I am pleased that the bill reauthorizes TRIA for a full 6 years. This will provide much needed certainty to businesses across the country as they expand and create more American jobs. Support for reauthorization of TRIA is deep and it is strong in the business community across this country. Mr. Speaker. I enter into the RECORD a letter from 28 different business stakeholders strongly supporting the reauthorization and the need for TRIA. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: American businesses strongly support H.R. 26 the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. This bill is the same as the TRIA legislation that passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 417 7 on December 10. 2014. Our coalition represents a diverse and broad majority of business stakeholders. We urge you to SUPPORT the bill when it is considered under suspension of the rules this week. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act is vital to the millions of businesses. job creators. and workers across the country reliant on TRIA to secure terrorism insurance and protect our economic growth. Following the attacks of September 11. 2001. Congress created TRIA to address a void in the marketplace. foster economic stability. and provide certainty to forprofit and nonprofit entities across the country. For the past dozen years. the United States has relied on TRIA as a fiscally responsible terrorism risk management plan to protect taxpayers and our national security and stability. It is critical that Congress act immediately to keep our terrorism insurance protection program in place. We urge your support of this important bill. Sincerely.

I want to thank my good friend and vice chairman of the Agriculture Committee. RANDY NEUGEBAUER. for his work in shepherding this bill to the floor again. I would also like to thank him and Chairman HENSARLING for fighting hard to include the Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act as title III of todays bill. The House Committee on Agriculture. along with the Financial Services Committee. has made moving this legislation a priority. Despite the lengthy title. the Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act is not a complicated bill. It fulfills the promise that this body made to our farmers. ranchers. and small businesses when DoddFrank was drafted and signed into law that end users would not be treated as financial firms. Yet regulators have narrowly interpreted the exemptions in the black letter of the law. forcing some businesses to leave capital idle in margin accounts. rather than investing in new production and creating jobs. Forcing businesses to post margin not only ties up capital. but also makes it more expensive for firms to utilize the risk management tools that they need to protect their businesses from uncertainty. Todays bill clarifies in statute that Congress meant what it said when it exempted end users from margin and clearing requirements. Specifically. it ensures that those businesses which are exempt from clearing their hedges are also exempt from margining those hedges. This wellreasoned legislation has broad bipartisan support. As a standalone bill. the House overwhelmingly supported it last year in June by a vote of 41112. Since then. we have passed it four more timesand if we pass it today. a fifth timewhich means we will keep doing it until we get it right. I am hopeful that with todays vote. we can finally offer farmers. ranchers. and businesses the relief we promised them almost 5 years ago. Again.

Mr. Speaker this bill contains another very important piece: we affectionately call it NARAB. which is the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokersjust think if TRIA and the NARAB portion of this bill had been in place in 1999. before we had the terrorism risk. before we had the terrorist strikes of 9111. and other terrorist attacks. But in the middle of all of that. even with the downturn of the economic calamity. standing in the middle of this storm were our insurance agents. the lifeline of the American people. What NARAB is doing here is making sure that we streamline the process and make sure that our insurance agents are able to operate across State lines. Mr. Speaker. we all realize that insurance is a Statelicensed. Stateauthorized operation. NARAB does not interfere with that. As a matter of fact. all 50 of the insurance agents of our States have all agreed with NARAB. This is an important bill because our insurance agents. our small businesses. are the lifeline in tragedy and distress. We live in a highly mobile society now. It is very important for our agents to be able to go across State lines with one licensing procedure that is held to the highest standard while at the same time being licensed in their own State. We have had great cooperation from all of our insurance agents. including the insurance agents association. Our financial advisers and our brokers all agree. The other thing. Mr. Speaker. is that many of us on the Financial Services Committee have been working on this measure for 10 years. For 10 years. we have been toiling in the vineyards on this and so have others in the Senate.

Chairman HENSARLING. at times. thought they were tiresome. I want to thank the chairman for putting a good spin on it. but very seriously. I want to thank him for his efforts. This is a bill where a number of us started off from different positions. from different perspectives. In true legislative form. we came together. This bill that we passed in December was a solid bill. Unfortunately. it was not taken up by the Senate. but it is essential that we pass it today because. as my good friend Mrs. MALONEY said. this could have a devastating effect on the construction industry and on the American economy if it is not renewed as quickly as possible. This has to be reauthorized. It is absolutely essential. I want to thank Chairman HENSARLING again for his efforts throughout this. Again. it has been a long process. but we stayed at it. and I thank him for that. Obviously. I thank Mrs. MALONEY and the ranking member. Ms. WATERS. Also. Mr. CAPUANO has been a fighter on this from the start. Again. we came together. This is a bill that. as I have said a number of times. was absolutely essential after September 11. when terrorism risk insurance could not be obtained. It even became more obvious as time went on how essential it was. how we desperately need it. and we have to preserve it. Also. not one Federal dollar has been expended on it. yet billions of dollars in revenue. construction projects. jobs. and expansion of the economy has resulted because of it. We are voting today. in a way. on a bill which. as Mrs. MALONEY said. is going to go on for another 6 years. That gives it permanence and stability. It gives the construction industry. the real estate industry. and the people on the ground who want those construction jobs the ability to go forward. It lets municipalities know there is going to be construction going ahead in their jurisdictions. It is a plusplus all the way. The changes that were made. the reforms that were made. I didnt believe they had to be done. but the fact is they are done. and they are not going to change the overall impact. They are not going to have any meaningful determinative effect whatsoever. Again. I am proud to support this bill in all its aspects. Mr. SCOTT from Georgia had a great concern about the insurers. I share that also. I think it is important that be in this bill. I know that was a bit of an obstacle in the Senate. but it shouldnt be. It had overwhelming support in the House. I know the great majority of the Members in the Senate support it. Now. we pass this on suspension today. sending a strong signal how we support this bill in its entirety. From my conversationsand I think Mrs. MALONEY has had the same conversationswe feel confident that the Senate is going to pass it. When they do. it will be a victory for the American people. a victory for American business. a victory for American labor. and a victory for the American people to show that we have fought all the way back from the horrors of 9111. and we are going to make sure that never again are we put in that position as far as the damage it can have on our economy. I would end this by saying that when we saw the attack in Paris today. we realized what can happen with a terrorist attack. how it can happen at any moment. and why it is essential this be reauthorized. Again. I thank the chairman for his efforts and patience over the last several years.",

There is plenty of room for compromise. plenty of room to get together and talk about it and get something done for the American people and the American economy. That is just one example. We have to get beyond the outside ideological groups telling us what we can and cannot do. Even if we agree with them. we have to understand we are elected to lead. to argue. and then to compromise. We are here today. finally. Thank you. Lets not get bogged down any further in this new Congress. We will have our differences. and we will have some differences that cannot be resolved. This was never one of them. I think there is plenty of room on Fannie and Freddie. I think there are issues on insurance. I think there are plenty of issues we can and should work on. We both have our outside groups to deal with. We both have to turn to them with loving attention and tell you: \"We love you. we agree with you. but I was elected to move the ball forward.\" That is what we are doing here today. and I congratulate those people that have finally done it. including the two people leading this bill. both the chairman and the ranking member of the committee. and other members of this committee that have worked on this for so long.

Mr. Speaker. as we have all recently seen. terrorism and violence continues to be a threat not only to our friends on the other side of the globe. but also to our homeland. The rise of ISIS has demonstrated that the American people and our interests are constant targets. Because these dangers continue to grow. it is our job to make sure we are taking the necessary steps to protect ourselves. The terror attacks on September 11. 2001. not only brought a devastating loss of innocent human life. they also wreaked havoc on our economy. costing insurers tens of billions of dollars. taking years to recover. We have to take the necessary steps to protect and prevent any physical harm to America and make sure we are doing what we can to protect our economic interests. That is what todays legislation is all about. When first passed in 2002. TRIA provided muchneeded stability to ease any economic pain of another attack. Todays reauthorization will continue to provide a necessary backstop and the financial security that will allow major commercial and real estate projects so vital to the economy to move forward. Reauthorizing this legislation is an opportunity for both parties to stand together in a bipartisan fashion and strengthen our national security. I would like to thank Chairman HENSARLING. Representative NEUGEBAUER. and the rest of the members of the Financial Services Committee for their hard work on this issue. It has taken time to get to this point. but I believe this is a good way for us to start this Congress. working together to pass a bill that is in the best interest of our national security.",

I brought this up on regular conferences and colloquies that I had with Mr. Cantor and more recently with Mr. MCCARTHY. but it is always timely to do the right thing. Today. we are doing the right thing. and I rise in strong support of the passage of this bill. Reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Program Reauthorization Act will provide muchneeded certainty to businesses and insurers. certainty that will help our economy and prevent harm to job creation. I believe Congress has the responsibility to reauthorize the TRIA program. and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting to do so today. This program expired at the end of 2014. and Congress must take action on TRIA without delay. I would reiterate that this program as incorporated in this piece of legislation has had well over 250 votes for at least the last year and a half. but it is never too late to do the right thing. The longer Congress waits. the worse the effects will be on our economy and job creation. I want to thank Ranking Member WATERS. I want to thank Ranking Member VELXZQUEZ for her work on this as well and. as I said. the leadership on the majority side that finally got us to a point where we could make an agreement last year. We passed a bill last year. I regret that the Senate didnt pass it. but I applaud the majoritys bringing it to the floor as one of the first pieces of business that we do.

I call on my colleagues to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. a publicprivate partnership that is vital to continued economic development across the country. Following the tragic events of 9111. terrorism became uninsurable. the marketplace evaporated. and rates skyrocketed. Many businesses were impacted. causing job losses and hindering the recovery effort. To address the growing problem. Congress swiftly passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. creating a Federal backstop and restoring coverage. Today I can say without a doubt. our efforts were successful. I have witnessed firsthand how this program has substantially helped New York City recover and prosper over the past 12 years. The program has also tripled the number of small businesses nationwide that have terrorism protection. As a direct result of TRIA. over 60 percent of small firms carry some form of coverage. Some stakeholders have already reported disruptions since TRIA lapsed last week. especially in highrisk cities such as New York. It should be noted that the lapse is not only affecting insurance coverage. but also the financing efforts of many jobcreating construction projects. Is this bill perfect? No. but it will restore certainty to the marketplace and prevent a rate spike that could force twothirds of small businesses out of the market. Mr. Speaker. acts of terrorism remain too risky to cover for the vast majority of carriers. especially for the small- and mediumsized firms that dominate the insurance industry. As a result. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. which has not cost taxpayers $1. continues to be a vital component of our economic growth and national security. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

I can speak from personal experience. having represented New York during and after 9111. that after 9111 you could not even build a hot dog stand. All construction stopped. No one could get any insurance. The only insurance available was from Lloyds of London. and it was incredibly expensive and people could not afford it. We lost thousands and thousands of jobs. And it happened also. when we came together and started to rebuild not only in New York but the Pentagon and Pennsylvania. I would say. of all the programs that this body put forwardand there were many. and I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their supportI truly believe that this particular one was certainly the most important in helping New York rebuild and rebound. I want to add that it did not cost our taxpayers one single dime. It is an innovative way to get building and construction happening across this country. So it is tremendously important to the economy. It is an important bill. and I am so pleased that it has been a bipartisan effort. This body passed the bill. It stalled in the Senate. but we do need to reauthorize it as swiftly and as quickly as possible. I hope it is an example of how this body can work together on legislation that is critical to this country to rebuild and expand the jobs and our economy and to help strengthen our country in other ways.

It is a piece of legislation that passed overwhelmingly in the House in the 113th Congress. Unfortunately. it was not taken up by the Senate. This is a winwin bill. It does a number of really good things for the country. and. more importantly. for the taxpayers. it begins to bring reform in a program that originally was meant to be a temporary program but somehow has become a permanent program. beginning to stairstepup the private market participation and stairstepdown the taxpayers participation. It increases the trigger. it increases the amount of recovery that the taxpayers would be able to recover in the case of an event. Another thing you heard many people talk about is this enduser provision that is going to help farmers and ranchers and small businesses not have to put up additional capital so they can use that capital to create jobs for America. Another provision in this bill is the NARAB II. which is a small business provision allowing your local insurance agent. maybe he or she can sell insurance in multiple States by being a member of NARAB and being able to not have to get a license in each individual State. but if they are licensed and meet the qualifications in that State. that is recognized by other States.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. What is before us today is a mini omnibus bill that contains. actually. 11 separate pieces of legislation. some of which may not be controversial but some of which are incredibly controversial and do not belong in this legislation. This is not an emergency. We have a new Congress. This bill should go through the regular order. Unlike the TRIA bill we just talked about. this bill is a bill which should and must go through the regular order. and it is absolutely inappropriate for the suspension calendar. Our Republican friends would have us believe that this is just some benign piece of legislation. yet this bill contains not only procedural problems but substantive problems which have never seen the light of day in any committee. Some of the legislation has only been public for about 24 hours. and what is particularly frightening is that the text of the bill has changed at least three times since Tuesday. We just got started yesterday in talking about the importance of regular order. and we are already violating those claims and promises. Mr. Speaker. the House of Representatives should return to regular order with this piece of legislation. and I urge my colleagues to reject it. Regular order. whereby legislation is debated at a hearing. marked up by a committee. and then finally considered by the whole House. is the process by which we vet legislation. That is not going on right here and right now. and there is no good reason for it. We do this to ensure that we fully understand the changing law. Nevertheless. Republicans have come here to suspend the rules and to consider a package of 11 bills which will ease the oversight of Wall Street firms. large banks. multinational corporations. and certain brokers. It should be pointed out right now that the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee. MAXINE WATERS. who is unable to be in Washington due to personal matters she has to address. has issued a call to reject this piece of legislation for many of the reasons I am articulating now. I think it is also important to point out that there are 52 Members of Congress who were sworn in yesterday and who represent more than 30 million Americans who will have to vote on bills affecting a collateral firms pledge. when they borrow money. affecting what information must be disclosed about certain brokers and financial statements of firms. without the opportunity to offer changes. This is the absolute antithesis of regular order. and this bill is not appropriate. We urge a \"no.\" I would like to talk a little bit about the specific reasons this bill is bad. Members should know that this is not the identical bill that came through in the fall. It has very important changes. If you voted for it last fall. that is no reason to vote for this bill now. First. the Volcker rule. This bill undercuts an important part of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Volcker rule was intended to prevent deposittaking banksbanks that use money insured by the Federal Government. the peoples moneyfrom making bets and using taxpayerinsured funds. The Federal Reserve went out of its way to try to ease the transition to a safer system. but this bill would give megabanks an additional 2 years. totaling 5 years. to sell off certain securities in which they retain ownership rights5 more years of risk. 5 more years of massive profittaking. This provision. which almost certainly juices the profits of big. megabanks like Citigroup and JPMorgan. has never been vetted. The public has not even had a day to review the text. It is wrong that bills that help Wall Street and multinational corporations get fasttracked on day 2 of this Congress while bills that help working families get slowed up for years. literally. Just last month. Republicans successfully handed Citigroup and other megabanks a multibilliondollar gift by repealing another reform measure. known as the \"swaps pushout.\" which was intended to prevent another Great Recession. The repeal of that provision allowed the megabanks to continue to borrow money from the Federal Reserve lending window. which is currently at about zero percent interest. to finance their risky derivatives. Experts have weighed in. Let me read for the RECORD the statement by the CEO of Better Markets: \"Its all about the bonus pool.\" said Dennis Kelleher. president and CEO of Better Markets. a financial reform nonprofit. \"The attack on the Volcker rule has been nonstop because proprietary trading is about bigtime bets that result in bigtime bonuses. Wall Street has been fighting it from day one. and theyre not going to stop.\" If you believe that there are things in this mini omnibus. or this megabill. that might be worth your support. understand that this particular provision has not been vetted anywhere. For that reason alone they are literally trying to sneak it in. and you should vote against it. Also. this particular bill includes three other provisions that weaken the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These provisions take away the authority of regulators who are charged with ensuring that everybody plays by the same rules so that. if at some point in the future. we find out that our financial system is threatened. our regulators will be unable to take decisive action to fix the problems that they can fix today. After witnessing the effect that one type of derivativethe credit default swaphad in spreading losses from the subprime mortgage market around the world. I would like to know why our first order of business in this Congress is to roll back the financial reforms that this Congress deliberated on and passed over an 18month period following the 2008 financial crisis. This bill undermines investor protections. It includes three provisions that have the potential to leave investors worse off than they are today. As we proclaim small investors and workers and all of these things. why are we undermining investor protections? In one instance. the bill exempts individuals who would broker a merger of a privately owned company to be exempt from SEC regulations. Since this legislation passed in a previous Congress. the SEC has taken action to make this unnecessary. However. if we pass this bill today. we will undermine a few basic investor protections that the SEC has retained. For example. the SEC determined that bad actors. such as convicted securities fraudsters. should not be able to take advantage of a carveout. However. by voting \"yes.\" you are saying that it is okay for people convicted of fraud to sell other things. like franchises or the restaurant down the street. Another provision would allow 75 percent of all public companies to no longer report their financial statements in computer readable formats. When everything is online today and when investors rely on computers to crunch the financials of various companies. this bill comes across as a huge step backwards. My colleagues want to address this bill. and I think it is important that they do. So. at this point. I am going to urge a \"no\" vote. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for allowing me to speak on his bill. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 37. the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. I am especially proud of and would like to highlight the past work of the Agriculture Committee on the three titles of this bill under its jurisdiction: the Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act. a provision on the treatment of affiliate transactions. and a provision regarding swap data repository and clearinghouse indemnification correction. As I noted in the debate earlier today on TRIA. the Business Risk Mitigation and Price Stabilization Act is legislation to clarify Congress intent to exempt nonfinancial businesses from a misguided regulatory requirement to post margin requirements on their hedging activities. Clearing and margining. while appropriate for some transactions. are not appropriate for end users hedging realworld commercial risks. Their hedging activities are not large enough to present a systemic risk. and a margin requirement represents a significant and needless expense with little value to the overall financial system. Title I puts in statute protections for American businesses. To grow our economy. businesses should use their scarce capital to buy new equipment. to hire more workers. to build new facilities. and to invest in the future. They cannot do that if they are required to hold money in margin accounts to fulfill a misguided regulation. Similarly. title II. regarding the treatment of interaffiliate transactions. was also passed by the House multiple times in the 113th Congress. and it will provide additional certainty to American businesses. It will do so by preventing the redundant regulation of harmless interaffiliate transactions that would unnecessarily tie up the working capital of companies. with no added protections for the market or benefits to our consumers. Today. businesses across the Nation rely on the ability to centralize their hedging activities. This consolidation of a hedging portfolio across a corporate group allows businesses to reduce costs. to simplify their financial dealings. and to reduce their counterparty credit risk. Title II of this bill will allow American businesses to continue utilizing this efficient. timetested model. Finally. title V of H.R. 37 provides muchneeded corrections to the swap data repository and clearinghouse indemnification requirements of DoddFrank. Currently. DoddFrank requires a foreign regulator requesting information from a U.S. swap data repository or derivatives clearing organization to provide a written agreement stating it will abide by certain confidentiality requirements and will indemnify the U.S. Commissions for any expenses arising from litigation relating to the request for that information. The concept of indemnificationrequiring a party to contractually agree to pay for another partys possible litigation expensesis established within U.S. tort law and does not exist in many foreign jurisdictions. Thus. it is not possible for some foreign regulators to agree to these indemnification requirements. This requirement threatens to make datasharing arrangements with foreign regulators unworkable. H.R. 37 mitigates this problem by simply removing the indemnification provisions in DoddFrank while maintaining the prerequisite written agreement requiring certain confidentiality obligations will be met. So. rather than stripping down DoddFrank. as we are so often accused of doing. this change would actually serve to enhance market transparency and risk mitigation by ensuring that regulators and market participants have access to a global set of swap market data. As chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture and as a cosponsor of each of these three bills in the 113th Congress. I appreciate Mr. FITZPATRICKS work in bringing these provisions together in a package that reduces the regulatory burdens and that promotes economic growth. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the legislation.",

This legislation just continues to give and give and give to Wall Street. Despite the fact that my principal objection is with the lack of adherence to regular order and the process of legislating. substantively. there are problems with this legislation. Wall Street banks. whose banks and traders recklessly drove this country into a financial crisis. are being rewarded yet again. and I cant accept it. I cant support it. What is really interesting to me is that here we are. less than 24 hours since we have been in Congress. yet in the last Congress. when Main Street had its needs. when unemployed people couldnt get Federal unemployment benefits. we couldnt get a hearing. we couldnt get a vote on the floor of the House for legislation that was bipartisan. that had an equal number of Democrats and Republicans supporting it. When Wall Street asks. we suspend the rules in less than a day without taking a breath and move to fit their needs into our schedule. But when Main Street needs help. Congress didnt give an answer.

I continue to hear from my constituents about the impacts of unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations on job creation. especially regulations that disproportionately affect smaller public companies and those considering accessing capital in the public markets.

While the SECs rule is well intended. this requirement has become another example of a regulation where the costs outweigh the potential benefits. These small companies expend tens of thousands of dollars or more complying with the regulation. yet there is evidence that less than 10 percent of investors actually use XBRL. further diminishing its potential benefits. That is why last Congress. the gentlewoman from Alabama. Representative SEWELL. and I authored the bipartisan Small Company Disclosure Simplification Act. which is incorporated into title VII of H.R. 37. I would like to thank Representative SEWELL for her diligent work on this legislation. which passed the Financial Services Committee last Congress with bipartisan support. This provision will provide an optional exemption for emerging growth companies and smaller public companies from the requirement to file their information in XBRL with the SEC. in addition to the information that they already file. Additionally. this title requires the SEC to perform a costbenefit analysis on the rules impact on smaller public companies. something it failed to adequately address in the original rule. and also to provide additional information to Congress on how the SEC and the market are using XBRL. Whether a supporter or a sceptic of XBRL. these provisions will help provide a pathway for the SEC to focus on developing a system of disclosure for smaller companies that eliminates unnecessary costs while achieving greater benefits. I believe H.R. 37 offers a practical step forward on these regulatory requirements in line with the intent of the original JOBS Act. ensuring that our regulatory structure is not disproportionately burdening smaller companies and disincentivizing innovative startups from accessing the public markets. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting \"yes\" on H.R. 37 so that we can continue to promote capital access in the public markets and spur job growth in communities all across this great country.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 37 and would particularly like to comment on title V. In order to provide market transparency. the DoddFrank law requires posttrade reporting to Swap Data Repositories. or SDRs. as they are called. so that regulators and market participants have access to realtime market data that help identify systemic risk in the financial system. So far. we have made great strides in reaching this goal. but unfortunately. a provision in the law threatens to undermine our progress unless we fix it. Currently. DoddFrank includes a provision requiring a foreign regulator to indemnify a U.S.-based SDR for any expenses arising from litigation relating to a request for market data. Unlike the rest of the world. though. the concept of indemnification is only established within U.S. tort law. As a result. foreign regulators have been reluctant to comply with this provision. and international regulatory coordination is being thwarted. While the intent of the provision was to protect market confidentiality. in practice. it threatens to fragment global data on swap markets. Without effective coordination between international regulators and SDRs. monitoring and mitigating global systemic risk is severely limited. H.R. 37 fixes this problem by removing the indemnification provisions in DoddFrank. This has broad bipartisan support. and a separate bill to do this was unanimously approved last year by the House Ag Committee and the House Financial Services Committee. Additionally. last year. the SEC testified to the Financial Services Committee that a legislative solution was needed. saying: \"In removing the indemnification requirement. Congress would assist the SEC. as well as other regulators. in securing the access it needs to data held in global trade repositories.\" If left unresolved. the indemnification provision in DoddFrank has the potential to effectively reduce transparency and undo the great progress already being made through the cooperative efforts of more than 50 regulators worldwide. In passing this legislation. we will ensure that regulators will have access to a global set of swap market data. which is essential to maintaining the highest degree of market transparency and risk mitigation. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on this bill.",

And of course they gambled. They won a lot of money. And then when they lost. they didnt lose their money. They lost our money. and we had to come in with a bailout. This is a corporate bailoutnot with taxpayer money. but with depositor money. depositors who are not interested in giving their money to an institution so that they can gamble it on risky items that they will see no benefit from. That is what the Volcker rule says: if you want to gamble. use your money. Good luck. Dont gamble with my money unless I say so. That is all the Volker rule says. It has worked pretty well.

DELANEY. and WAGNER for working with me on one of the underlying bills. the bipartisan H.R. 801. in the last Congress. Mr. Speaker. in this new Congress. adding jobs to our economy is a top priority. And passing the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act is an opportunity for us to create a better environment for private sector growth and job creation. Title III. also known as H.R. 801. is no exception. and I am proud to rise in support of its passage. A year ago this month. I came to this floor to speak on the underlying bill which passed overwhelmingly in this Chamber 4174. While it is unfortunate the bill was never considered by the Senate. it is clear today that in the 114th Congress. its prospects are better. Small financial institutions are essential to the communities they serve. They have a deep and abiding love for the towns they serve because these towns are their towns. and our constituentssmall business owners. farmers. hardworking Americansrely on these institutions to meet payroll. to purchase equipment. or to buy a car or home. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. these financial institutions have come under fire from Washington because of its regulatory overreach. forcing them to spend increasing shares of their resources to comply with onerous regulationsrequirements intended for larger banksinstead of having the flexibility they need to serve their communities. Lets be clear: small community banks and savings and loan holding companies were not the cause of the financial crisis. and I dont believe they should be treated as though they were the cause. I am not alone. In the 112th Congress. the House and Senate acted to eliminate some of these unnecessary burdens by passing the JOBS Act. Among other things. the bill raised the registration threshold for bank holding companies from 500 to 2.000 shareholders and increased the deregistration threshold from 300 to 1.200 shareholders. better positioning these banks to increase small business lending and. in turn. promote economic growth in our communities. but due to an oversight in the JOBS Act. it did not explicitly extend these new thresholds to savings and loan holding companies as well. As a cosponsor of the JOBS Act. I can say with absolute certainty that wasnt our intent. and I subsequently supported report language in the approps bill of Financial Services to clarify and ensure that savings and loan holding companies should be treated in the same manner as bank and bank holding companies. Additionally. Representative HIMES and I have written to the FCC and asked that they use their authority to carry out our original intent. In spite of these actions and the House passage of H.R. 801 last Congress. we are still without successful resolution to the problem. Todays vote can change that.

We put taxpayers back on the hook for losses that are connected to certain derivatives trading. among the riskiest bets that banks make. Well. Christmas is over. and Hanukkah is over. but the gifts keep on coming for Wall Street. Within this bill is another provision that cuts at the heart of the DoddFrank Wall Street reform legislation. It delays a portion of the Volcker rule. which bans federally insured banks from making those risky bets or investing in risky funds. including packages known as collateralized loan obligations. or CLOs. Mortgagebacked securities brought our economy almost crumbling to the ground in 2008. and we are still recovering. Taxpayers bailed out the big banks. yet for millions of homeowners who were forced from their homes and millions of others who are still under water. there hasnt been any assistance. People are right to be angry about this. and they are right to object to this new giveaway to Wall Street interests. CLOs are similar to toxic mortgagebacked securities. The only difference is that instead of bad mortgages. these packages involve junkrated corporate loans and a mix of other risky assets. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said last month that the corporate debt market is overheating and becoming increasingly dangerous. and CLOs are the big reason why. This has all the markings of another economycrushing disaster. Who gets the upside if Wall Street is able to continue packaging and selling CLOs with taxpayer backing? Wall Street.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 37. The Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act of 2015. This Trojan Horse legislation is actually a combination of eleven separate bills. ten of which were authored by Republican members of the Committee. I believe that Members should be afforded the opportunity to offer amendments and have a full and fair debate on these bills. However. by considering this package under Suspension of the Rules. Republicans begin the new year by denying Members the opportunity to thoroughly debate a measure that will have farreaching impact. Lets be clear: regulators have made tremendous progress in implementing the DoddFrank Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already returned $4.6 billion to 15 million consumers who have been subjected to unfair and deceptive practices. some of whom live in my Congressional District in Houston. The CFPB has established a qualified mortgage rule. ensuring that borrowers who are extended mortgage credit actually have the ability to repay the loan. and has established new rulesoftheroad for mortgage servicers. In addition. the CFPB has worked with the Department of Defense to develop financial protections for service members and veterans. and established a national database to aide consumers with complaints about debt collectors. credit card companies. and credit rating agencies. among others. Let us not turn back the clock on American consumers who already have seen the benefits of the CFPBs efforts. The Volcker Rule has forced banks to selloff their standalone proprietary trading desks. and banks have shifted away from speculative trading to investments in the real economy. Shareholders of U.S. corporations now have the ability to have a \"sayonpay.\" voting to approve or disapprove executive compensation. In addition Mr. Speaker. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recovered more than $9.3 billion in civil fines and penalties since 2011. leveraging enhanced authorities provided by DoddFrank. The SEC has also established an Office of the Whistleblower to aid them in policing securities market violations. which has already received more than 6.573 tips from 68 countries. Further. private funds are making systemic risk reports to regulators. helping them to understand previously opaque risks. To implement the DoddFrank Act. the CFTC has completed 65 final rules. orders. and guidance documents resulting in the registration and enhanced oversight of 102 Swap Dealers. two Major Swap Participants. 22 Swap Execution Facilities. and four Swap Data Repositories. In addition. the CFTC has established rules governing mandatory clearing. exchange trading. and reporting of the entire $400 trillion notional swaps market. It should also be noted that since DoddFranks passage. stability in the market has led to significant economic growth. Nearly 9.7 million private sector payroll jobs have been created since February 2010. There are now nearly 900.000 more workers employed in the private sector than before recessionrelated job losses began in early 2008. The unemployment rate has fallen by 3.9 percentage points since its peak of 10.0 percent in October 2009 and currently stands at 6.1 percentits lowest level since September 2008. Real GDP has grown 10.2 percent since its trough in 2009. and now stands 5.5 percent higher than its prerecession peak in late 2007. That in and of itself is news that the media should be discussing. Moreover. the housing market is recovering. with home prices rising. negative equity falling dramatically. and measures of mortgage distress improving. The S&P 500 has risen by 85 percent since July 21. 2010 and has recently reached new peaks. However. this progress has been regularly stymied by a concerted effort by the Majority to underfund regulators operations. relentlessly pressure them to weaken regulations. and otherwise erect roadblocks to implementation. As a result. the progress regulators have made to implement the law remains precarious. I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation and have a full debate on its merits.",

This research is critical for physicians and decisionmakers to more accurately assess potential health risks in this area. I want to thank my friend. Mr. HULTGREN. for introducing this legislation along with Mr. LIPINSKI of Illinois. A virtually identical bill passed the House by a voice vote this past November in the previous Congress. Many Americans are exposed to a broad range of low doses of ionizing radiation. These range from cosmic background radiation to medicallybased procedures which include x rays and CT scans. However. our current approach of radiation safety relies on an outmoded assumption that because high doses of radiation are harmful. it necessarily follows that much lower radiation doses are also harmful. This assumption is not based on a reliable scientific foundation. prevents patients from making informed decisions about diagnostic exams. and can lead to overly restrictive regulations. The Department of Energys Low Dose Radiation Research Program within the Office of Science focuses on the health effects of ionizing radiation and helps to resolve the uncertainties in this area that currently exist. Unfortunately. this program has not been a priority at DOE over recent years and has seen systematic deemphasis. H.R. 35 ensures the continuance and enhancement of this important research program. This legislation also directs the National Academies to formulate a longterm strategy to resolve uncertainties surrounding whether and to what extent lowdose radiation may pose health risks to humans. The bill stipulates that the academies must consider the most uptodate studies in this field of research. Finally. the bill requires the Department of Energy to develop a 5year research plan that responds to the Academies recommendations. I again thank the gentlemen from Illinois. Representatives HULTGREN and LIPINSKI. for their leadership on this issue. I also want to commend Congressmen SENSENBRENNER. POSEY.

While it may sound scary. we come in contact with small amounts of radiation every day from the cosmic background which many Americans are probably unaware of. Of course. radiation has been a useful tool which has led to innovation for medical imaging. like x rays and treatments. Numerous processes used by manufacturers in my home State of Illinois. for instance. include lowdose radiation to carry out precise and accurate measurements. But it is time that the regulatory structure surrounding exposure to lowdose radiation relies on sound science. Currently. the assumption is that because high doses of radiation are harmful to human health. lower doses must be. too. This is similar to saying that jumping down one step in a flight of stairs is harmful to your health because we already know that it is harmful to jump down an entire flight of stairs at one time. While there is little doubt that there is a threshold above which humans should avoid exposure to radiation. this legislation will ensure that the Department of Energys Office of Science prioritizes the research necessary to understand what that level actually is. My bill directs the agency to work with the National Academies to formulate a longterm research plan to do this work. As I continue to represent my constituents of the 14th Congressional District of Illinois. I will always champion the things we are doing right in Illinois.

H.R. 23. the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2015. reauthorizes the activities of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program through Representative RANDY NEUGEBAUER. my Texas colleague. has championed this program for over a decade. In the last Congress. he and Representative FREDERICA WILSONs bipartisan efforts helped move this legislation through the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology and to successfully pass the House. It is because of their past work that we are able to bring this bill to the House floor so early in this Congress. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program supports Federal research and development efforts to help mitigate the loss of life and property due to windrelated hazards. Millions of Americans live in areas vulnerable to hurricanes. tornadoes. and other windstorms. The National Weather Service reported 91 deaths and 892 injuries in 2013 due to tornadoes. thunderstorm wind. and high wind. We all remember that in 2011 that was the year marred by loss due to windstorms. According to the National Science and Technology Councils biennial report to Congress. in 2011 only. windstorms in the United States took nearly 700 lives. injured nearly 7.000 people. and caused an estimated $11 billion in total direct property losses. In Texas. we are all too familiar with the harm that excess wind can cause. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Storm Prediction Center. 128 tornadoes and 1.366 windstorms were reported in Texas in the last 2 years. The effects of these disasters can be felt for a long time. Initially established in 2004. the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program supports activities to improve our understanding of windstorms and their impacts and helps to develop and encourage the implementation of costeffective mitigation measures. H.R. 23 establishes the National Institute of Standards and Technology as the lead agency for the program. improves coordination and planning of agency activities in a fiscally responsible manner. and improves transparency for how much money is being spent on windstorm research.

First I want to thank Representatives NEUGEBAUER and WILSON for their hard work on this important legislation that will benefit our constituents. Americans face significant exposure to windstorms. According to the National Weather Service. between the years of 2003 and 2013. thousands of Americans lost their lives from the impacts of windstorms. Along with the loss of life. windstorms during that time caused billions of dollars of damage to property. including a severely negative impact on agricultural crops. Although we cannot stop a windstorm from happening. there is much we can do to save both lives and property when windstorms and other natural disasters do happen. In addition to responding quickly and with sufficient resources in the aftermath of a natural disaster. we must also invest in preparedness and resilience. Studies of FEMAs PreDisaster Mitigation program have shown that for every dollar invested in mitigation activities. $3 to $4 in recovery costs can be saved. The National Windstorm Reduction Program Act is primarily a mitigation program. It has the potential to lessen the loss of life and economic damage by supporting research and development on windstorms and their impacts and helping to ensure that this research is translated into improving building codes and emergency planning. but this program needs robust investment to achieve that result. The bill today includes a lower total authorization level than was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008. We can and we should do better than that. One of our responsibilities as a government should be to assist our constituents with disaster mitigation and response and preparedness. and that means investing in programs we already have in place to carry out these responsibilities.

You know. particularly 2011 was a very bad year. As it was pointed out. we had a number of people that were killed that year and over $28 billion in damage to property alone. What is happening is the risk is growing because our population centers are growing. You know. a tornado that goes through a town center does a lot more damage than one that goes through an empty prairie. As these storms are getting costlier over time. at a time where we are $18 trillion in debt. it is important that we utilize the taxpayers resources in an effective way. This particular program. as it was mentioned. is reauthorized at a fixed level. the level from previous reauthorization. but also it is designed to make the program more efficient and effective in the future. When a family loses a home. you know. they dont have to just rebuild the house. they have to rebuild their lives. We know a lot of people have either experienced losses of property or life. loved ones. or they know people that have. In particular. it is a personal thing for me because. on May llth of 1970. I had just taken my last final for that semester at Texas Tech University. and 3 hours or 4 hours later. a major tornado ripped through Lubbock. Texas. and killed 26 people. including destroying the apartment complex that I lived in. I was fortunately unharmed in that event. but what I did get to witness is the tremendous amount of damage that can happen from these storms and the loss of life. You saw things that you didnt think were possiblecars in parking lots that were rolled up and swirled up like an ice cream cone. So one of the things that later on. to me. in the building business. one of the things that we began to learn is. from important research that was done. that we were able to use certain building techniques that made houses more wind resistant. made buildings more wind resistant. and that is exactly what this bill. NWIRP. does. It takes these four agencies that currently have jurisdiction over thatand those include NOAA. the National Science Foundation. FEMA. and NISTand makes sure that they are using those funds appropriately and that there is not a lot of duplication in the research going on. Each one of them has an area of expertise. We want to do a better job of predicting these storms. We want to do a better job of learning how we can mitigate the damage from those. One of the things that happened right after the May 11 tornado in Lubbock is that Texas Tech University began doing research on windstorms and the effects of different materials. and later on they founded the National Wind Institute. which is doing important research on simulating cyclones and different kinds of wind events and the impact that they have on materials and certain building techniques. Certainly that will be important to our country as we move forward. What does that do for the taxpayers? Well. obviously if we can learn more about predicting the outcomes. we can make our buildings stronger. but. more importantly. save lives. And one of the things I know from a lot of the research that has been going on right now. that designs are being incorporated in a lot of buildings. Recently I was at a new elementary school in my district. and one of the things that we learned is that they incorporated certain building techniques within the cafeteria of that new elementary. Basically. the cafeteria became a storm shelter for the students going to that elementary. Those are the kind of things that will be beneficial from this. I urge my colleagues to help me reauthorize H.R. 23.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 23. This legislation would reauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. or NWIRP. The Federal Government has an important role in helping Americans prepare for and recover from natural hazards. H.R. 23 directs four Federal agenciesNIST. NSF. NOAA. and FEMAto conduct coordinated research and development on the nature of windstorms. their effects. and on ways to mitigate their impact. The legislation also ensures that this research is translated into practice through improved building codes and emergency planning. I was born and raised in south Florida. and I am a survivor of Hurricane Andrew. so I have seen my share of severe weather. I know firsthand that natural hazards are a leading threat to American lives and Americas economy. While we cannot stop a hurricane or tornado from happening. this Congress can act to make sure our communities have the tools they need to respond and recover from these disasters. We must begin by investing in preparedness and resilience. Studies of FEMAs predisaster mitigation program have shown that for every dollar we invest in mitigation activities we save $3 to $4 in recovery costs. I was pleased that this bill was considered in the Science Committee last Congress. and we worked in a bipartisan manner to make several improvements to the bill. I want to thank my colleagues. Chairman SMITH and Mr. NEUGEBAUER. for working across the aisle in a smooth and productive process. We worked together to increase the authorization for FEMA. the NWIRP agency tasked with taking the research conducted at other agencies and developing mitigation techniques and public outreach. Mr. NEUGEBAUER was the lead. and I appreciate his inclusion. Additionally. we added several social sciencerelated provisions to the bill. We cannot design effective disaster strategies without knowing how people make decisions and respond to disaster warnings. Often in a compromise. like this one. you do not get everything you would like. I would have liked to see increases in the authorization levels across the board. Unfortunately. this bill includes a lower total authorization level than what was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008. When the last few years have been devastating years for windstorms. including Superstorm Sandy and the tornado outbreak last May. it is difficult to understand why we would cut the total authorization level for this important program. I do hope that if this bill moves forward. we will continue our bipartisan efforts and work with the Senate to perfect this bill. Nevertheless. I understand the need to reauthorize this important program that can help minimize the number of Americans who are harmed or killed by windstorm disasters and reduce the costs associated * * * I support H.R. 23 and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the bill.",

The last few years have been devastating years for natural disasters across the country. There were massive tornadoes across the Midwest that resulted in loss of life and significant economic damages. In addition. Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 caused widespread destruction and death along the Eastern seaboard. H.R. 23 directs NIST. NSF. NOAA. and FEMA to support activities to improve the understanding of windstorms and their impacts. We can use that knowledge to reduce the vulnerability of our communities to natural disasters. The NWIRP program helps our federal agencies and communities across the nation develop and implement many measures that help minimize the loss of life and property during windstorms and to rebuild effectively and safely after such storms.

It reauthorizes important work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and refocuses the program on tsunami detection. forecasts. and research. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Oregon and the gentleman from California for their bipartisan work on this bill. A virtually identical bill passed the House by a voice vote this past September in the previous Congress. I now join the ranking member of the Science Committee. Ms. JOHNSON. in cosponsoring the bill before us today. Despite the recent absence of tsunami disasters here in the U.S.. the threat is still very real. The massive destruction from the tsunami caused by the 2011 earthquake in Japan is a vivid reminder of the need for enhanced early warning capabilities. We face a similar threat here at home. Tsunamis have the ability to injure Americans. damage property. and harm the economy. This bill updates the Tsunami Forecasting and Warning Program operated by NOAA. It will enhance the accuracy of forecasts. modernize and improve the standards and guidelines for mapping and modeling tsunamis. and support enhanced research efforts related to tsunami science. H.R. 34 also requires the NOAA Administrator to coordinate with State and local emergency managers to improve tsunami education and awareness in our coastal communities. This will help develop effective response and resilience in the face of tsunamis and other coastal hazards. This bill prioritizes fundamental scientific research on these phenomena. strengthens outreach programs. and advances technological forecasts to better understand and predict disasters.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 34. the Tsunami Warning. Education. and Research Act of 2015. I want to thank Mr. ROHRABACHER for working with me to advance this bipartisan legislation. I also thank the chairman and ranking member of the Science Committee. Mr. SMITH and Ms. JOHNSON. for their support in making this bill an early priority in the 114th Congress. I would also like to thank the State and local emergency management officials. coastal zone managers. and the many scientists and other experts who lent their expertise and experience to the development of this bill. Coastal community groups and emergency planners in my district are working hard to prepare their communities for earthquake and tsunami events. and I am grateful that they took some time to provide their input on this legislation. Last month marked the 10th anniversary of the SumatraAndaman earthquake in Southeast Asia. That earthquake triggered a tsunami event that claimed the lives of more than 200.000 people from Indonesia to Madagascar. Following that tragic event. Congress enacted the Tsunami Warning and Education Act to begin preparing our communities for the considerable threat posed by such an event. We were again reminded of the severe dangers that a tsunami represents for our coastal communities almost 4 years ago when the Tohoku earthquake near Japan created a devastating tsunami that resulted in the tragic loss of human lives and billions of dollars in economic damage. damage that reached as far as the west coast of the United States. The events in Indonesia and Japan underscore the importance of this legislation. which reauthorizes and extends U.S. efforts to prepare and protect our coastal communities from similar events. Our ability to prepare. respond to. and recover from a tsunami depends in large part on the hard work done at the local level. The Tsunami Warning. Education. and Research Act will support local efforts. and it is an important step toward making sure our constituents are ready to face the dangers posed by tsunami threats. Maritime commerce. vibrant tourism. and more than 120 million Americans are all part of the rich coastal U.S. economy. an economy that contributes significantly to the U.S. GDP. The commercial fishing industry alone supports about 1 million jobs. and the international trade associated with coastal and marine fisheries contributes close to $70 billion annually to the U.S. economy. Ensuring that coastal communities. big and small. have the resources and knowledge necessary to protect these critical assets from the threat of tsunami and be prepared should it occur is simply good and prudent policy. My coastal constituents are keenly aware of the threat that a tsunami poses to their communities. and cities up and down coasts have responded by installing warning sirens and developing evacuation routes. But as we learn more about which areas will be hardest hit and which technologies can provide the most accurate warning. a coordinated effort is required to update preparation and response. In Tillamook County. Oregon. for example. just outside my district. they recently decided they are going to be using social media and phones to warn residents. Seaside. a small coastal town in my district. has been identified as the most vulnerable community to tsunami on the Oregon coast. and local leaders and organizations there are proactively educating residents and visitors about tsunami evacuation routes. storage supply locations. and emergency communication systems. At the Federal level. we must do our part to help communities understand the risks and seriousness of the threats they face. and work with them to be prepared. which is why I sponsored this bill along with my colleague from California . In Oregon. we know that a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami will occur some day in the Cascadia subduction zone. The question is not a matter of if. but when. Although no one can predict when the Cascadia fault will rupture. we can and we must prepare. This legislation will help to ensure that local and regional decisionmakers have the tools and information they need to develop mitigation and response plans to this ever present threat. and to communicate these plans to the public in an effective and efficient manner. For distant tsunami events. this bill will advance research efforts related to improving forecasting. detection. and notification. It adds port and harbor operations as entities to be safeguarded by tsunami forecasting capabilities. This bill will also support research needed to improve our understanding of local tsunami events. A local tsunamione that is generated just off the coasthas a travel time of less than 30 minutes. This is the kind of tsunami most likely to have widespread and devastating impacts on the U.S. coast and on the Caribbean. In the 10 years since tragedy struck in the Indian Ocean region. we have made significant strides in our understanding of how to prepare for. mitigate. and respond to a tsunami. I have no doubt that the progress we have made. in large part through NOAAs efforts under the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. has enhanced the safety of our community and has the potential to save lives. This good work must be continued. and our bipartisan bill will provide ongoing assistance to protect our coastal communities from the impact of a tsunami. With that. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentlewoman. I also congratulate the chair. the ranking member. and others who support this needed legislation. Mr. Speaker. this bill will bring new focus to NOAAs ongoing efforts on deploying early detection systems. research. and working with potentially affected communities. better educating the public and designating evacuation routes and putting other measures in place that can mitigate damage or loss of life in the case of a tsunami. The Cascadia Subduction fault is not as well known to most Americans as the San Andreas in California. but the Cascadia Subduction fault. which starts just south of my district off of northern California has the potential for an even more devastating earthquake and much more probability of a devastating tsunami than anything caused by the San Andreas and other major faults. This bill is good in the focus it brings. The gentleman who spoke before me from California said it does it in a fiscally responsible way. Well. I would only disagree with that in that it is not fiscally responsible to underfund these efforts at NOAA. We should be moving forward with all dispatch to use existing technology which is on the shelf and being deployed by Japan. Southeast Asia. off of South America. and being used on land in Mexico and places like Romania for early detection systems. We are researching and thinking about what we want to do. There are offtheshelf technologies that will work for remote sensing. What will that mean? If you have remote sensors off the southern Oregon coast close to this fault. that means in the case of a major earthquakewhich could be Category 9you would have a warning further and further up the coast. a longer warning. For people immediately adjacent or in the midOregon coast. it could definitely save lives and give people more time to get to high ground by using known evacuation routes. The further you move north. say to the city of Portland. a major quake will have a major impact. but the shock waves would take 8 to 10 minutes or more to travel there. You could get people off the bridges. You could shut down the light rail system. People with critical manufacturing undertakings could shut down their lines. so they would have less economic loss. In my district. schools could be evacuated. We have many schools that dont meet earthquake standards that will collapse. Given 3 to 5 minutes that we could have in Eugene. you could save the lives of hundreds and hundreds of kids. But we are the United States of America. We cant afford it. Under the budget priorities of the Republican Party. we cant afford to deploy an early warning system off the United States of America. Now. Mexico can afford it. Chile can afford it. Malaysia and Indonesia can afford it. Japan can afford it. Romania and Mexico can afford it. We cant. Well. it is time to stop dragging our feet. This bill brings the focus to NOAA. but it also brings focus on the fact that we arent giving them the money they need. It brings focus to NOAA that will hopefully urge them to move more quickly and not mess around trying to develop new technologies or thinking about it. like some of our Federal agencies do. Use known. offtheshelf technologies that work and is being deployed elsewhere in the world. and it is up to Congress to give them a budget adequate to do this. I hope we act soon. This bill today is the first step.",

I would also like to thank Mr. ROHRABACHER for joining her in this bipartisan effort. and Mr. SMITH. the Chairman of the Science Committee. for starting the 114th Congress with a good bipartisan bill. Over 120 million Americans call the United States coastline their home. These coastal communitiesfrom major cities to small townsplay a vital role in sustaining the American economy. In fact. approximately onethird of the U.S. gross domestic product has its origins in coastal areas. That is why the bill we are considering today is so important. It would allow the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to continue to protect Americans and our coastal economies from the threat of tsunamis. This legislation is a perfect example of a familiar saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Our tsunami warning program has increased in effectiveness over the last decade. but we must remain vigilant in our preparedness and continue to invest in the research and development. and education and outreach. necessary to improve the resiliency of our coastal communities to these destructive waves. We were reminded in 2004 in Sumatra. and again in 2011 in Japan. of the devastation that can be caused by a tsunami. Billions and billions of dollars in economic damages and countless lives are at risk if we do not maintain. and improve. our tsunami detection and forecasting capabilities. Todays legislation advances NOAAs research efforts to do just that and may ultimately add minutes of critical response time to tsunami warnings. The bill also recognizes that the results of NOAAs research must be translated into outreach and education activities at the state and local level. The effective and timely communication of threats is critical in mitigating the impacts of a natural disaster. In addition. increased warning times are only effective if people know how to respond. I am pleased that this legislation emphasizes and supports local community preparedness. Resiliency to natural disasters is an important part of strengthening the nations economic security. I want to ensure that our coastal communities have the resources and tools they need to minimize the loss of life and property caused by a tsunami. Reauthorizing NOAAs tsunami activities is a key step in helping our communities continue to make progress. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.",

This week. we begin on that path with consideration of several legislative measures designed to grow the economy and create jobs. including the Hire More Heroes Act. the Save American Workers Act. and approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. These are several of the many jobs bills that have received broad bipartisan support. yet for one reason or another. they have been denied consideration under the previous Senate majority. The American people deserve better. Mr. Speaker. and more gridlock is not the option.",

The Constitution. however. is under attack by the policies of the administration. The administration has unconstitutionally. illegally. and unwisely issued a decree that. in essence. grants amnesty to about 5 million people. The real issue is not an immigration issue because we need immigration reform. but it is a constitutional issue. The Constitution has been bruised by the improper act of the President. All Members who support the Constitution and constitutional government. rather than a government run by one person. should oppose the illegal action memo of the administration. Along with Representative BLACK of Tennessee. I have introduced the Separation of Powers Act. This bill will prohibit taxpayer funds to be used or appropriated for the recent illegal actions of the administrations granting amnesty. The President also has been sworn to support the Constitution. and it is Congress duty to make the laws. whether the administration likes it or not. The Constitution is not a mere suggestion.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since I was first elected to Congress in 2004. I have heard from thousands of constituents across North Carolinas Fifth District. In recent years. there has been an understandable note of frustration in their voices over the direction that our country is headed. These folks know all too well the struggle to find a job and pay the bills. They are angry that it takes an average 111 days just to make enough money to pay the government before starting to keep what they earn for the year. They have watched an oppressive government intrusion into health care make it far too difficult and expensive for many to do business. They are discouraged by an uncertain regulatory environment that is wreaking havoc on both employers and employees. They are outraged at the Presidents unprecedented attempt to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens when there are so many individuals who have waited years for the opportunity to come to this country the right way. Over the last 4 years. the U.S. House of Representatives has done everything in our power to put this Nation on a better path. We have passed numerous pieces of legislation to encourage job growth and strengthen Americas standing in the global economy. We have also passed bills that would decrease energy costs. allow workers to have more flexibility to spend time with their families. and increase transparency in how tax dollars are spent. However. we were stymied again and again by Democrats in the Senate. Despite the short time we have had. the obstacles we have faced and the enormity of our task. House Republicans have still managed a number of conservative victories. For example. this summer legislation I authored was signed into law to streamline the Federal workforce development system. including the elimination of 15 duplicative programs. Last month we passed legislation that has since been signed into law to allow families of a severely disabled child to save for their childs longterm disability expenses in the same way that many families currently save for college through popular 529 investment plans. encouraging personal responsibility instead of increasing dependency on the government. We all wish we could have done more. much more. however. we will have greater opportunities over the next 2 years with a Republicanled House and Senate. The 114th Congress offers new chances to pass legislation that will take the country down a road of economic recovery that results in lower unemployment. a fair Tax Code. and opportunity for all. We will work to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. protect against executive overreach. reform Federal spending. and keep America strong. My priorities for this year include continuing efforts to increase transparency and accountability in government. That is why H.R. 50. the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. which we call UMITA. is the first bill I introduced in the 114th Congress. This legislation would improve transparency and public disclosure of the true costin dollars and in jobsthat Federal dictates pose to the economy. I have offered this legislation in the past four Congresses. and it has successfully passed the House with bipartisan support on three separate occasions. only to be ignored by the Senate. My hope is that this year will be different. Congress will also face off against the White House this year over President Obamas attempts to shortcircuit the American immigration process. By extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security only through February 2015. the House and Senate are prepared to confront the Presidents unparalleled power grab without the threat of a looming governmentwide shutdown. and we will do everything we can to stop his destructive actions. Congress will be addressing the American peoples greatest priorities in the 114th Congress. and we will work hard to build a better future for American families. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this evening I stand with my colleagues to discuss an issue that is very important to this country. and that is our countrys relations with Cuba. It has been 50 yearsfive decadesof a failed policy. Our wrongheaded policy toward Cuba. born of cold war tensions. has failed. Our policies have been in dire need of updating ever since. This island nation. which lies just 90 miles from our shores. one of our closest neighbors. should be a partner in our hemisphere. not an estranged country or enemy. Along with many of my congressional colleagues. many of whom are gathered here tonight. we have been fighting to make that a reality for decades. I would now like to move toward and talk a little bit about some of the issues that many of us have been involved in. and then I will yield to my colleagues. In the past. addressing our failed policies toward Cuba really had strong and clear bipartisan support in Congress. Recent polling shows it has bipartisan support amongst the American people. According to a 2014 survey commissioned by the Atlantic Council. more than 60 percent of Americans support lifting the travel and economic restrictions on Cuba. and 56 percent of Americans support changing overall United States policy towards Cuba. That includes 63 percent of Floridians. 62 percent of Latinos. and 52 percent of Republicans. Thanks to recent. very bold actions from President Obama. we have finally made some headway in this fight. We have started down the long and hard road towards ending our failed policies and establishing policies that promote the freedoms of Americans and Cubans. encourage trade and job creation here in the United States. and support the open exchange of critical medical development and research to treat diseases that afflict many Americans. In December. the President announced that the United States will reestablish diplomatic ties. facilitate travel. improve commercial exchanges and telecommunications and a variety of other policies. This is a welcomed and longoverdue response to our calls and the calls of many advocates both in this body and outside. from Cuba. the United States. and around the world. Today we come to the floor first to thank President Obama for his leadership and to discuss the important changes he has brought about through his action. but at the same time. we are here to call on this Congress to act to end the outdated embargo while maintaining our Nations unwavering commitment to human rights and democracy. I personally began my efforts to end the embargo when I was a congressional staffer for my predecessor and mentor. Congressman Ron Dellums. in 1977. Since then. I have traveled to Cuba more than 20 times and have led several congressional delegations to that island. Quite frankly. each time I am there. I am struck by how much both of our nations would benefit from improved relations. Over the years. many Members have been proud of their young people who have received their medical education at the Latin American medical school. ELAM. which allows students from lowincome and disadvantaged backgrounds to study medicine in Cuba for free. returning to the United States to practice in underserved areas. When I was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 112th Congress. I was honored to lead a delegation to talk with Cuban officials. including President Raul Castro. to determine their willingness to engage in dialogue with no preconditions in an effort to move toward normalization of relations. Recently. we led a bipartisan delegation to examine a new treatment for diabetic foot ulcers that afflict millions of Americans every year. Tragically. this condition often ends in amputations and sometimes death for patients. This new treatment has been developed. It is highly effective. Hopefully Americans can benefit from this treatment if we end the embargo. So I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that this development and other areas of common interest to the American and Cuban people are pursued and developed. which I will review later in my closing statement. Now I yield to the gentlelady from Texas . who has visited Cuba and really understands the trade and business aspects and the jobcreation aspects of why we need to move forward to end this failed policy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady very much. I rise in support of President Obamas recent announcement that updates our diplomatic policy approach to Cuba. I am very pleased to see that our outdated approach to U.S.-Cuban relations will end and we will begin to normalize our relationship with Cuba. Not only does the Obama administrations announcement reestablish positive diplomatic ties with Cuba. it also helps to empower the Cuban people by updating travel restrictions. remittance policies. and quality of life. One of the most positive outcomes of the updated policy announcement is the lifting of many trade restrictions between the United States and Cuba. In my home State of Texas. the Texas Farm Bureau has long supported improved trade policies with Cuba because of the potential to export Texas farm products. This provision not only serves the U.S. economy positively. but it is also very meaningful to the Cuban policy. which has struggled tremendously in the past. While trade provisions and helping to improve the livelihood of Cuban people by allowing the Cuban economy to build are constructive measures. we must focus on additional viable resources Cuba could provide to the United States. For instance. with the opening of diplomatic ties. I sincerely hope that our State medical boards in the United States will consider the educational value that Cuban medical schools provide to future health professionals who wish to practice medicine in the United States. I have had students from my district attend medical school in Cuba. I am aware that Cuba has offered nurses and physicians around the world in needy countries where needed. The aforementioned examples are only a few of the many ways that opening our diplomatic relations with Cuba will be positive for our country. and I urge my colleagues to support the Obama administrations decision to update our relationship with our neighbor and future ally.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady from California for her longstanding leadership. her commitment to human rights and change in a positive way for the relationship between the United States of America and Cuba. I also would be remiss if I didnt recognize some of my other colleagues who have been in this. have encouraged a change in policy for many. many years. if not decades: Congressman FARR. Congresswoman DELAURO. Congressman MCGOVERN. Congressman VAN HOLLEN. Congressman POLIS. Congressman MEEKS. and many others who have taken it upon themselves to visit the island of Cuba. like the average American is not allowed to do. and learn about the real situation on the ground there. I also commend the Obama administration and the President for his bold move in finally moving this outdated. anachronistic policy towards Cuba into a positive direction. Because just think about this: since the embargo has been in place and our policy of isolation has been in place. we had a war with Vietnam. but we have come to reconcile with the Vietnamese. and now the Vietnamese people have seen great economic reforms because America was engaged. Even after World War II. when we had a world war against Germany. you have to turn the page and move on in human history. and we were able to do that with one of our closest allies now with Germany. So why not Cuba? In the Tampa Bay area I represent a lot of CubanAmerican families. In fact. the bulk of my constituent work often involves family unification. It is not uncommon every week to have a situation where there is a dying grandmother in the United States and her grandchildren in Cuba would like to come and visit. And yet over the past years. they have been subjected to the worst kind of bureaucratic red tape that has not allowed them to travel freely to America. and the same for American citizens. Did you know that Americans are not allowed to travel freely to Cuba? Many people dont know that Cuba is really one of the only nations in the entire world where our constitutional rights to travel are restricted. And we think now with the Obama administrations move we will begin to open the door to greater travel. in recognition of our own human rights and constitutional rights. But I think it is really for our families to be able to unify them. It is only a 1hour flight from Tampa to Havana. It is less than that. and it is a beautiful flight. And yet it has been off limits for so long. So thank you to the Obama administration for beginning to take the steps to open this up. I want folks to know Cuba is changing. Just like the Congresswoman who has traveled there multiple times. I traveled on a factfinding mission not too long ago. There are meaningful economic reforms under way. America needs to be there to encourage it. to move it along faster and farther. People now in Cuba can own some private property. There are new small businesses and entrepreneurs that have the ability to step away from government control and take control of their own lives. There is decentralization of power. But unless America is engaged. we are not going to be able to continue those economic reforms and press for improvements in human rights. This is also an important time for America to capitalize on the changes in the world economy. Remember for a long time it was the Soviet Union that supported Cuba. or it was Venezuela. Well. now with the energy revolution in America. there has never been a better time for America to use its influence in the world. its economic power. its pressing for human rights. as Venezuela doesnt carry the day anymore. Their economy is in turmoil. The same for Russia. The economic conditions now play to our advantage. and we need to use it to improve human rights on the island. to improve family unification. and begin to establish those all important diplomatic ties. In my hometown of Tampa. they have led the way. My Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce has traveled a number of times. They would like to reestablish trade ties. There have been enormous numbers of cultural exchanges. The Florida Orchestra had a multiyear exchange with the Orchestra of Cuba. Ybor City businessmen have instituted art celebrations with the Cuban people right in the heart of Tampa. The University of Tampas baseball team went and played the Cuban national team. Yes. and the University of Tampa did prevail. much to the chagrin of the Cubans. But these are the ways that you build a relationship. a greater foundation for economic reform and human rights reform. In fact. it is the Saint Lawrence Catholic Church in Tampa that is going to fund the first Catholic parish on the island of Cuba in the coming years. If we cannot stand as leaders in the Western Hemisphere for religious freedom. for human rights. for economic engagement and improvement. who will? It is our time. I thank the leaders in this Congress that have pressed for this change. I commend President Obama for taking this bold move. and I encourage all Members of Congress to travel there and listen to the people. listen to their cries for positive change. We have it within our power to lift the embargo and begin to press on these issues. and I hope that we will.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as you notice. Members who are on the floor today have come from a variety of States. a variety of political philosophies and positions. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge Congresswoman BARBARA LEE for galvanizing Members on both sides of the aisle on an important and enormous leap of change that we have made over the years by her determination and persistence and knowledge. So I thank her very much for that kind of leadership. allowing many of us to travel to Cuba on any number of occasions. meeting with Fidel Castro. speaking about issues of government and the needs of the Cuban people and the needs of the American people. To my colleagues. everyone who has visited. they have found the Cuban people hospitable and friendly. desiring peace. and respecting America. If there is ever one impression that you have when you leave Cuba. it is the desire for strong relationships and the connectedness between Cubans. CubanAmericans. and Americans. As a Representative from Texas. I can assure you that over the years I have heard often from members of my agricultural community about their desire to begin engaging with trade in Cuba. And they do so as proud Americans. as Americans who have sent young men and now young women to faraway shores in military uniform to defend this Nation. What they see in Cuba. as has been indicated. is a friend with which we had disagreements. but a friend with which we now can find a pathway forward. As was mentioned. we had engaged in a war in Vietnam. we have engaged in a war in Iraq and Afghanistan. soldiers coming home now with few soldiers left behind. And. Mr. Speaker. we are engaging in diplomatic relations with Iraq. Afghanistan. and certainly Vietnam. How in the world can an island 90 miles away be held in such contempt that we cannot find a pathway forward. So I strongly support the executive order of this President. and I will tell you why in just a few minutes of the time that I have remaining. I serve on the Homeland Security Committee. and previously on Judiciary. on which I continue. My colleague is correct. At the time of the young boy by the name of Elian Gonzalez. who was found near the shores of our great Nation. his mother deceased trying to escape. of course. from Cuba with a number of others. there was this custody fight. if you will. about whether or not his relatives here or his father should have custody over him. his father being in Cuba. What a sensitive question for a very young boy who could not make a decision on his own. What a traumatic experience in those difficult waters watching his mother not survive. So as a member of that committee. working with my fellow colleagues and working then with the Clinton administration and then Attorney General Janet Reno. though it was not. if I might say. a clear and pretty scene. we knew that in the best interest of the child the parent was the best custodian or guardian. whether or not that child was. in fact. having to go to Cuba. But as I said earlier. the Cuban people are peaceful people. Every country has had a revolutionary path. and Cuba has as well. But it was a right decision for Elian. who is now a young man. and to all accounts is performing his duties as a responsible adult. But that was a very tough incident in our political life. if you will. to see a child snatched by officials of this government to take him home to Cuba. Maybe that was. in fact. the first statement of an altered policy. Let me close by saying why I believe the Presidents executive order is legitimate in the context of his legal authority. and I am excited about the beginning of the change in diplomatic relationships between Cuba and the United States. Mr. Speaker. would you not want to know who is 90 miles away from you in this time of franchise terrorism? Wouldnt we want to know who our allies are in the Caribbean. or who our allies are in fighting horrific drug trafficking? Well. I think we can find that in the entity of the Cuban government. We know that we have not seen a terrorist incident in that particular country. That is why we need to normalize relations. I am grateful for Mr. Gross return. who was brought out by many Members of Congress. including my colleagues here. including Congresswoman LEE. and as well some of the other political prisoners who have been released. including some in recent days. And then lastly let me say. let us celebrate the Cuban people for the magnificent export that they have: medicine. medical research. and physicians. Everyone knows that in the Ebola fight. the largest contingent. or one of the largest contingents of medical professionals. doctors fighting against Ebola on the continent of Africa. is and has been Cuban doctors alongside of the international workforce of medical professionals. Good Samaritans who sacrifice their lives to fight this deadly disease. But every single medical crisis in the world. you can count on Cuban doctors being there. as well as in conflicts and wars. such as over in the Mideast. Cuban doctors go to save lives. I want to thank the gentlewoman for this Special Order. I look forward to joining her in further codels to visit and to be part of the continued normalization. I say this not out of disrespect of the feelings of others who have experienced a crisis in their relationship with Cuba. but only to say that now may be the time for peaceful reconciliation. for families to be reconciled and for us to begin this peaceful journey with the nation of Cuba. Let me thank you. thank President Obama. and thank those who are very much a part of this.",

I want to thank BARBARA LEE for her steadfastness. for her tenacity. for her consistency in trying to bring a change in a policy that has been faulty. for it has been the policy that we have been doing over and over and over again. we have had over and over again and getting the same results: zero. I want to thank BARBARA for her hard work on this. I look forward to continuing to work with her as the President has opened up the opportunity for diplomatic relations with Cuba again. but we know that we still have a lot of work to do. and I look forward to working side by side with her until we have the kind of relationship and we have the kind of movement in this Congress where we really end the embargo. so that we can come together and make sure that change has happened within our relationships. I want to thank President Obama for his bold move. for indeed the camera of history is rolling and has brought us to this historic point which will take the United States of America and Cuba in a new and more positive direction after over five decades of severed diplomatic relations. American policy towards Cuba since 1961 has left our Nation out of sync with our neighbors in the Americasfor that matter. out of sync with our friends and allies all over the world. Our outdated policy. highlighted by our trade embargo. which has lasted for over half a century. has not only been ineffective but has blocked investment and trade opportunities for U.S. businessmen and farmers. it has kept families apart. and has done virtually nothing to change Cubas policies. In fact. just 90 miles away. if we had these trade agreements. if we were able to trade and bring markets and food to the shores of Cuba. it would be the humanitarian thing to do because people are starving simply because they dont have that opportunity on the island of Cuba. Clearly. when you think about the world which is smaller nowand one of the things that we should have learned by now is that unilateral sanctions dont work. if anything. they have further isolated us from the global community. We have got to work collectively with others. not just doing something out on our own. It has not worked. It does not work. As mentioned. denying American citizens the freedom to travel to Cuba to visit its many historic and cultural attractions. to meet its people. has been a stain on our democracy. I think the gentlelady from Florida talked about where we. as Members of Congress. have opportunities to go when we have travel. I can recall traveling. for example. not only to Havana. but Santiago de Cuba. and feeling the rich heritage and culture and looking at the people in Santiago who were poor. but I saw something when I looked in their faces: they were poor. but they were not hopeless. They were not destitute. They welcomed us into their homes to see how they were living. They had music playing. and they had hope for a better tomorrow and a better relationship with the United States of America. In fact. they scratched their heads. did not understand why they didnt have this better relationship with the United States of America. so I say that so that they want us to come. Others are going. we should permit our citizens to do the same. Now. the question is what is happening here in America. Well. a December 17 through 21 ABC News and Washington Post poll of adults nationwide showed that 64 percent of Americans supported establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. with 31 percent opposed. 68 percent supported ending the trade embargo. while 74 percent supported ending restrictions on travel to Cuba. Americans support the Presidents actions to normalize relations with Cuba. The United States International Trade Commission has concluded that if U.S. restrictions on financing and travel to Cuba were lifted in 2008. U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba would have increased between $216 million and $478 million. and the U.S. share of Cubas agricultural imports would have increased from 38 percent to 49 and 64 percent. which also would prevent some of the hunger that is taking place in Cuba. U.S. wheat. rice. soy. and meat producers have said that their industries will benefit from normalized relations with Cuba. now that trade financing restrictions are to be alleviated. President Obamas plan to establish relations and facilitate trade and commerce is a major market opportunity. It is good for Cubans. but it is also good for Americans because when you do that. you are also creating jobs for Americans right here in the United States. so it is a winwin because we are all about creating jobs in the United States. We are all about that commerce. We are also all about making sure that trade facilitation helps us in America. but it also can help people who have a great need on that island called Cuba. President Obamas actions to open the relationship and reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba will bring us closer. as BARBARA LEE indicated. to our allies in the region who have pursued more open relationship with Cuba while we have not. I serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I sit on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. I have had the opportunity to have dialogue and conversations with heads of states from throughout the hemisphere. For example. one of our closest allies. Colombia. one of our strongest partners. they are negotiating with the FARC on the island of Cuba. and when I talk to many of their individuals. they said the one thing that they think could help the entire hemisphere is for the United States to change its relationship with Cuba. Now. Colombia is one of our strongest. one of our most reliable allies. but they. too. have engaged with Cuba and are asking and looking and saying that our engagement with Cuba will change and help the hemisphere. Panama has invited President Castro to the Summit of the Americas. and the rest of our hemisphere wants this change. and our antiquated policy has been holding us back and hampering our ability to cooperate with countries in the region on a wide range of issues. Let me begin to conclude by saying this: the Presidents historic announcement has been universally well received by the region. which is heralding it as a major step forward in regional integration. The Presidents of Brazil. Argentina. andas I saidColombia and Mexico have praised President Obamas announcement. The announcement has also been applauded by regional organizations. including the Union of South American Nations and the Organization of American States. I conclude by saying that I have visited Cuba many times. I have worked tirelessly throughout my years in Congress to foster an improved relationship between United States and Cuba. and I believe the Presidents actions are good for both our countries and our hemisphere. American businesses will benefit. U.S. citizens will be able to travel to Cuba on a more regular basis and send remittances to their relatives by reopening our Embassy in Havana. We will be a safer place. and finallyfinallythe world often looks to the United States to be a leader militarily. We should be proud that the world can also look at us as champions of diplomacy. Through our Presidents new Cuba policy. we have shown our neighbors in the Western Hemisphereand indeed the rest of the worldthat we are committed to building new partnerships and that we will not be beholden to antiquated policies and that we are optimistic about what is possible through dialogue and diplomacy. and I thank the chairman.",

I never knew a time when Americans could go to Cuba or legally import goods and products from Cuba. Growing up. I remember the end of the cold war. when the Soviet Union fell. The last real excuse for the treatment of Cuba was that they were allied with the Soviet Union during the cold war. Well. the Soviet Union fell. Soviet subsidies and support for Cuba ended. and I really began to wonder why we continued this failed cold war policy of an embargotravel embargo and trade embargo against Cuba. Presumably. it was designed to bring Fidel Castros regime down. Now. again. this policy predates my birth by 10 years. It actually means that he is the longestserving head of state in the entire world. Obviously. it didnt work. It didnt work. Are we going to keep doing the same thing? Maybe a different path would have worked. and that is what the President has now proposed. For more than 50 years. we have isolated our southern neighbor. restricting trade. travel. commerce. as well as the flow of ideas. discussion. cultural exchange. the very things that can lead to a change and more support for human rights within Cuba. It really defies logic to expect that the status quo that has led to Fidel Castro being the longest regime and head of state in the world will somehow lead to the end of the very regime that it has actually helped to preserve. Unfortunately. the sanctions have hurt everyday Cubans without mobilizing political change or expanding their freedoms. Our policy of isolation was counterproductive. and it only prolonged the suffering and lack of freedom of the Cuban people. Our present landscape is particularly promising for restoring the U.S.-Cuba relationship. Now. let me be clear. Just as there are many countries that we have normal relations with that we continue to make sure we are outspoken about any human rights violations. of course. if there are political dissidents or others that are improperly jailed in Cuba. you will hear Members of this body. including myself. speaking out. just as we do for the oppression of Tibetans in China. while we continue to support ongoing normalized relationships with China. just as we do in countries where we want stronger labor laws or stronger antichild labor laws. yet continue to have a basic trade and travel relationship. Cuba can do better. Frankly. Mr. Speaker. America can do better with regard to human rights. and we discussed that in different contexts about expanding civil liberties for all Americans. but. yes. Cuba should do better. Guess what? The way to help show and lead Cuba to the promised lands of human rights and democracy is by engaging the Cuban people and by engaging the regime and showing them the many benefits that dealing with their neighbor to the north can bring. Now. let us make sure we are not mistaken here. the Presidents actions dont end the embargo. That requires congressional action. as outlined in the HelmsBurton Act of 1996. What President Obama did is he exercised his legal right to establish diplomatic relations and expand travel. facilitate remittances. and promote commerce. Congress does need to act. The Presidents step alone is a great step in the right direction. but to fully normalize our relationship with Cuba. Congress will need to act. and I continue to sponsor legislation that will help that occur. Of course. we should continue to call for transparency with regard to Cubas human rights record. to speak out for political dissidents. just as we do in dozens and hundreds of countries that we have normal trade and diplomatic relations with. I was proud to sign a letter authored by our great leader. BARBARA LEE. on this issue. encouraging President Obama to use the 2015 summit as a platform for stimulating this type of productive. regional dialogue. Now. decades of adversity between the United States and Cuba cannot be wiped away with a stroke of the pen. It will take time. But together we can build bonds of trust between the Cuban people and ourselves. and we can overcome the decades of mistrust and propaganda on both sides to lead to the betterment of the relationship between the Cuban people and the American people and the greater prosperity to both peoples through trade and commerce. I strongly support continuing to move forward to engage with Cuba and will continue to support the Presidents actions and similar legislative action here.

I now yield to my friend from California. Congressman SAM FARR. who has really forged a path toward where we are today for many. many years with the administration as it relates to establishing diplomatic relations. someone who has visited Cuba. who has the respect of the Cuban people. but also the respect of our own administration. and someone who continues to plug away each and every day for normal relations with Cuba and ending the embargo.",

    "speech": "Thank you very much. my dear colleague from California and our distinguished Member of Congress. BARBARA LEE. And I cant think of any other Member who has made more trips and taken more people and influenced this change of policy in the United States Congress than BARBARA LEE. I have had the pleasure of traveling to Cuba on six different mission trips and each one of them has been very interesting. one with my constituents in Santa Cruz. California. who have a sister city relationship with an area called Guama. and it looks much like the California coastline. and a very interesting area of trying to help rural people with a better connection by learning about their rural delivery of medicine. which far exceeds the way we treat rural people in this country. and learning from them how we might be doing a better job. at the same time improving the facilities they have. and things like that. just a cultural exchange. I find that every time I am there. whether it is Havana or other parts of Cuba. that there is always kind of a curiosity of learning about another country. a very welleducated country. a sophisticated country. yet a very. very poor country. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Latin America. in Colombia. I lived in barrios without water and without lights. People in Cuba might have access to water and lights. but the living conditions that they live in are really restricted. and some of the conditions in Havana are the greatest poverty I have seen in the world. So this will change when you get people that are welleducated and get an economy growing. I think that the action of President Obama is absolutely awesome. It is real diplomatic leadership. It is the ability to change the United States isolated. backward. closethedoor policy to opening it up with all the other Presidents of this hemisphere. As we prepare to go to Panama in the spring. President Obama now will be joining every President of this hemisphere. 36 different countries in the Western Hemisphere. all of whom have diplomatic relationships. travel relationships. normal relationships with Cuba. except the United States of America. and he is going to be applauded for his leadership in joining the hemispheric unity. When you think about the opportunities of this hemisphere. we can get along in this hemisphere in three languages: Spanish. English. and Portuguese. a little bit of French. We are not at war with anybody. This is a magnificent hemisphere to unify. and to be isolated from that unification by having this archaic policy towards Cuba is just wrong. So. Mr. President. you are a hero. and I look forward to you being welcomed as a hero at the hemispheric summit this spring. I would also like to say. I am ranking member on the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations. and this is an opportunity for 11 million people living in Cuba and hungry. and really hungry. Cuba has to import almost everything. They have trade importations from the United States. so buying agriculture products isnt new. What is going to be new is the ability to trade in normal functions. in using the financial instruments that all trade negotiants have. It is very difficult to export to Cuba because of the requirements that we make in the United States. We are not allowed. as Americans. to use credit cards or to get credit. All the other countries can. So what happens is these other countries are taking away market share where we could be in there with our products. I am very proud. in agriculture. to see the leadership of our States. our agricultural States. the Governorsbipartisan. This is not Democratic. This is a bipartisan. sort of the American outreach. and we have formed a coalition of agricultural groups to work on. really. opening up the trade. I am very proud to say that the International DairyI am going to read off this list. The International Dairy Foods Association. National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. National Association of Wheat Growers. National Barley Growers. National Chicken Council. National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. National Milk Producers Federation. National Turkey Federation. North American Meat Institute. the U.S. Dairy Export Council. the U.S. Wheat Associates. the USA Rice Federation. et cetera. et cetera. are all interested in helping promote our relationship with Cuba. So congratulations. President Obama. You are a true leader in this hemisphere. Thank you. BARBARA LEE. for setting aside this time for us to discuss it. I want to personally thank BARBARA LEE for inviting Alan Gross to be here yesterday when we were sworn in. I was fortunate to be able to meet with Alan Gross when he was incarcerated in Cuba. I brought him salami from the Eastern Market here and he just loved that. So last night he gave me a bracelet that he made when he was incarcerated. It is so nice to see him back in the United States in the Halls of the United States Congress. America is changing. and this is a big step. Thank you.",

So thank you. Congressman FARR. I now yield to Congressman COHEN from Tennessee. who understands very clearly the importance of lifting the embargo not only for our foreign policy goals. but also in terms of his constituents and in terms of the benefits to American businesses and the efforts in our job creation and economic revitalization efforts.

    "speech": "You are very welcome. Representative LEE. and I thank you for bringing this Special Order. You have indeed. as people have said. been the leader on this issue for many years. and I appreciate that and so many other issues you have been a leader on. but this in particular. Also. Mr. RANGEL has been an important leader on this issue. as have Mr. MEEKS and others. I had written the President and talked to Valerie Jarrett about what I considered the three Cs that he could engage in with executive authority. one of which was Cuba. and I commend him for taking this leadership role. the second of which was commutations. which he has not done nearly enough to commute unjust sentences here in this country. and the third is cannabis. which should be rescheduled to a schedule III drug so we could do research on medical marijuana and Charlottes Web. that can help children with epilepsy who otherwise are either dying are not being treated. But I commend the President for his actions toward Cuba. This is a policy that many have mentioned has been a failed policy for over 50 years. We do have engagements and diplomatic relations with China. where the Maoists are getting more and more power. with Vietnam and with Russia. Why should we not have relations with Cuba? There was no reason. The only reason was Florida and electoral votes. So I commend the President for rising above politics and doing the right thing for human beings and for Americans. As Representative CASTOR said. so many Americans want to travel to Cuba. and for many years I thought it was absurd that I couldnt travel to Cuba. because I wanted to and I couldnt because my country was stopping me from doing it. People were going through Canada or going through Mexico and other countries and getting in and subverting the law. but that wasnt right. If you were going to follow the laws of your country. you couldnt go and you didnt go. It was wrong. I did the have the opportunity to visit Cuba as a Member. and I found the Cuban people very. very. very friendly. As I was walking around Havana. I thought: This is so strange. I am supposed to think that these people arent going to like me. that this is our enemy. They are on the terrorist list. I should be concerned. But I felt as safe as I was anyplace in the United States or anyplace in the world. and people were very friendly and very nice. It was no different than being anywhere else in the hemisphere. I really like the old cars. the old fifties cars that are all over Havana. and they are kind of part of the culture now. While I like them because I remember as a child those cars and my parents having them and seeing them and thinking fondly upon them. I also thought about AutoZone in my district and all the parts they could be selling in Havana to make those cars work more efficiently and maybe have less impact on the environment. I also thought about Federal Express and how many packages that might be shipped in and out of Cuba by Americas number one and the worlds number one carrier of products. I thought about the hotel industry that is located in my communitywe used to have Holiday Inn. we have still got Hiltonand the hotels that could be built there. Other countriesmostly. I think. Spain and Sweden and Canada and even Israelhad hotels and restaurants and businesses. but not America. So it made no sense. I remember Katrina and the great tragedy just south of Memphis in New Orleans and when Cuba offered medical aid. doctors and medical aid. and we turned it down. How foolish of us to turn down an offer of humanitarian aid. but we did. And they offered aid after 9111 as well. Now. my appreciation for Cuba goes back to my childhood. In 1955. I was befriended by a baseball player whose name was Minnie Minoso. His real name was Aurelio Saturnino Armas Minoso. the Cuban Comet. number 9 with the White Sox. with the Indians. a little bit later with the Cardinals and the Washington Senators. Minnie befriended me and gave me a baseball when I was just 5 years of age. It was in the segregated Memphis. Tennessee. so the player who gave me the baseball originally was a White player named Tom Poholsky. I guess I didnt have to say he was White when his name was Tom Poholsky. but he was. I went to thank him. I had crutches at the time. I had just gotten out of the hospital some months earlier from polio and had a White Sox Tshirt and capit was an exhibition gameand thanked him. He said: You dont need to thank me. You should thank number 9 over there. the darkest player on the field. And so Minoso came over and we thanked him. What it was is he was kind of inhibited from the segregation laws in the South of being the nicest guy on the baseball field and coming up and giving me a ball. He became my buddy. I have known Minnie Minoso ever since. He is my nom de plume on some email sites and some phone books and some other things where I need kind of an alias. and he has been my friend and we have visited back and forth. He was a Cuban player who was beloved in Chicago. and I think is the most beloved player in Chicago today. A lot of Cuban players have gone to play in Chicago. and they play great baseball. We could have a great baseball relationship with Cuba. a great tourism relationship. a great cultural relationship and medical care. In traveling to Latin America as a Congressman. I have been told the biggest impediment to our relations with Latin American countries is our treatment of Cuba. The President. by starting to formalize relations with Cuba. has helped America in Latin America. which is our number oneSouth America. Central Americaour number one trading partner. It makes a lot of sense economically as well as humanely. I look forward to the time when all Americans can visit Cuba. the great culture. and exchange good wishes. They are our friends. Thank you. Representative LEE. for having this session on this program which shows President Obamas leadership.",

So thank you again very much. I now yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut. Congresswoman DELAURO. who has visited Cuba several times. who really has been very focused on the business aspects. the agricultural benefits to our own country and to Cuba as they relate to ending the embargo. also on womens issues and so many issues that really require us to normalize relations with Cuba. She has been in this fight a long time and still continues each and every day to move us forward. I really thank you again for your leadership. for being here and for being with some of us when we have been in Cuba and really raising these issues to a level that really.

    "speech": "I want to thank the gentlewoman. first and foremost. for her leadership. This is not an issue for the faint of heart or for people who want to say. \"Oh. my gosh. If we dont see success immediately. then we will wash our hands and go off and do some other thing.\" This has required tenacity and courage and passion and deep concern. We are grateful to you for your leadership in this area. and it has been a pleasure for me to work with you. Mr. Speaker. like my colleagues. we are no fans of the Castro regime. This is not about the regime. It is about the Cuban people and what we can do to help our near neighbors realize their aspirations for freedom and prosperity. Judged against that worthy goal. our policy for the last 54 years has been a dismal failure. It has not helped ordinary Cubans one bit. In fact. the sanctions have harmed them and us by holding back Cubas democratic and economic development. Back in 2007. I had the opportunity to chair the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. At that time. I led a bipartisan group of Members on a trip to Cuba. On that trip. it was so interesting to me that one of the things that one or two of my colleaguesand. again. in a bipartisan waywanted to do was to go to the port and see the offloading of rice. The fact of the matter is that. instead of getting their rice from the United States. which Cuba could do. they are getting their rice from Malaysia. Imagine if we could make an economic difference for our rice farmers. for our agricultural community. and because of a policy that has been so shortsighted. we are putting our own economic interests aside. I had the honor of taking part in another delegation to the island last year. led by our colleague BARBARA LEE. What we saw on the visit was an immense and an untapped potential. It was at that time as well that I accompanied Congresswoman LEE to visit with Alan Gross and to understand his plight. He was arrested and put in prison for 15 years. having served 5 years. What destruction it was doing to him physically and mentally. and unnecessarily so. We were so excited yesterday. when we were sworn in as newly elected or just elected Members of Congress. that Alan Gross and his wife. Judy. were in the audience to see itback home. here. in the United States. with family. and enjoying all of the freedom that he deserves. Again. the immense benefits. the untapped potential. We also saw and metand my colleague BARBARA LEE will bear this outwith entrepreneurs. There are many young women who have opened stores. they have opened restaurants. they have opened other small businesses. We spoke with people who are finding innovative ways to improve their lives and the lives of their families. yet. because of a lack of a financial infrastructure or the ability of U.S. banks to participate in Cuba. they are held to a modicum of what they can do. There is palpable hunger for change in Cuba. We need to do our best to support it. Opening the economy will help to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of the Cuban people. We have engaged with the Soviet Union and Communist China. both of which pose potentially severe threats to our country. Cuba poses no such threat. I applaud the President for his historic first step to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. We must stop persevering in a senseless cold war policy. This Congress must act to end this embargo. I thank the gentlewoman for the time. Mr. Speaker. like my colleagues. I am no fan of the Castro regime. But this is not about the regime. It is about the Cuban people. and what we can do to help our near neighbors realize their aspirations for freedom and prosperity. Judged against that worthy goal. our policy of the last fiftyfour years has been a dismal failure. It has not helped ordinary Cubans one bit. In fact. the sanctions have harmed themand usby holding back Cubas democratic and economic development. Back in 2007. when I chaired the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee. I led a bipartisan group of members on a trip to Cuba. This year. I took part in another delegation to the island. What we saw on both visits was immense untapped potential. I met entrepreneurs who have opened stores. restaurants. and other small businesses. I spoke with people finding innovative ways to improve their lives and the lives of their families. There is a palpable hunger for change in Cuba. We should do our best to support it. Opening the economy will help unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of the Cuban people. We engaged with the Soviet Union and Communist China. both of which posed potentially severe threats to our country. Cuba poses no such threat. Stonewalling the Cuban government only backs up the regimes claim that the United States is the enemy. By contrast. engaging diplomatically gives us the openings we need to address important issues like democracy and human rights. as we have done with China and many other countries. So I applaud the President for his historic first step to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. This new direction will benefit both nations. The President has done a great deal. within the confines of his available powers. to reestablish diplomatic relations. increase commerce. and advance shared humanitarian interests. There is more he can do: for example. he should do away with a Bush Administration policy that drains Cuban talent by encouraging doctors to defect. But lifting the embargo itself will require Congress to act. I have been arguing for an end to sanctions for many years. The Cuban people have suffered needlessly for too long. We ought to free them to join the international community and participate in the global economy. For our own businesses. lifting the embargo would ensure access to new markets just 90 miles from our shores. I am in favor of reestablishing formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. But our best ambassadors would be the American people themselves. Every American should have the right to travel freely to Cuba. The resulting flood of contact would give Cubans access to Americas most valuable export: our nations ideals and values. That is the surest path to freedom for the Cuban people. We must stop persevering this senseless Cold War policy. Congress must act to end this embargo.",

    "speech": "Yesterday we inaugurated the 114th Senate of the Congress. We welcomed back many dedicated Members and swore in many new ones. I have high hopes for our new colleagues. They share the resolve of my conference to restore the Senate to a place of high purpose. and they are determined to make a positive difference in the lives of the people who sent them. The men and women we have just sworn in have inaugurated one significant change already. that is. the majority we seated yesterday. I look to this new beginning with optimism and a profound sense of purpose. and I look to my colleagues with gratitude for their trust. Next to serving the people of Kentucky. this is the highest of honors. I recognize the serious expectations of the American people and I know they are counting on usand I do mean all of usevery single Member of this body. We are in a moment of great anxiety as a nation. The people we represent have lost faith in their government. They no longer trust Washington to do the right thing. Many face the reality of losing health plans after being told otherwise. Many struggle with rising medical costs after Washington officials repeatedly said they would be lowered. Confidence in the American dream has plunged. Anxiety about the type of country we leave to the next generation is widespread. For many it has never seemed more difficult just to get by. When Americans look overseas they see a world filled with chaos: instability roiling the Middle East. terrorists pressing an aggressive agenda. and autocrats scoffing at a superpower that doesnt seem to have a real plan. At home they see a government that is either uninterested in or incapable of addressing their concerns. a government that seems to be working for itself instead of them. Whether it is Washingtons dysfunction or a bureaucracy that has grown so Byzantine and unaccountable. it tried to muzzle political opponents and ignore the needs of veterans. The American people have simply had enough. and this past November they had their say. The message they sent was clear. If voters hit the brakes 4 years ago. this time they have spun the wheel. They said they want the administration to change course and move to the middle. They said they want Congress to send legislation to the President that addresses their concerns. This November the American people didnt ask for a government that tries to do everything and fails. and they didnt demand a government that aims to do nothing and succeeds. They asked simply for a government that works. They want a government of the 21st century. one that functions with efficiency and accountability. competence and purpose. They want a Washington that is more interested in modernizing and streamlining government than adding more layers to it. and they want more jobs. more opportunity for the middle class. and more flexibility in a complex age with complex demands. That is why we plan to pursue commonsense jobs ideas. including those with bipartisan support: measures such as reforming a broken tax system to make it simpler and friendlier to job creation. opening more markets to Americanmade products so we can create more jobs at home. and moving forward with bipartisan infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline. Americans are challenging this Congress and this President to work for them. They are challenging lawmakers in Washington to work for jobs for Americans. not just jobs for themselves. It seems simple enough. But in the end. in the era of divided government control. we are going to have to work hard to meet expectations and we are going to have to work together. Step No. 1 is getting Congress functioning again. That means fixing the Senate. Last session the House sent over countless commonsense bipartisan bills. Too many of them died right here without so much as a hearing. and Senators from both parties with ideas for jobs and growth were routinely stopped. So it is time to change the business model. We need to return to regular order. We need to get committees working again. We need to recommit to a rational. functioning appropriations process. We need to open the legislative process in a way that allows more amendments from both sides. Sometimes it is going to mean actually working late. but restoring the Senate is the right and practical thing to do because we are only going to pass meaningful legislation if Members of both parties are given a stake in the outcome. That is the genius of regular order. That is the genius of the Senate. I am reminded of this every time I walk into my office. On the wall are portraits of John Sherman Cooper. a Republican. and Alben Barkley. a Democrat. Keeping watch from below is a bust of Henry Clay. Each of these Senatorseach of these Kentuckianscame from a different political party. Each viewed the world through a different ideological lens. but all of them believed in the Senate and all of them left behind important lessons for today: Clay. about putting country first and pursuing principled compromises. Cooper. about choosing when to make a stand and making it. and Barkley. about having the courage to think differently from a President of the same political party he had served dutifully for years. These lessons echo into the present and they help point the way toward a better functioning government. A Senate and a Congress that function again will help move us past an era of government by crisis. It doesnt mean everything will be perfect. it doesnt mean we will never come up against a deadline. and it doesnt mean we will always agree. but together we can commit to changing the way Washington operates. This can be done. It can be done. This Senate has seemed imperfect at moments. but it has been proven to be a place of high purpose at many other times. a place where our country has come together to confront great challenges and advance solutions that once seemed completely out of reach. That is the Senate I saw when I saw Senator Cooper whip votes for the Civil Rights Act many believed would never pass. that is the Senate I saw when President Reagan worked with Democratic leaders to pass major reforms to taxes and Social Security. and that is the Senate I saw when a Republican Congress worked with President Clinton to pass historic welfare reform. The promise of the Senate is real. Time and time again it has been an engine for bipartisan achievement to which both parties can assume either credit or blame. and that is how we should view it today. So. yes. the American people elected divided government. but that doesnt mean they dont want us to accomplish anything. If there is a will to do so. we can come together to achieve great things. If President Obama is interested in a historic achievement of his own. this can be his time as well. The President has already indicated a willingness to work with us on trade and infrastructure and comprehensive tax reform. These efforts are going to require a lot of work. Navigating the political pitfalls will not be easy. but passing these types of measures will represent a win for the American peoplewins we could all be proud of. The truth is we could work for bigger things too. We could work together to save and strengthen Medicare. to protect Social Security for future generations. to balance the budget and put our growing national debt on a path to elimination. But bipartisan reform can only be achieved if President Obama is interested in it. The President is the only one who can bring his party on board. He is the only one. obviously. who can sign something that Congress sends him. I assure you. threatening to veto a jobs and infrastructure bill within minutes of a new Congress taking the oath of officea bill with strong bipartisan supportis anything but productive. I appreciate that bipartisan compromise may not come easily for the Presidentnot his first inclination. The Presidents supporters are pressing for militancy. not compromise. They are demanding the comforts of purity over the duties of progress. From DC to Montpelier. they see the limits of an exhausted 20th century mindset asserting itself. even when nearly every lever of power has been in hand. Across the Atlantic. they see the Sun setting on the social democratic idea. They see the tragic legacies of welfare statesempty promises and fear of the future. It is understandable why the Presidents supporters might want to retreat to past comforts. but now is the time to accept reality. Now is the time to actually move forward. Americans know that democracy is not about what you can get away with. it is about what you can achieve together. Many in this body. on both sides of the aisle. understand that. I have talked to many colleagues on the other side of the aisle who understand this fully. We are calling on the President to ignore the voices of reaction and to join us. Whatever he decides. though. this Congress is going to function again. Lets pass legislation that focuses on jobs and the real concerns of the middle class. After so many years of sluggish growth. we are finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administrations long tenure in Washingtonthe expectation of a new Republican Congress. This is precisely the time to advance a positive. progrowth agenda. Some of the measures the new Congress will pass may seem significant. others may seem modest. That is OK. As we have seen in recent years. a bigger bill does not always mean a better bill. While we are always going to search for areas where we can agree. the President may not be enamored of every bill we pass. and that is OK too. It is not our job to protect the President from good ideas. A little creative tension between the Executive and the legislature can be pretty healthy in a democracy such as ours. Presidents and Congresses have disagreed before. They have confronted challenges that eclipse the ones we see today. What is important to remember is that the Senate has always enduredalways. We have a duty to restore it now so we can meet the mandate of the people who sent us here. Former majority leader Howard Baker once noted that making the Senate work is like \"trying to make 99 independent souls act in concert under rules that encourage polite anarchy.\" Yet he also reminded us that \"it doesnt take Clays and Websters and Calhouns to make the Senate work.\" It simply takes men and women of honor working in a spirit of good faith. It may be difficult. but it has been done before and it can be done again. and if we are going to get there. it helps to recall in whose footsteps we walk today. This is the same Chamber where Dirksen and Mansfield allied for historic progress. This is where Byrd drew from antiquity to rouse colleagues to present challenges and where in later years he would critique successors on the finer points of procedure. This is where Mitchell honed the skills he needed to help bring warring communities together. enemies who responded to critics not just with floor speeches or press conferences but actually live ammunition. This is where Dole shared war stories with Inouye. and with a fateful tap on the shoulder. he would partner with Moynihan in their effort to reform Social Security. The names of many Senators who came before us are etched into the desks we sit at today. The men and women who precede us include future Presidents and Vice Presidents. They include former athletes. veterans. and astronauts. We have forgotten some. we remember others. but their legacies live on. Here is how Senator Claude Pepper put it: The Senate is inefficient. unwieldy [and] inconsistent. it has foibles. its vanities. its members who are great . . . and those who think they are great. But like democracy ... it is strong . . . it has survived many changes. it has saved the country [from] many catastrophes. [and] it is a safeguard against any form of tyranny. In the last analysis. Pepper noted. the Senate \"is probably the price we in America have to pay for liberty.\" For everything Senator Pepper and I may not have agreed on. we certainly agreed on that. In the same way. each of us here may not agree on every issue. We may be Republican. we may be Democrat. but we are all Americans. We each have a responsibility to make the Senate function. and we each have a duty to work for the people who sent us here in serious times to get serious results. Lets restore the Senate we love. Lets look for areas of agreement when we can. Above all. lets make Washington work again for the people we serve. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. before I read a statement into the RECORD which was written by the minority leader. Senator REID. I have to say that the Senators who serve on the Democratic side of the aisle are committed to the traditions. precedents. and the rules of the Senate. We. of course. will work to preserve this great institution and protect our own individual rights and responsibilities in the Senate. I welcome what Senator MCCONNELL. our new majority leader. has envisioned as a more active floor in the Senate where we do not run into lengthy and repeated filibusters but bring amendments to the floor. debate them. vote on them. and ultimately pass legislation. That is the procedure of the Senate which historically had been honored but fell. sadly. into disrepair over the last several years. Although we hope our minority status in the Senate is shortlived. I think we will establish that the Democrats are a much better minority when it comes to the Senate than perhaps those on the other side of the aisle. but only time will tell.",

    "speech": "I have the opening remarks from the Democratic leader. HARRY REID. which I wish to read into the RECORD. Senator REID states: As some already know. I had a mishap in my home last week while exercising. As a result. I sustained several broken bones in my face and ribs. As bad as that sounds. I am doing well and recovering quickly. I regret I am not on the Senate floor to make these remarks in person. but my doctors have urged caution and ordered me to stay home while I recuperate. I thank my friend. the Assistant Democratic Leader. for delivering my remarks today. A Greek philosopher once wrote: \"There is nothing permanent except change.\" Our nations elections prove that theory every two years. This is one of those times of change for the Senate and for our country. The desks in this Chamber have been rearranged. committee assignments adjusted. and a new majority assumes control for the next two years. Or in other words. its just another Wednesday in January at the start of a new Congress. For all of the changes. our duties as United States Senators remain the same: We are here to help working Americans and ensure our government has all it needs to serve the people. In spite of almost no Republican cooperation over the last six years. weve made significant strides in many regards. The new Majority Leader claims the Senate hasnt achieved. in his words. \"squat\" in recent years. The numbers. however. tell a different story. Today the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 5.8 percent. Over the last six years the American economy has added 10 million jobs. The stock market has reached alltime highs. Our nations manufacturers are thriving. The American automobile industry was brought back from the brink of collapse in spite of Republican opposition. And lets not forget that there are more than 10 million Americans newly insured with health care coverage. While some here in Washington may see that as \"squat.\" the economic recovery has been very real to American families. I know how important it has been to working Nevadans. And while we worked to improve the economy without Republicans help. we also worked to fulfill our constitutional obligation to offer advice and consent on Presidential nominations. Just last Congress we confirmed 132 judgesthe most since the Carter Administration. Overall. we confirmed 611 of the Presidents nominees last Congress in spite of Republican opposition. As we speak. we have an Attorney General and a Secretary of Defense waiting to be confirmed. I remind everyone that last Congress the Republicans mounted an unprecedented filibuster for a nominee for Secretary of Defense [a former Republican Senator]. I challenge my friend. the Majority Leader. to change course and work with Senate Democrats in confirming the Presidents nominees in the 114th Congress. Working together. we can easily meet and surpass last Congresss benchmark of 611 confirmations. My Republican colleagues. and especially the Majority Leader. should also know that Senate Democrats are especially eager to continue to help American families. Working together. we can send meaningful. bipartisan legislation to the President for his signature. The mistakes of the past. the gratuitous obstruction and wanton filibustering will not be a hallmark of the Democratic minority in the 114th Congress. The filibuster is an indispensable tool of the minority. but Republicans abuse of it last Congress has come to epitomize the gridlock here in the United States Capitol. To be clear. I have no intention of just rolling over. I cant. Not when the middle class is teetering on the verge of extinction. Any attempt to erode protections for working American familiesthe dismantling of DoddFrank. the weakening of net neutrality rules. or the Republicans neverending quest to repeal the Affordable Care Act. known as ObamaCare will be met with swift and unified Democratic opposition. But wed rather legislate together. And theres plenty of common ground for bipartisan compromise if Republicans are willing. That is the end of the statement from Senator REID.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. throughout the history of the United States of America. we have had a remarkable alliance with the nation of France. It bears remembering and repeating that the French stood by our side when America was fighting for its independence from Great Britain. The French were honored in many ways for that alliance and help. including. as I recall. a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette which hangs in the U.S. House of Representatives to this day. That was not the only time by any means that the French have stood with us and we have stood by their side. It happened during World War I. World War II. and many times after that. Through the NATO alliance and in many other ways. we have worked with the people of France for common goals and common purpose. and that is why we were so saddened this morning to learn of the news that was reported by the Tribune: Masked gunmen shouting \"Allahu akbar!\" stormed the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper Wednesday. killing 12 people before escaping. It was Frances deadliest terror attack in at least two decades. With a manhunt on. French President Francois Hollande called the attack on the Charlie Hebdo weekly . . . \"a terrorist attack without a doubt.\" He said several other attacks have been thwarted in France \"in recent weeks.\" France raised its security alert to the highest level and reinforced protective measures at houses of worship. stores. media offices and transportation. Top government officials were holding an emergency meeting and Hollande planned a nationally televised address in the evening. Schools closed their doors. World leaders including President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack. but supporters of the militant Islamic State group celebrated the slayings as welldeserved revenge against France. This event in Paris recalls what we lived through not that long ago when the United Stateson September 11. 2001was attacked by terrorists and more than 3.000 innocent Americans lost their lives in New York. in Washington. and in the countryside of Pennsylvania. Many of us recall that at that momentthat sad. awful momentpeople around the world rallied to stand with the United States in our grief and in our determination for justice. We particularly remember that the people of France did that. and they spoke out in one voice saying they were going to be by our side in this battle against terrorism. I think it is appropriate today that we follow suit. that we join in that same spirit. \"A ce moment tragique. nous sommes tous Parisiens. nous sommes tous Francais.\" Let us all work together not only to bring justice to this horrible situationthis attack on free press in Francebut let us also work together to bring an end to terrorism in our time. We can work with our allies and friends in France to achieve that goal.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 40 years ago this week. a young prosecutor from Vermont was sworn into the Senate. He was part of a historic group of lawmakers often referred to as the \"Watergate babies.\" Today that man is President pro tempore emeritus as well as the most senior Member of the Senate. It is an honor to serve with him and to recognize Senator PATRICK LEAHY for reaching this historic milestone. PATRICK LEAHY remains the youngest Senatorand the only Democratic Senatorever sent to this body by the people of his home State of Vermont. But that is not what makes PATRICK LEAHY exceptional. What makes him exceptional is the fact that he is a consensus buildera thoughtful man committed to making government work better. It has been a privilege for me to work closely with Senator LEAHY serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a member of that committee since 1979 and for many years as chairman. Senator LEAHY made a profound mark on Americas system of justice. He has voted on the nominations of every sitting member of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has fought to preserve the balance between liberty and security during especially difficult times. Sen ator LEAHY has also fought to make Americas respect for human rights a cornerstone of our Nations foreign policy. He has been a leader in the global effort to ban antipersonnel landmines. He championed the \"Leahy Law\" to prevent U.S. tax dollars from benefiting human rights abusers abroad. He was a leader in recent efforts to free U.S. citizen Alan Gross from a Cuban jail and in the modernization of our Nations policy toward that island. One last point. PAT LEAHY is also. almost certainly. the biggest \"Dead Head\" in the Senate. Twenty years ago. he invited his good friend. Jerry Garciathe lead guitarist for the Grateful Deadto join him for lunch here in the Capitol. Two other members of the band came. too: drummer Mickey Hart and bass player Phil Lesh. As one might imagine. this unusual foursome created a bit of a stir in the Senate Dining Room. Then in walked Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Ever the bridgebuilder. Senator LEAHY walked over to Senator Thurmond and said: \"Please join us. Theres someone I want you to meet.\" It is a story worth pondering as we begin the 114th Congress. If we could all be so open to creating unlikely alliances. there is no telling what we might achieve in the next 2 years. Again. I thank my friend Senator LEAHY on his 40 years of service to the people of Vermont. America. and to the great causes that face our generation. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to address the state of the Senate and how to restore its greatness. Yesterday. I was sworn in as the President pro tempore. Although there have been some notable exceptions throughout history. the modern practice of the Senate has been to elect as the President pro tempore the most senior Member of the majority party. As one noted historian of the Senate has generously written. \"election of a senator to the office of president pro tempore has always been considered one of the highest honors offered to a senator by the Senate as a body.\" I am greatly honored to have been selected for this position. but I am keenly aware of the great responsibilities that come with it. The President pro tempore of the Senate is one of only three legislative offices established by the U.S. Constitution. and in recent decades it has been occupied by true giants of the Senate. Their names. which include Vandenberg. Russell. Byrd. Stevens. Inouye. and LEAHY. resonate as some of the greatest legislators ever to serve in this body. Beyond the President pro tempores formal responsibilities in presiding over the Senate and helping ensure the continuity of government. this office represents a unique opportunity to assist the majority leader in guiding the Senate as it addresses the critical issues facing our Nation. In that sense. the President pro tempore serves as an elder statesman. sharing accumulated knowledge and lessons learned through long experience. I consider it fortuitous that the beginning of my service as President pro tempore coincides with the start of a new year. For many. the new year is a time for reflecting upon the past and reviewing commitments for the future. I believe we as Senators should use this opportunity for some much needed introspection about the state of this institution. The Senate has long been heralded as the worlds greatest deliberative body. With so many critical challenges facing our Nation today. there has never been a more important time for the Senate to live up to its storied legacy and to fulfill its responsibilities to the American people. Central to properly understanding our responsibilities as Senators is to appreciate the Senates role in our system of government. This means understanding both the Senates purposes and its unique place at the center of our constitutional structure. It is important for us to consider these issues. James Madison famously called the Senate the great anchor of the government. He described its purpose as twofold: \"first to protect the people against their rulers. secondly to protect the people against the transient impressions on to which they themselves might be led.\" The Senate accomplishes the first goalprotecting the people against their rulersby playing a crucial role in the appointment and removal of both judges and executive branch officers. The Presidents power to appoint is tempered by the requirement that his appointees receive the Senates advice and consent. Additionally. the Senate possesses the power to remove from office any official that has engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors. The Presidents power to enter into treaties is also critically checked by the requirement that the Senate provide its advice and consent to a treaty before ratification. As such. the President does not have unfettered power to fill up executive offices. pack the courts or make agreements with foreign nations. He cannot staff agencies with corrupt. incompetent or ideologically extreme cronies unless the Senate allows him to do so. He cannot conclude treaties that will harm American interests unless the Senate gives its assent. In selecting lifetenured judges to apply the Constitution and laws of the land. the President cannot act unless the Senate confirms his nominee. In all of these settings. the Senate serves as a crucial check against executive abuse. The Senate accomplishes the second of Madisons goalsprotecting against temporary shifts in popular opinionthrough its character and its institutional structure. In contrast to the large. transient House. the Senate is small. more stable. and therefore. it has the opportunity to be more thoughtful. Four hundred thirtyfive Members inhabit the House. and only 100 fill this Chamber. The entire House stands for election every 2 years. Naturally. reelection is constantly on Representatives minds. Senators. by contrast. have 6year terms and only onethird go before the voters each election. Even with the pressures of modern campaigns. these divergent characteristics produce fundamentally different institutions. But the Framers designed the Senate to do much more than merely check transient and occasionally intemperate impulses. They created the Senate to refine the publics will and to give more wisdom and stability to the government. The Framers chose the Senates relatively small size to enable more thorough debate and to provide individual Members greater opportunity to improve legislative proposals. Longer. staggered terms would give Members greater flexibility to resist initially popular yet ultimately unwise legislation. They would also guard against temporary majorities. A fluke election may produce significant majorities for one party that 2 years later disappears. This can lead to wild swings in the law as each new majority seeks to enact a vastly different agenda during its brief period of power. Overlapping terms help to avert this danger. Finally. statewide constituencies require Senators to appeal to a broader set of interestsincluding the concerns of the State governments themselvesthan do narrow. more homogenous House districts. To these constitutional characteristics. the Senate has added a number of traditionssome formal and others informalthat have enhanced its deliberative character. These include the right to extended debate. an open amendment process. and a committee system that gives all Membersfrom the most seasoned chairmen to the newest freshmena hand in drafting and improving legislation. The late Senator Byrd liked to say that \"as long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the power of unlimited debate. the liberties of the people will remain secure.\" The Senate protects liberty by giving each Senator an active role in the legislative process. This multiplies the checks against bad laws and expands the universe of individuals working to make good laws better. It erects what Madison called a necessary fence against hasty and unwise government action. It enables each Senator to bring his or her own wisdom and considered judgment to bear on pressing national issues. When the Senate functions properly. it is a truly deliberative body in which all Senators work to identify the common good and the best means to achieve that common good. The Federalist describes the common good as the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. This is to be distinguished from the individual good. which may vary from person to person and which may not result in the Nations benefit. Much like the Senate is designed to protect against transient shifts in public opinion. it is also designed to enable Senators to pursue the common good. Senators are able to prioritize achieving the correct results over doing what is politically convenient. The best answers do not always immediately present themselves nor are they always easily explained. Longer terms give Senators more time to investigate. to analyze. to reconsider. and to recalibrate. and so do robust debate and an open amendment process. These are critical elements of our deliberative pursuit of the common good. Another crucial component of our pursuit of common good is prudence. Aristotle called prudence the legislative science because it concerns the best means of achieving the most good in practice. Prudence restrains us from seeking immediate and complete vindication of a single abstract principle. Instead. it counsels us to work within our existing circumstances to vindicate the enduring principles upon which our liberty depends. While we should remain true to our principles. we must also recognize that we operate in an imperfect world where we do not control all of the levers of power. We cannot simply charge forward blind to present realities. To do so is to jeopardize our hopes for achieving any meaningful success. because in the messy world of politics. adopting an allornothing strategy usually produces only the latternothing. Politics is the art of the possible. Ideology is important. and rhetoric is captivating. But at the end of the day. when the campaign is over. the American people sent us here to govern. We are here to protect their liberties and to protect and improve their lives. When we grandstand or hold out for impossible demands. we do nothing but a disservice. The Framers gave us staggered. extended terms so that we could use our independent judgment to get things done. We should try to get to it. An astute commentator observed that the Senate stands at the crossroads of our constitutional system. It shares power with the other branches of the Federal Government. It ensures temperance in the legislative branch. It must consent or not consent to the Presidents treaties and appointments. and it plays a critical role in appointments to the Supreme Court. But it alsoand this is unique among the branches of the Federal Governmentembodies the interests of federalism and State power at the national level. The Framers created the Senate to be much more than a simple legislative body. The Senate is uniquely positioned to mediate both among the Federal branches of government and between the Federal and State governments. As such. the Senate truly embodies the role described by one wise commentator as the sober guardian of the Republic. Our responsibilities as Senators follow directly from the Senates constitutional role. As the peoples representatives and as envoys of our individual States interests. we are accountable to our States and to our Nation. We do not serve any one party or principle. or any particular ideology or faction. We may align ourselves into certain groupsRepublican and Democrat. conservative and liberalfor purposes of organization and cooperation. but we are Senators first. Other labels are secondary. Civility and statesmanship must be our constant ideals. Madison once instructed that \"the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness. with more system. and with more wisdom. than the popular branch.\" A key purpose of this body is to calm the passions that arise from the heat of political discourse. As such. we must always be courteous in our communications one with another. both formal and informal. on the floor and off. facetoface or on a video screen. When we disagree we need to do so with dignity and respect. acknowledging the sincere motives and passions of even our most firm adversaries. Statesmanship connotes public spiritedness and a willingness to compromise in pursuit of broader goals. Petulance and unilateralism accomplish nothing in this body. Any Senator who would choose the glow of the camera over the prospect for meaningful achievement seriously misunderstands their role as a Senator. Next on the list of practices Senators must follow are prudence and considered judgment. I have already spoken about prudence. It is a habit of mind that focuses on present realities and achievable goalsnot pieinthesky pipedreams. Prudent lawmakers make experiencenot theorytheir guide. and they recognize that success in a republic requires harmonizing competing values. Considered judgment is closely tied to prudence. Prudence is not rash. It requires deliberation and thoughtful analysis. Our constituents sent us here because they trusted our judgment and favored the general outlines we presented in our campaigns. Now that we are here. it is time to put our plans into action. We do this by studying problems. investigating proposals. and carefully choosing solutions that best cohere with our principles. Exercising judgment is an individual matter. Colleagues and opinion leaders may guide our deliberations. but the ultimate choice of policy is one which we each must make on our own. The final two obligations I wish to highlight are our responsibilities: first. to seek the common good through earnest deliberation. and second. to achieve consensus to the extent possible. As I explained. the Framers designed the Senate so that Members would be able to seek the common good encumbered by few political constraints. Because we stand for election only every 6 years. we are less susceptible to swings in public opinion. We have the independence to value longterm impact over shortterm politics. And because we are a small bodyrelatively speakingall Members are able to participate fully in the legislative process and to add their voice of praise. warning or suggestion to each proposal that we consider. We deliberate not to score points or to craft sound bites but because we believe that in the contest of opposing views. the best answers will win out. I mentioned consensus. Although much of our daytoday operations are conducted by unanimous consent. obviously we do not do everything around here by consensus. We are 100 fiercely independent legislators. Even at the end of a lengthy debate with numerous opportunities for amendment. we may remain sharply divided about a bills wisdom or the objective it seeks to achieve. But that does not mean consensus should not be our goal. We should take counsel from past legislative victories which show that broad victories produce lasting reform. whereas narrow partisan power plays tend to yield only rancor and repeated attempts to repeal. For 38 years I have had the extraordinary privilege of serving in the Senate. During that time. I have witnessed it at its best and. more recently. at its worst. My experience throughout the last four decades has confirmed to me the wisdom of the first Adlai Stevenson. then Vice President. who in his 1897 farewell address captured the essence of the Senate: In this Chamber alone are preserved without restraint two essentials of wise legislations and good government: the right of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result from hasty legislation. rarely from the delay which follows full discussion and deliberation. In recent years these foundations of the Senates unique charactermeaningful debate and an open amendment processhave come under sustained assault by those who have prioritized scoring political points over preserving the Senates essential role in our system of selfgovernment. Rather than simply bemoan this recent institutional damage. we have a duty to use this new Congress to restore the Senate. By returning to regular order and committee work. promoting robust debate. and enabling a deliberative amendment process. we can make the Senate work againboth Democrats and Republicans. First. robust debate. Senators ability to engage in meaningful. substantive debate is at the core of the Senates identity. Through robust discussions and inclusive deliberation. Senators examine all sides of an issue. We air opposing views and ensure that in haste we do not make worse the problems we are trying to solve. When individual Senators have the right to debate a matter fully. it engenders confidence that the final legislation produced represents the best possible bill upon which the Senate can agree. Many pieces of legislation that seemed imperfect passed this way and have gone on to benefit the Nation greatly. For over 200 years. the Senate has provided each Member broad prerogative to debate and discuss the critical issues of the day. In the early years of the Republic. visitors flocked to the Senate gallery to hear Senators such as Daniel Webster. Henry Clay. and John C. Calhoun. just to mention three. to hear them expound upon matters of national concern. It was in this body that some of our Nations most important debates over taxation. slavery. expansion. and foreign affairs took place. For many years. freeflowing debate was so intertwined with the identity of the Senate that no effective cloture mechanism to cut off debate even existed until well into the 20th century. While the need to end debate in certain circumstances is clear. we have strayed too far from this important deliberative tradition. In particular. the practice of filing for cloture at the very same time a bill is brought up for consideration has proliferated to a disturbing degree. When a full and robust debate has occurred. invoking cloture is often appropriate. But we must not abuse this power by reflexively seeking to cut off debate before it even begins. Let us return to a system where all Senators have a say in what the Senate does and are able to express their views without getting cut off. The second Senate hallmark we must restore is an open amendment process. The reason for an open amendment process is to improve legislation. No single Member can foresee all contingencies that may arise or identify all of the potential pitfalls. There is a reason there are 100 Senators. not just 1. More eyes mean more mistakes caught and more opportunities for improvement. An open amendment process also facilities consensus. One amendment may resolve a particular Senators concern. allowing him to support what he or she once opposed. Another may make a bill politically palatable to Senators who support the bill in principle but not in its current form. Amendments may also achieve buyin as Senators who successfully amend a bill find themselves more committed to final passage. When Senators retain the ability to amend legislation. such input can establish a wide and lasting base of support that crosses partisan and ideological lines. Indeed. an open and honest amendment process has frequently enabled diverse coalitions to find important areas of agreement. I even found that the former Senator from Massachusetts. the late Ted Kennedy. the famed liberal lion of the Senate. a man I came to Washington to battle. could be a productive partner. In the process. he became one of my closest friends. even if we widely disagreed on a lot of things. I miss him personally. We were able to do things that would not have been done had it not been for the work we did together. Unfortunately. over the past several years. the Senates traditionally open amendment process has come under increasing attack. For the sake of shielding electorally vulnerable Senators from tough votes. we have emasculated one of this institutions critical characteristics. It is time to stop manipulating Senate rules to prevent amendments. It is time to stop blocking amendments for fear of tough votes. It is time to return to healthier ways of doing things. where we work together to improve legislation rather than doing all we can to keep Members out of the process. The third hallmark we must restore is a vigorous and productive committee system. Although perhaps not as moribund as our amendment process. the role our committees play in drafting and refining bills has indeed suffered in recent years. For centuries Senate committees have served as the primary forum for critical deliberation and amendments in this body. Bills introduced in the Senate are referred to the relevant committees where Members have the opportunity to consider. debate. and amend the bill at length. Committees are the workhorses of the Senate or at least should be. On the floor we can do only one thing at a time. But any number of committees and subcommittees may operate simultaneously. allowing Senators to work out language and make compromises on multiple bills at the same time. Committees also perform a crucial investigative function. They hold hearings. call witnesses. and solicit expert opinions on a wide variety of issues. enabling Members to expand their understanding and to better finetune individual bills. Lately. however. we have witnessed a disturbing trend of bypassing the committee process altogether by bringing bills directly to the floor for votes. This practice undermines committee work and frustrates Members who diligently seek to move their legislative priorities through the committee. It also deprives bills of the benefits of committee review. which include more search and consideration of language. opportunities for comment by outside experts. and the ability to address support for amendments without tying up precious floor time. A healthy committee process is essential to a wellfunctioning Senate. This body is not a fiefdom. We do not convene merely to give our assent to immutable messaging bills. We are supposed to work together to write. amend. and pass important legislation. When Senators bring up for consideration bills they have written without input from other Members. manipulate Senate procedure to prevent floor amendment on those bills. and then simultaneously file cloture to cut off debate. they act as autocrats rather than agents of democracy. Lets return this body to one that operates by consensus. not dictate. Lets return the committee process to its proper place in our legislative landscape. as the first line of review rather than an utter irrelevancy. Lets restore the Senate to its proper role in our constitutional system by restoring the traditions that have made this body so great: robust debate. an open amendment process. an active. meaningful committee process. Equipped with these tools. the Senate historically never shied away from taking on what everyone agreed were the toughest issues of the day. Yes. we had to take tough votes. Yes. we could not rush legislation through as fast as we sometimes would have liked. Yes. we sometimes felt deep disappointment when proposals we championed fell short. But while the Senates rules can be frustrating and politically cumbersome. they are what allowed the Senate to serve the country so well for so very long. Restoring the Senate in this manner will not be easy. After years of bitter partisan tension. we cannot expect a complete change to come overnight. But by reestablishing our historic aims and reinstituting our designing modes of operation. including robust debate. an open amendment process. and regular order through committee work. the Senate can once more be about the peoples business and observe the title of the worlds greatest deliberative body.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. one of my friends in this body is the distinguished minority leader. HARRY REID. HARRY and I have been friends for a long time. He has served here for a long time. He served well in many respects. He certainly was a tough majority leader. He is a tough guy. Recently he suffered some very severe injuries. He is mending. These injuries seem to be injuries he can handle. although very strong. tough injuries. I wish him the best. that he may be able to recuperate well. come back again to this deliberative body. and play the role he needs to play for the minority in this illustrious body. HARRY and I believe many things together. especially in the religious area. He is a fine man. His wife Landra is a very fine woman. I am glad to see that her health has improved. She is a terrific person. Both of them are terrific people in their own right. I pray that the Lord will heal HARRY and make it easier for him to come back as soon as he can. Being a tough guy. he will be back here pretty soon. I wish him the best. It is no secret that Elaine and I have been praying for him. Hopefully. those prayers will be efficacious. I have great respect for my colleagues on the other side as well as my own colleagues on this side. These are good people. There are very few Senatorsnot more than 2in my 38 years in the Senate that I thought might not have much redeeming value. Everybody else has played significant roles in this body. sometimes that I hotly contested and differed with. but nevertheless very good people over all these years. HARRY REID is one of the nicest people one will ever meet off the Senate floor. He is all right on the Senate floor too. All I can say is that I wish him well. I am praying for his recovery. I want him to succeed in every way. He is from our neighboring State. Nevada is very important to us. We like both Senators from Nevada. Senator HELLER is one of the finest Senators here. They work well in Nevadas interests together. I hope everything goes well with Senator REID and his wife Landra and his lovely family. They are good family people. I wanted to make those comments on the floor because of the high esteem in which I hold HARRY. Yes. we disagree on a lot of issues. sometimes pretty strongly we disagree. but great Senators can do that. They can get over it quickly too. I hope the remarks I made earlier in the day on this deliberative body will be taken up by everybody in the Senate to realize this is the greatest deliberative body in the world. We need to make sure it remains such. That means tough votes. It means tough amendments. It means long days here sometimes. but it also means an ability to have a rapport with my friends. not only on this side but the other side as well and for them to have a rapport not only with their side but with our side. Lets hope we can build something and lets hope we can bring our two sides together and work in the best interests of the country and get some things done that are sorely in need and do things that both Democrats and Republicans can say: We did it together. Yes. there were tough times. Yes. we differed from time to time. But we did it together. and we did it in the best interest of the country. I hope both leaders will be able to work together in this manner and that all of us will do our work in the best interest of this country. I do not think we necessarily have to forget politics. but we ought to sublimate them sometimes to the point where they do not interfere with getting very important work done. I wish HARRY REID the best. As I said. he is in my prayers.",

I have spoken on the floor at times when he has been in other leadership roles. He is a solid Member of this Senate whom we rally around in so many ways. The comments he just made about the leader of our friends on the other side and the importance of family to Senator REIDthat is also important to Senator HATCH. People are important to Senator HATCH. I believe he is going to be a tremendous President pro tempore of the Senate. chairman of the Finance Committee. and a critical leader at a critical time. The comments he made on the floor today about Senators being willing to take tough votes. to take positions on issues. to let the American people know where we standthat is not only where the Senate ought to be but in so many ways it is where Senator HATCH has always been as a Member of the Senate and now as the highest elected official in the Senate. the President pro tempore of the Senate.

    "speech": "I thank my friend for his leadership and his comments. The Presiding Officer and I are looking at legislation we looked at last year where the Senate would simply have to stand up on rules and regulations that have an impact on the economy and say \"Yes. we are going to improve those\" or \"No. we are not going to do those.\" That would be a role for the Senate where the regulators for the first time have an obstacle and an opportunity to come to the people who have to go to the voters and say: What do you think about this rule? What do you think about this regulation? I look forward to seeing the REINS Act again that would put some more controls over regulators. which both the Presiding Officer and I have worked on. Today I will talk for a few moments about the work we will hopefully get to quickly. The first numbered bill in this new Senate is the bill to authorize the Keystone Pipeline. In the 6 years that Canada has been waiting to try to sell us a product that we need. I have spoken about thisas many of us havemany times. It is hard to actually think about what I might say today that hasnt been said before in that 6year period of trying to do what I believe and what most Americans believe is the logical thing for us to do. Our best trading partner. Canadamore North American energy is one of the critical keys to our economic future. As I over and over again think of the list of opportunities in front of us. that has to be near the top. What happens when we have more American energy? What happens when we are more selfsufficient with our two closest neighbors for the energy we use. the energy we need? What happens when we are less dependent on economies that we dont do as much business with or places that arent as friendly to us as our neighbors to the north and our neighbors to the south? More American energy has an impact on utility bills. it has an impact on transportation. and it has an impact on whether we are going to make more things. An economy that grows things and makes things is stronger than an economy where we just trade services with each other. We should be looking for those things which create that competitive incentive for us to get back into manufacturing. In the last session of Congress. we were able to pass a bill I cosponsored with Senator BROWN from Ohio on advanced manufacturing. and I think it is going to have an impact on doing things in different ways. but I dont suggest that it would have a greater impact than a utility bill that somebody thinking about building a factory understood that they had a great likelihood of being able to pay for a long time and in a competitive way or a delivery system that works. Those are the kinds of things that will create more American jobs. The Keystone Pipeline clearly creates some jobs in and of itself. I think 20.000 jobs or so is the estimate just to build the pipeline and another 20.000 for all of the support of material and things that go into that pipeline. I think the Presidents own State Department has a number of 42.000 jobs that would be created if we go to this shovelready project. We had a lot of discussion in the country when the President became President about the importance of finding shovelready projects. This is a project where people have had the shovels in hand for a long time. They have a product we need. We are their best trading partner. It is logical that they would want to sell it to us. It is equally logical that we should want to buy it from them. The State Department says over and over againand this is the State Department where the Secretary of State was put in place by the President. who yesterday said he would veto this billthe State Department says over and over again that there is no environmental impact we should be concerned about. For people who say: Well. the Canadians should be concerned about the impact of taking that oil out of the ground. that is really going to happen. The oil sands are going to be heated up. The oil is coming out of the ground. It is going to be sold to somebody. The question is. Do we take advantage of that logical opportunity or do we give that opportunity to somebody else? When we get into this debate next week. somebody will say: Well. maybe there are 40.000 jobs to build the pipeline. but there are only three or four dozen jobs to run the pipeline. Well. of courseit is a pipeline. It is not complicated to do. but it is the logical and easiest way to move fuel that we need. oil that we need. oil that would become part of our commerce and other commerce. But anybody who thinks that those are the only jobs that would be created when we grasp the idea of more American energy just isnt thinking about what this means to our economy. There are many jobs to be created. That is why this has become such an important issue and such an important votenot just for the pipeline itself but for the message it sends to the American workforce. the message it sends to people who are thinking about making things in America. and the message it sends about our future economy. This is one of many things that are just waiting for us to take advantage of them so that we can grow our economy in new and positive ways. Among the things that will be said that I will disagree with on this in the next few days: Well. this is only 35 permanent jobs. Anybody who believes that embracing more American energy is only 35 American jobs is either kidding themselves or just trying to kid the American people. We need to take advantage of this opportunity. There is no government funding involved. It is just government approval. This is a $7 billion project. 42.000 jobs. The government just has to say yes. Six years and several months ago agoI think about 2 months ago now we passed the 6year anniversary of the Canadians having the application and asking us to let them do this. Why do they even have to do that? Because they cross an international border. We build pipelines in the country all the time with very little Federal involvement. This is revenue for the States. communities. and counties this pipeline goes through. There is a revenue stream there. You pay for the permanent ability to have that infrastructure available to you. It is a $7 billion project. revenue for State and local government. but most importantly. it is a sign from the people of the United States of America through their government that we are going to take advantage of this great opportunity of more American energy that is in front of us. Since he came to the Senate the same day I did 4 years ago. Senator HOEVEN has been a leading advocate as a North Dakotan. He understands what energy can do for the economy. He also understands the importance of being able to transport that energy product around in the right way. It frees train cars for manufactured goods. agriculture. and other things. It does so in the best way. Senator MANCHIN. joining with Senator HOEVEN as the principal sponsors of the bill. is a leader on these energy issues. He understands energy issues. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill. I believe there are 60 of us who have cosponsored the billclearly enough to send the bill to the Presidents desk. It would be nice if the President would look at the opportunity and decide to sign this bill. This is an important part of the future of the country. It is time for the Senate. the Congress. and the Government of the United States to wrap its arms around what this means to the people of the United States. It means good jobs. It means a different future than if we dont have it. One other topic I wish to mention while on the floor isspeaking of good jobsjobs for veterans. A bill I filed in the last Congress in the Senate has passed the House again last night. the Hire More Heroes Act. I hope we can get to it quickly. Last year it passed in the House 406 to 1. but the Senate wouldnt take up the bill that passed the House 406 to 1. How do we hire more heroes under this act? We give people who already have veterans health benefitsTRICARE or other VA benefitsa little bit of an exception as an employee. Employers dont have to count them toward the 50 employees that trigger a law that many employers are trying to avoid being affected by. the socalled Affordable Care Act. We have a chance to go to those who served us and say: Look. we are going to create one additional opportunity. We are not going to count the fact that you already have health care against you. we are actually going to let it work in favor of your opportunity to get a job and to move forward with that job. Whether it is more American energy or hiring our heroes for jobs they need to havethe veteran unemployment numbers are unacceptable. Veterans who have served since 9111 at one time last year had an unemployment rate right at the 9 percent number. Any number is unacceptable. We need to take those veterans skills and put them to work. I hope we do that by quickly following our colleagues on the other side of the buildingwho now have passed this bill twiceand getting this bill on the Presidents desk as well. Hiring our heroes. creating jobs. looking at more American energyI am hopeful these are the kinds of things this Congress will quickly send a message to the President and the countrythese are the kinds of things we want to see happen for more opportunity for young Americans and for all Americans. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I share the view of my colleague from Missouri about the importance of the Keystone Pipeline. We will have an opportunity over the next several days to talk more extensively about that and the importance it has to our economy and to energy security. Obviously it is something that we think is about jobs and the economy. which is why there is so much support for it in the Senate among Republicans in the Senate. and I would argueI think there will be a lot of Democrats as well. Yesterday Republicans assumed the majority in the Senate thanks to the overwhelming support of the American people. and we are ready to roll up our sleeves and go to work. This week President Obama is going to be traveling around the country attempting to take credit for the recent shred of economic good news we have finally seen after 6 years of economic stagnation under the Presidents policies. Unfortunately. all of the campaignstyle tours in the world cannot disguise the fact that our economy is nowhere near where it should be. More than 5 years after the recession supposedly ended. Americans are still feeling the pinch. Wages are stagnant. Household income has declined by almost $3.000 on the Presidents watch. The price of everything from health care to education has risen. And the Presidents policies have done nothing to help. In fact. the Presidents policies have actually made things worse. Whether it is the taxes in the Presidents health care law or the energy tax proposed by the Presidents outofcontrol EPA. the Presidents policies have done nothing to help the economy. But there is reason for Americans to be hopeful. Poll after poll has demonstrated that the American people are concerned about jobs and the economy. and in the new Congress Republicans are going to make jobs and the economy our priorities. We are committed to passing legislation that would help create jobs. grow the economy. and expand opportunities for struggling middleclass families. and we plan to get started right away. This week the senior Senator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. reintroduced legislation to approve the jobcreating Keystone XL Pipeline. According to the Presidents own State Department. this commonsense project would support more than 42.000 jobs. It would also substantially increase revenue to State and local governments. providing increased funding for local priorities such as schools. roads. and bridges. I can speak firsthand to that because it would cross my home county. Jones County. in South Dakota. I can say the people in my home county see the opportunity to generate revenues that would help support the local school district in an area of the State which is losing population and having a harder and harder time keeping the school open. The pipeline has bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. and I am hopeful that the President will drop his inexplicable opposition and finally sign off on this jobcreating project. Republicans also plan to take up the other jobcreating measures that spent far too long languishing in the Democraticled Senate. The Obamacare tax on lifesaving devices. such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. has already had a negative impact on jobs and the medical device industry. At a time when our economy is still suffering from years of stagnation. repealing this tax is a nobrainer. I am confident we will have bipartisan support for this repeal. and I hopeI hopethe President will sign it. Republicans also plan to repeal the Obamacare provision that changed the definition of fulltime work from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week. This provision is forcing businesses to reduce employees hours and wages and hire parttime rather than fulltime workers in order to comply with the Obamacare requirements. Millions of Americans who want fulltime work are currently stuck in parttime jobs because they cant find anything else. The last thing the government should be doing is making it more difficult for employers to offer fulltime positions. Another Obamacare position that is making it difficult for employers to hire is the employer mandate. Later today I will introduce a bill called the HIRE Act. which would make it easier for employers to hire new workers by exempting Americans who have been unemployed for more than 27 weeks from counting as employees for whom a tax penalty must be paid by the employer under Obamacares employer mandate. In addition to passing jobcreating legislation. the new Republican majority is committed to increasing congressional oversight. Executive branch agencies have been out of control under the Obama administration. The Presidents EPA alone has proposed billions of dollars worth of regulations that will have a catastrophic effect on our economy and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs. if not hundreds of thousands of jobs. Just one of these regulationsthe backdoor national energy tax on coalfired powerplantswould cause Americans energy prices to soar and destroy families livelihoods. In my State of South Dakota. household energy prices could increase by as much as 90 percent. South Dakotans with incomes below $50.000 a year already spend onefifthonefifthof their aftertax income on residential and transportation energy costs. which is twice the national average. I might add. They cant afford a 90percent increase in their costs. What is more. this national energy tax will have almost no effect on our air quality. It would devastate communities and drive up energy bills in this country for nothing. The EPA is far from the only Federal agency to have abused its power under the Obama administration. Take the Obama IRS. for example. which targeted organizations for extra scrutiny based on their members political beliefs. It is past time for Congress to assert its oversight authority and check the executive branchs overreach. While Republicans want to work with Democrats as much as possible. we will not hesitate to draw a bright line between Democratic and Republican priorities. Republicans want to address some of the biggest challenges facing our economy. to put our Nation on the path to longterm prosperity. That means doing things such as reforming our Tax Code. which is inefficient and bloated. making it simpler and fairer for families and businesses in this country. It also means reforming our regulatory system to eliminate inefficient and ineffective regulations that are discouraging job growth. The Democraticled Senate was pretty dysfunctional. The minority party was largely shut out of the legislative process. Bills were frequently written behind closed doors. The committee process was largely defunct. Too often the Senate floor was a forum for partisan politicking rather than serious debate. What was the result? The voices of too many Americans got shut out of the process and the Senate accomplished next to nothing for the American people. Republicans intend to change all of that. Under Republican control. the Senate will return to regular order. That means bills will once again be debated and amended in the open. in committee. before coming to the Senate floor. Once bills come to the floor. all Senators. regardless of party. will have the opportunity to offer amendments and to fully debate legislation before it comes to a vote. The American people deserve a Senate that works and Republicans intend to give it to them. The American people have spent a long time struggling in the Obama economy. but they are about to get some relief. Republicans are determined to pass solutions that will help create jobs. grow our economy. and expand opportunities for American families. We hopewe hopethe Democrats in the Senate and the President will join us. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. as we begin this new session. I think it is important for us to remember why we are here and what our job is as Senators. What our job is. it seems to me. is to try to understand the needs of the American people. the problems facing our constituents. and propose real solutions to those problems. So before we get involved in all of the debates I know we are going to have. let me put on the floor what I believein hearing from the people of the State of Vermontare some of the most important issues facing our country and the need for the Senate. the Congress. and the President to address those issues. First and foremost. to my mind. is the state of American democracy. We are a democracy. and men and women have fought and died to preserve American democracy. which means the people of Americanot kings. not queens. not an aristocracy but the people of this countryregardless of where they come from or their economic status. have the right to participate in the political process. to elect their leaders and create the future they want for themselves and their kids. What is the status of American democracy today? We just came out of a midterm election where Republicans did very well. But I think it is important to understand that in that electionthat national election63 percent of the American people didnt vote. Eighty percent of young people didnt vote. The overwhelming majority of lowincome and working people didnt vote. There are a million reasons an individual doesnt vote. but my guess is that for many people they look at the political process and they say: Yes. my family is hurting. I am working longer hours for lower wages. My job went to China. My kid cant afford to go to college. I cant afford health insurance. What are those people in Washington doing to protect my interest? Not muchnot the Republicans. not the Democrats. I am hurting. What are they doing? People say: Hey. I dont want to participate in this process. It doesnt mean anything. I am not going to vote. I think another aspect about why people dont vote is they turn on their TVs and they are bombarded with 30second ugly television adsoften ads that come not even from the candidate but from people who do \"independent expenditures.\" As a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United. billionaires. corporations are now allowed to spend unlimited sums of money in a political process. If somebody is a billionaire. they can now spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to destroy other candidates or to elect the candidates they want. Is that truly what American democracy is supposed to be about? Do we believe that men and women fought and died for us so billionaires can elect candidates to protect the wealthy and the powerful? I would say at the very top of the agenda for this Congress should be a movement to overturn. through a constitutional amendment. this disastrous Supreme Court ruling on Citizens United. In my view. we should move toward public funding of elections so all of our people. regardless of their economic status. can participate in the political process and run for office. I think the next issue we have to take a very hard look at is the 40year decline of the American middle class. I know some of my Republican friends talk about what has happened under the Obama administration. and they are right in saying we are nowhere where we should be economically. No one debates that. But let us not forget where we were 6 years ago when George W. Bush left office. Everybody remembers where we were: 700.000 people a montha monthwere losing their jobs. People say: Hey. we are growing 200.000 or 300.000 jobs a month now. not good enough. Right. it is not good enough. but growing 200.000 or 300.000 jobs a month is a heck of a lot better than losing 700.000 jobs a month. Our financial systemthe U.S. and the worldswas on the verge of financial collapse. That is where we were when Bush left office. Now Wall Street is doing very well. In terms of our deficit. when Bush left office we had a $1.4 trillion deficit. Now that deficit is somewhere around $500 billion. Are we where we want to be? No. Are we better off than we were 6 years ago? Absolutely. But when we look at the middle class today. we understand the problems are not just the last 6 years or the last 12 years. The problems are what has been going on over the last 40 years. The fact is. we have millions of working people who are earning. in real inflationaccounted dollars. substantially less than they were 40 years ago. How does it happen. when we are seeing an explosion in technology. when worker productivity has gone up. that the median male workerthat male worker right in the middle of the economyearns $783 less last year than he made 41 years ago? Look at why people are angry. That is why they are angry. In inflationaccountedfor dollars. the median male worker is making $783 less last year than he made 41 years ago. The median woman worker made $1.300 less last year than she made in 2007. Since 1999. the median middleclass family has seen its income go down by almost $5.000 after adjusting for inflation. So people all over this country look to Washington and they say: What is going on? You gave us this great global economy. You have all these great unfettered freetrade agreements. We have all this technology. Yes. I know the billionaires are getting richer. millionaires are getting richer. with 95 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent. We have one family. the Walton family. now owning more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Yes. the billionaires are doing great. but what is happening to me? What is happening to the middle class? The answer is. for a variety of reasons. in the last 40 years the middle class has shrunk significantly. Today we have more people living in poverty than at almost any other time in American history. and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth. So what do we do? What do we do to rebuild the middle class? What do we do to create the millions of decentpaying jobs we need? Let me throw out a few suggestions that I hope in this session of Congress we will address. For a start. everybody in America understands our infrastructure is collapsingno great secret. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers. nearly onequarter of the Nations 600.000 bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. and more than 30 percent have exceeded their design life. What that means is that all over this country bridges are being shut down because they are dangerous and they need repair. almost one third of Americas roads are in poor or mediocre condition. and 42 percent of major urban highways are congested. As we speak. in cities all over America people are backed up in traffic jams. burning fuel and wasting time because we dont have proper infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers says we must invest $1.7 trillion by 20205 yearsjust to get our Nations roads. bridges. and transit to a state of good repairmore than four times the current rate of spending. So what happens when we invest in infrastructure? I will introduce legislation to invest $1 trillion in rebuilding our roads. bridges. water systems. wastewater plants. aquifers. older schools. and rail. When we do that. $1 trillion in infrastructure investment not only makes our country more productive and efficient. but it also creates a substantial number of decentpaying jobs. A $1 trillion investment would maintain and create 13 million decentpaying jobs. The fastest way to create goodpaying jobs is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. In my view. that should be a very. very high priority for this Congress. The second issue I think we need to addressand I understand there are differences of opinion on this issue. I think when our kids and our grandchildren look back on this period and they look at an issue such as the Keystone Pipeline. they will be saying: What were you people thinking about? How could you go forward in terms of increasing the exploration and production of some of the dirtiest oil on this planet when virtually all of the scientists were telling us that we have to substantially reduce carbon emissions and not increase carbon emissions? In my view. an important mission of this Congress is to listen to the science and the scientific community. They are telling us loudly and clearly that climate change is real. climate change is caused by human activity. climate change is already causing devastating problems in America and around the world in terms of drought. in terms of flooding. in terms of extreme weather disturbances. and we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency. into weatherization. into wind. into solar. into geothermal. and into other sustainable energies. When we do that. we not only lead the world in reversing climate change. but we also create a significant number of jobs. In this last election. interestingly enough in some of the most conservative States in America. voters voted to raise the minimum wage because they understand that a minimum wage of $7.25 an hourhere in Washington. DC. the Federal minimum wageis literally a starvation wage. No family. no individual can live on $7.25 an hour. I applaud all those fast food workers all over this countrypeople who work at McDonalds and Burger Kingfor having the courage to go out on the streets and say: We have to raise the minimum wage. I applaud their courage in doing that. and I applaud the many States around this country. including the State of Vermont. who have raised the minimum wage. In my view. if someone works 40 hours a week. they should not be living in poverty. I hope that one of the major priorities in this Congress is to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Over a period of years. I would raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour. It is also unacceptable that in America today women who do the same work as men earn 78 cents on the dollar compared to male workers. I think we have to address this discrimination. and we need to move forward with pay equity for women workers. When we talk about the decline of the American middle class and the fact that millions of workers are working longer hours for lower wages. when we talk about the fact that in the last 14 or so years this country has lost 60.000 factories and millions of goodpaying manufacturing jobswhen we put that issue on the table. we begin the discussion which is long. long overdue about our trade policies. That is what we have to talk about. The truth of the matter is that from Republican leadership in the White House to Democratic leadership in the White House. there has been support for a number of trade policies which. when looking at the cold facts. have failed. NAFTA has failed. CAFTA has failed. Permanent Normal Trade Relations with ChinaPNTRhas failed. Over the last 30 years. Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have continued to push unfettered free trade agreements which say to American workers: Guess what. You are now going to be competing against somebody in China who makes $1.50 an hour. If you dont like it. we are going to move our plant to China. And many companies have done exactly that. Do we think that is fair? Do we think that is right? I dont. We are going to be coming up with the TransPacific Partnership trade agreement. TPP. Without going into great detail at this point. I have very. very serious problems with that agreement. In terms of the process. no Member of this Congress has been able to walk into the office where these documentshighly complicated legal documentsare held. bring staff in there. and copy the information. We are not allowed to do that. but we are supposed to vote on a fasttrack agreement to give the President the authority to negotiate that agreement. It doesnt make a lot of sense to me. So I hope we use the TPP as an opportunity to rethink our trade agreements. Trade is a good thing. but American workers should not suffer from unfettered free trade. Trade should be used to benefit the middle class and working families of this country and not just the multinational corporations. We live in a highly competitive global economy. Everybody understands that. I think we also understand that our young people are not going to do well and our economy does not do well unless our people have the education they need to effectively compete in this global economy. It saddens me to note that a number of years ago the United States of America led the world in terms of the percentage of people who had college degrees. We were number one. Today we are number 12. The reason is that the cost of college has soared at the same time that the income of many middleclass and workingclass people has declined. We are in a position now where hundreds of thousands of young people thinking about their future look at the cost of college. look at the debt they will incur when they leave college. and they are saying: I dont want to go to college. I am not going to go to college. I am not going to get posthigh school education. That is a very bad thing for this country. It is a bad thing for our economy. We should put high up on the agenda the issue of how in America all of our people. regardless of the income of their families. can get the education they need without going deeply in debt. This issue of college indebtedness is a horror. I remember a few months ago talking to a young woman in Burlington. VT. who left medical school $300.000 in debt. Her crime was that she wanted to become a doctor and work with lowincome people. She shouldnt be punished with a debt of $300.000. Other people are graduating college $50.000 in debt. And graduate schoolwe have attorneys in my office who have a debt of over $100.000. We can do better than that as a nation. Those are some of the issues. There are others out there. But I think what is most important is that we try to listen to where the American people are todayto the pain of a declining middleclass. to single moms desperately struggling to raise their kids with dignity. to older people trying to retire with a shred of dignity. On that issue. let me be very clear. If there is an attempt going to be made here in the Senate to cut Social Security or to cut Medicare. there will be at least one Senator fighting vigorously on that. Poverty among seniors is going up. Millions of seniors in this country are trying to make it on $12.000. $13.000. $14.000 a year. The last thing we should be talking about is cutting Social Security. In fact. we should be talking about expanding Social Security. There are a lot of issues out there. I hope we dont get lost in the weeds. I hope we focus on those issues that are major concerns to the American people. I hope very much that we have the courage to stand up to the very. very wealthy campaign contributors and their lobbyists who have enormous influence over what takes place here. and that we in fact represent the people who sent us here who are overwhelmingly middleclass and workingclass people. Madam President. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. under the direction of our new majority leader. the Senator from Kentucky. we have been entrusted with a great opportunity to lead this new Congressthe 114th Congressand it is a great honor. Maybe people assume that to be the case. but it is always a good idea to express it out loud and to say how grateful we are for the opportunity to be able to lead the 114th Congress and serve in the majority in the Senate. It is also important to say we approach this opportunity with great humilitynot just with humility but with also a determination and a commitment to address the top priorities of the American people. If there is one issue I heard about from my constituents in Texas during my reelection campaign. which concluded on November 4. it is: Why cant you guys and gals get things done? How come you cant address the problems that confront the American people? By and large. at the top of that list were jobs and stagnant wages. parttime work when people want to work fulltime. They were kitchen table. breadandbutter sorts of issues. Now we have an opportunity starting this week to address one of those priorities. which is creating jobs with the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The Keystone XL Pipeline is important for a lot of reasons. one of which is job creation. It obviously transports oil from Canada through the United States. bypassing the delivery of this oil in railcars. which has been the subject of some news reports when some of them have gone offrail and created some accidents. The oil ends up in Southeast Texas. where we have a lot of refineries which create a lot of jobs but where that crude oil will then be refined into gasoline and jet fuel and other refined products. This is also important because this is a supply of oil from a friendly neighbor. Canadaone of our closest alliesand reduces our dependence on oil from parts of the world that arent quite as stable certainly as Canada is. So it is important from a jobs perspective. It is important from a geopolitical perspective and a national security perspective as well. I went back and looked and noted that the President actually formed a Jobs Council during his first term in office. The job of the members of the council was to put their heads together and provide strategic advice on ways to boost the economy. This is the Presidents Jobs Council that he created during the first term of his Presidency. The groups main homework assignment was to produce this framework for job creation and enhance national competitiveness. In fact. they produced something entitled \"Road Map to Renewal.\" I havent Googled that or Binged it or put it in a search engine. but I bet if anybody who happens to be listening is interested. they could type that into a search engine on the Internetthe \"Road Map to Renewal\"-and find out all they want to know about it. It includes a number of specific and practical recommendations for action. One of those recommendations to the President was to \"optimize all of the nations natural resources and construct pathways (pipelines. transmission and distribution) to deliver electricity and fuel.\" That would seem to be right in the wheelhouse of the Keystone XL Pipeline. The report added that regulatory and \"permitting obstacles that could threaten the development of some energy projects. negatively impact jobs and weaken our energy infrastructure need to be addressed.\" So the Presidents own Jobs Council recognized that the key to Americas energy security is to focus on Americas energy development. including the transmission lines and pipelines by which this natural resource is transported. I know perhaps coming from an energy State such as Texas we are perhaps a lot more familiar with the pipelines and the oil and gas industry because it creates so many jobs and so much prosperity in my State. but some people are a little apprehensive about the idea of a pipeline going under the ground. I invite them to again type into their favorite search engine on the Internet \"oil and gas pipelines\" and look at the map that pops up. It is astonishing how many existing pipelines exist in the United States today. I bet 98 percent of Americans dont even know they exist. Maybe that is too high. maybe it is 95 percent. So this is a safe and efficient and effective way of transporting these natural resources all around the United States. Obviously. if they are transported by pipeline. they dont have to be transported by railcar. including through some populated parts of our country. and subjected to some of the accidents we have read and heard so much about. These underground pipelines are a fairly common reality in our country. which leads me to be absolutely mystified at the resistance from some on the other side of the aisle and in the White House to doing what should be in our selfinterests. which should be something that addresses one of the most important things the American people care about. which is jobs. and the other thing they care an awful lot about. which is security and reducing our dependence on imported energy from the Middle East. That was 3 years ago last month that the Presidents Jobs Council made this recommendation. Then there is last month. when the President said this: \"Im being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new Congress to get things done.\" Hearing that was like music to my ears and I think to a lot of people. to have the President say he wants to work with the Congress. even though Republicans won the majority in the House and in the Senate. So imagine my confusion and the confusion on the part of so many Americans when yesterday the White House Press Secretary said the President would veto any legislative approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Think about the timing of that statement. We had an election on November 4. we had the new Congress sworn in yesterday. the President said a month ago he wanted to work with the Congress. and then the first day of the Congress. before the legislation was even filed much less voted out of committee and brought to the floor. the President said: If you pass that. I am going to veto it. I am probably not the only one who is confused by the contradiction. We know this pipeline would produce thousands of wellpaying jobs and would enhance the supply of energy from a close ally and neighbor. as I said earlier. So the President issued a veto threat on the day the new Congress was sworn in. and it is clear to me that notwithstanding the Presidents previous statements. he is either confused or he has changed his mind about cooperating with the Congress. I hope he meant what he said when he said he would work with us to try to address the concerns of middleclass families when it comes to jobs and help grow the economy and help America prosper. But I am here to say that Republicans who now have the honor and responsibility of serving as the majority in the Senate and in the House did listen. We heard the message delivered to us by the voters on November 4. We know they dont want more bickering. They dont want more dysfunction. The American people. including my constituents in Texas. want results. They want jobs. They want fulltime. not just parttime work. and they want the security that would come with legislation such as this that we are considering today. That is why this week our new majority leader. the senior Senator from Kentucky. Mr. MCCONNELL. has decided we will take up this energy project as job No. 1. This is bipartisan legislation. I was watching TV this morning. I think with the Presiding Officer. and we were together and saw that Senator MANCHIN from West Virginia and Senator HOEVEN from North Dakota were appearing on a morning TV show talking about the importance of this legislation. and they estimate they have as many as 63 votes in the Senate. which by definition is a bipartisan majority. to pass this legislation. This place can be pretty confusing at different times. and I am perplexed why the same President who said he wants to work with us is issuing premature veto threats. even though there is a bipartisan majority for this legislation. Again. the President said he is for an \"all of the above\" approach to take care of our energy future. If that is true. then this should be a part of that approach. He has acknowledged the important connection between job growth and energy development. If there is a poster child for the role that the energy sector can play in growing the economy. it is my State. Texas is a State where we are quite familiar with the oil and gas industry. We are not just sold on oil and gas because we do produce the most electricity from wind turbine of anywhere in the country. We are truly an \"all of the above\" State. But after years of anemic economic growth and the lowest workforce participation in four decades. does the President of the United States think this is an inconsequential piece of legislation? Why does he not work with us as opposed to remaining an obstruction to real progress the American people are crying out for? I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. this is my first \"Time to Wake Up\" speech in the Senate as a Member of the minority. Being in the minority will give me the opportunity. for the first time. to use the tools uniquely available to Members of the Senate minority. On the issue of climate change. which is affecting all of our States but particularly Rhode Island. I intend to use those tools politely and persistently. We have just left a period of partisanship and obstruction by the minority unique in the Senates history. I do not intend to return us to those days. My intent is to enliven the Senate and see to it that it does its duty. that we as Senators do our duty to our fellow Americans. My intent is not to blockade and degrade this great institution with obstruction for the sake of obstruction. My goal. in short. is Senate action. not Senate inaction. Pope Francis recently spoke to the world about mankinds care of Gods creation. He warned us against what he called negligence and inaction. I hope to be a constant spur in the Senate against negligence and inaction. specifically the negligence and inaction that is our present Senate standard of care for Gods Earth. I know that powerful forces of negligence and inaction are arrayed against us. I know the Supreme Courts reckless and shameful decision in the Citizens United case has empowered those forces as never before. I know there has resulted an unprecedented campaign by polluting interests of political spending and threats. It is plain to see that the polluters campaign has. for now at least. silenced meaningful bipartisan debate about carbon pollution. We can line up the Citizens United decision and the silence almost exactly. Coal and oil interests are enjoying massive economic subsidiesmassive subsidiesand similar to any special interest. they will fight to protect those special benefits. But it cant last. It cant last. My confidence is strong because our American democracy is ultimately founded in the will of the American people. and the American people understand the need to end our days of negligence and inaction. They want us to run the blockade that polluters have built around Congress. Polling shows this. More than 80 percent of Americans say they see climate change happening right around them. Twothirds say they would pay more for electricity if it would help solve this problem. Among Independents. that is 64 percent. Even among young Republicans. voters get ityoung voters. anyway. Under the age of 35. most Republican voters. according to polls. think that climate denial is ignorant. out of touch or crazy. Those are the words from the poll. Under 50 years of age. a majority of Republicans and Republicanleaning Independents support action against climate change. Among all Republicans of all ages. fully half support restrictions on carbon dioxide. and nearly half think the United States should lead the fight. Trusted American institutions get it. toofrom the Joint Chiefs of Staff of our military services to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. from all of Americas major scientific societies to the experts we trust day in and day out at NOAA and at NASA. and from the leaders of Americas corporate communityWalmart and Target. Apple and Google. Ford and GM. Mars and Nestle USA. Alcoa and Starbucks. Coke and Pepsi. From all of them and from many other respected voices comes the message that climate change is a serious threat. I have confidence that Congress will soon have to heed their voices. We might mention the recent agreement in Lima where 194 countries all agreed to carbon reductions. Does the Republican Party in the United States of America really want to be aligned with Vladimir Putin. the great international climate denier? My confidence also comes from necessity. This simply must be done. Our human species developed on this earth in a climate window that has always been between 170 and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmospherealways. For as long as human kind has been here on Earth. carbon concentration has wobbled up and down but always within that rangethrough our entire history. going back a million and probably more years. We have now rocketed outside that range and broken 400 parts per million. a condition on Earth that is a first. again. in millions of years. Our oceans. as a result. are acidifying measurably at a rate unprecedented in the life of our species. One has to go back into distant geologic time to find anything similar. If you go back that far and look at what the geologic record tells us about what life was like on the planet in those primal eras. it presents a daunting prospect. The scientific warnings about what this means are now starting to be matched in our experience with unprecedented rain bursts and droughts. wildfires and heat seasons. sea levels and ocean temperatures. In the tropic seas. coral reefs are dying off at startling rates. in the Arctic seas. sea ice is vanishing at levels never recorded until now. Everywhere the oceans shout a warning to those who will listen. Rhode Island. as a coastal State. as the Ocean State. is particularly hard hit. We get the land problems such as the rain bursts heavily associated with climate change. which in 2010 brought unprecedented flooding along our historic rivers. We have the sea level rise. It is expected now to be several feet by the end of the centuryby a warming sea that has also disturbed our fisheries and distressed our fishing economy. \"It is not my grandfathers ocean out there.\" as one commercial fisherman told me. This only goes one way. There is no theory of how this magically gets better on its own. Every theoryand now most observationsall point to all this getting worse and perhaps very badly worse. The time for negligence and inaction has passed. In the Senate we need to begin a conversation about this. We have to begin at the beginning. We have to agree on a baseline of facts. principles. and laws of nature that can then inform our judgments about what to do. I do not think it is asking too much of the new majority in the Senate to begin an honest conversation about carbon dioxide and climate change. I dont think that it is too much to ask the new majority in the Senate that we undertake this conversation in a serious and responsible manner. I do not think that is extreme or unreasonable. We need to begin at the beginning in this conversation. and I will make every effort to see to it that we begin. But even as we begin. we can keep the end in sight. That end is a world where polluters pay the costs of their pollution. That in turn creates a world where market forces work properly in our energy markets. The end is a world where it is America that seizes the economic promise of these new energy technologies. where we are buildersnot buyersof the energy devices of the future. The end is a world that turns back from the brink of a plainly foreseeable risk where the consequences of negligence and inaction could well be dire for us and for the generations that follow us. In sum. we in this Senate have a duty before us. and negligence and inaction will not meet what that duty demands. For those of you with a coal economy or an oil economy in your States. I understand and I want to work with you. There are answers to be found. But please. do not pretend that this problem doesnt exist. That is false and unacceptable. I must. on behalf of my State and on behalf of our future. insist that we in the Senate meet our duty. even under this new Senate majorityand I will. I yield the floor. and I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. along with Senator JOE MANCHINand actually a total of 60 sponsorsI have filed S. 1. which is the Keystone approval bill. It is a very simple. straightforward bill. This is legislation we have seen before in this body. What it does. under the commerce clause of the Constitution. is authorize Congress to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline project. I have this map in the Chamber to show you the project. It runs from Hardisty in Alberta. Canada. all the way down to our refineries in Texas along the gulf coast. This project will move 830.000 barrels of oil a day. Some of that will be oil from Canada. Some of that will be domestic oil from the Bakken region in Montana and North Dakota. This is part of building the infrastructure so we can build a comprehensive energy plan for our country. We are producing more and more oil and gas in our country from shale from places such as the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana. the Eagle Ford in Texas. natural gas from places such as the Barnett and the Marcellus in New York. Pennsylvania. and Ohio. What we are working toward issome people refer to it as energy independence. but really energy security for our country. What does that mean? It means we produce more energy than we consume. Obviously. energy has a global market. The market for energy is a global market. We know that. The market for oil and gas is a global market. But the point is. working together with our closest friend and ally. Canada. we can have North American energy security where we produce more energy than we consume. Why is that important? That is important because it is about creating jobs. It is important because it is about economic growth. It is important because it is a national security issue. Why do we continue to rely on oil from the Middle East? Why are we continuing to send dollars to the Middle East where you havelook at what happened in Paris today with an attack by Islamic extremists. One of the ways we fight back. one of the ways we push back is we take control of our own energy destiny. We can do it. We are doing it. Why are gas prices lower today at the pump? Is it because OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present? I do not think so. It is because we are producing far more energy than we ever have before. But to continue to produce that energy. we have to have the infrastructure to move that energy from where it is produced to were it is consumed. That means pipelines. That means roads. That means rail. For electricity. that means transmission. But we cannot have an energy plan for this country that really works without the infrastructure to move that energy safely and effectively. That is what this project is all about. So why are we here talking about it today? It seems like a pretty straightforward proposition. After all. I think there are something like 19 different pipelines that cross the border. In fact. there are millions of miles of pipelines in this country. Here is a map I have in the Chamber of just some of them. We have millions of miles of pipeline in this country. A lot of them. as you can see. cross the border. So why are we standing here today talking about another pipeline project? Because for the past 6 yearsfor the past 6 yearsthe administration has held this project up. They keep saying: There is a process. As a matter of fact. Josh Earnest. just yesterday. said: Oh. we have a process. Congress should not intervene in the Keystone XL Pipeline approval issue because there is a process. Really. Mr. President. there is a process? Lets see. The TransCanada company filed application to build the Keystone XL Pipeline in September of 2008September 2008. If you do the math. that is more than 6 years ago. And there is a process somehow to get to a conclusion? So that company. which has invested hundreds of millions already. wants to build. ultimately. an $8.9 million project that will move 830.000 barrels of oil a day. And here they are 6 years later still waiting for approval. That is why today we are asking Congress to step forward and do what the American people want. Keystone is not a new issue. The American people understand this issue. Poll after poll shows the American people. by a margin of about 70 percent to 20some percent. support this project. Whom do we work for? We work for the people of this great country. and 70 percent of the people of this great country say: Approve the project. After 6 long years. where all of the requirements have been met. approve the project. But the President. of course. continues to hold it up. and even yesterday issued a veto threat. Why? Why is he wanting to threaten a veto on a project that 70 percent of the American people support? It is really hard to understand. isnt it? Because every time an objection comes up. we have worked to address that objection. When there was an objection on the route. the company rerouted. So the President says: Well. it is an environmental concern. He says: Well. it is an environmental concern. Really? An environmental concern? This is what his own study found. After 6 years of study. the State Department. in multiple environmental impact statementsthree draft statements and two final environmental impact statementsthis is what they found: no significant environmental impact. according to the U.S. State Department environmental impact statements. That is not something I did. That is not something the company did. That is something the Obama administration didrepeatedlyand came to the same conclusion: no significant environmental impact. In fact. if you do not build the pipeline. you have to move that oil with 1.400 railcars a day. Now. Canada is going to produce the energy. North Dakota. Montana. other States. are going to continue to produce the energy. So that energy is going to move. The question is. how and where? If we cannot build the pipeline. then it has to go by railcar. So do we really want 1.400 railcars a day moving that product around or do we want it to move more safely. more costeffectively. with better environmental stewardship through a pipeline? Common sense. Then there is this idea somehow: Well. Canada is not going to produce that oil if they do not have a pipeline. Wrong. They will move it by rail. and they will build other pipelines. Here are several that are already in the planning stages. as shown on this map. They will move it to the East Coast to refineries they have there or they will send it west and it will go to China. Now. does that make sense? It does not make sense to the American public. which is why the American public wants to work with Canada as well as produce energy in our country to become energy secure. The idea that we would say no to our closest friend and ally. Canada: We are not going to work with you. we are going to continue to buy oil from the Middle East. and we are going to have you send your oil to China. makes no sense to the American people. And it should not. It should not. That is why they overwhelmingly support this project. So here we are. We are starting the new Congress. I think. very clearly. in the last election. the people said: We support this project. You saw it time after time with candidate after candidate who supported this project who won their election. But on an even bigger issue. an even bigger message. the people of this great country said: We want the Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to get things done. We want the Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to get things done. So here we have legislation that has passed the House repeatedly with a bipartisan majority. Here we have legislation that has bipartisan support in this body. Here we have legislation that the American people overwhelmingly support. after clearly giving the message in the last election that they want us working together to get work done. and the President issues a veto message right out of the gates. Why? For whom? Whom is he working for? So it is incumbent upon us to work together in a bipartisan way to get this legislation passed. The way we are approaching itand I see my good friend and colleague from the great State of West Virginia is here. I want to thank him and turn to him. but I want to do it in the form of a question. It was my very clear sense from the last electionand I think the very clear sense that we all got from the last electionthat they want to see Congress working together in a bipartisan way. in an open process to get the important work of this country done. So with this legislation. it is not just that it is about important energy infrastructure. It is also that we want to return to regular order in this body. offer an open amendment process. allow people to bring forward their amendments. offer those amendments. debate them. and get a vote on those amendments. If they have amendments that can add to and improve this legislation. great. lets have that process. Lets have that debate. Lets have those votes. Lets make this bill as good as we can possibly make it. Then the President needs to work with us. The President needs to meet us halfway and get this done for the American people. So I would like to turn to my good colleague from the great State of West Virginia and say: Arent we doing all we can here to try to make sure we are approaching this in a bipartisan way with an open. transparent process to try to build support for this legislation?",

    "speech": "I say to the Senator. he is absolutely correct. I thank him for this opportunity not only to work with him but also to bring the facts forward. We have heard many times: We are all entitled to our own opinions. we are just not entitled to our own facts. If you start looking at what we are consuming today in America. at last count 7 million barrels of crude oil is purchased every day in America from other countries7 million barrels of crude a day. So this line would possibly furnish 830.000 barrels of that dependency that we have. Lets look and see where it comes from right now. Mr. President. 2.5 million barrels we are already purchasing from Canadaour best. greatest ally we could possibly have. the best trading partner and the No. 1 trading partner that 35 of the 50 States have. So it is not an unknown there. But lets look at where we are purchasing some of the rest of the oil from. We purchase 755.000 barrels of heavy crude a day from Venezuela. Lets look at Venezuela. where it is an authoritarian regime. It impoverishes its citizens. It violates their human rights. It shows its willingness to put down political protests with horrific violence. We also purchase 1.3 million barrels a day from Saudi Arabia. We all have our concerns about Saudi Arabia and a lot of the money we follow goes into the wrong hands. Fortytwo thousand barrels a day from Russiafrom Russia. We know their intent and what they have been doing with their energy policy. Their regime has invaded its neighbors and they armed proRussian separatists in Ukraine. So when we start looking at what we are doing. those are the facts. This is not just hearsay. It is not just rumors. These are facts. We purchase 7 million barrels. When I first was approached on this 4 years ago when I came to the Senate. they said: What do you think about the Keystone Pipeline that will be bringing oil from Canada into America? I said: Where I come from in West Virginia it is pretty common sense. We would rather buy from our friends than our enemies. I would rather support my friends. my allies. my trading partners more so than I would the enemies who use anything I buy from themthe money they receive from that product that I buy from them and use it against me. It is pretty common sense. not real complicated. I know everybody is trying to make this complicated. Also. they talk aboutwe just had a caucus talking about what would happen to the oil. I know the Senator has been watching this very closely. But they said the Keystone Pipeline will strictly be just an avenue and a vehicle for exporting this oil out. They are just going to use America to bring that oil through. We checked into that a little bit further. That is not true. Even the Washington Post gave it three Pinocchios that said it was untrue. We found out. basically. the crude oil from Canada is expected to be mixed with the domestic oil from the Bakkens. from the Senators region. North Dakota. and that the Canadian oil is a heavier crude. similar to Venezuelan oil. It will be mixed with the light crude from the Bakkens. which enables it to flow much easier and be produced. Once it commingles. this oil is basically American oil. It lives and dies and basically is marketed with the policies of the United States of America. Our policy is not to export crude oil. So I do not know why people are using this argument and scaring people that we will get no benefit. Then we talked about the jobs. They said there is not that many jobs. In West Virginia. you give us 42.000 jobs. We would be very appreciative. We will thank you. These are all highpaying jobs. They said: Well. they are only contract jobs. But yet I hear everybody talking. Republicans and Democrats. about building roads and building bridges. Those are also seasonal types of jobs. Those are also contracting jobs. They are not permanent jobs. but we are tickled to death to get them. That is the whole trade union. All the unions that I know of are supportive of this piece of legislation. Every working man and woman whom we keep talking about who supports themselves and their family supports this legislation. Why we are running into such a roadblock I have no idea. Then when we put the map upthe other map we had. I said: When I first heard about this pipeline. I thought it was an anomaly that we did not have many pipelines in America. Then we put up this map. This is what we have in America today. So this is not foreign to any of us in any State we have pipelines. many in West Virginia and all through this country. Then we look at public support. We think: Here we are Democrats and Republicans. We look at the polls. and we live and die by the polls. they tell us. or we should. But the bottom line is that if we do believe in the polls. this has been a consistent poll. It has not varied for over 5 years. We have not seen the numbers fluctuate that much. Overwhelmingly. we have Americans in all aspects of the political realmwhether you are a Democrat. Republican or an Independentwho overwhelmingly support this pipeline. So I cannot see the objections to it. I was very disappointed when the President said he would veto itor the White House once we said we would go through this process. I think the Senator and I talked about this. We thought this is going to be an open process. I was encouraged by my colleagues on the Democratic side who have some good amendments. I believe. that should be considered and I believe would pass and enhance the bill. We only need four morefour more Senators on my side of the aisle who can see the benefit of a good bill. a good process with good amendments to strengthen this bill. to put us in a position that is vetoproof. That should be our goal. Basically. we should not be deterred by the White House or the President saying already that they are going to veto this bill. Lets see if we can make this bill so good that when we are finished with this product and this process 2 or 3 weeks from now. we will have a product that basically we are all proud of. that the American people are proud of and will support. and maybe. just maybe. the White House will change its mind. I am hopeful for that. I appreciate all the effort and work. We are working very well together. At last count. we had nine Democrats working with our Republican colleagues. That puts us at 63. I am hopeful to get four more at least that will look at the virtues of this and the assets and what it will do for our country. My main goal is this: Energy independence makes a secured and protected Nation. Anytime we do not have to depend on oil coming from other parts of the worldand the resources we give them when we purchase their product. they use those resources against us time after time again. We can see now. with the oil prices dipping. the benefits the consumers in America receive. the strength that gives our country. I am so thankful for that. that we are getting a break. I think we can continue to make that happen for many years to come if we are able to be smart strategically in what we do today. I think the Senator spoke about the environment. He might want to touch on that again. But most of this oil is being produced now. some way or another. and it is also getting transported in different ways and means. The bottom line is there is no significant environmental impact. I think the State Department has even done five studies that show that to be true. I said also 2.5 million barrels a day are being purchased from Canada today. Refineries in Illinois are now refining this product. They said we should not do it. We have been doing it for quite some time. We are using this product. With technology we are using it better. It has helped us be more independent of foreign oil. That is No. 1. the security of our Nation. Being an American. and for West Virginians. the security of our Nation is first and foremost what we support. That is why I think we see a tremendous amount of people from the Mountain State. I say to the Senator. who support this piece of legislation. We are going to work diligently. We have a long way to go. but I think the facts are on our side. We are all entitled to our opinions. but we cannot change the facts.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I applaud. first of all. the Senator from North Dakota for his leadership on this most important issue and his commitment to making it a priority for this Senate. the first bill introduced into this Senate. I also applaud the Senator from West Virginia. one example of. as we sit in this Chamber today. Republicans and Democrats discussing and supporting the Keystone XL Pipeline. I reiterate many of the comments expressed by my colleagues and convey the importance of this pipeline. because as the Senator from North Dakota mentioned and showed on his map. the very first State the Keystone Pipeline enters as it comes from Canada is the State of Montana. Let me tell you something. It is not just a pipeline. This is also changing the way of life and economic stimulus for our great State. I spend a lot of time traveling around the State in my pickup. As I drive around Eastern Montana. where the Keystone Pipeline will travel. I recognize this is a lifeline for many of our rural communities. In fact. Circle. MTCircle. MT. is a small town of around 600 people. It is located in McCone County. It is one of six Montana counties that the Keystone XL Pipeline will run through. Circle. similar to a lot of small communities in Montana. has experienced the same economic and population declines that other towns have faced in recent years. In fact. the county has significant infrastructure needs that have gone unresolved in the wake of a shrinking tax base. For towns such as Circle. the Keystone XL Pipeline is not just about energy. It represents economic opportunity and hope for the future. You see. McCone County alone would see $18 million in property tax revenue from the Keystone Pipeline construction. That is just in the pipelines first year of operation. That is money for neighborhoods. It is money for roads. not to mention the influx of jobs for the area. Another $45 million would be distributed among five other Montana counties. and $16 million would go to Montanas schools and university systems. You see. the Keystone XL Pipeline means lower energy costs for Montana families. for our senior citizens. and for small businesses. In Glasgow. MTI remember traveling in my pickup into Glasgow. I met with the NorVal Electric Coop. They told me that if the Keystone Pipeline is approved. they will hold electric rates flat for their customers for the next 10 years. That is several thousand Montana families up in the northeast part of our State. The reason for that is because they will supply electricity to these pump stations on the Keystone Pipeline. If the Keystone Pipeline is not approved. those ratepayers will see an approximate 40percent increase in their utility rates over the next 10 years. That is a potential increase of $480 per year for the average household in Montana. As the Senator from North Dakota mentioned. 100.000 barrels a day of the oil traveling through the Keystone Pipeline will be Montana and North Dakota oil. That supports the Bakken formation. With the revolution of hydraulic fracturing. what it is creating now is lower gas prices at the pump today. Montanans know this pipeline is not just a lofty idea or some kind of DCbased rhetoric. It is hope for the people of my State. It is a tangible result and a solution that Montanans deserve. I have to tell you. that is why it is so disappointing that once again we are seeing the President and some Senate Democrats playing political games and perpetuating the 6 years of gridlock that have held back this jobcreating project. Rather than putting the American people first. the President has threatened to refuse the people of Montana their right to determine their economic future. It took the Canadians just 7 months to approve their end of the Keystone Pipeline. It has taken this President more than 6 years. That is 6 years without the hundreds of goodpaying jobs that will be created in Montana and thousands more across the Nation. That is 6 years without millions of dollars in critical revenue for Montana schools. for infrastructure. for teachers. That is 6 years without the answers and actions that Montanans deserve. I think the pipeline checks every box of common sense. It is environmentally sound. it creates jobs. it is economic opportunity. and it is going to help us move toward North American energy independence. So the question is: Why are we still waiting? The people of Montana. the people of this country have said they have had enough. That is why we are here today speaking in support of this important project. I am proud the Senate is taking steps to move forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline. I know the House intends to do the same shortly. President Obama can continue to obstruct progress on American jobs and American energy independence. but the American people have sent a strong message that they are ready to remove any roadblocks that President Obama intends to put in the way. The time for partisanship. the time for political games is over. It is time the Congress and this government gets to work for the American people and starts getting results for this country. The polls are clear. Sixtyseven percent of the American people want the Keystone Pipeline approved. Seventyfive percent of Montanans want the Keystone Pipeline approved. Prior to serving in Congress. I spent 28 years in the private sector. where we were focused on getting results in the real world. It seems only in DC are we outside of the real world of doing something and getting results on behalf of the American people. That starts with approving the Keystone XL Pipeline.",

    "speech": "First let me thank and congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his dogged determination in fighting for these American jobs and for energy security for our country. I am so grateful for his hard work. He has really been tenacious in this fight to get this bill past the Senate and to the Presidents desk. I also congratulate my friend and colleague from Montana. Last fall the American people elected 12 new Republican Senators to work in this body. and he is one of them. I have had the opportunity to travel with him in Montana. He has a great background. He is innovative. and he is energetic. He is going to do a tremendous job not only for his State and the Rocky Mountain West but for the entire United States as a Member of the Senate. He just took his oath yesterday. We were able to hear from him today. and he is going to be a remarkable addition to this body. I know that all of these dozen new Republican Senators are as eager as the rest of us in the new Republican majority to start fulfilling our obligation to the people we represent. Americans elected a Republican Congress because they wanted a change. They wanted to change the direction that President Obama and Democrats have taken the country. Under the Democratic leadership over the past several years. the Senate was a place of dysfunction and gridlock. More than 40 jobs bills passed by the House of Representatives in the last Congress never even came up for a vote in the Senate. Many of those bills had overwhelming bipartisan support. just like this one we are debating today. Those days are over. That is a completely unacceptable way to run the Senate. All of us here in the Senate. Republicans and Democrats. have been given an opportunity to work together and to get things done. That is what the American people told us on election day. that is what they are expecting from us. and I believe that is what they are demanding of us. The poster child for the gridlock and dysfunction of Washington has been the Keystone XL Pipeline. For more than 6 years it has been a symbol of outofcontrol Washington bureaucracy. The State Department has absolutely refused to do its job and to make any kind of decision on the pipelines application. The Keystone XL Pipeline has also been a symbol of gridlock in the Senate. A small group of extreme environmentalists with deep pockets has bullied Democratic Members of the Senate to block a bill that would move this important jobs project further. According to the latest figures. Americas labor force participation rate is woefully low. it is just 62.8 percent. Are Democrats in this body satisfied with that number? Is the President of the United States. President Barack Obama. satisfied with this pathetic participation in Americas labor force? I can say that people in my State. Republicans all across the countrythey are not satisfied. That is why we are determined to push jobcreating legislation such as this Hoeven bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline. The President said there is no benefit to this important infrastructure project. During a press conference last month. President Obama actually claimed that the project is \"not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.\" Apparently. that is what the President believes. Well. he is wrong. Just ask the Obama administrations own State Department. It says the pipeline would support more than 42.000 jobs. Some of those are construction jobs. Some of them are in the transportation field and the manufacturing field. It includes jobs at warehouses. restaurants. and motels along the route. Does President Obama think that a good job is not even a \"nominal benefit\" to the Americans who could get those 42.000 jobs from this pipeline? According to the Congressional Research Service. there are already 19 pipelines operating across U.S. borders. Why is this the one that suddenly offers not even a nominal benefit. according to President Obama? Why does President Obama refuse to make a decision about whether to approve the pipeline? Well. the President has taken a position on this bipartisan billaccording to the White House Press Secretary on Tuesday. the President will not sign this bill once Congress passes it. The State Department has done one study after another showing that the pipeline would create jobs and that it would have no significant environmental impact. President Obama has been downplaying those benefits and threatening to veto the bill. That is not Presidential leadership. Now Republicans are going to show the leadership that the American people have been asking for and that they voted for last November. We are going to bring a bill to the floor and force the President to finally do something by putting it on the Presidents desk. Democrats have been playing politics with this pipeline bill. The Republican majority will now get it done. We are going to allow a vote on this project. We are going to allow Senators to offer amendments. What a unique situation in the Senate. We are going to let everyone say which side they are on. This will be a bellwether decision. Are Members of the Senate in favor of 42.000 jobs for American workers or are they in favor of more Washington delay? Democrats will have a chance to make their arguments. The extreme opponents of this project will make misleading claims to try to discount the pipelines benefits. and they will try to stoke peoples fears. We have seen it all before. At the end of the day. here is what this all comes down tofour things: No. 1. the Keystone XL Pipeline will support more than 42.000 jobs in the United States. No. 2. it will be a private investment of $8 billionnot taxpayer spending. private spending. No. 3. it will have minimal effect on the environment. No. 4. the pipeline is actually safer than other methods of getting that oil to market. Congress should approve this pipeline and pass this bill and the President should sign it. The Keystone XL Pipeline is a job creator. It has bipartisan support. It has been stuck in Washingtons bureaucratic gridlock. It is interesting. When I listen to and think of the President and his comments about jobs and what the impact is going to be. it makes me think of what the president of the Laborers International Union of North America said in the summer 1 year ago. He was scheduled to testify today at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearinga hearing that now the minority. the Democratic acting leader. Senator DURBIN. objected to having yesterday. He objected to just a hearing and a discussion. It is interesting. There was a press release from the president of the union. who was quoted on the subject of the economic benefits associated with the construction of the pipeline. Terry OSullivan said: The President [President Obama] seems to dismiss the corresponding economic opportunities that would benefit other laborers. manufacturers. small businesses. and communities throughout Keystones supply chain. He said: The Washington politics behind the delay of the Keystone XL pipeline are of little concern to those seeking the dignity of a good. highpaying job. We renew our call to the President [President Obama] to approve this important. jobcreating project without delay. This is what a job is. It is about someones dignity. their identity. and their selfworth. People take a lot of personal pride in their work and in their job. I think we ought to approve it. I am ready to vote for it. The American people have been clear: They are tired of Washingtons gridlock and delay. and they are tired of the direction President Obama has been taking this country. The American voters demanded change. they demanded action. and this Republican Congress is going to deliver just that. So I say to my friend and colleague from North Dakotaand I see that the chairman of the Senate energy committee has arrivedthank you both for your leadership. To the Senator from North Dakota. former Governor there. thank you for your leadership on energy in North Dakota. And to the senior Senator from Alaska. the chair of the energy committee. thank you specifically for your leadership. I look forward to working with both of you specifically on this project and on additional issues that will bring American energy security and jobs to our Nation.",

    "speech": "To my friend and colleague from North Dakota. it is all about infrastructure. In Alaska. my home State. we have boundless supplies of oil and natural gas. but until we were able to build that 800mile pipeline across two mountain ranges to deliver oil from Alaskas North Slope to tidewater in Valdez. that oil didnt do anybody any good. Today.the oil pipeline in Alaska is less than half full. So we are working to try to figure out how we can do more as a State to contribute more to our Nations energy needs. to allow us as a State to be producing more for the benefit not only of our State but of the Nation as well. but we are held back by policies that limit us. So it is policies and it is infrastructure. It is absolutely infrastructure. We are trying to move Alaskas natural gas to market as well. But. again. if we dont have the infrastructure. it sits. It stays. It doesnt benefit consumers. it doesnt create jobs. and it doesnt help any of us out. So Keystone truly is about infrastructure. I thank my colleague from North Dakota for leading on this issue for years now and for reintroducing the legislation. S. 1. the first bill to be filed in the Senate this year. It will be among the first bills to pass in this new Congress and appropriately so. This is a measure that not only enjoys bipartisan support in the Senate. it enjoys broad support over in the House. and it enjoys support across our Nation for great reason. So why are we where we are? Why are we looking at this situation and saying there is so much frustration going on? Senator MCCONNELL has promised to allow open and full debate on the Keystone XL Pipeline project. the legislation in front of us. I think we are looking forward to it. As the chairman of the energy committee. I am looking forward to robust debate on Keystone XL and what it will provide for this country in terms of jobs and in terms of opportunities. We are all frustrated. We are all frustrated by a Presidents decisionor unwillingness. really. to make a decision about this pipeline. It has been 2.301 days and counting since the company seeking to build it submitted an application for this crossborder permit2.301 days. That is more than 6 years ago. Yesterday the President was finally able to make a decision. He issued his statement of administration policy. In his statement he says that by advancing this measure. it would cut short consideration of important issues. Excuse me. Mr. Presidentcut short a process that has been underway for over 6 years? That is amazing to me. Again. when we talk about decisions. lets get moving with this. The President seems to be advancing some pretty interesting things when it comes to the energy discussion. He was quoted in an interview just this morning in the Detroit News. He basically told Americans that we are enjoying lower energy prices right now. but we had better enjoy them fast because they are not going to last. He said we have to be smart about our energy policy. I am with you there. Mr. President. We do have to be smart about our energy policy. But to think the suggestion is just enjoy low prices while they last. take advantage of the sunshineno. Mr. President. your energy policies need to make sense for today. for the midterm. and for the long term. For the long term and for the short term we need to make sure we have infrastructure that will allow us the energy supply that is so important to this country. It amazes me we would be so defeatist with this approach. We have an opportunity in this Congress. We had an opportunity this morning in the energy committee. We had scheduled a hearing on the Keystone XL Pipeline. We were going to hear testimony on original legislation to approve Keystone XL as we did last year on a bipartisan basis. But as Members in the body know. there was objection to that unanimous consent. We had to postpone the hearing. I quite honestly was surprised. It would have been nice to know an objection was coming before we had organized the hearing. before we had invited witnesses. before we had completed all the preparation. We are going to do our best in our committee to adhere to regular order. I hope our colleagues will work with us. I wish to introduce for the RECORD some of the testimony we received from the three witnesses who graciously agreed to participate in our hearing we had scheduled for this morning. Andrew Black. president and CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. described pipeline safety issues and the gains Keystone XL would bring to the American economy in terms of jobs and payrolls. An excerpt from his testimony is as follows: While there is much controversy associated with the Keystone XL Pipeline. the facts are that pipelines are the safest way to transport crude oil and other energy products. A barrel of crude oil has a better than 99.999 percent chance of reaching its destination safely by pipeline. safer than any competing transportation mode. A second witness we had invited was David Mallino. legislative director of the Laborers International Union of North America. In his testimony he explored the positive jobs impact of the pipeline and responded to some environmental concerns. Here is an excerpt from Mr. Mallinos testimony: Regardless of characterizations by the projects opponents. it is indisputable that jobs will be created and supported in the extraction and refining of the oil. as well as in the manufacturing and service sectors. We also invited Greg Dotson. vice president for energy policy at the Center for American Progress. He submitted his testimony in opposition. We made sure we had opposition testimony presented as well. He discussed climate change. He responded to the arguments in favor of Keystone. While he may be an opponent of the pipeline and as usual would have been outnumbered by the supporters of the project. I will still reference his testimony for the RECORD. A copy of the testimony of Mr. Black. Mr. Mallino. and Mr. Dotson may be found on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee Web site. I do believe that had we been allowed to hold the hearing this morning. we would have heard very strong bipartisan statements in support of Keystone XL from many members of our committee. The majority of our committee supports this pipeline and is already cosponsoring this bill. I will close my comments by assuring members of this body. we are in day 2 of this 114th Congress. This is not going to be our only debate on energy legislation over the years. I know it has been a long 7 years since we have had comprehensive energy legislation. A lot has changed. A lot of people have great ideas to improve and reform our policies. and I welcome those ideas. I am looking forward to the debate. to advancing these proposals through the energy committee. I think we can make significant progress on supply and infrastructure. on efficiency. on accountability. Those areas in particular should be the forum or the focus of an energy bill that we would hope to report out. We are going to work hard on the energy committee. We are planning on legislating. Keystone XL is a natural point for this Congress because it has been delayed for so long. 2.301 days. It is clear this President is not going to make a decision on this. so the Congress needs to make it instead. I look forward to coming back to the floor in a couple days when we have S. 1 officially in front of us. We are going to have good debate on it. I look forward to working with my colleague who has been so determined on this issue for so long. His leadership has been key in getting us here. but we need to finish it. We need to make the connects so we can move the resource and provide jobs for this country and for our allies and friends in Canada. I again thank my friend and look forward to these next couple days and the next couple weeks where we will have an opportunity to put this before the American people on the floor of the Senate.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I rise to join my colleagues on the other side who represent States that know a little bit about energy and certainly my colleague from North Dakota who has led this effort from the first day he arrived in the Senate. It is no big surprise because we know we can have much oil out there and we can know where the reserves are. but if we dont have the infrastructure to move that oil to market. what it does is drive up prices. I havent checked today. but oil price is below $40 a barrel. If someone doesnt think that is supplydemand economics 101. they dont understand what is happening. The fact is we have known reserves in places such as North Dakota and Alaska. we have produceable reserves in Canada. and we have an opportunity to continue to develop these resources in a way that benefits in an incredible way American consumers. Think about what is happening for the average American family today when they fill up at the pump. and think what that means and how that will ripple through our economy as discretionary income grows. But that is only possible when we have a known supply that is moveable. it is transportable. it is in fact capable of reaching its market or reaching the refinery. That is what we are talking about when we are talking about North American crude oil. We are going to hear a lot of stories about this debate about how this crude oil is more dangerous to the environment. how it is different than Bakken crude. Guess what. It is different than Bakken crude. but it is not different than the crude refined in refineries in Texas. where we will be displacing crude that is refined from Venezuela. and we are going to be replacing it with crude that is produced by our friends to the north. Canada. So infrastructure is a huge part. In fact. that is why. when Secretary Moniz declared the Quadrennial Energy Review. he looked at not just where is the supply and the future of supply of energy. he focused on transportation of energy because that is a huge part of our challenge. As we look at the Keystone XL Pipelineand we say Keystone XL because a lot of people dont know we already have a Keystone Pipeline. We already have a pipeline that is bringing oil sands from Canada into the United States for refining. A lot of people dont realize this is the second pipeline that will be named Keystone. and it is a pipeline that has been in process for literally a decade. from their planning process to the time they actually ask for a permit. I am going to address some of the concerns of some of my colleagues as we hear them so we can kind of lay the groundwork. We frequently hear the Keystone XL Pipeline will be exporting. and all of the oil that is coming down will find its way directly into China. That gets said all the time. and guess what the Washington Post gave it: three Pinocchios. It is not true. It is going to get refined. It is going to get refined in the United States of America. it is going to displace Venezuelan crude. and it is going to find its way into the American markets and continue to provide that supply that is in fact today driving down costs. So lets get rid of the first argument that this is going to somehow not benefit American consumers. that this is going to somehow find its way onto a barge immediately upon arrival into the gulf. That is the first thing we need to be talking about. which is lets actually have a factbased discussion about what this pipeline is. The second argument we will hear is that this somehow will have a huge effect on climate and on climate change. and for those reasons alone it ought to be rejected. Lets take a look at what the experts who have repeatedly looked at this very issuebecause one thing we know that I think is beyond dispute when we talk to the officials in Canada. is that we are going to produce oil sands oil from Canada. regardless of whether we build a pipeline. That oil is going to find its way into the transportation system and quite honestly is going to burden our rail transportation system because we havent figured out how to build a pipeline. So all those who want to confuse the issue about the pipeline versus the development in Canada of the oil sands. lets separate it. Lets look at what in fact is the decision before the United States of America. that is. the decision of whether it is in our national interest to approve a permit for a pipeline. I will say this over and over again as we pursue this debate: This is a pipeline and not a cause. So many people have talked about it. and I think in some ways this process has gotten exaggerated on both sides. I mean it is going to be a panacea and prevent all unemployment or it is going to be the worst thingan Armageddon for the environment. And you know what. this is a pipeline. This is a transportation system. This is an essential part of the infrastructure to bring an important fossil fuel into our country so that it can be refined and utilized by the American people. And by the way. knowing those reserves are there. knowing that we have the reserves we have in the Bakken. and knowing that we are developing more untraditional sources of supply has driven the price down and has created the situation we have today that is saving consumers millions and billions of dollars in our country. The second thing I want to say is people say we have to respect the process. I respect the process as part of what I have done my whole lifeI am a lawyer. So you hear repeatedly about due process and having to go through due process. Occasionally. the process is broken6 years to site a pipeline.",

The other issue that is raised is that the pipeline is somehow going to disrupt what is happening in Nebraska. I think the Senator from North Dakota was absolutely correct to put as part of this bill a provision in that says that all bets are off if Nebraska reverses the decisions that were made in Nebraska. But somehow that is getting forgotten in this debate. So we are going to have a lot of hours of debate. I think. on Keystone XL Pipeline. We are going to have a lot of amendments. I am grateful for the opportunity to go back to regular order. I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about amendments. But I want so badly for us to have a reasoned and factbased debatenot an emotional debate but a debate that basically puts this pipeline issue in perspective.

The result is that increased U.S. production in North Dakota has \"fundamentally reordered the worlds energy markets.\" This is a national security issue. This is an issue where RussiaI think the breakeven point for them is about $110 a barrel. Right now it is at $48. They never dreamed this would happen. Their entire economy is at stake. and hopefully it will cause Mr. Vladimir Putin to start thinking about some of his adventuresome antics around the world. In addition. the pipeline represents not only everything that the distinguished Senator has brought out but it is a symbol that says that we are going to go ahead with all of our energy production. We are going to go \"all of the above\" here. This is not eitheror with green projects or fossil fuels or whatever. So if you vote for the pipeline you are voting for something that really affects our national security. Think about potential exports to Europe. They could be less dependent on Russia and so Vladimir does not have his choke hold on them. if you will. There is a lot going on with regard to this issue that people havent thought about.

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. President. I take this timeand some of my colleagues will be joining meto express concerns about the first major bill that has been brought to the floor under the Republican leadership dealing with the Keystone Pipeline. I want to start first by talking about the socalled urgency for us to take this issue up and circumvent the normal process. The normal process would be for this matter to continue through the regulatory review. which is there to protect the public interest. To shortcircuit that in an unprecedented way and for Congress to approve a site for a pipeline is not the way it is done. In order to consider this there must be some urgency. First. let me just share with my colleagues what the American people are experiencing with the price of gasoline at the pump. It is at a historic low over the last 5 years. with $2.19 the average price for gasoline at the pump. So there is certainly no urgency if we are talking about trying to get more oil in the pipelines for the cost of energy. By the way. I think we all understand that our actions here in this Congress will have very little to do with the availability of oil in the near term. It would take some time to construct the pipeline and for it to have an impact on the level of oil that is available. The second issue that I find somewhat puzzling with regard to the urgency of this issueand some of my colleagues have pointed it out on both sides of this issueis that there is already a pipeline that is available that could be used. Admittedly. it is not as efficient as what they are trying to do with the Keystone. and that is to make tar sand. the dirty oil we have. more economically available and feasible to be transported. That makes little sense under todays economics and the price of gasoline makes it even more hard to understand. Construction of this pipeline and the approval of this Congress will have very little to do with the consumer availability of energy here in the United States. Now. compound the fact that we are talking about Canadian oil. the dirtiest oilthe tar sand oilthat is being transported through the United States because Canada doesnt want to transport it through their own country because of their concerns on the environmental side and which ends up in Texas at the Port Arthur. TX. refinery. Now for those who are not familiar. that is a foreign tax zone which is taxfree. So. therefore. the oil can go into the international marketplace in a very easy manner. Valero. which is one of the potential usersconsumers of this oilis building export facilities in order to handle more exports to the international communities. None of us can speak with any definitive judgment as to how much of this oil will in fact end up in the United States. but the fact that they are transporting it to a southern portthey are not transporting it to a refinery in the Midwest. which would be a lot closer and a lot cheaperis a clear indication this oil will end up in the international marketplace and will have very little to do with energy security in the United States. I think we have to make that clear. We are bypassing the normal process to allow Canadian oil to enter the international marketplace more efficiently with risk to the United States and very little benefit. Why are we doing this? We hear it will give us jobs. I am for job creation. I would like to see us work on a transportation bill where we could create millions of jobs in a far more harmonious way than we can with Keystone. I am for clean energy policies which will create great permanent jobs in the United States. But the job creation estimates for the Keystone Pipeline are that it will create literally a few thousand temporary construction jobs. They are not permanent jobs. There are only a handful of permanent jobs. So it isnt about creating jobs. and it is not about energy security in the United States. What is this all about? There is very little benefit compared to the risk factors in the United States. Let me talk about the risk factors which give most of us concern. The environmental risk factors have us the most concerned. Tar sand is a multitype of product that is literally mined and processed into a crude oil which is very thick and dirty. There are different ways to get to the tar sand. but one way to get to the tar sand is to take the topsoil off the property and mine it through a strip mining process. That has been done in Canada. and it is still being done in Canada. causing tremendous environmental damage. It is. in and of itself. a process that most of us would want to avoid. Yet this legislation does nothing to prevent that type of processing of the tar sands. Tar sands produce a very thick oil product that can only make its way through the pipeline by it being processed. and it creates additional risk factors because of the way it is processed. There have been oil spills of the tar sands product. We have seen it in Arkansas and we have seen it in Michigan. It caused devastating damage. It is not easy to clean up. It is not like normal crude. It causes permanenttype damage to a community. as we saw most recently in Michigan. So there are risks associated with taking Canadian oil in an effort to make it easier to reach the international marketplace. unlikely to end up in the United States. creating few permanent jobs. Frankly. a lot of us dont quite understand this. As I said. it is dirty. The use of this tar sands oil produces a much larger carbon footprint than other crude oil. causing additional problems in dealing with climate change. We have a serious issue with what is happening to our environment. I am proud to represent the State of Maryland. Most of the people in my State live in coastal areas. They know the consequences of global climate change. They understand it. They know what is happening along the coast. and they know we are at risk. They understand the fact that we have inhabitable islands in the Chesapeake Bay that have disappeared and are disappearing. They understand that our seafood crop. the blue crab. is threatened because the warming water affects the sea grass growth which is critically important for juvenile crabs to survive. They understand the risks and want us to be responsible in dealing with climate change. They also know that we are getting a lot more extreme weather in the east coast of the United States and throughout our country. They know on the west coast. They are getting dry spells and wildfires. They understand the risks. They understand the cost to America of not dealing with climate change issues. The costs involve not only direct damage that is caused but also in the global consequences of climate change. So we are worried about our carbon fingerprint. We are proud the United States is joining other countries in dealing with climate issues. I applaud the work of President Obama. in the most recent international meetings. when he dealt with climate change issues. We need to do a better job. Why are tar sands an issue? Because tar sands produce more carbon emissions than other types of oil. It is about 81 percent higher than the average use of crude oil and 17 percent higher than the welltowheels basis of producing oil. That is a concern. That translates into millions and millions of carsthe difference between that and having millions of cars on the roads. It is an important part of our leadership. If we are trying to establish international credibility and then we facilitate more of this dirty tar sands oil. what message does that send? What type of cooperation should we expect to receive? I am trying to figure out why this is the new priority of the leadership in the Senate. Why is this the very first bill to come to the floor of the Senate when. as I pointed out earlier. there seems to be no urgency. I have been told it has been delayed and delayed and delayed. The reason it was delayed is because the construction operating firm changed the routes of the pipeline. They had one route mapped outand no alternative routesbut didnt check to make sure it didnt violate State laws. Now they are wondering why it is taking so long. It is taking so long because they had to change the route. It is not the governmental process that is slowing this down. it is the fact that the proposers of this route did not have their ducks lined up in a row before they submitted the route that could be approved. We are still not sure about that. As I said earlier. for Congress to dictate where a pipeline should be is wrong. That is not our role. We should let the regulatory process. which is there to protect the public. go forward. It would also trample on States rights. There are some serious legal challenges pending in State courts as to the actions of a Governor dealing with a location issue. That should be resolved by the courts. and we are pretty close to having that ruling. It is very unclear to me what impact this legislation would have on States rights as it is currently being litigated in the State court. Why are we doing that? The delays have been caused because of the way this pipeline was suggested. The regulatory process that would protect the public safety is moving forward. Considering oil and gasoline prices at the pump there is no urgency. There are serious environmental risk issues. I understand the State Department report has been mentioned frequently. Look at the State Department report and look at what it is saying about the price for oil. The per barrel price of oil was a lot higher when they did that report. Lower costs have a major impact on what we are talking about here. I urge my colleagues to let the process go forward. I thank the President for spelling out his concerns and his desire to let the regulatory process reach its conclusion. let the State court decision go forward as to what the State believes is the right thing to be done here. I believe all of that will give us a much better process than us trying to substitute our judgment for what should be done through a regulatory process. I am going to close by quoting from one of the individuals. Ben Gotschall. from Nebraska. who has been very active on this issue. He said: The Cowboy Indian Alliance shows our cooperation and our working together in mutual respect. That shared bond proves that we pipeline fighters are not just a few angry landowners holding out. or environmentalists pushing a narrow agenda. We are people from all walks of life and include people who have been here the longest and know the land best. I think that is pretty instructive. This is a broad coalition that is concerned about the actions that are being contemplated in the Senateactions that would overrule landowner rights. actions that would take away State rights. actions that would shortcut regulatory process. actions that help private companies directly without taking into account the regulatory protections that are provided under law. It seems rather unusual that this would be the very first issue where we could work together in a bipartisan way to expand opportunities for energy in the United States. Clean energy produces a lot more jobs. and we could be talking about incentives so we could have a larger production of clean energy in the United States. Democrats and Republicans would clearly work together to come up with ways we could have more efficient use of energy. Democrats and Republicans could clearly work together in that regard. There are so many areas where we could work together and show the American people that we understand their frustration with Congresss failure to deal with many of the issues in the last Congress. but instead it looks as though we are picking an issue that is more about special interest than it is one that will help deal with an energy problem in the United States and has the potential to broaden our environmental challenges in the United States. For all of those reasons. I hope my colleagues will reject this approach and let us go back and work together to find a common way to help us deal with our environment. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the issue we are going to be debating over the next 2 weeks in the United States is really a story about two gasoline stations. In July of 2008. the average price of gasoline in America was $4.11 a gallon. In January of 2015 in the United States of America the price is $2.21 a gallon. That is great for every driver across our country. and that is great for Americans who buy home heating oil. They are saving a lot of money this winter and the predictions are that it will continue throughout the rest of this year. That is great. However. it is not great for the oil companies. It is not great for the Canadians. It is not great for Wall Street. They are not happy with this incredible benefit that is now flowing to Americans all across our country who now have a gasoline station that has $2.21. on average. as to what people will pay. What does the Keystone XL Pipeline truly stand for? It truly stands for the Keystone \"export\" pipeline. That is right. What the Canadians want to do is to basically construct a straw through the United States of America. bring that straw down to Port Arthur. TX. which is a taxfree export zone. and then export the oil out of the United States. Why would they want to do that since they advertise that it is all about North American energy independence? There is a simple reason. The price of tar sands oil in Canada right now is getting $13 less per barrel than it would get in the United States. but it is $17 less than if they can get it into ships and send it around the world. That is the very simple economic strategy of the Canadians. How do I know this? Because during a hearing in the House of Representatives I asked the head of the pipeline for TransCanada: Would you accept an amendment to keep all of the oil here in the United States of America? He said: No. By the way. I asked the same question of the head of the American Petroleum Institute. He said: No. There is a lot of false advertising going on here. On one hand they say this is great for American energy independence. On the other hand. when we say lets have an amendment on the floor of the Senate that will keep the Keystone oil here in the United States. they say: Oh. no. They are absolutely opposed to that. Logically. we have to reach the conclusion that their goal is to get the extra $17 per barrel which they will get if they can start selling it to China. Latin America. and other parts of the world. That is the plan. There are no two ways about it. By the way. that should be their plan. That is what their responsibility isit is to the shareholders of their companies. What is the strategy for the American driver? That is whom we have a responsibility to. We need to make sure they get the lowest possible price. My goodness. They have been tipped upside down and had their money shaken out of their pockets at gas stations all across our country for years. and finally the day of deliverance has arrived and they have $2.21. on average. for the price of a gallon of gas. and now we are told the price of oil is too low. We have to get it back up again. Of course. the best way of accomplishing that is to start exporting oil because the less there is in North America. the higher the price will be for American drivers and for American home heating oil consumers. It is a very simple plan. It is not about helping Americans at the pump. It is about pumping up the prices so oil companies will have new profits. It is very simple. If it is not that. then just accept an amendment that keeps all the oil here. It is a simple thing to do. and then the rhetoric matches with the reality of what is going to happen. The oil should stay here. but they will not accept that. and they have made that clear. This is all part of a wish list we are going to see on the Senate floor for the rest of this year. This is the Big Oil wish list of 2015. We start with the Keystone \"extra large export\" Pipeline to take oil and send it out of the country. Then they want to lift the ban on the exportation of U.S. crude oil. which is now on the booksa ban on U.S. crude oil. This is Canadian oil. There are no laws against that. Then they want to begin exporting our natural gas. even as consumers and businesses and natural gas vehicle firms are enjoying recordlow prices. which in turn is transforming the American manufacturing sector and our relationship with natural gas in America. They essentially want to declare war on the Environmental Protection Agency and their authority to protect Americans against pollution and to make sure the fuel economy standards of the vehicles which we drive continue to rise and rise. Honestly. if we want to tell OPEC we are serious and keep them awake at night. then we should keep the oil here so the prices will drop. and we also need to increase the fuel economy standards and consume and import less oil. But that is not going to be the agenda that comes out here on the Senate floor from the majority. It is going to be just the opposite. In a way. that is why this first debate is actually a preview of coming attractions of what will be happening out here on the floor of the Senate throughout the course of this entire year. There is kind of a Keystone kabuki theater that is debuting this afternoon on the Senate floor. The reality is this bill will never become law. The President is going to veto this bill. There are not enough votes to override the veto. So instead what we have is just a preview of this entire agenda. notwithstanding the fact that they are not going to be supporting a national renewable electricity standard or dramatically increasing the energy efficiency laws in our country or making sure the Canadians finally have to pay their taxes for the oil liability trust fund which they are now exempt from. American oil companies have to have a trust fundin the event there is an oil spill in the pipelinebut the Canadians dont have to have a trust fund. Over 10 years. that is $2 billion that American companies have to pay. which Canadians dont have to pay. to make sure that something is done to protect against oilspills. Back when the Democrats took over the House and Senate in 2007. we worked together to put together a comprehensive energy bill. What was in it? Dramatically increasing the fuel economy standards of the vehicles in our country. having a new biofuels law to expand that production. and making sure that energy efficiency in America was enhanced dramatically. We worked on a bipartisan basis. and President Bush. a Republican. signed that bill because it was done in a bipartisan. \"all of the above\" approach. That is not what this is all about. This is not \"all of the above\". this is \"oil above all.\" That is the strategy the Keystone Pipeline embodiesshouts. It is not balanced. It is not where we should be as a country. So I say lets have an amendment to the bill that keeps the oil here in the United States. Lets have this debate here on the floor. Lets match up the rhetoric of the oil stays here with protection of the American economy and the American driver within the reality that we voted for that to keep it here. Lets have that debate. I think it is important because otherwise the Canadians and the American Petroleum Institute will continue to engage in false advertising about where this oil is going to be used. So from my perspective. this is the dirtiest oil in the world that is going to contribute mightily to an expansion of global warming. We know that 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded in historynotwithstanding the fact that it snowed here in Washington. DC. yesterdaythe warmest year in history. That is what I think the green generation out there knows as they look at this issue. What are we going to do to make sure we avoid the catastrophic consequences of a dangerously warming planet? We have to engage in preventive care of this planet. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to engage in preventive care to make sure we do not pass on this everincreasing danger to future generations. We are going to get a chance here to debate this. The Keystone Pipeline is a good example of how there is not. in fact. a balanced policy. I asked for an amendment on the floor so that we can debate whether the oil goes through a pipeline from Canadathe dirtiest oil in the worldlike a straw. potentially causing environmental catastrophes across our country. and then gets exported around the rest of the planet.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the truth is that despite our rather big egos. much of what we do in the Senate is pretty quickly forgotten. People have a hard time remembering what we did 2 months ago or yesterday. let alone last year. But I have a feeling that the Keystone Pipeline bill we are now discussing and decisions that will be made about that bill will not soon be forgottennot by our children or our grandchildren and not by people throughout the world and. in fact. not by history. I believe that decades from now our kids and our grandchildren will scratch their heads and they will say: What world were these peopleMembers of Congressliving in in 2015 when they voted for this Keystone Pipeline? How did it happen that they did not listen to the overwhelming majority of scientists who told us we have to cut greenhouse gas emissions. not increase them? I think our kids and our grandchildren will be saying to us: Why did you do that to us? Why did you leave this planet less habitable than it could have been? The issue we are dealing with today is of huge consequence. I fear very much that a majority of the Members in the Senate and in the Congress are poised to make a very dangerous and wrong decision. In that light. I am more than delighted that President Obama has indicated he will veto this Keystone Pipeline bill if it is passed. Climate change is one of the great threats not only facing our country but facing the entire planet. It has the capability of causing severe harm to our economy. to our food supply. to access to water. and it raises all kinds of international national security issues. Let me read an excerpt from a letter sent to the Senate back in October 2009: Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring. and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are based on multiple independent lines of evidence. and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of the vast body of peerreviewed science. Moreover. there is strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad impacts on society. including the global economy and on the environment. For the United States. climate change impacts include sea level rise for coastal states. greater threats of extreme weather events. and increased risk of regional water scarcity. urban heat waves. western wildfires. and a disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The severity of climate change impacts is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades. This statement was signed by virtually every major scientific organization in this country. including the American Association for the Advancement of Science. the American Chemical Society. the American Geophysical Union. the American Institute of Biological Sciences. the American Meteorological Society. and many other scientific organizations. Scientists are not the only people warning us about the danger of climate change. Hear what the Department of Defense has to say about the impact of climate change on international and national security. What they point outand I think what every sensible person understandsis that when people are unable to grow the food they need because of drought. when flood destroys their homes. when people throughout the world are forced to struggle for limited natural resources in order to survive. this lays the groundwork for the migration of people and international conflict. That is what the Department of Defense tells us. Now. given all of the scientific evidence and given the concerns raised by our own Department of Defense and national security experts all over the world and given the fact that the most recent decadethe last 10 yearswas the Nations warmest on record. one would think that when the National Climate Assessment warns us that global warming could exceed 10 degrees Fahrenheit in the United States by the end of the centurycan we imagine this planet becoming 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and what this means to the planet? When sea levels have already risen by nearly 7 inches over the last century and are expected to rise another 10 inches to 2.6 feet by the end of the centurywhen all of that is on the table. one would think this Senate would be saying: All right. we have an international crisis. How do we reverse climate change? Instead. what the debate is about is how we transport some of the dirtiest oil in the world and thereby cause more carbon emissions into the atmosphere. I suspect our kids and our grandchildren will look back on this period and say: What world were you living in? Why did you do that to us? It would seem to me that what we should be debating here is how we impose a tax on carbon so that we can break our dependence on fossil fuel. That is what we should be discussing. not how we increase carbon emissions. We should be discussing what kind of legislation we bring forward that moves us aggressively toward energy efficiency. weatherization. and such sustainable energies as wind. solar. and geothermal. That is the kind of bill that should be on the floor. We should be having a debate about legislation that makes our transportation system far more efficient. that expands rail and helps us get cars and trucks off the road. We should be having a debate about how we can create the kind of automobiles that run on electricity and make them less expensive and how we can get cars running 80 to 100 miles per gallon. Those are the kinds of debates and that is the kind of legislation we should be having on the floor. not how do we expand the production and the transportation of some of the dirtiest oil on the planet. In my view. the U.S. Congress in a very profound way should not be in the business of rejecting science because when we reject science. we become the laughingstock of the world. How do we go forward? How do we prepare legislation if it is not based on scientific evidence? And to say to the overwhelming majority of scientists that we are ignoring what they are telling us and we are going to move in exactly the wrong direction I think makes us look like fools in front of the entire world. How do we go forward and tell China and India and Russia and countries around the world that climate change is a huge planetary crisis at the same time as we are facilitating the construction of the Keystone Pipeline? So I am delighted the President will veto this legislation if it happens to pass the Congress. Our job now is not to bring more carbon into the atmosphere. it is to transform our energy system away from coal. away from oil. away from fossil fuel. and toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy. That should be the direction of this country. and we should lead the world in moving in that direction. With that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. in his first legislative message to the 89th Congress in 1965. 50 years ago I believe this month. President Johnson laid out what would become a key marker in the legislative fight for Medicare and Medicaid. Ultimately. the bill was passed in July 1965. President Johnson signed it in Independence. MO. I believe at the home of former President Truman. President Johnson. in his legislative message to the House and Senate in 1965 said: In this century. medical scientists have done much to improve human health and prolong human life. Yet as these advances come. vital segments of our population are being left behind behind barriers of age. economics. geography or community resources. Today. the political community is challenged to help all our people surmount these needless barriers to the enjoyment of the promise and reality of better health. Fifty years later we have made historic improvements to our health care system. thanks in large part to a couple of things: No. 1. medical research. funded both by taxpayers and often by drug companies. foundations. universities. and others. and No. 2. because of social insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Before the passage of Medicarelisten to these numbers0 percent of our Nations seniors lived below the poverty line. only half our Nations seniorsat this time 50 years ago. early in 1965. had health insurance. and insurance usually only covered visits to the hospital in those days. Now. thanks to Medicare. 54 million seniors and people with disabilities have access to guaranteed health care benefits. Let me share a letter a constituent named Donald. from Toledo. OH. wrote to me last Congress. when the House of Representatives threatened to turn Medicare into a voucher program as part of its budget proposal. Donald wrote: Thank you for your efforts to keep Medicare from being privatized. At the age of 63. I am going to be eligible for Medicare before too long and looking at the affordability of health care is critical. If Medicare is privatized. we will not be able to afford it any more than we can afford private insurance today. That is the whole point. The reason there is a government health care program. the reason there is social insurance. is because people. as in 1965. only half the people in the country had any kind of health insurance. It is a little disconcerting to know that after working all our lives and living comfortably. that in our retirement years we will either have to try to find fulltime employment to be in a position of affording Medicare. privatized Medicare. I am sure I dont need to tell you how difficult finding a job is these days when you are an older citizen. I know normally I am writing you from the opposing side. but this time we definitely see eye to eye. Ralph Waldo Emerson. 150 or 160 years ago. said that history has always been a fight between conservators and innovators. There is a legitimate place in society for both. creating the tension that moves our country one way or the other. Conservators want to protect the status quo. They want to preserve privilege and want to hold on to their wealth. Conservators fundamentally dont believe the government should be involved in ensuring a decent standard of living. Innovatorswhat we might call today progressivesunderstand our society is only as strong as its most vulnerable members. If we go back to the key congressional votesthe key congressional votes. not necessarily final passageto advance debate of a Medicare bill in 1965. most Republicans voted no. Then it was the John Birch Society that opposed it. Today. 50 years later. it is the tea party that opposes social insurance. Some of the most privileged interest groups in Washington opposed the creation of Medicare. But they were wrong. As I said earlier. 30 percent of seniors lived below the poverty line prior to Medicare. Medicare helped to cut the poverty rate in half by 1973. only 8 years after its passage. We see the same attacks today. Budgets proposed in the House of Representatives over the past several years have tried to dismantle Medicare. by and large by privatized vouchers. to help offset the cost of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. They would privatize the program and undermine its guaranteed benefits. Ohios seniors have worked hard. they have paid into Medicare. and they deserve a program that truly meets their health care needs. They deserve better than the underfunded voucher that would put them at the mercy of the private insurance industry. Thankfully. we have been able to block this plan in the Senate. We will continue to do that. Interestingly. the Affordable Care Act has provided significantly enhanced benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. In my State alone more than 1 million Ohio seniors have gotten freemeaning no copay. no deductiblepreventive care benefits under the Affordable Care Act. If you are on Medicare and your doctor prescribes an annual physical or asks that you be given an osteoporosis screening. a diabetes screeningall the things doctors order for their patients for preventive carethose are provided under the Affordable Care Act and under Medicare. no copays. no deductible. Many of the efforts to privatize and voucherize Medicare mean taking away preventive care. taking away prescription drug protections added to Medicare under the Affordable Care Act. Others want to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. I was in Youngstown. OH. a couple of years ago at a townhall. A woman stood up and said: I hold two jobs. and I am barely making it. I think the two jobs were close to minimum wage. so she was probably making $8 an hour in one and $8.50 in the other. She was a home care worker and doing something else. She had tears in her eyes. She said: I am 63 years old. I need to stay alive until I can get health insurance. This was maybe 5 years before we passed the health care law. Imagine being 63 years old and your goal in life is just to find a way to stay alive so you can have health insurance. Some geniuses in the House and maybe in the Senate think it is a good idea to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. Just because we dress like this and have jobs that arent all that physical other than walking back and forth from our offices to the floor. just because we have this kind of lifestyle and just because we are privileged enough to get to dress like this and get paid well and get to do these incredibly privileged jobs as Members of the Senatethere are a whole lot of people in this country whose bodies wont last until they are 67. They cant work until they are 67 to get Medicare. They are working at Walmart. standing on floors all day. they are home care workers. they are working at fast food restaurants. they are construction workers. Both my wifes parents died before the age of 70 in large part because of the work they did. the kind of heavy. strenuous work. and the chemicals they were exposed to and all that. So when I hear my colleagues propose to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67and I know they say we cant sustain these entitlements. whatever that means. What they really want to do is raise the eligibility age. To raise the eligibility age for Medicare to 67. they need to take Abraham Lincolns advice. His staff wanted him to stay in the White House and win the war. free the slaves. and preserve the Union. President Lincoln said: No. I need to go out and get my public opinion bath. What did he mean by that? He meant: I have to go out and talk to people. So when I hear Senators say they want to raise the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67whether they are in Gallipolis or Troy or Zanesville. OHwhen I hear people say they want to raise the retirement age or the Medicare eligibility agewhat I think when I hear Senators say that is they are not out talking to real people. We know we can do a number of things to improve and strengthen these programs so future generations can continue to move into retirement years with a sense of security. Last Congress I was an original cosponsor of the Medicare Protection Act. which would make it difficult for Congress to make changes that would reduce or eliminate guaranteed benefits or restrict eligibility criteria for Medicare beneficiaries. With several of my Senate colleagues. I will submit a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. a reminder that these programs must be protected. not weakened. not rolled back. not undercut. not privatized. not voucherizedif that is a worda reminder that all these programs must be strengthened. As we move forward in protecting social insurance. we should remember President Johnsons words when speaking to the House and the Senate 50 years ago: Whatever we aspire to do together. our success in those enterprisesand our enjoyment of the fruits that resultwill rest finally upon the health of our people.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think it is important to understand that TRIA is legislation that we need. which is the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. We passed a bill with only two or three \"no\" votes in the Senate last year. But what the House of Representatives has done looks like what they will probably do in the future: They have taken legislation which is really important to the country. which passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis. and they have loaded on to that legislation extraneous provisions. Frankly. that is what people in this country are tired ofwhen legislation that must pass and has overwhelming support is about to pass. special interest groups come and add their language to it. That is exactly what happened here. If the House of Representatives gets its way. if Wall Street gets its way. it is the first step to begin to slice away at the DoddFrank legislation. When I hear a number of my colleagues in this body and down the hall in the House of Representatives say they support progrowth policies and deregulation. what they are saying is they want to roll back the protections for consumers in DoddFrank. the Wall Street reform bill. and they want to weaken the provisions in the rules that govern Wall Street behavior. I dont quite understand it because what I do understand is less than a decade ago. because of Wall Street greed. because of Wall Street overreach. because this body and the body down the hall weakened the rules on Wall Street. and because the previous administration appointed regulators who would really look the other way. we had terrible damage done to our economy. About a mile north of the ZIP Code I live in in Cleveland had the highest number of foreclosures of any ZIP Code in the United States of America because of deregulation. because of Bush appointees to many of the bank regulatory bodies. So I caution my colleagues. as we accept this legislation. the TRIA legislationand I assume we willto understand that is not going to be behavior that we are going to sanction in the Senate. where they take mustpass legislation and they find ways to attach to this legislation rollback of consumer protections and weakening of Wall Street rules. That is what got us into this. We cant let these special interests who have so much power in the House of Representatives. who have so much influence in the House of Representativeswe cant let them have their way on legislation like this. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to highlight a Presidential message that was delivered to the Congress 50 years ago today. But before I go into the importance of Medicare and Medicaidfacts that I think all my colleagues and I can agree toI would like to take a brief look back at where America has been and recall what life was like for so many of those who were poor. disabled. vulnerable. and uninsured or unlucky before these programs. which today are a lifeline. Medicare and Medicaid. were in place. Those were the days of the \"poor farm\" and the \"almshouse.\" These were the places where the poor and uninsured would go for care. very often on the outskirts of townout of sight. out of mind. It was not a happy choice. and more often than not for seniors and the poor it was the only choice. These were places that provided care and was often very basic and very often it carried a stigma. The accommodations were sparse at best. In return for health care and housing. residents were expected to work on an adjoining farm or do housework or other chores to offset the costs of their stay. This was the primary option for someone whose extended family could not offer careor didnt want to offer care. This was not thousands of miles away from the shores of our country. it was right here in the United States. Not very many Americans remember those days. In fact. I think it is fair to say hardly anybody under 50 remembers those days. President Johnson submitted his message to the Congress 50 years ago today. and fewer than half of Americas older people even had any health insurance. In that era. it was not uncommon for older people who got an illness to be treated like secondclass citizens. and many older people without family to care for them and no health care coverage ended up destitute and would often end up on our streets. It was a time no one wants to revisit. It is a time sociologists described as another Americawhere 40 to 50 million Americans were poor and lacked adequate medical care and were socially invisible to a majority of the population. I bring this up because I wish to spend a few minutes this evening talking about how far America has come. I want to make sure that we in the Congressas we look to this anniversary of these critical programs. Medicare and Medicaid. and the vivid difference they made in the daily lives of Americans. we should all spend just a few minutes talking about the health care advances we have seen over the years. Here are a couple of facts: Today with rocksolid essential medical services. 54 million Americansor virtually every senior and those with disabilitiesnow has access to what we calland I remember this from my days as director of the Gray Panthersthe Medicare guarantee. It is a guarantee of secure Medicare benefits for our old people. Medicaid has made a critical difference for 68 million of the Nations most vulnerable. including more than 32 million kids. 6 million seniors. and 10 million individuals with disabilities. Because Medicare and Medicaid made health care possible for millions of people. they have also been the catalyst for innovation in treatment that benefits people of all ages. I emphasize that fact because it is often not appreciated that Medicare. as the flagship Federal health care program. often is the spark. the catalyst for innovations that get copied in the private sector. For example. in the first 30 years of Medicare alone. the Medicare Program helped to reduce deaths from heart disease by onethird for people over age 65. By providing coverage and access for millions. these programs became catalysts for change in how medicine is practiced and paid for Americans across the age spectrum and helped us to find the root causes of disease and perfecting better therapies to treat. As time has marched on. these programs evolved and improved and the rest of the health care system followed. In 1967. Early and Periodic Screening. Diagnostic. and Treatment programs. comprehensive services for all Medicaid youngsters under age 21. was created. and that has helped to improve our countrys health. starting with our children. In 1981. home and communitybased waivers were established so States could provide services in a community setting. allowing individuals to remain in their home for as long as possible. Every State uses this option to facilitate better care and services to the Medicaid population. and I think it is fair to say that every single seniorand this is something I heard again and again and again in the those Gray Panthers dayswould say: Why cant we have the option to have good. quality. affordable care at home because it will also save money compared to the alternative. which is institutional care. In 1983. Medicare took one of many big leaps away from feeforservice with the advent of a new reimbursement system for hospitals. It was called prospective paymenta system that pays hospitals based on a patients illness and how serious it is and not solely on how much it costs to treat them. This was a radical change at the time. Today it is commonplace and acceptable. In 2003. the prescription drug coverage benefit was added to Medicare. providing access to necessary medications to those most likely to need them. As a result of greater access to prescription drugs. senior health has dramatically improved. In 2010. as a result of health care reform. preventive services became free to patients. prescription drugs became cheaper for beneficiaries who fell into what was known as the doughnut hole. and again Medicare moved further away from feeforservice. volumedriven care and on to paying for quality and value. Not only was that good for seniors. it was good for taxpayers because it helped to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund. Finally. in 2012. the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began releasing for the public to use actual claims data. Access to this information. in my view. is a key element of the challenge with respect to understanding the costs of care. the variations and the way medicine is practiced across the country. Clearly. access to Medicare claims data is part of the path to improving quality and holding down the costs of health care in our country. These examples are easy to forgetthe most recent onesbecause now they are commonplace. but that makes them no less remarkable. I will close with one last point that I hope will be part of what guides the work of the Senate in this session. I see the distinguished Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. He is to be joined by the majority leader. Senator MCCONNELL. shortly. I will just close my remarks with respect to these critical programs by pointing outand I hope it will be remembered frequently as big issues are tackled in this CongressMedicare and Medicaid were bipartisan efforts. and the enactment of these programs shows that the Congress can craft bipartisan solutions to complex and politically difficult problems. That is what happened in 1965 when the Senate passed a legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid by a 68to32 vote after the House approved it 3 months earlier on a 313to115 vote. As this Congress gets underway. and as the leaders come to the floor to discuss a critical aspect of how we move ahead. I hope all of us take a page from that particular playbook. Let us recognize that with Medicare and Medicaid there was an opportunity to come together to tackle a big issue. and my hope is that this Congress will not use partisan tactics when the solutions have to be bipartisan. and that is the lesson. Despite sharp differences and partisanship. the Congress of the days I have been speaking of was able to rise above the culture and those challenges to find agreement and make our country a better place. As this new Congress begins. I hope we can use that 50yearold spirit to strengthen. protect. and improve Medicare and Medicaid to keep that guarantee strong. ensure health care to those who need it most. and protect a program that has been a lifeline to millions of Americans. With that. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I commend my colleague from Oregon for reminding us of this 50th anniversary of President Johnsons recommendation to Congress to create Medicare and Medicaid. Today. as we witness 54 million people benefitting in America from Medicarein my State some 2 millionand 68 million from Medicaidin my State 3 millionwe understand the importance of this program. Almost half the people who live in Illinois are covered with health insurance by Medicare and Medicaid. When we add in the Affordable Care Act. we have literally half the population of my State. It is a testament to the fact that when we made a commitment and followed through on a bipartisan basis. as the Senator from Oregon said. we created programs that had vibrancy and really served people for a long time. I read something the Senator from Oregon is. I am sure aware. of. which is that because Medicare was a complete Federal payout. it was implemented throughout the United States almost within a year. It took 17 years for every State to join the Medicaid Program. It wasnt until 1982 that the last State joined into MedicaidArizonabecause there was a State contribution. Look at the experience we have now with the Affordable Care Act. where some States are reluctant to join in. So that is part of it. The point I wish to get to and which the Senator made so well is how it changed life for senior citizens and for those who were poor. It gave them a chance for quality health care that didnt bankrupt them in the process. Medicaid has been a dramatic success. For critics of government health programs and critics of Medicaid. the 2011 survey found that 70 percent of physicians across America accept Medicaid patients. People would believe from some of the critics that the opposite is true. Seventy percent accept Medicaid patients. So it is a good program. The reimbursement attracts 70 percent of physicians willing to treat them. The last point I will make to the Senator from Oregon particularly. if he happens to know a good bookstore. I would suggest he consider the new book by Dr. Gawande entitled \"Being Mortal.\" I am virtually through it. and he really challenges us to look beyond health care for the elderly to where they are living. how they are living. and how they are being treated. So I am hoping we can rise to another level of conversation beyond Medicare and Medicaid. celebrating this anniversary but accepting a new responsibility to that generation of seniors who served America so well. I thank the Senator from Oregon for reminding us of this anniversary. I am proud to stand with my colleague Senator WYDEN today in support of his resolution honoring President Johnsons commitment to creating the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. Fifty years ago today. President Lyndon Johnson sent a message to the Congress which he titled \"Advancing the Nations Health.\" In that message the Johnson quoted President Thomas Jefferson who in 1787 wrote. \"without health there is no happiness. An attention to health. then. should take the place of every other object.\" Those words were true then. true in 1965. and true now. President Johnson was concerned about the health of our nation because of the staggering effect that no insurance and chronic disease had on the elderly. At that time. 80 percent of people over 65 were disabled or lived with a chronic disease. Unfortunately. 50 percent of people over 65 did not have health insurance. From his concern and effort came the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Both programs created a social safety net that has improved the lives of millions of Americans. Today more than 54 million people are enrolled in Medicare. 2 million in Illinois. The vast majority of Medicare enrollees are seniors. They receive quality. affordable. care and access to prescription drugs because of the President Johnsons commitment. In this new Congress. we should work together to ensure this highly successful program remains in place for future generations. Medicaid has been a lifeline for millions of people. especially for children. Sixtyeight million people are enrolled in Medicaid. 3 million in Illinois. And thanks to the Affordable Care Act. 600.000 became newly eligible for the program last year. Medicaid makes it possible for more than half of the babies born in Illinois to be delivered with medical care. Some argue that Medicaid isnt working because physicians refuse to see people in the program. But the data says that isnt true. 2011 data shows that 70 percent of officebased physicians nationwide were willing to see new Medicaid patients. I call that a success. As we remember President Johnsons tireless effort today. we should also keep in mind our commitment to these vital programs and work together to strengthen them.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to speak about the 50th anniversary of Medicare as well. I commend the remarks of both the senior Senator from Oregon and the senior Senator from Illinois about this 50year anniversary since President Lyndon Johnson first sent his message to Congress that would later become both the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. As was referred to earlier. there are 100 million Americans benefiting. including over 4.8 million in my home State of Pennsylvania. when we consider both programs together. When President Johnson sent this message. he said: Our first concern must be to assure that the advance of medical knowledge leaves none behind. We canand we muststrive now to assure the availability of and accessibility to the best health care for all Americans. regardless of age or geography or economic status. So said President Johnson all those years ago. and how prescient he was and how knowledgeable he was as well to be thinking about the future and to be considering advances in technology and holding all of us to the highest possible standard when it came to health care for older Americans or health care for the poor and for children. We know that in the ensuing 50 years we have strived to make that vision of President Johnson a reality. first. of course. with Medicare and Medicaid. and then more recently-\" recently\" meaning the last 20 years or sowith the Childrens Health Insurance Program. known by the acronym CHIP. and then followed by. a number of years after that. the Affordable Care Act. which included an expansion of the Medicaid Program. providing coverage to millions more Americans. We know that when Medicaid was created in 1965. the U.S. Government put forth a promise to ensure that the most vulnerable members of society would have access to health care. Whether it is our children or whether it is frail. elderly members of our family living in nursing homes or individuals with disabilities. Medicaid ensures they have access to health care. So we have made great strides. Let me quote again from President Johnson: Poor families increasingly are forced to turn to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms and to overburdened city clinics as their only resource to meet their routine health care needs. Again. President Johnson was way ahead of his time in dealing with what was then a problem and still remains a problem but less so a problem because of Medicaid. This important lifelineMedicaidto health care. having been created 50 years ago. was strengthened in 2010 and helps ensure that millions of Americans have access to quality. comprehensive health care. We must continue to make sure that we guarantee Medicaid remains strong and provides such needed care to those in our society who often get overlooked. We must never forget that Medicaid is the program that many middleclass families and lower income older citizens who are on assistance and people with disabilities turn to when they need extended nursing home care. sometimes referred to as longterm care. So when it comes to longterm care for poorer families as well as longterm care for middleclass families. often millions of Americans are turning and have turned for their longterm care to Medicaid. and we should remember that. As we celebrate this 50th anniversary. lets always ensure that both Medicare and Medicaid remain strong programs that so many Americans can turn to. We must do our best to be true to Lyndon Johnsons vision \"that the advance of medical knowledge leaves none behind.\" It is a very important anniversary. and it is a good reminder about our obligations in the Senate to protect both Medicare and Medicaid. With that. I yield the floor.",

He was a tenacious competitor on the baseball diamond. the basketball court. and in the halls of the capitol in Albany. but it wasnt merely the abstract desire to win that drove him. The quest for justice and fairness in our country motivated him to act. and he used his pulpit as a public servant to push for a better world for all Americans. Throughout his career. he spoke powerfully to us about the value of equality. and the visionary words of his most famous speech. the Tale of Two Cities. still hold true today. decades later. Governor Cuomo was a brilliant and generous mentor. and I was honored that he took a risk and helped me when I was an untested Congressional candidate a decade ago. Whenever we met. he was always kind. thoughtful. and always generous. I know that Mario Cuomos most cherished title wasnt Governorit was husband and father. He took these roles as seriously as his governorship. and it is clear that he succeeded in both. He loved his wife and children. and he instilled in his sons and daughters an unwavering commitment to service.

    "speech": "Mr. President. for nearly a year now. Americans across the country have made their voices heard on the critical issue of how we protect an open Internet. Their message has been loud and clearthey want meaningful rules that protect the Internet as a platform for free expression and innovation. Consumers want to see the online space as we have always known it. as a place where the best ideas and services can reach users on merit rather than based on a financial relationship with a broadband provider. Last Congress I joined with my friend in the House. Representative DORIS MATSUI of California. to introduce bicameral legislation requiring the Federal Communications Commission. FCC. to ban \"paytoplay\" deals on the Internet. Today. I am pleased to once again join with her to reintroduce this important bill. When we originally introduced this legislation last June. nearly 300.000 Americans had commented on FCC Chairman Tom Wheelers open Internet proposal. That number alone would have been an impressive level of public engagement. Since that time. however. the number of public comments filed at the FCC has swelled to nearly 4 million. As the comments show. consumers are concerned that without meaningful rules the Internet will become a place where broadband providers charge tolls to websites or applications for them to reach end users. This would represent a fundamental departure from the way in which consumers and entrepreneurs interact with the Internet. A twotiered Internet based on ability to pay would harm the innovative and competitive environment we have all come to expect in the online world. Like an overwhelming number of the public. I have grave concerns that a paytoplay Internet would allow larger companies to squeeze out their competitors. stifling competition online. A small web company in Vermont that develops an idea to rival the largest Silicon Valley titans should not have to worry that its access to consumers could be blocked because its competitors have a paid arrangement with broadband providers. The next generation of Internet companies and retailers should have the same protections that allowed a company like the Vermont Country Store to become a thriving online success. Paytoplay arrangements would also harm consumers. who would not have the assurance that the service they are paying for will provide the speed that they want. Too many Americans currently lack real choice in broadband providers. particularly those in rural areas. A paytoplay Internet could result in whole swaths of the Internet becoming functionally inaccessible to the customers of certain Internet providers. This is not the Internet we know today. and the FCC or Congress must act to ensure that it does not come to pass. The Online Competition and Consumer Choice Act is straightforward. It requires the FCC to establish rules preventing providers from charging websites for priority access. It also requires rules to prevent providers from prioritizing their own affiliated content or services. These are simple rules to preserve the equal platform we know online today. This legislation should not be used by opponents of meaningful open Internet rules to undermine the FCCs important work to craft open Internet rules that will protect consumers and innovators. To the contrary. this bill sets out important policy positions that the FCC should adopt in its current consideration of open Internet rules. The FCC should not hesitate to act at its February meeting to ban these deals outright. The importance of an open Internet is an issue that resonates in homes and businesses across the country. I spent significant time last year listening to voices outside of Washington. particularly those of Vermonters. so that I could hear firsthand about the impact the Internet has had on small businesses and consumers. The Judiciary Committee held two hearings on this issue. including one in Vermont. where I heard exactly these kinds of stories. These are not people looking for a handout or special treatmentthese are entrepreneurs and consumers who simply want the Internet to remain an equalizing tool regardless of where you live or how deep your pockets are. There should be widespread agreement to prevent special deals that harm consumers and dampen online innovation. The FCC and Congress should rightly focus on this timely and significant issue to protect innovation and competition online. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Nepal Trade Preferences Act. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It grants dutyfree status to imports of Nepalese garments for a ten year period. I have been a friend of Nepal and the Nepalese people for over 25 years. I have witnessed its political struggle and sadly the deterioration of its readymade garment industry. The Nepal Trade Preferences Act bill will promote muchneeded economic development and contribute to lasting political stability in one of the worlds poorest countries. Allow me to go over some basic facts of everyday life in Nepal. Nepal has a per capita income of $730. Approximately 25 percent of the Nepals 24 million people live in poverty. The unemployment rate in Nepal stands at a staggering 47 percent. and most Nepalese live on $2 a day. The 2005 phaseout of the MicroFiber Arrangement. which established export quotas from developing nations. has deeply damaged Nepals apparel industry. Instead of continuing to import garments from Nepal. U.S. importers have shifted their orders to China. Bangladesh and other lowcost labor markets. In fact. the number of people employed by the Nepalese garment industry dropped from over 90.000 people to less than 5.000 today. textile and apparel exports from Nepal to the United States fell from approximately $95 million in 2005 to $45 million in 2013. and the number of garment factories plummeted from 212 to 30. Despite Nepals poverty and the nearcollapse of the garment industry. Nepalese garment imports are still subject to an average U.S. tariff of 11.7 percent and can be as high as 32 percent. In essence. we are unfairly taxing the imports of a highly impoverished country that cannot afford it. Taxing textile and apparel imports from Nepal. which constitute .01 percent of all U.S. imports. makes no sense. I would point out that U.S. tariffs on Nepalese garments stand in contrast to the policies of the European Union. Canada. and Australia. which all allow Nepalese garments into their markets duty free. It should come as no surprise. then. that while the U.S. share of Nepalese garment exports has fallen. the European Unions share has risen from 18.14 percent in 2006 to 46 percent in 2010. The purpose of the \"Nepal Trade Preferences Act\" is to ensure that we provide Nepal with the same trade preferences afforded to it by other developed countries. No more. no less. Humanitarian and development assistance programs should be critical components of our efforts to help Nepal. I was proud to support the Presidents budget request of $77 million for Nepal in fiscal year 2015. But assistance is no substitute for organic economic development. We should help the Nepalese people help themselves by reopening the U.S. market to a once thriving export industry. In the end. economic growth and prosperity can be best achieved when Nepal is given the chance to compete and grow in a free and open global marketplace. With this legislation. the United States can make a real difference now to help revitalize the garment industry in Nepal and promote economic growth and higher living standards. There is no doubt that Nepal has struggled to draft a new constitution and coalesce around a governing majority. While only Nepal can chart its political course. passing this measure would undoubtedly help regenerate Nepals stagnant economy. Let us show our solidarity with the people of Nepal by passing this commonsense measure. I urge my colleagues to support the Nepal Trade Preferences Act. By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself. Mr. BENNET. Mr. BURR. Mr. KING. Mr. ISAKSON. and Mr. BOOKER):",

    "speech": "The Senator from Colorado. MICHAEL BENNET. and I have been working for 1 year to make it easier for the 20 million American families who fill out the Federal application form each year in order to receive grants and loans for college. The piece of demonstrative evidence that Senator BENNET and I have been carrying around in Tennessee and Colorado is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA. This is the form that 20 million Americans fill out. It is familiar to many families as it has 108 questions. and it is important to them because about half of the American families who have students in college have a Federal grant or loan to help pay for college. The problem with the 108 questions is that they are generally unnecessary. Senator BENNET and I were at a Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. We heard four witnesses representing different perspectives in our country saying that we only need two questions to know whether we could make a Federal grant or loan to a student from Wisconsin who wanted to go to community college with roughly 95 percent accuracy. So today we are introducing legislation which is named the Federal Aid Simplification and Transparency. or FAST. Act. It will turn these 108 questions into twoone about the amount of family income and one about the size of family. It will free students and their families from the dreaded FAFSA. It will eliminate thousands of hours of busywork by guidance counselors. college administrators. parents. and accountants. I will use a specific example. On Friday I am going to Tennessee with President Obama. who has been attracted to our great State because we have become the first State to say to all of our high school graduates that community college is tuitionfree. How can we do that in Tennessee? Tuition at community colleges. like in some places in the country. is about $3.600 per year. and the Pell grant can pay up to $5.700. but on average needy students receive about $3.300. So for about half the students. there is only a small gap between the amount the Federal Pell grant pays and what tuition costs. Tennessee has committed to make up the difference. But here is the catch: The major obstacle to Tennesseans who want to take advantage of the new Tennessee Promise Program is the 108question form. The president of the community college in Memphis. Southwest Tennessee Community College. tells me he thinks he loses 1.500 students a semester because of the complexity of the form. They just dont fill it out. So it is a terrific example of how the Federal Government. with good intentions. has built up over the years an enormous amount of paperwork that is getting in the way of the single greatest need our State has. which is to have more of our students better trained. This will help the businesses that are attracted there offering good jobs will be able to hire people who are properly trained. In addition to that. our bill does the following things: It not only eliminates the 108 questions and replaces them with 2. it tells families the result earlier in the process. For example. if you have a daughter who is a junior in high school. now you will be able to go online and find outanswering two questionshow much money you are eligible for in grants and loans. Now you have to wait until the second semester of your senior year. The next thing it does is it streamlines the Federal grant and loan programs by combining two Federal programs into one Pell Grant Program and reduces the six different Federal loan programs into threeone undergraduate loan program. one graduate loan program. and one parent loan programresulting in more access for students. Fourth. it enables students to use a Pell grant in a manner that works for them. They can use it yearroundnow they cannot use it for three straight semestersor at their own pace. Next. it discourages overborrowing. Too many students borrow extra money they do not need to go to college. For example. under the Federal rules a student is entitled to borrow the same amount of money if they go full time as they are if they go half time. That makes no sense. It saddles students with debt they cannot pay back. Finally. it simplifies the repayment options. Now there are nine different ways to make repayments. We suggest two. Senators KING and BURR have their own bill. which they will be introducing today and talking about a little later. that streamlines repayment options. I have been delighted to work with Senator BENNET. I congratulate him. His background as the Denver school superintendent and as a father has made him a very effective advocate for this effort. We have listened to educators and parents in our own States. The bill has been out there now for more than half a year. We have attracted other sponsors. including Senator BOOKER and Senator ISAKSON. We hope other Senators will want to join us. Finally. I would say before going to Senator BENNET that as chairman of the Senate committee that handles educationthe Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committeewe are ready to move on this. As soon as we can finish our work on fixing No Child Left Behind. which we have been working on for 6 years and have held 24 hearings. In addition. almost all of the members of the current committee were there last year when we reported a billas soon as we can finish that work. we will be ready to move to reauthorize the Higher Education Act to deregulate higher education starting with the FAST Act and the legislation Senators KING and BURR have promoted. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his partnership on this. I salute him for his leadership.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am delighted to be on the floor today with. among others. Senator ALEXANDER. who has worked so hard on the bill we are talking about today. Through the Chair. I want to wish him well in his new role as chair of the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee on which I serve. He is quite right to have said this bill came to us as a result of testimony in front of that committee by a variety of witnesses but all of whom agreed that the current system is completely unwieldy. I would also like to thank the other cosponsorsSenators BURR. BOOKER. ISAKSON. and KINGfor joining the efforts and for being here today as well. I first became aware of this problem when I was superintendent of the Denver public schools. We had a couple who very generously donated $50 million for scholarships for kids who were graduating from the Denver public schools and who had applied to college. One of the things we learned in that process was how terrible the process was for filling out the financial aid forms for the Federal Government. That was a requirement we had for people to be able to be eligible for this scholarship. We literally had to put new rooms in our schools. in our high schools. and staff them with people in order to fill out these forms. Every year tens of thousands of students and parents in Colorado and millions more across the country fill out the FAFSA as part of the college application process. It is the gateway to financial aid. By some estimates. over 2 million people who are eligible for financial aid and Pell grants do not get it simply because of the complexity of the form. I ask unanimous consent to show some demonstrative evidence.",

    "speech": "Here is this years form. It is a different color than the one we had last year. This is the form a student has to fill out108 questions. This is the instruction manual that goes with the form. which is something in the neighborhood of 66 pages long. It is very tiny print. To be honest. the ridiculousness of this form would be funny if it were not for the lost time. money. and energy our country spends on it. Here are some of the examples of the questions families have to put up with on this form. Several times there are questions about income. We have been told by the witnesses we had that we only need two questions. There are a number of questions about income. investments. and assets. Each requires notes and instructions which are contained in here. Question 36: What was your and your spouses adjusted gross income for 2014? Question 37: Enter your and your spouses income tax for 2014. Question 39: How much did you earn from working in 2014? Question 40: How much did your spouse earn from working in 2014? It is ridiculous. The questions become even more complicated. Question 42: As of today. what is the net worth of your and your spouses investments. including real estate but dont including the home you live in? That is the kind of reaction we get all over the country when we talk about this at home. The instruction form here says. for question No. 43. the net worth of businesses and/or investments. Business or farm value includes the cur rent market value of land. buildings. machinery. equipment. inventory. et cetera. Do not include your primary farm. Do not include the net worth of a familyowned and controlled small business with more than 100 fulltime or fulltime equivalent employees. Just to make it really clear. in dark print. bolded print. it says: business/ farm value minus business/farm debt equals net worth of business. This is as complicated as any tax form. At a time when the demands of the global economy require us to have more college access. not less. it is a shame that this bureaucratic piling up of questions is making it harder and harder for people to go to college. So I think this is going to be great for our students. to get it down to a postcard that has two questions. The estimate is that the time saved by moving away from this existing form is the equivalent of 50.000 jobs that could be spent actually providing college guidance to young people who will now have the benefit of knowing. as Senator ALEXANDER said so eloquently. what financial aid they will be eligible for in their junior year before they apply to college rather than waiting until their senior year. until they have already been admitted to college. That makes no sense to the people we represent. and there is a reason for itit is because it makes no sense. My hope is that this is a bill we will be able to move this year. Again. I thank Senator ALEXANDER for his tremendous leadership.",

    "speech": "I wish to thank Senators BENNET and ALEXANDER for their work on this legislation. It is going to help our Nations students make better. smarter. and moreinformed decisions about higher education. Historically. the United States has been the leader globally in expanding college opportunity. We understand that an educated workforce is essential to our Nations economic competitiveness. Without highly skilled workers. America will not be able to compete in the global economy. The average price of a college degree in the United States is climbingabout $13.856. Please put that in perspective with our competitor nations. nations that are keeping the cost of college low. knowing that their longterm competitiveness as a country depends on the education of their children. nations such as the United Kingdom. where a college education costs less than half of ours. and Germany. where kids pay a mere $933. The average American student now is graduating from college with around $29.000 in loans. In New Jersey. that is up from an average of $27.000 in 2011 and $23.000 and change in 2010. This is unacceptable. Mounting debt is undermining not only the success of our individual young people in our country. but it is undermining the longterm competitiveness our Nation has in a global knowledgebased economy. That is one reason why it is important that we work to make the process of obtaining financial aid simpler and more straightforward. We saw the ridiculousness which Senator BENNET held up in the length of the form and the explanation document. Well. this has to change. This is something I recognized when I was mayor of the city of Newark. We had classes. Literally we called it. I think. Financial Aid University. where we brought experts in just to try to help students navigate all of that. We spent so many resources knowing that for our kids from Newark to be competitive. we had to help them navigate this labyrinth of challenging questions and documents that it takes perhaps a college degree or even more to figure out. When I first came to the Senate about 13 months ago. one of the first pieces of legislation I offered. having had that experience. was a way of simplifying these forms. There is an urgency here because the College Board estimates that 2.3 million students do not fill out the FAFSA form. the free application for financial aid. Because the form is a gateway to financial aid. having 2.3 million being deterred from actually filling it out is a harm to our Nation. not just to those individual students. Many students who qualify for Federal aid skip the form because they find itas we obviously sawtoo complex. Because eligibility is currently based on income information for the year immediately preceding enrollment. financial aid deadlines mean that tax data is not yet available. As a result. students must determine how to fill out financial aid questions on the FAFSA form and take additional steps then to submit later the tax documents. We know more can be done to make this process simpler and accessible. which is why I am pleased. I was really rejoicing when Senator ALEXANDER and Senator BENNET showed me there was a way we could workeven further than the legislation I introduced in the last Congressto reduce it to two questionssaving time. saving energy. saving stress but even more importantly empowering students to get their education and contribute to our economy so that we can compete with those other countries that seem to be doing a much better job than we are in keeping the cost of college low. This bill streamlines the financial aid system. simplifies the FAFSA form. discourages overborrowingwhich is a problemand. most importantly. gives students and families better information earlier in the process to enable them to make better decisions for them. This bill is a good step. This bill is a great step. I am looking forward to working with the higher education community as well as students and families in New Jersey on how we can be successful in simplifying this process. increasing access to college and boosting not only enrollment but the economic output of our citizenry. Again. I thank Senator ALEXANDER and Senator BENNET for their work and leadership. I am pleased to be with them in this effort. and I look forward to continuing the conversation this year.",

Having his support and advice on this bill will be a great advantage in helping it go from the Senate floor through the House to the Presidents desk and into law. In 2013 the Congress and President Obama made significant steps forward in improving the student loan programa $100 billion per year Federal program to help students go to college. That law created a marketbased. marketpricing system. and it had the effect in that year of reducing the rate for undergraduates. cutting it about in half. The two Senators who led that were the Senator from North Carolina. Mr. BURR. and the Senator from Maine. Mr. KING. Senator BURR and Senator KING have continued to work on student loans. making it easier for students to go to college. easier for them to pay their loans. and easier for them to pay them back. We are proud to have them as cosponsors. but they have their own legislation on student loan repayments. which I am pleased to cosponsor and which will be a top priority in the Senate HELP Committee as soon as we finish fixing No Child Left Behind.

    "speech": "I thank Senator ALEXANDER and Senator BENNET. and I thank them for what they propose in the FAST Act. As a parent who went through two kids going to college. when I was presented that form. I realized I wasnt capable of doing it. I remember a story still today of a dear colleague of mine in the House of Representativesmany know Sonny Bono. We asked Sonny one day: Why did you come to Congress? How did you get into politics? He said: Well. I became mayor of a city for one reasonbecause I opened a restaurant. When I went to get a sign permit. they gave me 50 pages to fill out. I didnt graduate from high school. but I figured out it was easier for me to run for mayor. win. and make the sign permit 1 page than it was for me to fill out 50 pages. That is how he got his start in politics. I might say. as a parent. to be able toon a post cardapply and know whether I was eligible for my childrens student aid would be a tremendous thing for all parents. Senator KING and I are on the floor to talk specifically about the Repay Act. As we have looked at student loans and as the government has become the primary loan component for student loans. what we have seen is that the consolidation of ones loans has dramatically increased in an incoherent way. Now. some might say that is exactly what government does. We say we are going to fix a problem. and we fix it in a way that you dont understand it. it is way too cumbersome. What we have tried to do is we have made an effort to provide more avenues for or options for children to choose or parents to choose how to pay back student loans. What we have done is we have made it as complicated as the form that Senator BENNET showed. which determines eligibility. Currently. the Federal Government offers 12 repayment options for students. Among these 12 options. students are offered a series of terms and conditions that often overlap amongst several other programs with very similar sounding names and stated benefits. The problem gets worse annually. The administration continues to do new regulations every time we see a problem. and those regulations then overlap with existing regulations on student loans to where individuals dont know exactly what their options arewhat Senator KING and I want to do. We will introduce. hopefully later today. the Repay Act. It provides two options that kids choose from: a fixedrate option for repayment and an incomebased option for repayment. We also realize that under the incomebased options that are out there today an individual who is married could file as marriedfiling an individual tax formand their household income isnt considered for the amount they are going to repay on a monthly basis. That is not how we designed it. We designed it so what their income capability was. their repayment would reflect it. In other words. we have people who are gaming the system today because their one spouse makes a lot of money and one spouse doesnt make much. and they pay a minimal amount of monthly student loan repayments. When they do that. they cheat the other students behind them because they take money out of the system that can be used for those individuals who desperately need it. The Repay Act streamlines a multitude of loan programs and creates a fixedbase and incomebased repayment. It does it by consolidating all incomebased repayment programs into one repayment program that caps borrowing at $57.500 for 20 years and limits to 25 years the repayment period for loans over $57.500. while ensuring the monthly payments rise at a reasonable rate based upon that annual income levelagain. the household income level. The benefit for students is they will up front have the knowledge they need of what they will expect to pay based upon the amount they borrow. We believe this will drive smarter borrowing decisions and will lead students to limit the amount of debt they take prior to going to school. Behavioral economists argue that when an individuals options are less complex and straightforward. individuals are more likely to make rational decisions. Senator KING and I believe the changes included in the Repay Act will promote those rational decisions that will ultimately lead to smarter borrowing that leads to repayment and ultimately healthier financial situations for our Nations graduates. Why are we here? It is because only 80 percent of our student loans are being repaid. That means 20 percent is in default. What we want to do is we want to see kids get a great education. We want to see the ability for that to be paid for. and we want that money to be repaid based upon their success in the marketplace. I believe this act will put us on that road to do it. Now. I dont want to pretend. and I dont think Senator KING will pretend. this isnt something that we crafted and created. This is the result of ideas that were put forward by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. the Lumina Foundation for Education. the Education Finance Council. the American Council on Education. the Young Invincibles. the Institute for College Access and Success. the New America Foundation. and many other groups. This is truly Congress. the Senate at its best. reaching out to organizations that do this day in and day out. just as I think the chairman did on the applicationcard student aid form. We have tried to search the best ideas. From that we have gleaned them and put them into the Repay Act. We will introduce this bill. I thank the chairman. It does complement very much the FAST Act. I thank my colleague. Senator KING. for his help on the introduction of this bill. I yield back.",

    "speech": "Economic development and jobs is what unites us in this body. That is what we all want. That is what everyone here is striving to achievejobs and opportunity for the people of this country. There are many factors that contribute to that. and we can discuss and debate all of them this year. I suspect that we will. There is infrastructure. tax policy. smart regulation. and regulatory reform. But the one about which there is very little dispute is education. The single greatest job creation and economic development act in the history of the United States was the GI bill. subsequent to World War II. which opened the doors of college and higher education. to millions of Americans and literally built the middle class in this country. Education is what it is all about and education is even more important now than it was then. There was a time in this country when you could graduate from high school and get a pretty good job in a mill. make good money. have two cars in the garage. and lead a successful life. That is much more difficult today. Even those jobs in those mills require more education. In my State of Maine we did a survey a few years ago that showed 70 percent of the jobs had people touching a computer every day. That is what takes an education. and to get an education takes access. I will share one rather chilling statistic in terms of the competitive nature of the 21st century. We are engaged in competition. We are engaged in competition with the entire world and they want our jobs. A little statistic is the top 8 percent of high school graduates in China are equal in number to all the high school graduates in the United States. Think about that for a minutethe top 8 percent in China are equal in number to all the high school graduates of the United States. We are going to have to work to compete. and the only way we are going to be able to do that is if we work smart. and the only way we are going to be able to work smart is with education and expanded opportunity and access to education. Higher education in the 21st century. I would submit. is more important than ever. There has been attention to this over the years by State governments. local governments. by parents. by students. and by the Federal Government. going back to the midst of the Civil War. when one of the great education bills of all time was passed. the land grant college system in 1864. Support for research at our great universities has been a Federal effort. Student loans have been a part of what we have tried to contribute to this system for many years. Then. of course. we have Pell grants. which have enabled millions of students to find opportunity in higher education. But. ironically. the very programs that are designed to increase access to higher education have. themselves. become inaccessible. Senator ALEXANDER and Senator BENNET made a dramatic showing today with these ridiculous forms. When you read the forms the conclusion is: I guess my kid isnt going to go to college. We have created a system where you need an accountant. a lawyer at your shoulder in order to fill out a form for financial aid. and the people who need it the most are the least likely to have the resources to bring those experts to bear on the process. Programs designed to promote access have themselves become inaccessible. So that is what today is all about. That is what our discussion is all about. It is about accessibility and simplification. Senators ALEXANDER and BENNET and BOOKER have brilliantly articulated the power of the idea behind the FAST Act: reduce the questions to just a few simple questions to get the necessary information. You dont need 80 pages of instructions to answer two questions. It will open the doors to literally millions of students whom we need. This isnt nice to have. this is need to have. This is an economic security and a national security question. We need these people. The current form is discouraging the very people we want: those who may or may not take the plunge into higher education. The simple fact is you shouldnt need an accountant to figure out whether you can get financial aid to go to college. The complementary bill Senator BURR and I are introducing today. along with Senator RUBIO and Senator WARNER. is called the Repay Act. The bill Senator ALEXANDER is speaking to is about accessibility and simplification on the front end. Our bill is accessibility and simplification on the back end. dealing with the issue of repayment. It basically reduces eight current optionsand I have a chart that would make Rube Goldberg blush in terms of the complexity of the current optionsto two. One is a 10year fixed repayment plan. which certain students can select if it makes sense for them. and the other is a variable incomedriven plan. As Senator BURR pointed out. the ideas for this bill came from across the spectrumfrom students. financial aid offices. financial aid administrators. Republicans. Democrats. and President Obama in his most recent budget. By the way. one of the groups Senator BURR mentioned is the Young Invincibles. I would like to be a Young Invincible. I would like to see where I can join that group because sometimes I dont exactly feel that way. But this is an idea I think is invincible because it just makes so much common sense. Borrowers can switch between the fixed payment and the variable payment depending upon their circumstances. but they never pay more than 15 percent of their disposable income. I think another important provision is if a borrower is totally and permanently disabled and the loan is forgiven. they do not have to pay tax on the loan that is forgiven. Under current law. they have to pay an income tax on the phantom income of the loan that is forgiven. I particularly thank Senators WARNER and RUBIO for joining us on this bill. They had their own bill on this repayment structure last year. and they have generously decided to join forces with us on this bill. and I believe that will add substantial weight to our work. They have already made contributions to the drafting of the bill. and I think that will help us considerably as we move forward with this legislation. Quite often around here we talk about things we cant dowe cant doproblems we cant fix. This is something we can do. This is a human problem of our making by layering programs over one another and having the bureaucratic rules build over the years to the point where. as I said. it has created an accessibility problem for the very program designed to give access. These are important bills. They are not necessarily the bills that are going to get the headlines or cause all the fights and the friction. but these are the quiet kinds of changes that will change our country. They will provide opportunity for our students. for our families. and for our country. I am proud to join Senator ALEXANDER. the chair of the HELP Committee. and Senator BURR particularly. who has worked so hard on this bill. I think we have a combination of bills that will make a difference in peoples lives and in the future of this country. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

I am hopeful we can bring it to the floor by the spring. give the full Senate a chance to consider it. combine it with action of the House and work with the President. just as we did in 2013. I am going to turn to Senator BENNET for just a minute to let him have a concluding word. but I wanted to say this. As I mentioned. President Obama is going to Tennessee on Friday. He is going to celebrate an initiative Tennessee has taken by itself to say to all high school graduates: Two years of community college education is tuition free. Of course. that is based upon the Pell grant. The State just makes up the difference. which isnt that much. I am going to have an opportunity to say to the President: Mr. President. the one thing the Federal Government can do to make it easier for more Tennesseans to take advantage of Tennessee Promise is to get rid of the FAFSA. Because the President of Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis says 1.500 students a semester are not enrolling in community college. who ought to be going. just because they and their families are intimidated by this form or cant fill it out. There is no excuse for that. and we are going to fix that. Maybe the solution is three questions. maybe it is four questions. but surely it is not 108 questions. and 70 or 80 pages of instructions. wasting the time of administrators. guidance counselors. parents. accountants. students. and discouraging Americans from taking advantage of education.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Governor Mario Cuomo. who passed away on January 1. 2015 at the age of 82. A highly respected public servant and brilliant orator. Mario Cuomo served as Governor of New York State for three terms. from 1983 to 1994. Governor Cuomo was born on June 15. 1932. in his beloved Borough of Queens. Hailing from a family of Italian immigrants. he worked in the familys grocery store in South Jamaica growing up. The governor graduated from St. Johns Preparatory School. and went on to play baseball on the freshman team at St. Johns University. An aggressive player. he showed great talent and promise. Indeed. he was signed as a prospect in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. earning a signing bonus E22 that exceeded that of a contemporary prospectMickey Mantlethat was later the subject of joking between the two men. Shortly after beginning to play for the Class D Brunswick Pirates in Georgia. the young future Governor Cuomo was struck in the head by a fastball. forcing his retirement from baseball. He then returned to St. Johns University. graduating in 1953. There he met his wife. a fellow student. Matilda Raffa Cuomo. Together they had five children: Andrew Cuomo. the current Governor of New York. Dr. Margaret I. Cuomo. Maria Cuomo Cole. Madeline Cuomo ODonohue and Christopher Cuomo. a journalist at CNN. and fourteen grandchildren. Upon graduation. Cuomo enrolled in St. Johns Law School on scholarship. where he graduated at the top of his class. Cuomo experienced success in his law career early on. often fighting on behalf of many bluecollar and middle class families like his own. His success did not go unnoticed. and in 1974 he was the Democratic Partys choice for Lieutenant Governor of New York. Although he lost the primary election. newly elected Governor Hugh Carey named him New Yorks Secretary of State. In 1978. Governor Carey asked Cuomo to be his running mate as Lieutenant Governor. and the pair won the election handily. In 1982. when Carey did not run for reelection. Cuomo sought and won the office of Governor of New York. In his inaugural speech. Cuomo called on the state government to be \"a positive source for good.\" espousing an energetic optimism and true belief in government. An elegant spokesman for liberal politics. his keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention is widely regarded as one of the finest political speeches of our time. Gov. Cuomo served proudly as New Yorks 52nd Governor for three terms. leading the state with a philosophy of \"progressive pragmatism\" that resulted in fiscal and ethics reforms for the state. and a broader economic reach for the state in the global marketplace. At his lead. New York became renowned for passing more \"first in the nation\" types of legislation than any other state. From automobile safety to education reforms to public safety. Mario Cuomos leadership. more than anyone elses. succeeded in ensuring New Yorks rightful place at the Empire State. On a personal level. I was always an admirer of Governor Mario Cuomo. from his first election right up until his unfortunate passing. Shortly after my initial election to Congress in 2004. I made an appointment to meet with Gov. Cuomo at his New York law office. Scheduled as I was for a brief meeting. I was surprised to spend nearly two hours in the Governors office. absorbing his advice and hearing of his many experiences in government and private life. To this day. to gain inspiration and to learn more about how to say what is on my mind. I consult many of Gov. Cuomos writings. His voice still teaches and his message still resonates all these many years later. Mr. Speaker. thank you for allowing me a few moments to honor the life of Governor Mario Cuomo. I ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the Cuomo family. and our most sincere gratitude for his dedication to creating a better state and nation.",

Herbert Harris. Herb died at the age of 88 on Christmas Eve at his home in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Fairfax County. He served three terms in the House from 1974 to 1980. representing what was then Virginias 8th District. Like his predecessor. Stan Parris. my predecessor. Tom Davis. and me. Herb served on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors prior to his election to Congress. and that experience served him well here. He was a champion for the region. helping secure the necessary federal funds to complete construction of the Metro system and to expand the Manassas National Battlefield Park. He stood out as an outspoken liberal at a time when most of Virginia. even Northern Virginia. was still largely conservative. During his tenure on the Fairfax County Board. he fought for community infrastructure investments. particularly for transportation and sewer system modernization. He also helped with Inova Health Systems expansion to Mount Vernon. It was during these years that he served on regional transportation boards. including the Metro Board of Directors. and became one of its chief regional advocates. Upon his election to Congress. he pushed to secure the necessary federal funds to complete the regional Metro system. and he was an early proponent for expanding the system further into Virginia to reach Dulles International Airport and other communities. A veteran of the Navy. Herb fought the Carter Administration on proposed cuts in national defense and military pay. And based on his experience in local government. he became an advocate for granting full voting representation in the House for the District of Columbia. After narrowly losing his bid for reelection in 1980 and then a rematch in 1982. Herb put his political career aside. telling one confidant that the time required by todays Members to raise campaign funds put too much emphasis on chasing money rather than exchanging ideas. He returned to private law practice after leaving the House. Our former colleagues. Representatives Moran. Davis. and Wolf collaborated in 2001 to name a new Post Office building in the Mount Vernon area to honor Herbs service.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I introduced legislation to prevent illegal immigrants from claiming the refundable portion of the child tax credit. The refundable child tax credit provides cash payment to lowincome families who pay no income tax. The program was intended to be an additional cash benefit for families who receive the earnedincome tax credit. While administered through the tax code. it is a meanstested welfare expenditure. Since Social Security numbers are issued only to those who have the legal right to work in the United States. illegal immigrants use Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN). which are issued by the IRS regardless of legal status. ITINs allow a person to file a tax return and thus claim the tax credit. The Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Certifying Agent Program. which allows a person to apply for an ITIN on behalf of an individual with no verification of their immigration status. has compounded the abuse of ITINs for fraudulent tax claims. With no verification of a persons status on their tax return or at the issuance of an ITIN. the system has a significant fault. which allows taxpayer dollars to go to those who are not eligible. The Treasury Departments Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has reported that illegal immigrants claimed $4.2 billion through this child tax credit in 2010. With the federal government borrowing heavily to finance deficits of nearly $1 trillion. we need to ensure federal benefits are only going to lawabiding citizens. We must take steps to solve this waste of taxpayer money by ending this gap in the tax code. If enacted. this legislation would require those claiming the tax credit to list their social security number or other proof of lawful immigration status on their tax return. It would also require the IRS to verify the proper documentation before issuing ITINs. The TIGTA has estimated this legislation would reduce federal spending by $8.4 billion over two years. At a time when the federal government is operating under significant deficits. we must ensure scarce taxpayer dollars are used responsibly. Allowing them to go to those who are in this country illegally is grossly irresponsible. This simple and common sense measure will ensure better accountability to all taxpayers. while also saving money. In short. this legislation will ensure this welfare program is only available to its intended recipients. ensuring those who follow the law can continue to receive this assistance. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation through Congress.",

For Ted. this year brings to a close four decades at the helm of TAP. His tremendous career has been dedicated to this organization and the goal of serving others in need. It has been a highlight of my service as the U.S. Representative for Virginias Sixth District to have worked with Ted to help preserve the community action mission set out by the organizations founder.

As TAPs Executive Director. Ted has been determined to not allow them to be forgotten and he has succeeded by providing methods of care that are a model for similar organizations around America that provide a hand up to a better life. In life. we are called on to adhere to the Golden Rule. which Ted clearly took to heart thanks in part to his roots in the ministry. The Roanoke Valley is forever thankful that Ted followed a calling.

Quarterback Bryce Morrison rushed for 175 yards and five touchdowns. running back Devyn Nelsen rushed for 289 yards and one touchdown. Before hoisting the championship trophy. Randolph had to overcome a large deficit. The team trailed 276 at halftime before scoring on all of their secondhalf possessions. including 28 consecutive points. In a game that featured two highpowered offenses and 89 total points. the defining moment was an outstanding defensive play. With less than 30 seconds remaining in the game. Bryce Morrison intercepted a pass to complete the comeback and secure Randolphs third straight state championship. Although football is a team game. I would like to recognize a few notable accomplishments by individual Randolph players. Bryce Morrison was named Section 6 Class D CoOffensive Player of the Year. In addition. Morrison. Devyn Nelsen.

I am looking forward to seeing you in the coming weeks. and my friends in North Carolina and South Carolina. too. When I am not here or in my district in Chicago. I have half a dozen events lined up over the next few weeks. and I am going to be going from town to town. State to State. talking with people about the Presidents immigration executive actions and what it means for them. their families. and their communities. In congregations and community centers and schools. and with local elected officials. I am going to be doing outreach to educate the community of immigrants and also to mobilize the multitude of allies at the State and local level who will help millions of our immigrant neighbors come forward and register with the government. I will not be alone in this effort. Next week I will be with the distinguished gentleman from Rhode Island. DAVID CICILLINE. and with his mayor in Providence holding an event to get people the information they need so they can get ready to sign up with the government. From Charlotte to Houston to Los Angeles. my colleagues here in the House are pulling together events to educate their own communities. and I hope to attend as many as I can. Evangelical congregations across the Nation. the Catholic Church. and my own archdiocese in Chicago are stepping up to organize and host events and begin laying the groundwork for millions of people who work and live and raise families in the U.S. to come forward and pay to be temporarily spared from deportation. Labor unions. corporations. small businesses that want to help families remain together. hey. they are preparing. too. and mayors. lots of mayors across the country. Apparently when Mayor Rahm Emanuel from the city of Chicago steps forward to say he will help facilitate the enrollment of families and individuals with the Federal Government. other mayors say. \"Me. too.\" and good for them. We can all help by playing a role in implementing the immigration executive actions taken by the President that will help millions of people. Congress refuses to pass laws that channel people into legal immigration with visas. and Congress refuses to address millions of people who have lived and worked here for a decade or more. and they refuse to address any meaningful enforcement like EVerify or at the borders and ports of entry because they would rather play politics and play to the talk radio audience. But at the White House and on our side of the aisle. we are actually taking steps on immigration that will address the anxieties of the talk radio audience and not just inflame their frustration with the current mess. Remember. not doing anything. the Republican strategy. that is amnesty. We are going to make sure that millions of American citizens can live with their family members and that we not place American citizen children in foster care by the thousands because we are deporting their parents. We are going to make sure that more of the employment and tax base of the country is on the books. working legitimately for employers who have to follow the rules. and that employers will not get to pick between a legal job market and an illegal one that is not protected by labor laws. wage protection. safety regulations. and. yes. tax compliance. We are getting accurate information out to people to tell them that what the President announced is not immigration reform. it is not a permanent but a small step in the right direction within the confines of current law. As I said during the last Congressand I am repeating it again todayI will work with anyone in either party who has a legitimate idea on how to make our immigration system more secure. more legal. more orderly. Most of my fellow lawmakers in this body support legal immigration. and to make progress we need to break with the group opposing legal immigration. We need a modern visa system that takes America beyond the current system crafted in the 1980s and 1990s. We need a modern enforcement with an electronic verification system that replaces a paperbased system of documentation. We need modern border security that works hand in hand with modern visa and enforcement systems so that we channel traffic through ports of entry where commodities. cargo. and people are inspected efficiently. More militarization. more deportation. and narrower legal immigration channels have not given us greater control over the immigration process and have led us to a number of problems. If you are serious about border security. legalization enforcement. legal immigration. then my door is always open. Tell me what you need to move forward. Do you need more fences? More high tech visas? More immigration judges? Tell me what it will take to get this Congress out of the current rut. In the meantime. I and a lot of my colleagues are going to be out there around the country protecting American families from destruction and protecting millions from deportation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the recent concessions by President Obama to the Castro regime mark a drastic departure from one of the most consistent tenets of United States foreign policy and traditional American values. and sets a dangerous precedent for other rogue regimes to emulate. The pardoning of convicted Cuban spies follows an illadvised exchange with the Taliban in which the rhetoric emerging from the White House to justify its actions has been unnervingly similar. As predicted. the course of policy by this administration on caving to terrorist demands makes the United States more vulnerable. We see those repercussions manifest themselves across the globe. Just recently. Venezuelas thug Nicolas Maduro jumped at the opportunity to request an exchange of a convicted criminal in the United States for the freedom of prodemocracy leader Leopoldo Lopez. whom Maduro has jailed in Venezuela. This is not the way to protect U.S. national security interests throughout the world. this is a way of putting them in jeopardy. When we equate unjustly imprisoned Americans to battlehardened terrorists or convicted spies. we set a dangerous precedent for the world to follow. The Cuban regime has already signaled strongly that it will not unclench its fist. despite recent developments. On December 30. just 13 days after President Obamas announcement. the Cuban regime arrested nearly 60 activists seeking to express themselves freelythis in addition to the arrest of more than 200 activists on Human Rights Dayha. that is richjust 7 days before the announcement normalizing relations. Yet the administration proudly and openly touts the promised but yet unproven release of 53 dissidents as a major breakthrough when in reality the net result will mean hundreds more in Castros gulags. Raul Castro will free 53 and arrest 60 more in the next months. This shows the failure of the administrations argument and proves that there is no intention by the Castros to move in the direction of reform or freedom. Instead. President Obama has created an atmosphere that emboldens the regime to continue its violent tactics with no concern about consequences from this White House. We must not forget that Cuba not only poses a threat to its people but also threatens us here at home. Cuba must remain a state sponsor of terrorism because it has not changed its terrorist ways. For example. in the year 2013 Cuba was caught helping another dangerous regime. North Korea. evade U.N. Security Council resolutions of sanctions by shipping arms and munitions to the Kim Jongun regime. At a time when many in Congress and even the White House are trying to punish the North Korean regime for its cyber attacks against the U.S.. we cannot forget that those rogue regimes helped North Korealike the one in Cuba. The Castro regime continues to thumb its nose at the U.S. by harboring fugitives such as New Jersey State trooper killer Joanne Chesimard. by harboring Puerto Rican terrorist William Guillermo Morales and bank robber Victor Gerena and many others who have fled U.S. justice for the shores of Cuba. These are just a few of the reasons. Mr. Speaker. why the administration must reexamine its relationship with Castro and impose strict sanctions against the thugs. not offer it concessions for all of these transgressions. Just like a zebra cannot change its stripes. the Castro regime cannot and will not change its antifreedom. terrorist ways. It is our duty to support democracy and be a voice for those 11 million Cubans oppressed throughout the island. By appeasing dictators. we have disappointed people all over the world who are struggling to achieve freedom. and the White House has betrayed core American values and principles: the respect for human rights and the right for people to choose their own destiny. As the first Cuban Americanborn Member of Congress who went from being a political refugee. fleeing the oppressive and brutal Castro regime. to a senior Member of this hallowed and cherished body. I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that the cause for freedom and democracy in Cuba is not forgotten. Until the oppressive yoke of tyranny installed by the Castro brothers has been lifted and the regime has been replaced by a representative democracy like the one we have here in our cherished Nation. I have a moral obligation to freedomloving people everywhere. and I will not ever forget that responsibility.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as we begin the new Congress. America sees the two parties in both the House and the Senate. along with the White House. making statements that establish positions that distinguish one from another. But what if we started not by defining our differences but with efforts that would bring us together? We ended the last Congress with the passage of the Paul Simon Water for the World Act. something I have worked on with my friend and partner from Texas. TED POE. for years here in the House. There was extraordinary bipartisan leadership demonstrated by Congressmen CHARLIE DENT. AARON SCHOCK. Senator DICK DURBIN. It did take 6 years. but this bipartisan effort for a humanitarian cause. especially benefiting women and girls around the globe. was worth the time and effort. The legislation focused and enhanced American efforts dealing with international water and sanitation. Today 152 million hours will be spent by women and girls traveling to get water. often dirty water. to meet the needs of their families in some of the poorest regions of the planet. This legislation created more focused American leadership. and it was backed up by unprecedented increases in American aid for water and sanitation. It will pay benefits for generations to come for millions. making friends for America while it allows children to live longer and makes the lives of women and girls more bearable. And we did it together. Are there other such candidates for legislation that will bring us together? Dr. PHIL ROE and I have been working on the Personalize Your Care Act with medical groups. advocacy organizations. experts in palliative care. hospitals. the community of faith. This is an effort to make sure that at the end of life for our loved ones. they actually get the treatment they want. not health care on autopilot. We have had tragic stories about how medical decisions by reflex and default have put people in isolated ICUs in painful and foreign settings when actually most of them. and in fact most of us. would rather be comfortable at home. surrounded by our loved ones. There has been a brilliant and exhaustive report by the Institute of Medicine that deals with the problems and concerns and how we can do better. Dr. Atul Gawandes bestselling book. \"Being Mortal.\" makes it clear that there are crying needs and simple. commonsense compassionate solutions. There is a revolution taking place in health care today. What if. as part of that revolution. Congress started the new year with our bipartisan legislation. the Personalize Your Care Act. to make sure those families understand their choices. that their choices are known. andmost importanttheir choices are respected? We had dozens of cosponsors and broad support across the medical establishment and the community of faith. Maybe we can pick up where we left off and have this legislation bring us together to protect our families and start the year on a united front. giving families the protection they want for the care they need. There is no reason we in Congress need to spin our wheels and shout at and past each other. Mr. Speaker. I could have made this same presentation not about the water and sanitation. but about how this Congress came together in the final hours to help save the lives of Afghans and Iraqis who are now at risk from the tender mercies of the Taliban and al Qaeda because they helped Americans as guides and interpreters when we needed them. These are some of my examples of bipartisan cooperation that are important which we have done in the past. I would invite my colleagues to share their agenda of bipartisan. low or nocost legislation that allows us to work together. It is not too late to start the year and this Congress right.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. a new Congress. but the sights are familiar: the same rhetoric with no regard for the truth. Ahead of another illadvised vote to approve the Keystone pipeline. the same myths are being spread pitting environmental protection against job creation. Winston Churchill once said: The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it. ignorance may deride it. but in the end. there it is. Let us separate myths from reality. It is time to decide: truth or scare. Approval of the Keystone pipeline will have very little impact in the way of job creation but a detrimental impact on the environment and hinder our promise of a clean energy future. That is the truth. My question is: Why are we ignoring these facts and voting once again to approve the Keystone pipeline. which would carry one of the dirtiest energy sources on the planet? Perhaps it has something to do with the many myths associated with this project. Pipeline proponents are quick to point to the creation of jobs as the primary reason for the projects approval. however. the facts dont match up. According to the only independent analysis by Cornell Universitys Global Labor Institute. these claims are not accurate. TransCanadas job claims are complete fabrications. The Cornell report concludes that Keystone will not be a major source of jobs. nor will it play any substantial role at all in putting Americans back to work. The State Department says Keystone would only create 35 permanent jobs and 1.950 construction jobs for 2 years. Most of those jobs created by this project will be nonlocal and temporary. In reality. we can and should be creating jobs by improving our existing infrastructure and investing in clean energy. education. and research. In fact. Keystone would make it much harder for the United States to invest in clean energy jobs and address global climate change. Our best bet at a clean energy economy lies far. far away from tar sands. That is the truth. Proponents of the pipeline claim that Keystone will bring down gas prices for Americans. but in reality. prices at Midwestern pumps could actually increase. According to its own documents. TransCanada expects the pipeline to increase gas prices in the Midwest up to 15 cents per gallon. Currently. a surplus of gas in the region means that our prices stay stable. If the pipeline is built. oil companies will be able to send their product to the gulf coast for export. which will reduce the surplus and drive up costs for Midwestern consumers. That is the truth. On top of all this. lets not forget TransCanada is the same company that operates the existing Keystone pipeline which spilled a dozen times in the first year of operation. The twelfth spill released 21.000 gallons of oil in North Dakota. contaminating the soil and water. Across the country. about 3.2 million gallons of oil spill from pipelines every year. These spills pose a great threat to American drinking water. especially when you consider the proposed project route would cross 1.073 surface water bodies and affect 383 acres of wetlands. Most Americans understand that oil spills in the past have had severe environmental impacts. but any Keystone spill would be truly catastrophic. That is the truth. In the end. Keystone brings a whole lot of environmental risk and very little reward. It is time we stopped perpetuating the myths. It is time we heed the warnings. It is time we decide: truth or scare.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in Mobiles Cooper Riverside Park. there stands a statue of Pierre Le Moyne dIberville. the French founder of Mobile. a statue which is identical to another statue located in Havana. Cuba. This statue is just one example of the robust ties between the city of Mobile. located in my Congressional district. and Cuba. These ties go all the way back to Spanish colonization in the 18th century. It is safe to say that I represent a district that stands to benefit from improved relationships with Cuba. In fact. the Port of Mobile is a straight shot to Cuba and could be an important economic hub. just as it was going back to the 18th century. Under the right circumstances. I would gladly support lifting the trade embargo with Cuba and improving diplomatic relations. Unfortunately. now is not that time. The economic benefits should not come at the cost of enabling a ruthless regime that is unwilling to change. Once again. the President seems to be more interested in a publicity stunt than in a substantive solution. The White House will tell you that this action is no different from previous efforts to improve relations with other communist countries like Vietnam or China. Here is the problem with that premise. In each of those cases. the President engaged with Congress in a serious conversation and debate about the best path forward. A plan was developed. serious concessions were agreed to. and each nation mutually benefited from these meaningful actions. Unfortunately. in the case of Cuba. President Obama has again decided to cut Congress out of the process and act alone with no real plan to accomplish his stated goal. This approach is the wrong way for our government to operate. and it has once again resulted in a bad deal. Columnist Charles Krauthammer put it best when he said: Do you know how to achieve a breakthrough in tough negotiations? Give everything away. Mr. Speaker. I cant help but ask what reforms Cuba will make as a result of this deal. Lets not forget that this is the same Cuba. under the same regime. who during the cold war had nuclear missiles on their soil aimed at the United States of America. This is the same Cuba that refuses to let the church operate freely. This is the same Cuba that worked with Venezuela and North Korea against the interests of the United States. This is the same Cuba that has been accused again and again of egregious human rights violations. Nothing has changed in those areas at all. and the Castro brothers are still in power. Now. there is a path forward for improved diplomatic relations and ending the trade embargo. The Castro regime must go. Political activity must be legalized. Public commitments to free and fair elections must be made. An independent judiciary must be established. Rights to free speech and freedom of the press must be guaranteed. Cuba must renounce the policy of being a staging area against the United States. Political prisoners must be freed. and the Cuban citizens must be treated with respect and dignity and be provided with the basic freedoms we often take for granted here in the U.S. Under those conditions and with a President willing to work with Congress. the embargo could be lifted and progress could truly begin. Mr. Speaker. I find myself once again coming to this floor to implore President Obama to abandon his illconceived. independent executive action and. instead. come to the Capitol. work with this Congress. share ideas. and collaborate. and together. we can make a real. positive impact on behalf of the American people.",

Alzheimers. you name it. but we have inadequately funded the NIH. It has not kept up with the level of inflation over the last decade. Based on that level of inflation. the funding we have given the NIH has resulted in a 10 percent diminution in funding on the purchasing power of the National Institutes of Health. The likelihood of any one of us dying from a terrorist attack or from some weapon fired from North Korea or Russia or Iran is very slim. but the odds of us suffering from the diseases which I have mentioned previously is likely in our loved ones. We need to fight those diseases. We can do it. and we can successfully come up with treatments and cures if we fund the National Institutes of Health. Supporting the NIH used to be a bipartisan commitment. especially seeing that every dollar invested results in about $2.21 in economic growth. I hope that this new American Congress will see that and that my Republican colleagues will agree with me that we need to put a focus on our individual capital. the personal capital of people. their health and their wellbeing. I talked to Representative MARINO recently. and he is going to join me in founding an NIH caucus. I think there is nothing more important. In the past. many times. when I have brought up funding for the NIH. friends on the other side have said: \"Well. we will have to pay for it. If we put more money in it. then our children and grandchildren will be paying for the debt for years to come.\" That may be true. but nevertheless. the children and the grandchildren will be receiving the benefits of the treatments and cures more likely than any of us will. for research takes a long time. We also need to change our course in stem cell research. We have had problems with allowing scientists to use this opportunity to come through with great medical breakthroughs. Federal funding is currently prohibited by the 1996 Dickey amendment to the appropriations bill that funds the NIH. but researchers around the world have dived headfirst into the field using stem cells and producing incredible findings and progress. In 2010. a gentleman named Darek Fidyka. a Polish man. was stabbed multiple times in a knife attack. and he was paralyzed from the chest down. but thanks to stem cell research in Poland. in collaboration with researchers and doctors there and in the United Kingdom. Darek can now walk again with the help of a walker. Dr. Geoff Raisman. the chair of neurological regeneration at University College Londons Institute of Neurology called this developmentand I agree with him-\"more impressive than man walking on the Moon.\" We allowed a man who couldnt walk. couldnt stand to walk. and more will come from that research on stem cells and other scientific research. Darek otherwise would have been paralyzed for life. and now he is walking again thanks to private investment in stem cell research. but the government needs to participate. Mr. Speaker. it is time for this Congress to adequately fund the National Institutes of Health. recognize its importance to our constituents who are important to us. and whose lives and health are the most important things that we can provide for them. It is time this country no longer turns a blind eye to research. and to stem cell research in particular. I urge my colleagues to seize the opportunities offered by this new Congress and join me in the efforts to fund the National Institutes of Health and to join the National Institutes of Health Caucus.",

We have all heard from small businesses and companies who have been forced to lay off workers due to the Presidents health care law. consequently slowing innovation that drives our Nation and slowing the pace at which that innovation can improve public health outcomes for all Americans. This week I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 160 that will repeal the medical Hl10 device tax.

And so my question and my inquiry is to the new. incoming Governor for the State of Texas. Governor Abbott. to find value in this medical facility because of its historic relationship. It once housed the only outside posttraumatic stress disorder center in Houston outside of the veterans hospital system. It was well attended by veterans who loved the idea of a center that was away from the massive hospital system. It serves people who are poor in the neighborhood and seniors. It has helped those who suffer from substance abuse. and I believe that it needs and desires and deserves a new start. I will be working with a variety of agencies to do that. and will not be ashamed that unfortunately tragic or. let me say. misbehavior of some caused this unfortunate turn in this hospital.

House Resolution 19 provides for the consideration of two important pieces of legislation to help the American economy. both of which passed in the 113th Congress with bipartisan support. H.R. 30. the Save American Workers Act. is designed to address a critical flaw in the Affordable Care Act which is causing workers to lose hours at their jobs and. thus. lose wagesthose wages that help put food on their tables. those wages that help feed their families. pay their utility bills. heat their homes during the winter. and cool their homes during the summer. H.R. 30 fixes this flaw by changing the newly created labor rule in the Affordable Care Act which defines fulltime work at 30 hours a week and places that definition back where the American public has believed it to be for the last 100 years. that is. at 40 hours. The second bill contained in todays rule is H.R. 3. the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. and that would put an end to what has been a 6year process for approving a pipeline that should have simply been common sense for Americas economy a long time ago. The rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate for each of the bills. This allows the House to fully debate these crucial issues. These bills are targeted pieces of legislation dealing with one single provision in the Affordable Care Act and one single pipeline. respectively. No one is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act today. For that. stay tuned. But I have no doubt that Members of the minority will claim that this bill is an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But. in fact. it simply makes changes to a definition and interpretation by the Department of Labor in the bill. As always. the minority is also afforded the customary motion to recommit on each of the bills. Madam Speaker. as a result of the Affordable Care Acts requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide health insurance coverage to those employees working 30 hours per week. employers across the Nationfrom schools to universities to municipalities to restaurantsare being forced to cut workers hours or face unsustainable employment costs to their businesses and to their organizations. As a result. we are seeingand this is what Republicans predicted prior to the controversial and contentious passage of the Affordable Care Actbut what we are seeing is the bill has fundamentally changed labor law in this country. creating a new. standard 30hour workweek. As a result. workers hours are being cut. and productivity in this countrya country that has always prided itself on the work ethic of its citizenswill decrease over time. This is what onerous government regulations dosuppress innovation and hamper businesses. Many Members of the Democratic Party have been outspoken in clamoring for an extension to longterm unemployment benefits. which would extend government assistance to all unemployed Americans well beyond a years worth of benefits. Yet there is something that can be done now. there is something that can be done today. which will have an actual. practical effect of putting more money in more peoples pockets. We have heard story after story from every State in the Union that employers are dropping workers hours from less than 39 hours a week to perhaps less than 29 hours or fewerpotentially 10 work hours a week that workers wont see in their paychecks. which could mean hundreds of dollars that men and women wont have to feed their families and pay their bills. Increasing workers hours increases money that people have to spend. The Affordable Care Act fundamentally changed labor law in this country. and the repercussions of this may not be felt for years to come. This is a dangerous. slippery slope. What other labor laws will be reinterpreted now to define \"fulltime employment\" as 30 hours per week? Do people intend to impose overtime rules on employers who employ people for over 30 hours per week? This is yet another regulation which would only result in businesses cutting more hours. What will the National Labor Relations Board reinterpret. knowing that the very fabric of labor law is now based on a 30hour workweek instead of the 100year standard of the 40hour workweek? Prior to the Affordable Care Act. employers were already overwhelmingly providing health insurance to their employees working 40 hours per week. Making the change contained in Mr. YOUNGS legislation will cause the least amount of disruption to the labor market. and that is an important thing. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Affordable Care Act will reduce the total number of hours worked. on net. by about 1.5 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024. almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor. Because of this. the Congressional Budget Office projects a decline in the number of workers of about 2 million in 2017. rising to 2.5 million in 2024. as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The latest Congressional Budget Office figures show that the Affordable Care Act will increase spending by almost $2 trillion. double the estimate from 5 years ago. And the Joint Committee on Taxation says that taxpayers will be on the hook for over another $1 trillion over the next decade. Americans earning as little as $25.000 annually will pay more because of the law. even after accounting for the $1 trillion in premium costsharing subsidies. H.R. 3. the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. is an issue that Congress and the American people have been supportive of for the past several years. It has now been over 6 years since TransCanada first submitted its application for a Presidential permit to cross the United StatesCanadian border with a pipeline bringing oil to refineries in Houston. Texas. The Presidents own State Department. in a several thousandpage document. stated that the pipeline would be cleaner and more environmentally friendly. It is a way to transport oil than other means. namely. with trucks. trains. and ships. This is common sense. The issue has been debated here in the House I dont know how many times over the past several years. Enough is enough. It is time to approve this application and put men and women to work who will be building this pipeline. Madam Speaker. let us be clear about what is happening today. We are not repealing the Affordable Care Act. We are not undermining the Affordable Care Act. The bill does not take health insurance from a single person in this country. It is a fix to a fatal flaw in the legislation. a fix similar to the seven other fixes that have passed both Houses of Congress and. in fact. been signed by the President. It is similar to the 37 unilateral fixes that the President and his Secretary of Health and Human Services have made on their own. This is a fix to stop this legislation from resulting in people losing work. If Democrats cant agree to fix a provision in the Affordable Care Act that is preventing people from working. then it is simply empty rhetoric to claim that they are interested in any fixes at all. I will encourage my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on the rule and \"yes\" on the underlying legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

It doesnt mean it will pass. but it means that Members have the opportunity to offer new ideas to improve legislation. Well. guess what? Guess what. Madam Speaker? This bill didnt have any hearing or markup in any of the committees of jurisdictionneither of them: Energy and Commerce. Natural Resources. Transportationall bypassed for this bill that then went directly to Rules Committee. And the Rules Committee said: By the way. nobody can change these bills that no committee has even looked at. So that is how we got to where we are today. That is the wrong process. A vote against this rule today is a vote for regular order. a vote for making sure that Members of this bodyDemocrats and Republicansboth on the committees of jurisdiction and in the general body can have their say on bills. That is why it is so important to defeat this very first rule here today. Because if this passes. it is very dangerous. It can become the precedent for all the bills this Congress. This starts with an innocuous bill. This is the 50thsomething repeal of ObamaCare. I dont know how many times the Keystone pipeline has been passed. So it seems innocuous. I am not for the policies. We will talk about them in a minute. Some people are. There is nothing new under the Earth here. We have seen these are in different forms. different versions. but they havent passed through committee. But the procedure here is saying: Guess what? No committee of jurisdiction can look at these bills. Rules Committee is not going to allow any amendments from Democrats or Republicans. If this rule passes. that has the danger of becoming the precedent for this entire Congress. The committees of jurisdiction will be avoided and overruled and gone around. and Members will have no opportunity to even offer their ideas here on the floor of the House to improve bills. Now. lets talk a little bit about the content of these two bills before us today. First. the socalled Save American Workers Act. Mr. BURGESS says that it changes labor law in this country. somehow defines fulltime workers and fulltime work. and that is simply not what it does. It simply addresses the benefits and whom companies will need to provide benefits to. And. frankly. if this bill were to be the law. a company could very easily say: By the way. Mr. or Ms. fulltime worker who works 40 hours a week. you now get off Friday at 4 oclock. Sorry. you are 39 hours a week. you dont get any health care. And they are going to do it. That is why some companies want this to pass. Most companies provide benefits to all their employees. and it is not an issue. But the folks that might be lobbying Members of Congress about it. of course that is their intention. They want to cut people from 40 hours a week to 39 hours a week and not give them health care benefits. Ask them questions. Democrats or Republicans. If you are thinking of voting for this. ask them why they want it. That is why. of course. they want this bill. Right now. they would have to cut them all the way down to 30 hours. which is a much more complicated endeavor. because they probably would have to add new employees and have to manage that from an HR perspective. It is probably just worth it to let people continue working 40 hours and give them their benefits. But if this very dangerous provision were to become law. many. many Americans would find themselves cut from 40 to 39 hours. 391/2 hours. go home at 4:30 on Friday. Sorry. no health care. Sorry. no health care. Now. look. if there is a real discussion about how to improve health care in this country. Democrats and Republicans. we are happy to be part of that. Lets talk about what health care should look like. When we have an idea to change something. to remove part of the Affordable Care Act. lets talk about what replaces it. This is simply a bad idea. It is a disincentive for companies to even provide health care to their employees. Not only that. it is a deficit buster. It increases the deficit by $53 billion. Is the first bill that we are looking to pass under a rule a bill that didnt even come through a committee. that no Member of Congress can even offer a payfor on? If we allowed an open rule here. I would love to offer a payfor for that. How are we going to pay for this $53 billion that this costs? If you want to do this bad policy. that is one thing. I dont think we should do it. But if you want to do this policy and risk having companies cut their employees from 40 hours to 39 hours. if it is going to cost $53 billion. I want to know how we are going to pay for it. I dont think that we should go to our Federal deficit and debt and leave that to the next generation to pay for. How many times does Congress do that? Oh. we will just have somebody else pay for it. Our kids will pay for it. our grandkids will pay for it. That is exactly what is going to happen with this bill. like so many others. Several thirdparty economic analyses have found that five times as many employees would be at risk of having their hours reduced to parttime status under this bill than under current law. That is right. Five times as many are at risk of being cut from 40 to 39 hours than are currently at risk of being cut from 40 to 30 hours. Oh. so endanger the benefits of more employeesthat is exactly what this bill does. This bill is no way to create jobs. It is a way to prevent many Americans from having the health care through their employer that they already enjoy. forcing them to get taxpayer subsidized health care through the exchange instead. That is why it costs money. That is what the $53 billion is. It is a fact that what Republicans are saying is: Sorry. I dont think you should pay for your own health care. I think taxpayers should pay for it. They are trying to force you and me to pay for your health care. rather than getting your own health care. paying your employees share. It is simply bad for the country. bad for the deficit. bad for the next generation. and as I said. just as importantly. a bad precedent for the way that this Congress works. Lets talk about the Keystone pipeline. This is really a phantom pipeline because yesterday in committee I asked. \"Does anybody actually want to finance or build this pipeline?\" I havent seen any evidence that there is. at the current rate of oil.",

The truth is it does not exist to move the oil from the tar sands of Canada to our ports for export. That is what we are talking about here. As far as I can tell. there is nobody who wants to pay to build it because it doesnt make economic sense with oil at $52 a barrel. It might be a different discussion when oil is $110. $100. or even $90 a barrel. We had statistics that about 90 percent of the tar sands production requires oil at $75 a barrel and about 100 percent of it requires oil at $65 a barrel. When oil is about $52 a barrel. nobody is going to pay for this pipeline. It is a phantom pipeline. We are talking about issues that might have made sense to talk about if somebody actually wanted to do this pipeline. but before we waste the deliberative efforts of this body on a topic like this. we would like to see some evidence that somebody actually wants to build a pipeline there in the first place. not to mention that the other reason it is a phantom is nobody knows what the routing is going to be. It is still in flux. There is a lawsuit. Where is the final routing going to be? Not only are there serious doubts about who will finance the pipeline. but in addition. we dont even know where it is going to be. By the way. the costs of the pipeline have gone up. Transcorp says the pipeline will cost $8 billionup from their estimates of $5.4 billion just a couple of years agonot to mention that we are being asked to approve a pipeline that we dont even know the final routing of. Again. as one of the very first bills that bypasses committee. that nobody can amend here on the floor. we are asked to encourage employers to cut their employees from 40 hours to 39 hours. so they can eliminate their benefits and force taxpayers to pay for it to the tune of $53 billion over 10 years. We are being asked to approve a phantom pipeline that nobody wants to pay for and nobody knows where it is going to go. What a way to start a Congress. Lets do better. Lets defeat this rule.

Too bad. your amendment wont be made in order. Do you believe that the 54th vote to undermine the Affordable Care Act is a waste of time? Too bad. the Republican leadership doesnt want to hear about it.

In theory. changing the definition of a fulltime worker to 40 hours a week would shift. not eliminate. the incentive for employers to reduce workers hours. Additionally. more employers could be inclined to shift more workers to \"parttime\" status under a 40hour definition because the disruption to their workforce is smaller from 40 to 39 hours per week than 40 to 29 hours per week.

There is just no denying that fact. When the House passed the Affordable Care Act. we had a smooth. gradual. incremental increase based on payroll which. again. did not create a cliff. My amendment would simply say that the exempt number of employees before the tax kicked in would be raised from 30 to 49. so that when an additional employee was hired above the 50 threshold. there would be a tax. there still would be an incentive. but there would not be a cliff.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Texas. Madam Speaker. I wonder: Does anyone know who Lisa Gray is? Or the many Lisa Grays across America? Lisa Gray is a woman who. as a small business owner. admitted that if it had not been for the Affordable Care Act. she would not have been able to get the chemo treatment for her leukemia. Just think of the workers who are now getting affordable care access. Now. with this legislation. they will be cut to 39 or 38 or 32 hours. so as not to have the employeemandated and responsible way of treating their health insurance. This bill that is on the floor today will give us a $53 billion deficit. It will result in 1 million people losing their employeesponsored coverage like Lisa Gray or families that I saw coming for enrollment in Texas. It will increase the number of people obtaining coverage through Medicaid. CHIP. and the health insurance marketplace between 500.000 and 1 million and increase the number of uninsured by upwards of 500.000. Do we realize what we have gained through the Affordable Care Act? According to the Kaiser Family Foundation. the average annual premium for employersponsored family health insurance rose just 3 percent. That is far different from 7.9 percent before the Affordable Care Act. Where is all this noise that our insurance premiums are going up? I will tell you what will be going up: it will cause an additional 6.5 million workers to find that their employers have cut their hours. and it will result in $19.6 billion in additional costs to the Federal health care program. Are we talking about deficit? I am talking about lives. Madam Speaker. and I am talking about the ability to save lives. This legislation is not interested in doing so. What about my State of Texas? We have not opted in to the expanded Medicaid. Twentythree Stateswhat will that do to individuals below 100 percent of the Federal poverty line if they had any ability to access the marketplace? They wont have the ability to access the marketplace because they will be in those who are cut down. Let me just say that we have the ability to realize and do better. Let me stop people from saying there is no Federal law that requires employers. Madam Speaker. to cover employees. You wont face penalties. You can do better. I believe this bill does not answer our concerns. I dont want Lisa Gray to lose her insurance. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 30. the socalled \"Save American Workers Act of 2014.\" which is the latest attempt by the House Republican majority to impede the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and deny Americans the security that comes from having access to affordable. highquality health care. At the start of the new Congress the American people expect the \"Peoples House\" to take up matters of central concern to their lives: jobs. affordable education. and initiatives to close the income gap. I oppose this bill because its effect would be to deny employer provided health insurance to hard working employees who work more than 30 hours but less than 40 hours per week. The majority is bringing before the House of Representatives a bill that was brought before the last Congress. and the Obama Administration said that it would be vetoed. The majority has attempted over 50 times to end the Affordable Care Act with no hope of accomplishing their goal. Todays vote is no different from past attempts to take away Americans right to affordable health care insurance. Further. should the Republican majority in the Senate decide to take up this billthey do not have the 60 votes to bring H.R. 30 before the Senate for a final vote. If they could get H.R. 30 out of the Senate the President would veto the bill and neither the House nor the Senate has the twothirds majority necessary to overcome a veto. This is a waste of limited legislative days for 2015. and a poor start to the 114th Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 30. the Save American Workers Act would: Increase the federal deficit by $53 billion over the next decade. Result in one million people losing sponsoring coverage. Increase the number of people obtaining coverage through Medicaid. CHIP. and the Health Insurance Marketplaces by between 500.000 and one million people. and Increase the number of uninsured by up to 500.000. Since 2013. over 10 million Americans now have health insurance because they took advantage of the Affordable Care Act. An independent analysis conducted by the University of California Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education found that increasing the threshold from 30 to 40 hours would result in nearly three times as many workers. about 6.5 million in total. being vulnerable to hour reductions than under current law. Premiums for employersponsored insurance grew in 2014 at the lowest rate on record back to 1999. tied with 2010. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation data. the average annual premium for employersponsored family health insurance coverage rose just 3.0 percent (1.2 percent adjusted for inflation) to $16.834 in 2out. far below the 7.9 percent (5.6 percent adjusted for inflation) rate seen from 20002010. Our nation has taken a momentous step in creating a mindset that health insurance is a personal responsibility with the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. The law did not automatically enroll all citizens into the program because it was specifically designed to be an optin process. This nation because of the Affordable Care Act has 7.3 million people signed up for Marketplace plans. paid their premiums. and accessed quality. affordable coverage. An additionally. 8 million individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP since the beginning 2015 Open Enrollmentthats an increase of nearly 14 percent compared to average monthly signups before this years enrollment period began. Millions of young adults have gotten covered on their parents plan. because the law says they can now do so until they turn 26. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 10.3 million uninsured Americans have gotten since the start of Open Enrollment. In just one year (since the start of Open Enrollment). weve reduced the number of uninsured adults by 26 percent. Americans have more choices. During Open Enrollment 21314. consumers could choose from an average of 47 plans. Contrast that to before the Affordable Care Act when many consumers had few. if any. real choices. Today. were able to announce that in 2015 there is a 25 percent increase in the total number of insurers selling health insurance plans in the Marketplace in 44 states. Seventysix million Americans with private health insurance can finally get preventive services such as vaccines. cancer screenings. and yearly wellness visits without cost sharing. because the law says your insurance company must provide you with these services with no copay or other outofpocket expense. This includes nearly 30 million women and over 18 million children. Millions of families have real financial security because insurance companies can no longer deny them coverage because of a preexisting condition or because they reach an annual or lifetime limit in coverage. Insurance companies must include things like prescription drugs and hospital stays in their coverage. And being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition. H.R. 30 proposes to amend the Internal Revenue Code by redefining a full time employee for purposes of providing health insurance to only those workers who work a 40hour workweek. The bill would redefine \"fulltime employee.\" for purposes of determining which employees an employer must provide health insurance coverage to only those hourly wageworkers who work 40 hours a week. The Affordable Care Act for the purpose of employers providing health care to workers defined a full time employee as any worker who works 30 hours a week or more. Few hourly workers in lowwage jobs work a 40hour work week. These employees often rely on government assistance. which amounts to a hidden tax break to employers. Low wageworkers often rely upon public housing assistance. SNAP. WIC or Medicaid to make ends meet. In the 115th Congress wants to help Americans with access to affordable health care insurance they would address the issue of states that are not participating in the Medicaid expansion in states like the state of Texas where millions of uninsured low wage workers do not have access to health care insurance. Health insurance should not be used as a status symbol. but a basic right for people who live in the worlds most prosperous nation. I know that many predicted that the Affordable Care Act would cause havoc on the nations health care system. but it is not the ACA that is causing havocit is a small vocal minority within the majority party that is causing headaches and heartaches to doctors and their patients. I ask that my Colleagues vote against the rule for H.R. 30. [From The Ledger.com. Jan. 8. 2015]",

We must reject this assault on our environment. especially at a time when so many communities across our country are experiencing the impacts of climate change through severe weather. coastal storms. and crippling droughts.

Greater American access to safe and reliable North American energy resources. because certainly getting more energy from our close friends. our neighbors. our closest ally. the Canadians. makes perfect sense. Reduced energy costs for American families. How important is that? Enhanced American energy security. And in todays modern world. more than ever. energy independence and energy security equals national security. So no wonder. Madam Speaker. that this project is supported by so many groups from all across the spectrum: labor organizations. so many labor organizations are supportive of this because of the jobs that it will bring. so many business organizations because of what it is going to do to help turbocharge our economy. and certainly the vast majority of American people. in poll after poll after poll. have demonstrated that they want this project to happen. They are totally cognizant. very aware of what this project means. again. to reducing our reliance that we have currently on fossil fuel from foreign sources. some countries that are not particularly favorable to American values and our way of life. and the American people are very. very supportive of this project.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today the House is scheduled to consider H.R. 30. which is really more properly called the \"Sabotage American Workers Act.\" a bill to provide a major change in ACAs requirement that larger employers offer health coverage to employees who work 30 or more hours a week or face a penalty. raising the threshold to 40 hours instead. The GOP claims the 30hour threshold is a destructive barrier to more hours for workers. However. in reality. this GOP bill would lead to fewer hours and more parttime workers. the exact opposite of what the Republican rhetoric about restoring the 40hour workweek implies. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Urban Institute have found no compelling evidence that parttime employment has increased as a result of ObamaCare. H.R. 30 would lead to more parttime work. since large employers could avoid providing health care coverage by reducing employees work schedules by even just an hour. Even conservative analysts agree. Yuval Levin recently wrote in the National Review that changing the definition to 40 hours \"would likely put far. far more people at risk of having their hours cut\" and \"would make for a worse effect on workers.\" Unfortunately. Congressional Republicans remain unmoved by the facts. choosing instead to launch yet another attack on working families. According to the CBO. this bill would increase the Federal deficit by $53 billion over the next decade. So I would urge all of my colleagues to vote \"no\" on this rule and then \"no\" on H.R. 30.",

The denial of insurance based on a preexisting condition? Exactly what are you trying to save them from? Despite the repeated distortions and assaults. the Affordable Care Act is working. In the most recent open enrollment. more than 6.5 million people have registered for or renewed their health insurance coverage through the marketplace exchange. and open enrollment will continue through February 15 of this year. Just this week. new data show the uninsured rate has sunk to 12.9 percent. a 4point drop in the past year. and one of the lowest in decades. Many of these are our constituents who. without the Affordable Care Act. would not have health insurance. They are realizing the benefits of a patientcentered insurance model in which their coverage cannot be rescinded or denied because of a preexisting condition and does not put them at risk of bankruptcy in the event of an emergency. But my friends on the other side will not be deterred in their zeal to repeal. at any cost. no matter who it hurts. even if it means abandoning their own professed principles. The Congressional Budget Office says this bill would increase the Federal deficit by at least $53.2 billion over the next 10 years.

One of those bills is for a phantom pipeline. We dont even know if anybody wants to build it. and we dont know where it is going to go. We dont even know whether this right of eminent domain might be given to a private company over this so that a company can condemn private property of a private landowners and take it away.

It is a bill that will lead hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans to lose their health care and have to take taxpayer subsidies through the exchange to be able to even have any kind of health care. Look. instead of rehashing proposals that we voted on I dont even know how many timesin fact. we voted on this phantom pipeline when it was a little less phantom. I think there were actually people who wanted to build it when oil was $110 a barrel. Guess what? The costs of the pipeline have gone up by about 30 percent. and as far as we can tell. there has been no evidence presented. either in the Rules Committee or here on the floor. that anybody wants to build it.

The first week of a new Congress is a little bit different from other times. None of our committees have been constituted. Yet. in this Congressin this historic Congresswe have been left an enormous amount of work by the previous Congress. not because the House wouldnt do its work. Republicans and Democrats showed up and passed bills and sent them over to the Senate. and there they languished. Well over 300 bills are stacked up on the former majority leaders desk. I stress the word \"former\" in that statement. and I believe that is why he is the former majority leader. Now it is a new day and a new Congress. No. the committees have not yet been constituted. but there is an enormous amount of workthere is an enormous body of workthat has already been accomplished by the House of Representatives that now needs to move forward on behalf of the American people. on behalf of our economy. on behalf of our jobs. on behalf of heating our homes. Look. I am old enough to remember when the Democrats assumed power in 2007. in the 110th Congress. It was kind of an unusual time for me because I had been in the majority previously. and I didnt know what it was like to be in the minority. but let me just take everyone back for a moment. The rules package that the Democrats passed in the 110th Congresstheir first year of the majorityprovided for the consideration of five measures. I never quite understood that because the Democrats ran on \"six for 06.\" Nevertheless. five measures were included in their rules package. They went directly to the floor with these bills. with no committee consideration. not even the consideration of a hearing in the House Rules Committee. which they controlled at the time. So it is a little disingenuous to say. \"Oh. we are rushing things. Oh. we have not had adequate consideration.\" You heard the gentleman from Illinois describe the number of hearings and markups that have been done on just the Keystone pipeline. In the time I have been sitting here I have heard discussions that there is nothing in the Affordable Care Act that actually cuts a workers hours. but a plain reading of the legislationof section 1513. page 158. paragraph four. for those who are keeping score at homereads: A fulltime employee. section A. in general: The term \"fulltime employee\" means. with respect to any month. an employee who is employed at least 30 hours of service per week. That seems pretty straightforward. What has happened as a result of that very plain language even before the Department of Labor issued its rules. which were even more restrictive. is employers made the decision of: Do you know what? We are not going to employ anyone over 29 hours because we dont want to run the risk of invoking this employer mandate. Now. it is true enough that the administration did delay the mandate. Yes. we are criticized for passing things that are restrictive on the Affordable Care Act. The administration has done so so many times30. 35I dont even remember how many. One of the things they delayed was the employer mandate. In fact. later on. in this very section. section 1513. it states: On the effective date of the employer mandate. the amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31. 2013. That is in the past. It is important to bring this up. It is not part of our discussion today on the rules. but it is for employersfor small businessesin this country to recognize. with the delay of the employer mandateactually. it started last week. January 1 of 2015no taxes for calendar year 2015 will be paid until next year. So the fines under the Affordable Care Act will. in fact. not start until next year. but the reporting requirements started 7 days ago. Big companies understand this. Big companies get this. Big companies have got lots of lawyers on retainer who are working on this every day. It is the small employers with 50 employees back home in our districts who need to understand that they have to be keeping these records today so that they will be able to go back and verify the statements on their tax bills next year.",

Right now. the law says that every large employer must give health insurance to its fulltime employees. Here is the catch: it defines full time as 30 hours or more. So guess what is happeningbusinesses are cutting workers hours. They are keeping them below 30 hours to avoid the penalty. It is commonly known as the ObamaCare 29ers. And what is more. community colleges are laying off their professors and they are cutting their hours. so they have to cut their class offerings as well. In other words. the law is making it much harder to learn new skills and to find a better paying job. I cant think of a worse way to support working families: taking opportunities away from them. cutting paychecks. cutting hours. Who are the people who are most at risk with this 30hour rule? Well. by and large. it is young people in lowpaying jobsprobably their first jobs. One study said that over half of them have. at most. a high school degree. These are the people who are just getting started in life. who need those extra hours. who want to move up the ladder of economic opportunity. ObamaCare is holding these people down. That is why we are here today. This bill changes the laws definition of full time to 40 hours a week. That is the way most people define full time. That is the way it has been done for decades in other parts of law. That way. businesses will no longer fear letting their employees work a full workweek. That way. people can get the experience they need. That way. we can get people working again and build a healthy economy. Mr. Speaker. it is really clear. There are so many parts of this law that are holding back the country. that are raising health care costs. that are putting us further behind and deeper in the hole on fiscal responsibility. But this rule is costing people jobs. this rule is knocking people out of fulltime work.

Today. 7 percent. more or less. of workers work between 30 and 34 hours. while close to half work 40 hours. As you can see. the number working 40 hours overshadows dramatically those who are working less. This is the key point. So if you shift the basis of employer responsibility for health care to begin at 40 hours instead of 30 hours. the result will be a dramatic increase in the number of workers whose hours of employment will be reduced to less than 40 hours per week. You will be creating hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of 39ers. CBO and Joint Task conclude. therefore. that 1 million workers will lose their employerbased health insurance. with half of them shifting to insurance through the health exchanges or through Medicaidby the way. with some taxpayer supportand the other halflisten to thislosing health insurance coverage completely. So when you take off the label of this Republican bill and look at the contents in the package. this is a bad deal. highlighting the need for a truth in labeling requirement for this Congress. When you go beyond the benign Republican rhetoric. this is a bad deal for American workers and the middle class and taxpayers. That has led even a conservative like Yuval Levin to say that todays bill \"is worse than doing nothing.\" This bill is brought up today without any committee consideration or discussion with Democratsthe minority leader is here. the minority whipnot a single minute of discussion. Unfortunately. contrary to the rhetoric we heard yesterdayagain. from the majorityabout the need to look for common ground. on this issue the Republican approach is scorched earth. I urge a strong negative vote. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to elaborate on the chairmans retort to what we just heard about criticisms pertaining to this law. Number one. this law is inherently unfair. Trying to finance health insurance for some Americans by cutting hours and wages for other Americans is just. frankly. not what we should be doing as a country. The Save American Workers Act would actually save most workers from a potentially massive loss in hours and wages. and I will walk the gentleman through that momentarily. It will also cause fewer workers to be directly impacted by this employer mandate. Very briefly. let us start with saving most workers from a potentially massive cut in hours. Under current law. if you work between 40 to. say. 45 hours and your employer happens to not offer you employersponsored health insurance. you are in the minority. An employer is incentivized to offer these typically higherwage. higherskilled workers employersponsored health insurance. and that is why so many do. It is part of our normal functioning labor market. So if one were to be moved hypothetically from 40 hours down to 29 hours. they would lose roughly $270 a week or $14.000 a year. according to the American Action Forum. Under the Save American Workers Act. these 40- to 45hour workweek individuals would no longer be at risk of such a massive cut in their wages or their hours. Lets take someone working 30 to 35 hours. just above that new fulltime employment threshold in ObamaCare. They tend to be lowerwage hourly workers. according to the Hoover Institution. and lets assume they had no employersponsored health insurance. There are 9.8 million Americans who fall into this category. They are vulnerable to a cut in their hours and wages. Were one to move from 35 hours a week down to 29. they would lose on average $148 per week. or $7.694 a yearagain. according to the American Action Forum. Under the Save American Workers Act. these individuals. 30 to 35 hours a week. would no longer lose any hours or wages. just reinforcing the point that the good chairman made. Well. this is why I introduced the Save American Workers Act. Lets restore the 40hour workweek that so many people worked so hard to put in place. that has long been understood to be the gold standard of the workweek in this country. Over the past few years. I have witnessed a strange phenomenon in our country. In Indiana. we have seen local school corporations announce they will limit the hours of substitute teachers. classroom assistants. cafeteria workers. custodians. We have seen retailers limit the hours of their cashiers. The list goes on and on. from hotels to manufacturers to colleges and universities. I guarantee that every Member of this body back in their district has heard similar stories. This is happening because of the new 30hour definition of fulltime employment. Now. there is no good reason to do this. other than. perhaps. to arbitrarily set this new definition of fulltime employment to fund the massive cost of this national health care bill. It has ignored decades of practice in the labor market reality of our 40hour workweek. It has distorted that market. As a result. the Hoover Institution estimates that as many as 2.6 million American workers are at risk for lost hours. Now. it is not just the lost hours that should concern us. Again. it is the lost wages. An employee losing 10 hours a week is also losing an entire weeks paycheck each month. An employee going from 35 to 29 hours is seeing a 17 percent pay cut. courtesy of ObamaCare. The people most affected by this provision are the people who can least afford it89 percent of them do not have college degrees. 63 percent of them are women. Perhaps. ironically. it sounds a lot like the people ObamaCare was supposed to help. CBO analysis indicates that it comes at the expense of up to $105 billion in cash wages. Now. I defy anyone to say that it is fair to expand coverage to a halfmillion peoplethat number from the CBOon the backs of 2.5 million people who cant afford it. How fundamentally inefficient is the health care system that potentially requires the loss of over $200.000 in cash wages for each person it insures. I authored H.R. 30. the Save American Workers Act. to help these hardworking Americans. And I introduced this bill jointly with the gentleman from Illinois . who happens to be a Democrat. He. too. realizes that ObamaCare is littered with serious unintended consequences that need to be addressed. In the Senate. we have seen a similar version of this bill introduced in a bipartisan manner.",

Perhaps you are going to really want to do something that will save the workers and give them the purchasing power they had in 1968. The chairman said it well: We go from creating 29ers to 39ers. This bill will allow you to work 10 more hours without health care. Isnt that wonderful? I am sure every American worker is saying: Thank God the Republicans are going to have me work 10 more hours before I can get health insurance. Arent you generous? The American worker needs help. not to be misled by a rhetoric which pretends to do something for them but leaves them stuck. not just for 5 years. but for 10. 15. 20 years. as those at the top of the ring get better and better offand we are among most of those 10 percent.

This is the 54th time that the Republicans have come out here to end the Affordable Care Act. This one is an assault on the employer mandate. You cannot have a bill without an employer mandate. Now. we had to pick a time. Lots of employers in this country right now without any Federal law are giving insurance to their people down to 30 hours. So we said. \"All right. lets make that full time.\" What the business community said they were supporting. they really werent supporting. and they are in here to get rid of it. This bill is the blueprint for business to shift all their employees on to the government. very simply. Close the building at 4 p.m. Now. everybody has only worked 39 hours. right? Go home. Now. the office doesnt have to offer them any health insurance under the law. They have to go over to the exchange. get involved in Medicaid. get involved in the exchanges and getting subsidies and all of that. which you are going to pay for. You are going to pay for that by letting the employers get out from under paying it and shifting it on to the Federal Government. That is what this is all about. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Mr. RYAN for his generous step toward a singlepayer system. When the American people find out that their business can now take their insurance away if they dont work 40 hours. they are going to say to themselves. \"Well. then I am in this Federal Government thing. Why isnt everybody in that?\" You are heading down the road of a singlepayer system because if you dont have a mandate for employers to cover their workers. you are simply saying. \"Well. the employers dont have to care anymore.\" Who is going to care? Well. the Republicans certainly arent going to care. You all know that without being told.

Despite the fact that productivity has soared and profits have increased. these gains are not flowing to the vast majority of Americans. In 81 percent of Americas counties. median income today is lower than it was 15 years ago. After adjusting for inflation. todays average hourly wage has the same purchasing power as it did in 1979. this despite the fact that American workers are producing far more. Productivity has increased 74 percent since 1973. There is a reason why the wealth is concentrated at the top. There are a myriad of tiny little changes that have a cumulative effect on the vast majority of American workers. Refusing to raise the minimum wage. attacking the right to unionize. special tax benefits for a few. and todays legislation are all examples. No doubt changing the definition of 40 hours for purposes of the Affordable Care Act will benefit a few businesses. but there are far more employees who work 40 hours a week or more than who work 30 to 40 hours. and as has been pointed out by the conservatives at the National Review and The Weekly Standard. it is easier to drop employees to 39 hours a week than to 29 hours a week. This meaning this proposal is going to reduce far more hours of work and wages for whom it matters the most. Wages arent the only benefit at stake. As has been pointed out. according to the CBO. a million workers will lose health insurance through their employer. half of whom will lose it altogether. The other half will be shifted to the government through Medicaid. increasing spending by more than $50 billion over the next decade.

I have only been a Member of Congress for 2 days now. but passing bills to help American workers and those who employ them. especially so early in the year. is exactly what our constituents sent us to Washington to accomplish. The purpose of this legislation is simple: to increase the threshold of classifying a fulltime worker under the Affordable Care Act from 30 hours to 40 hours a week. Back in my south Florida district. I constantly hear from families who are frustrated by the burdens of the Affordable Care Act. The 30hour workweek provision has limited the incomes of many Americans and their potential to grow in their jobs. Defining 40 hours as a full workweek will provide relief to many families who are unfairly getting caught in these growthcrushing regulations. Working Americans want to get ahead and work as many hours as possible to provide for their families. The 30hour workweek is limiting their ability to do so. So. again. I want to reiterate my support for this bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground where we can make changes in the Affordable Care Act that will benefit our neighbors back home.",

I guess I could take some happiness in the fact that we are not having an outright repeal of the Affordable Care Act on the floor today. but I know that this effort is really about repealing the bill. It is a piecebypiece approach. where the Republicans want to basically tear down whatin my opinion. and when I go home my constituents sayis an excellent program. More and more people are signing up for the Affordable Care Act. More and more people are getting insurance at an affordable price with subsidies and the expansion of Medicaid. The Republicans know that they cant repeal it outright. so now. they are trying to do it piece by piece. There is no kidding ourselves as to what this bill will do. It is going to increase the deficit. adding $53 billion to our debt. It is going to increase the number of uninsured. It will shift more people onto public programs. and it will cause workers who are currently receiving employersponsored health coverage to lose that coverage. My Republican colleagues claim this bill is necessary to protect jobs. but the fact of the matter is that the Affordable Care Act has strengthened the job market. Our economy and workforce are stronger now than before the law was passed. Basically. what is happening here is if you are a large employer with more than 50 fulltime workersin other words. 96 percent of employers are unaffected by the lawfor those 4 percent of larger employers who have the means. the law says they need to do right by their fulltime workers and offer them health insurance. The Republicans dont think businesses owe their employees anything at all. They think that bigger businesses should have the right to deny their workers health insurance. Even though the ACA says that that is what they should dogive them health insurancethey say. \"No. they shouldnt have to do that.\" The bill the Republicans have presented today would say that big businesses could deny health coverage to someone working 39 hours a week. 52 weeks a year. That is not a parttime worker. Their employers should provide them with health coverage. That is all that we are asking. Giving big businesses a green light to drop coverage for their workers is not the way to move the country forward. Workers have the right to decent health care. and businesses should help them get it. That is the fair thing. That is the right thing. This bill simply takes us in the wrong direction. I keep hearing from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as to how terrible the Affordable Care Act is. The fact of the matter is it is working and it is working for working people.",

This is one more attempt. More than 150 million Americans get their health coverage through their jobs or through a family members job. As for the Affordable Care Act. when we passed it. at that time. 96 percent of all businesses with over 50 employees provided health insurance for their fulltime employees. So that we wouldnt dismantle the Presidents systemrather. that we would build on itwe established a mandate. Those employersthose businesseswith over 50 employees would be mandated to provide insurance for their fulltime employees. Ninetysix percent were already doing it without a mandate. and those with under 50 employees werent subject to the mandate. This bill would change the ACAs definition of \"fulltime employee\" for somebody who works 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week. That puts a lot of Americans at risk of having their hours cut to just under the 40hour threshold. so that a few employersjust a few. as 96 percent were already doing itcan escape their responsibility of providing the insurance. They are less likely to suffer a job loss today because most people work a 40hour week. Cutting below 30 is very unlikely because people would start quitting. Ninetysix percent were already being provided their insurance. Now. if you are working from 9 to 5. with an hour off for lunch. suddenly. you are no longer a fulltime employee. That is only 35 hours. If the employer sends everybody home at 4 on Fridays. that is 39 hours. You are no longer a fulltime employee. As a result. many peoplethose currently working between 30 and 40 and those who will have their hours cutwill suddenly be parttime employees. not entitled to employerprovided health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office. that is about a million people who will lose their employerbased health coverage. Mr. Speaker. this is just another attack on the health security of American families. It is an attack that families do not want. but it will help that handful of businesses that just wants to deny hardworking employees their health insurance. I want to put one thing on the record. We have had more consecutive months of 200.000plus job growth than anytime in recent history. so the jobkilling aspect of it cant be doing too badlya lot more than there were under the previous administration. We ought to be building on the ACA. not diminishing it. We ought to be working to strengthen it. including fully expanding Medicaid to all 50 States. We can do better. This hurts families.

We have got to do everything we possibly can to encourage employers not only to create jobs but to maintain the jobs they currently offer.

The Republicans keep claiming that this provision of the Affordable Care Act is affecting workers hours. but despite these claims and despite a lot of anecdotal evidence that I have heard from the business community. the labor and employment experts have detected no such impact. In fact. our economy has created 10.8 million new jobs since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Almost 10 million of those jobs are fulltime jobs. What this proposal would actually do is put more workers into the kind of jeopardy that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are trying to prevent. Only 7 percent of Americans work in jobs that place them close to the current 30houraweek threshold. Far more Americansabout 44 percent of themactually work 40 hours a week. so even slight changes to their work schedules are going to deny them access to the health insurance that they so desperately need. I have been sitting here. I am really touched by the concern that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have for women and for young people. people who really are at the lower end of the employment spectrum and who the Republicans say are going to be harmed by this. Let me tell you. for the 4 percent of the large corporations that are subject to these provisions of the Affordable Care Actpeople who have 50 employees or morehere is the way it is going to work for the young people and for the women. These people are going to be people working for large corporations. making just barely above minimum wage. If they work 40 hours a week. they get insurance. Under this proposal. all their employer has to do is cut 1 hour a week out of that39 hours a weekand suddenly they lose their health insurance. And that is what is going to put those people at risk. Those women in clerical jobs. women with little kids. those young people in their twenties coming into the job market. trying to do the right thing and have health insurance. now they are going to have to pay for that insurance out of their own pockets. and for no reason. The consequences of this misguided proposal dont stop there. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 30 would raise the deficit by $53 billion in the next decade while also keeping a million American workers from getting health insurance through their jobs.

It is this mythical idea in their minds. which was all the rhetoric that was used to sell the law in the first place on all these good things it is going to do. The problem is: reality. Look at what is actually happening in the real world. This is the problem with ObamaCare. when the myth of ObamaCare clashes with the reality of what is going on in America. People are losing their hours. People are getting jobs cut back. It is not big corporations. it is small businesses. Look. I talked to a retailer in the First Congressional District of Wisconsin who was telling metears coming down her faceof how she had to cut back hours. about how she had to take all of her fulltime employees at her retail business and knock them down to part time. Why? Because her competitors are doing the same thing. This is happening throughout America. The last speaker basically proved the point by saying. if you go to 40. they will go down to 39. Well. 39 is a lot better than 29. And guess what? The majority of Americans are at 34 hours. Going to 40 puts them above that. going to 30 puts them below that. putting people out of work. The fantasy land of ObamaCare. the fatal conceit of the central planning behind this law is that. in reality. it just doesnt work. Lets give people relief. At this time.

That is simply not true. The basis for the Joint Tax and CBO estimate is that there will be the loss of hours for hundreds of thousands of people. And as a result. 1 million people will no longer be enrolled in employmentbased coverage. and of those. 500.000 will have no insurance. So that statement is not correct. And. if I might say so. when the chairman said the House will take up a bill to define full time as 40 hours per week so more people can work full time. the basis of the CBO estimate is that fewer people will be working 40 hours or more. That is the basis for their conclusions. So let me just. if I might. emphasize what has been said by a conservative. Yuval Levinnot related: Putting the cutoff for the employer mandate at 40 hours would likely put far. far more people at risk of having their hours cut than leaving it at 30 hours. That would make for a worse effect on workers and on the economy. That is just a fact. The ACA has eliminated discrimination in terms of preexisting conditions. It has dramatically reduced the uninsured ratenow 12.9 percent. the lowest since that began to be tracked. It has increased Medicare benefits. and it has held health care cost growth to record lows.

This legislation weakens employees access to health insurance. threatens employer based insurance coverage. and increases the budget deficit by 45.7 billion dollars due in part to the resulting increase in the number of uninsured. I have always believed that access to quality healthcare is a right. not a privilege! The Affordable Care Acts current 30hours per week threshold for classification as a fulltime employee was designed to discourage employers from circumventing penalties that support the successful implementation of the law. Raising the threshold to 40 hours per week would limit access to employerprovided insurance coverage. and thereby impede a persons right to access healthcare. Some businesses argue that the Affordable Care Acts classification of a fulltime employee adversely impacts a business hiring and its ability to offer other employee benefits. However. the facts just dont bear this out. According to the San Francisco Federal Reserve. when the Affordable Care Acts provisions are fully implemented. the overall increase in the incidence of parttime work is likely to be \"small. on the order of a 1 to 2 percentage point increase or less.\" Other organizations analyses have also found little evidence that health reform has increased parttime work. In fact. since President Obama took office. the overall fulltime employment rate has consistently increased. so much so that the current U.S. unemployment rate is 5.8 percent. The Republican majority is offering the American people a solution in search of a problem. This bill does not save American jobs. nor does it help the American worker. Rather. this bill relegates American workers to the second class status of the \"uninsured\" and in doing so denies them. what I believe. is their right to affordable. quality healthcare. which is something that all Americans deserve.",

Before Obamacare. employers were free to tailor their benefit plans to meet the needs of their workers. Once Obamacare was enacted. however. employers with more than 50 fulltime employees were required to offer governmentmandated plans to their employees or face steep tax penalties. In many cases. this penalty could range from $2.000 to $3.000 per employee. Obamacare mandated that a \"fulltime employee\" is someone who is employed an average of 30 hours per week. As the administration has written new regulations to implement Obamacares mandates. the costly administrative complexities have forced many employers to shift more workers to parttime status. According to a 2013 study by the University of California. Berkeley. as many as 2.3 million workersor roughly 2 percent of the American workforceare \"vulnerable\" to lost employment and reduced wages due to Obamacares mandate. In Illinois. an employee earning the states minimum wage of $8.25 an hour stands to lose up to $330 a month if the definition of fulltime employment remains at 30 hours. Additionally. Obamacares 30hour rule has caused great harm to school districts. colleges and universities. As many as 225.000 workers in the education sector are at risk of seeing their hours cut. hitting bus drivers. teachers aides and cafeteria workers the most. Meanwhile. the rule creates a new burden for institutions of higher learning that seek to hire adjunct faculty to meet the demands of their students course requirements. Not only will these additional burdens place limits on the services that institutions of higher learning offer to their students. but in many cases will cause the schools to dramatically raise tuition.",

The Congressional Budget Office doesnt represent Democrats and it doesnt represent Republicans. It represents the American people and is here to guide Congress. this House. to make sure we are making decisions based on the facts. What are the facts according to the Congressional Budget Officenot Republicans. not Democrats? According to the Congressional Budget Office. this bill would increase the taxpayers burden by $53 billion over the next decade because this bill is unpaid for. This bill would result in 1 million Americans losing their employersponsored coverage. That is not Democrats saying that or Republicans. That is the Congressional Budget Office. This bill would increase the number of people who obtain their coverage by governmentsponsored health care because they would have lost their employersponsored health care. And that is why the American taxpayer would have to foot the bill of close to $53 billion. This bill would also. according to the Congressional Budget Office. increase the number of Americans who end up with no health insurance up to 500.000. That is not my number. that is CBOs. I think it is higher. but CBO says 500.000. I will be guided by CBO. CBO tells us as well that there are some five to six times as many American workers who are at the 40houraweek threshold than there are Americans who work at about 30 hours. So when this bill says that now the threshold will be 40 hours. any employer who decides to cut 1 hourthe time of this debate. 1 hourfrom the paycheck of an American worker has escaped responsibility to provide health insurance for all those workers under their employ1 hour. Six times more American workers are working 40 hours a week than 30 hours a week. That is why H.R. 30 costs the American taxpayer money. That is why it is bad for Americans and their paychecks. Now. Americans really dont care much about these debates. At the end of the day. they want to know we are doing something and getting something done. They want to know we are working together to solve some problems. They want us to boost job growth. They want us to boost an economy that works for all Americans. not just the privileged few. We have some pretty good news for them over the last few years. Nearly 11 million new jobs. 57 consecutive months of job growth. the longest streak in our countrys history. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act which is being debated today. 10 million more Americans today have health insurance. and that means health security that they didnt have before. The deficit has been cut by twothirds. gas prices cut by halfgood news. So you are probably not surprised to learn a couple of other things. During that same time. the economy has grown 12 percent. corporate profits have grown 46 percent. and the stock market 92 percent. What is the missing element in all of that growth? Paychecks. The paychecks of the average American worker have stagnated over that time. Everybody else is doing well at the top. but the guys at the middle. they are hurting. What does H.R. 30 do? It sucker punches that same American worker who has to earn a paychecknot the guy who has an inheritance. not the guy who has investments to live off ofthe guy who lives off of a paycheck. My motion to recommit says stop that. We have our final chance to do that. Vote for the motion to recommit. Vote against H.R. 30. and lets work on behalf of Americans and their paychecks.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I dont know what to say. Paychecks. Guess what. It is happening across America today. Even before the employer mandate kicked in. businesses across America are cutting workers hours down to 29. That doesnt help a paycheck. So think about what is going on in America today and look at what has already been happening. and this is before this costly employer mandate even took place. It is happening in every congressional district. We heard about cafeteria workers. firefighters. teachers. community colleges. retailers. restaurateurs. all of them being forced to cut the hours of their employees down to parttime work. If you want to help a persons paycheck. give them the opportunity to have a fulltime job. That is what this does. It is really kind of amazing. I hear a lot of talk about the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation and the costs and the costs of this bill. Here is the bulk of the costs. What we are saying is dont impose these costly. punitive mandate taxes on hardworking taxpayers. So by removing these mandate taxes. yes. I suppose it costs the government some money. It puts that money back into the paychecks and back into the pockets of the hardworking taxpayers who give us the money in the first place. It says to businesses: Go ahead and hire. add hours. and increase wages. That is the socalled cost of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. we want more people working. We want the people who are in 30- to 40hour jobs. hourly wages. high school educations. just getting started in life. we want them to keep climbing that ladder of life. This law puts a huge roadblock in front of people working. What this motion to recommit does is it is just designed to kill the bill. With respect to the veterans issue. we solved that yesterday with our Hire More Heroes Act. which we passed in a big. bipartisan vote. So make no mistake. This recommit is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to simply kill this bill. Look. if you want to impose this mandate. if you want to knock people into parttime work. and if you love ObamaCare. then vote against the bill. But if you want more jobs. if you want more hours. if you want more people working. if you want more people having better opportunities. and if you want to give some relief on these mandate taxes. then vote for this bill. This bill is the right way to go. And I have just got to tell you that. at the end of the day. we havent even seen the full force of this punitive move because the employer mandate is just beginning to kick in. All of these things have happened in anticipation of this new mandate. We havent even seen the worst of it yet. That is why we should pass this now and prevent this from happening and getting worse before this mandate kicks in. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

I am here on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in our Special Order hour where we want to share with the American public our concerns about a trade deal that we think will be coming through Congress in the first few months or first half of this session. The TransPacific Partnership is the biggest and the baddest of the trade deals that we have seen come before this country. It represents a dozen countries. From Chile to Japan. almost 800 million people are represented by countries that would be included within the TransPacific Partnership. and it represents 40 percent of the worlds economy. Yet the trade agreement has been drafted largely in secret. No one from the public has seen it. Quite honestly. Members of Congress havent seen it. But about 600 people in this country are involved with the drafting of this trade deal. It has great ramifications that go beyond trade. the 29 chapters that make up the TransPacific Partnership. We anticipate there also could be a move from leadership to introduce legislation to Fast Track the trade deal. What that means to Fast Track it is to really take away the publics ability. through their elected Members of Congress. to have a say. to be able to debate and to amend the trade deal. We anticipate that could be one of the first votes that would come to us this Congress about trade. We at the Progressive Caucus want to share with the public the various concerns that we may have about this very. very large. allencompassing trade deal that could affect American jobs. could affect food safety. could affect environmental concerns. could affect things like buy American laws. currency policy. and many. many more issues. I am joined by a number of Members of Congress today who would like to take part in this. and I would like to. at this time. yield to my colleague from the great State of New York. who has put a number of efforts towards this in working very strongly to make sure the public knows what is in the TransPacific Partnership.

It is great to join him in this hour of discussion about the Fast Track method that has been associated with trade negotiations and with fair trade/free trade concepts alike. I represent a district in upstate New York. the 20th Congressional District. which is primarily the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk River Valleys. and it was there that we became the donor area to the Erie Canal that gave birth to westward movement for this Nation and sparked an industrial revolution. It was there that we saw the development of a necklace of communities. dubbed mill towns. that then rose as the epicenters of invention and innovation that saw manufacturing booming as we went forward as a nation. Many an immigrant called that their new home. that region their new home. and they tethered their American Dream to the prosperity that was continuing to grow in the region. I think back to the manufacturing sector and all that it meant to my ancestors. all it meant to me and the opportunities that came into my life. and it was that empowerment that came through the availability of work. the dignity of work. the opportunity to earn a paycheck that really made a difference. I think of those same towns today having really lost millions of jobs across America. We are reflective of all those towns that became those manufacturing centers. that enabled people again to engage in meaningful employment and to be able to have those dreams. those American Dreams fully. fully strengthened by the opportunity for work. When I see the reduction of standards. of environmental standards. where we are willing to have our children exploited by the ugly sins of the past with concerns for child labor laws that might erode. when we think about some of the inequities that are brought to bear with the denial of collective bargaining. all of these items have snuck into trade negotiations. There is an importance for Congress to be able to provide the oversight and the assessment of these various negotiations. where we can look at these trade deals and suggest amendments or have sound debate. We not only have a right as Members of Congress. I think the public that we represent has a need for Congress to review these documents and to suggest improvements. So I look forward to this hour of discussion where you and I and our several colleagues will join together in speaking to the wisdom. or lack thereof. of some of the processes that have followed this entire trade discussion. We are talking about a trade deficit now that has ballooned beyond belief. to record proportions. and where we are putting our economy and that American Dream at risk and where we are denying meaningful employment to those whom we represent here in Washington. I thank you for leading us in this hour of discussion. and I know that the information that we will exchange will be very critical and important to people who will be airing into this discussion and allowing them to trade those. exchange those ideas with their given elected representatives.

I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Progressive Caucus in explaining why we oppose this socalled Fast Track authority for international trade deals. Let me be clear. I am very much protrade. Trade is essential to the econ omy of my district. and I am proud to represent the Port of Los Angeles. the largest container port in the country. Trade is essential to our economy in my district. but it is essential to the economy of the whole State of Californiaand of course. dare I say. the whole Nationthe many wonderful and diverse exports we do promote in our State: films. creative content made in Hollywood. the fruits and vegetables grown in Central Valley. the wines from Sonoma and Napa. the innovative products developed in our Silicon Valley. or the goods that are manufactured in California factories. Trade is essential to our entire U.S. economy. Trade creates and sustains American jobs. not only at our ports in this country. but throughout the entire supply chain. Trade helps American businesses reach new markets. grow. prosper. Trade helps American consumers gain access to many products that we value. and trade is not an exclusive Democratic issue or Republican issue. Everyone who wants our Nation to prosper understands the importance and value of engaging in trade and being globally competitive and connected. That is why I am proud that as a progressive Democrat I was able to join with a conservative Republican. TED POE. and we have worked together to cochair our Congressional PORTS Caucus. We now have about 90 Members of Congress. Republicans and Democrats. coming together over the issue of investing in and sustaining and making competitive our Nations seaports. We might disagree on other policy issues. but we have a common understanding of the economic benefits of trade. especially trade passing through our ports. So I want to say it again. and I hope it is clear that I strongly support trade. However. I am opposed to trade deals with other countries that have harmful consequences on our American workers and deals that give unfair advantages to those who exploit workers and destroy the environment. That is why I oppose Fast Track. I believe with all my heart that Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee trade agreements. but Fast Track takes away our authority to regulate trade and to be involved in these negotiations. Under Fast Track. we would only be able to vote for or against a deal that has been negotiated without us. and we would not even have the opportunity to amend it. That sounds like a recipe for a raw deal. not a good deal. I am honored to hold public office and to have earned the support and the trust of those who depend on me to stand up for them and what is best for them. I take my responsibility very seriously to represent them and act in their interests. as I think every Member of Congress does. and I think our constituents are counting on us to make trade deals that are fair and beneficial. I think Fast Track undercuts our authority and our ability to provide this oversight. I hope that we can support trade and have good trade agreements. but I hope we can all oppose the idea of Fast Tracking these trade deals.",

    "speech": "First of all. thank you to my colleague. Mr. POCAN. for his leadership on this and for yielding. Mr. Speaker. this is a really important subject for the American people. It is a really important subject for the people that I represent in Flint. Michigan. in Saginaw. Michigan. Bay City. You mentioned Flint. It is my hometown. I was born and raised there. September 16. 1908. General Motors was incorporated in Flint. Michigan. and it was a company that brought together carriagemakers and wheelmakers. and they put the world on wheels. About 30 years later. the workers in that city at General Motors organized and got the first UAW contract. Between the auto industry itself and the organized workers who were able to then claim their fair share of the tremendous wealth generated by their productive capacity. we built the American middle class. We built an amazing society that gives opportunity. gave opportunity. I think. to just about anybody who felt they could work hard and would put in the time and get a fair wage and get decent benefits and be able to go to work with some dignity. We built something that was truly amazing. It was not that long ago. because of globalization and because of trade deals like the one that is being considered right now. that the Federal Government. rightfully. and this President. rightfully. stood up for the American auto industry and put it back on its feet. They gave the American autoworkerthe American workerthe chance to reclaim that dignity that so many people fought for even decades ago. What I worry about is that everything that those people worked and fought for could go away. In fact. even the great work that this President did to rescue the American auto industry could all be for naught if we continue down this path of pursuing trade policy that puts corporate and stockholder and offshore interests. really. in front of the interests of the American people and the American worker. My hometown has seen this play itself out. I rememberI was in local governmentwhen the North American Free Trade Agreement was adopted. We keep hearing that the agreement that is being contemplated right now is a vastly different sort of agreement. but we dont see that. What we do hear and see is the very same language and the very same rhetoric and the very same explanations or excuses about the need to grant Fast Track authority to negotiate this agreement and bring it back to Congress for a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote. The same arguments that are being made now were being made then. and the people whom I represent truly believed that they were sold a bill of goods. At one point in time. in my hometown of Flint. Michigan. we had 79.000 autoworkers. This was a city that was never more than 200.000 in population. so this is a city that really grew up around American manufacturing. It was direct GM employees. but it was suppliers and a whole community built around this incredible productive capacity that started over a century ago. but in just a few short years. we have gone from that 79.000 number to about 10.000 autoworkers in my hometown. When I think about trade and these trade deals. it is not a question of sort of the big geopolitical tensions that we are trying to address. It is not even a matter of this kind of esoteric argument about the philosophy of trade policy. It is about Flint and Saginaw and Bay City. Michigan. families who have worked hard their whole lives and who stand to lose everything because we are continuing to pursue trade policy that thinks about the shortterm profits of multinational corporations and not about strengthening the longterm integrity of the American middle class. This is a dangerous path that we are on. What is particularly concerning to me is that. when I go home. as I doas you all dowe get questions about this. The questions are: \"We keep hearing that this trade agreement will have a high standard. a high set of standards. and that it will not be like past agreements.\" Even some here in Washington have said that we are fighting old battles and that this is a new day. Yet. when I have to answer to my constituents questions like: \"Will these agreements have environmental protections and enforcement mechanisms for those environmental standards unlike some previous agreements?\" I have to say. \"I dont really know because we dont have access to the documents. We dont have access to the process. We havent been asked to weigh in.\" \"Will the agreements have labor standards that guarantee that American workers wont have to compete with nations that outlaw labor unions?\" for example. \"I dont know because we have not seen that language.\" We are being asked to accept on faith that. somehow. miraculously. this trade agreement is going to look dramatically different than others. even of those that have been fairly recently passed. Finally. I am asked. \"Will there be protections to keep other nations from manipulating their currency?\" No matter what else is in any of these trade agreements. if currency can be manipulated to a point so that the price of one nations exports makes it impossible for us to compete with them. all is lost. From what we hear. there will be no currency provisions or at least. if there are any at all. they certainly wont be strong enough to have any influence whatsoever on the ability of these nations to undermine the American economy by dumping goods. by manipulating currency in a fashion that makes it impossible for us to compete. This is the wrong track for this country. It is something for which Congress needs to stand up and assert its constitutional role in defending. I stand with my colleagues. and I know many. many others who simply are not going to sit idly by no matter who the President isa Democrat. a Republican. or otherwiseand allow the prerogatives of Congress. which means the prerogatives of the people who sent us here. to be overlooked. It would be a dangerous path for us to take. and I am very grateful to my friend Mr. POCAN for his leadership and for the leadership of many others here on this issue. I am glad to stand with you in fighting this battle.",

American Motors was the company that ran the town. Almost everyone had a family member or a neighbor who worked at American Motors. Now. granted. we made Pacers and Gremlins. so there were some mistakes along the way. American Motors eventually went away to Renault. and it went away to Chrysler. It went away to nothing as well as the people who had the strong familysupporting wages from that auto industry.

I think the American people are hearing from us through you. so I just want to thank you again for really beating the drum across America. allowing the American people to know what the real deal is here in Washington. D.C. Let me also thank all of my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus for rising tonight to talk about why we are strongly opposed to Fast Track for the TransPacific Partnership. Mr. Speaker. when it comes to trade deals and American jobs. Congress should never be a rubber stamp. As the Representative from Californias 13th Congressional District. I have the honor and the privilege of representing the Port of Oaklandone of our Nations busiest seaportsand also the airport. I support trade because it is critical to the economy of my district and our Nation. Trade is good when it is fair. when it is open. when it is transparent. and when it creates goodpaying jobs here in America. Trade is bad. however. when it ships American jobs overseas so that the 1 percent can reap even greater profits. For this reason. I join the vast majority of AmericansAmericans from both partiesin opposing Fast Track for the TPP. Bad trade hurts all American workersAmerican families. American businesses. and also. especially. those individuals and businesses in communities of color. Of the 2.7 million jobs lost because of the U.S.-China trade deal. a disproportionately high percentage35 percent. mind youcame from communities of color. That is outrageous. Now. after these individuals lost their jobs. their situations got even worse. When they found a new job. it was. on average. for a 30 percent lower wage. The loss of these jobs and wages totals more than $10 billion in lost economic growth for these communities. not one time. but each and every year. Enacting another bad trade deal will continue to prevent communities of color from building wealth and moving into the middle class. In addition to the negative impact on communities of color. Fast Track for TPP will not provide an opportunity to add critical labor and environmental protections that are critical to respecting human rights and preserving our planet. That is why my colleagues and I are here. saying \"no\" to Fast Track for the TransPacific Partnership. Trade negotiations should not be conducted in back rooms. The American people and Members of Congress deserve to know what is in these deals. That is why. again. Congress is so important. Otherwise. people have no say. They have no voice on trade policies that really affect their economic livelihoodstheir ability to put food on the table and their ability to aspire into the middle class. Fast Track for the TransPacific Partnership does not help the American people. It only allows special interests and corporations to craft trade deals that are bad for the American people. Mr. Speaker. it is time to turn the lights on the TPP. If the United States is going to pursue a trade deal in the Pacific. Congress needs to fully debate it so we are certain that it creates jobs and all the protections that we all are standing for and know about and want right here in America. Over the last 20 years. the U.S. has lost nearly 3.5 million jobs due to NAFTA and the United StatesChina trade deal. Many of these jobs were lost in California and in communities of color. Lets not make the same mistake again. Lets stand together in opposing Fast Track because it will sacrifice American jobs and environmental protections in the name of international corporate profits. Lets take Fast Track off of the table. and lets start talking about creating goodpaying American jobs for American families. Thank you. once again. for your tremendous leadership.",

At this point. I would like to yield to a colleague of mine from the great State of Ohio. who has seen much of this firsthand and who. today. has very eloquently explained her experiences of being around when NAFTA had passed. Let me yield to Representative MARCY KAPTUR from the great State of Ohio.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the very able gentleman from Wisconsin. Congressman POCAN. for organizing all of us this evening and for his indefatigable efforts to tell the truth about what is happening to the workers of our country and those around the world. I rise with you tonight because Americaour wonderful countryhas a huge \"good jobs\" deficit because we have a gigantic free trade deficit. Our trade policies export more U.S. jobs than U.S. products. More and more foreign imports come across our shores than we send goods out. and the gap grows wider every decade at extraordinary proportion. Never before in American history have so many good jobs been outsourced off our shores. Americas workers have had income shortagesevery family knows itbecause America has had this jobs hemorrhage due to the flawed. Fast Tracked free trade agreements that have been ramrodded through this Congress. Since 1975. when Wall Streets free trade regimen began to lock down. America has amassed a $9.5 trillion trade deficit with the world. If you count up every year. numbers dont lie. and this has translated into a gigantic. unprecedented jobs loss of over 47.5 million lost American jobsgood jobs from coast to coast. livingwage jobs. jobs that have evaporated from our communities. jobs that have been shipped out. We know the places as we just look at the tags on any productsMexico. China. Vietnam. Korea. Bangladesh. Honduras. Guatemala. Turkey. El Salvadorto dozens of Third World nationsfrankly. most very undemocraticwhere workers are treated like a bonded class. Workers everywherehere. tooare being treated like expendable parts. Yes. American jobs are being shipped out to pennywage sweatshops behind the Iron Curtain of anonymous towns in distant countries most Americans will never visit. Anonymity. worker exploitation. and hidden squalor are fundamental to free trade. And so are the stories of Americans who struggle to earn a living. who lose their jobs and are forgotten. are forgotten in their plight. In our country. the impact on the average American family has been a loss of real income of $7.000 a year. Imagine that. The public knows it. The people who elected me to Congressand I thank themhave allowed me to be a voice. to put the ugly puzzle of outsourcing together. And I have made it my mission to travel the world to find the companies that fled our shores. And I have traveled to find them. I have lots of photos. and I have lots of interviews. And I have had time to talk to unemployed Americans toofar too manyand the exploited workers of developing nations and to visit the plants that have been displaced from this country and built elsewhere. The titans who run these global transnational corporations. their operatives. and the Wall Street giants that finance them couldnt care less about workers anywhere or the communities in which they live. And. frankly. these new bosses of global production dont care about democracy or the rule of law either. They pay whatever they want. and they can pay off as they see fit. I have seen workers making Maytag washing machines in Monterrey. Mexico. Those used to be made in Newton. Iowa. These Mexican workers dont earn enough to buy the very washing machines they make. And with the jobs lost from Newton. the poverty rate in Newton has dramatically increased in the town that Fred Maytag proudly helped build. HoweverI dont know if you have noticedthe quality of those machines has gone down too. Who can be proud of what is happening? I have visited the homes where those workers from Monterrey live and other maquiladora factory zones and have see firsthand their impoverished living standards. I have stood at a surreal location in Mexico following NAFTAs passage called MichiganOhio Avenues and witnessed the jobs outsourced from our country from a windshield wiper factory that used to be located in New York. I have met women in the garment industry from Honduras and El Salvador who earn 10 cents for every Tshirt they produce in those sweat shops down there. barricaded off behind barbed wire and outsourced from places like the Carolinas. The women are being paid 10 cents an hour for every Tshirt that then comes in here and is sold for $20 each at stores and shopping centers around the country. Meanwhile. the booming garment and textile industry of the Carolinas. like the furniture industry too. has all but disappeared. and the tens of thousands of jobs that went with them. I visited those massive shuttered factories. and they reminded me of the auto plants that existed in my industrial region. I have tracked furniture jobs to Vietnam and have seen child laborers perched with their bare feet on the edge of large wooden bowls that they sand and spray with lacquer paint. wearing no face masks. with no air filters. breathing in the fumes and chemicals certain to damage their fragile lungs and bodies. Let me just say in closing. as an Ohio Representative. we have lost over 5 million manufacturing jobs alone in northern Ohio since the passage of NAFTA. which I fought with every ounce of being that I had here in 1993. We lost that fight. A 12votes switch here would have made the difference. And as I speak here today. another global company. Hugo Boss. a Germanowned company. is shutting down a factory in Brooklyn. Ohio. where workers had their pay cut 17 percent 2 years ago to save that company. You can walk into any Hugo Boss outlet. and you can see mens suits selling for $1.200 apiece. What a tragedy. What a tragedy for our country. What a tragedy for workers globally. I will say to my wonderful colleague from Wisconsin . thank you so much for doing this. In terms of Chinaand others will cover this more completelyjust in the past year. 2013. the latest complete year of data. our country assumed $319 billion of trade deficit with the nation of China just in that year. just in that year with that one country. Because of that deficit. we have lost an additional 1.595.000 more American jobs. just with this one country in 1 year. The answer to balanced global growth is to pay workers a living wage and to respect their work. not exploit it. The answer to balanced growth is to stop the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and to pry open the closed markets of the world. starting with Japan. China. and Korea. And the answer to balanced growth and fair trade is to stop the hemorrhage of more jobs from this country by defeating any more deals like NAFTA and all of its offspring. and the Fast Tracking of more jobs that they are trying to do in the TransPacific Partnership. It is time for America to stand up and for this Congress to stand up with the American workers and communities. Again. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me this evening.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Representative KAPTUR. for all that you have done. You have been an articulate spokesperson on behalf of jobs and the effects of these bad trade deals on jobs. And I have to say. I am really glad you brought up the textile industry. because when we talk about the need to work together in this Congress. this is an issue where Democrats and Republicans can absolutely unite. About 12 years ago. I was on a delegation of the American Council of Young Political Leaders. And one of the people on the delegation was a very conservative judge from the State of Mississippi. She and I and the group had met with some sweatshop workers in Indonesia to talk about all the mills that have left. especially in the southern part of the United States. and those jobs are pretty much gone forever. I have been in business for 27 years. since I had hair. I have had a small business. And in that role. we screenprint on Tshirts. And I have watched over the years all of the mills that made Tshirts in the United States pretty much leave. It is pretty hard to find clothes still made in the USA. It is even harder to find them unionmade in the USA. And this is something that unites people of different political ideologies because we see those jobs leaving. It doesnt matter. It is not a Democratic job or a Republican job. These bad trade deals too often just cost us jobs. I appreciate you bringing that up. and thank you again for all that you do. Next I would like to yield to someone who has been an extraordinary leader in this area. She has helped to coordinate Members of Congress like no one else. not just on this issue but on many other issues. She is an absolutely tireless advocate for the American public and for making sure that Congress has the proper role when it comes to trade agreements. She is someone whom I am extremely honored to have as a colleague and a friend. I would like to yield to the great Representative ROSA DELAURO from the State of Connecticut.",

    "speech": "Thank you so much to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Again. it is reciprocal. It is just such an honor to serve with you. We are simpatico in the views that we hold with regard to this and so many others. I am honored to be able to serve with you and to be tied together on this critically important issue. Earlier today. my colleagues who are on the floor here tonight and others who have spoken. we were all at a press conference. And I think we can say with one voice that it was one of the broadest advocacy coalitions that we have seen come together. It certainly is true for me in my 24 years in the House. The advocacy groups and Members of Congress came together to oppose Fast Track. It included faith groups. human rights groups. labor unions. environmental groups. and consumer protection groups. And the purpose. as I said. was to oppose the policy known as Fast Track for trade deals. Under this Fast Track umbrella. if you will. what happens? Members of Congress are denied the opportunity to debate and vote in detail on the text of these deals. We cannot have a serious debate. nor can we amend the process. Negotiations are going on right now between the United States and 11 other countries. If these negotiations are successful. it will create the largest trade deal in history. something called the TransPacific Partnership. Yet the details of this trade agreement remain a secret from the American people. from the Representatives of the American people in this body. The contours of the deal are being sketched out in secret. as I have said. by a Whos Who of Wall Street firms. big pharmaceutical companies. energy companies. and other corporate interests. They want to ram the agreement through the Congress. again. without amendment and with little opportunity for debate. To me. that is the very opposite of what we have been sent here to do. I have always opposed Fast Track. no matter who was in the Oval Office. I will oppose it again. We cannot. and we must not. really just sign away our constitutional duties. We need to retain the ability to scrutinize trade deals page by page. line by line. word by word. We should do that for all legislation. let alone legislation with such farreaching implications for American workers. Some of us remember the debate on this floor or going back home during the debate on health care when our constituents and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say to us. have you read the bill? Have you read the bill? How can you vote on a bill that you have not read? The TPP is 1.000 pages. 1.000 pages. We want to read the bill. That is what we are asking for. Make no mistake: bad trade deals can have grave consequences for our people. And it used to be that the workingclass families became middle class by finding work that paid enough to save a little. buy a home in a safe neighborhood. send their kids to college. and leave the next generation better off. But today. the good jobs that used to lift people into the middle class have been shipped overseas to places where labor is cheap. Many of them have gone to countries that get ahead by abusing labor rights. polluting the environment. risking public health. or manipulating their currency. A recent GAO report tells us of unpunished violence against trade unionists in Colombia. of union suppression in Guatemala. of abuses against foreign workers in Oman. These are all countries that we have trade deals with. agreements under which they promisedthey promisedto improve their records. We havent held them accountable on these promises. I am not against free trade. I am in favor of fair trade on a level playing field. Hardworking Americans will win 9 times out of 10. but the competition must be fair. A recent Gallup Poll showed that in 2014. the issues Americans most often identified as the biggest problem facing our country was \"poor government leadership.\" Today. 80 percent of Americans disapprove of the job that this institution is doing. Why? Because far too often. we are seen as working not for all Americans but for a privileged few: tax breaks for millionaires. benefit cuts for the poorest. unprecedented paydays for those at the top. dwindling paychecks for everyone else. The big economic problem today is that jobs that people have do not pay enough to them so that they can live on it. Fast Tracking this trade agreement will exacerbate that problem. NAFTAstyle trade deals are in the same category. For a narrow band of wealthy individuals and big corporations with the means to invest their money beyond our the borders. they do wonders. For the rest of us. they spell disaster. They send our jobs overseas. They erode our ability to protect our workers. consumers. and the environment. Worst of all. they threaten to saw the legs off the ladder of opportunity that leads to the middle class. Fast Tracking these deals would be yet another insult to American workers. yet another sign of how little their political leaders really care about them. Instead of our abdicating our constitutional responsibility. lets send a clear message: enough is enough. No more offshoring. No more NAFTAstyle trade deals. no more Fast Track. Let us focus on helping American workers. not throwing their jobs away. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for all of his efforts. and it is a privilege to work with you on this issue.",

    "speech": "say was to talk about the job loss in the manufacturing sector. in the clothing textile sector in the Carolinas. I represent a district in Maryland. but my family is from North Carolina. A lot of my family members had those goodpaying jobs in the mills. They were making the sheets. pillowcases. Tshirts. and hats. and they all lost their jobs. All of those jobs went someplace else. but they didnt stay in North Carolina. That was a tragedy. It was a tragedy for my family. as it has been a tragedy for families all across this country. I remember the NAFTA debate. and so many Members of CongressI wasnt in Congress at the time. Mr. POCAN wasnt in Congress at the timebut we remember the debate. We remember that they told us: \"Well. there would be other jobs that would be created. so dont worry about any jobs that would be lost.\" They said the jobs in the service sector would grow and they would stay. Almost one of the first things to happen after NAFTA went into effect was all those call centers closed. Those were servicesector jobs. and they left. along with millions of manufacturing jobs. In my home State of Maryland. we lost 70.000 jobsand we are a small Statebut we lost those just to NAFTA. so when people tell me now as a Member of Congress: \"We want you to just Fast Track this trade deal. this TransPacific Partnership deal. and just trust us that the process is going to work. just trust us that all you have to do is rubberstamp the trade deal\"I rememberand Mr. POCAN. you rememberand that is what requires us for our constituents to say no way. that we cannot just give Fast Track authority over. hand it over and. in effect. just say that whatever the deal is that has been negotiated. we will just take that deal for the American people. Well. you and I know better. One of the things that has long concerned me is getting wind that our Trade Representative. on behalf of my constituents and your constituents. were negotiating away Buy American provisions. negotiating them away without our even having a voice in that conversation. Lets look at those Buy American provisions. In 2012. 68 of our colleagues joined us in saying to President Obama. \"Dont negotiate away the Buy American provision.\" Then just last year. 120 Members of Congress said. \"Mr. President. dont negotiate away the Buy American provisions.\" So I see that the wind is really beneath our sails because the American people understand that when you negotiate away Buy American. what you do is negotiate away the buying power and the jobs of American workers. You trade what is. in effect. billions of dollars of American taxpayer buying power for very little buying power coming from the other direction. I am troubled that we have a Trade Representative that just wants to say. \"Take the deal and run.\" and those of us who stand in the steps of American workers. we are in their place. We are representing them. We have their voice. We need to have their voice. and we have to have their back and say \"no\" to Fast Track and say \"no\" to the TPP and \"no\" to provisions that would trade away what we know the statistics are. The U.S. procurement market is more than 10 times larger than all the TPP procurement markets combined. and so that means that we would trade away preferential access for U.S. firms to $556 billion in Federal Government procurement. For what? $53 billion in return? We have to say \"no\" to this deal. I want to thank Mr. POCAN for bringing us together. It is good that we are doing this from day one in the United States House of Representatives because what we are saying to American workers is: \"Not only will we stand with you on the first day of the Congress and the next day of the Congress. but all the way to the end. to keep from trading away millions of your jobs.\"",

    "speech": "Thank you again so much. Representative EDWARDS. When you talked about the job loss in Maryland. we lost nearly 75.000 manufacturing job through the NAFTAWTO period in the last 20 years. When I was a legislator in the State of Wisconsin. it was a Buy American law that I got passed with a bipartisan vote in the Wisconsin Legislature. The fact that we are going to give up our sovereignty to have that law and some multinational corporation can sue any local unit of government so that they can contest those laws and we can lose that ability. I think the average person. if they knew that was something even being discussed. would be opposed to that. much less the other 28 chapters in addition to procurement that are included in this TransPacific Partnership. Thank you so much for all the work you have done on this and for making people aware of all the little hidden gems that if we dont have an ability to have a full and fair debate in this House. things that could happen in the biggest and the baddest of the trade deals yet we have seen in this country. so thank you so much. Mr. Speaker. the Progressive Caucus is going to be doing everything we can in the coming months to fight this. to make sure that Congress has a say. We arent against trade. we want fair trade. but the socalled free trade that is out there right now that is being drafted by corporate CEOs and Wall Street banks doesnt include the public and doesnt include Congress. and it needs to have every single person represented. We are the voices of the American people. We need to be able to have a full debate in this body. and we need to be able to amend any deal that we dont like. the particular deals that have been decided by others. by corporate leaders in this country. The American public has to be included. Before I ever came to this Congress. the last 27 years. I have run a small business. a small specialty printing business. One of the things we do is we source Americanmade and unionmade products for people. I watched. over that 27 years. companies leave this country over and over and over. whether it be the mills that I mentioned from the South that made Tshirts to things as simple as pens. Companies like Parker Pen used to have up to 1.000 jobs in Rock County. Wisconsin. that now have all gone out of this country. Those are the types of jobs that we have seen leave over and over. When you go back into these communities. they have not replaced the same quality paying jobs. That is part of why we have got a problem. While the economy has been coming back. unfortunately. many people are being left behind. and they are not having the same familysupporting wages that they need out there. The TransPacific Partnership is 29 chapters. but only five of those chapters actually relate to trade. So much of what we have talked about has been about the job impacts and your income impacts of a trade deal. but this also covers environmental law. currency law. intellectual property law. food safety. and the ability for procurement. as we just talked about on Buy American laws. and on and on and on. This Congress. I think. can work together. Democrats and Republicans. who have a concern about giving carte blanche authority to simply the U.S. Trade Representative and the White House and leaving the people out. leaving the Congress out of that conversation. We are going to continue to fight this. to talk about this and to make sure that people understand what Fast Track is and what it isnt and to make sure that those myths that may be out there about how to help create jobs may not be true. and there is a lot more ramifications that are out there.

    "speech": "I appreciate it. Thank you to my colleague from North Carolina. You are very gracious in yielding to me. and it has been a pleasure to work with you. Mr. Speaker. I thank those assembled here tonight. I just want to talk a little bit about some of the issues we have going on in the West. in northern California. First of all. the excitement we have of coming init is a new Congress. it is a new direction for our country. I think. We have a stronger majority in the House of Representatives. of the Republican House. As well. it is a different majority over in the Senate. A lot of people arent too concerned with what party it is or what partisan issues are. they want to see results. That is what I am looking for as well. Many bills were sent out of the House last session and languished on a desk over on the Senate side. and I think we will now see action on those commonsense measures that are going to help jobs in America. help our economy rebound. and help people get out from under the grip of government power and government regulation that is just killing their hopes and killing their ideals. We are looking for that in this new session. and we expect we will be held accountable to make that happen. It is not going to be a miracle. We are not going to get all the results we hoped for. but at least there are going to be things on the RECORD now that have gone through this House and have gone to the Senate that will be showing the American people what our agenda is and what it has been about. Bringing it back home to California. I represent the First District in the northeast portion of the State. It is a beautiful district. I am very proud to have been elected for a second time to represent the First District. It is an area that has a lot of great resources that benefit our whole State. even our whole country. To be able to have my family here with me in Washington attending the festivities. the honor of being sworn in and getting started. getting a fast start. going to work here in this new 114th has just been a real delight. What we need to be happening in California is a better and wiser use of our resources. You may have seen. at the end of the last session. we were working towards better management of our water supply. Now. we have a deluge of rain once in a while. even when we are suffering drought for the last few years in California. The water seems to all come at once. If it isnt being saved in snowpack. it will come quickly via rain through our streams. and that is an opportunity for us that we should be retaining that behind the dam. so that we have as well the water that gets down the Feather River and the Sacramento River and can be transferred and put somewhere to be used later. We have the ability to have the water allocated as needed for fish. for habitat. but there is excess water that needs to be stored. I dont know why that isnt the automatic protocol. but Congressa bill I cosponsored with many of my other colleagues put forward reminding the Bureau of Reclamation and others that they need to retain this extra water. It isnt needed for fish. and it isnt needed for the normal runs. so we will have more stored later. That is what we will continue to work for. But I still go back to the vision that people before us had that have given us Shasta Dam. Lake Oroville. and the whole State water project and the Central Valley project that we have in our State that we have benefited from for so many years. that everybody benefits from. whether you are an environmentalist. a farmer. a person who lives in a city. or if you just have a tap in the country. If you are not on a well. you are probably benefiting from these projects because we had the vision in the past to build them and we didnt have nearly the roadblocks. Now. of course. we have great environmental concerns and environmental awareness to do things better than we did in the 1850s or the 1880s or what have you. We know how to do these things. But it doesnt mean that. because of a handful of people who dont want to see things happen. we stop the progress for all the rest of us. So that is what we will be pushing for in this new Congress. to build more water storage. We can do that in northern California. Sites Reservoir. and there are other projects that can be enhanced to retain more water. and there are smarter ways to keep the water that we do have to make the water go further because it is necessary. The way California is suffering from droughts. agricultural land is going to be the first thing to go. Any time an emergency can be declared to switch whatever water does get to agriculture to meet other needs around the State. we have to take care of people first and we have to take care of cities. but when we see so much being run out through the Golden Gate that could be saved. or for questionable tactics on fish that really havent been proven for that kind of habitat. then we are missing the mark. So we will be working very hard to add to our water storage and to be smarter with the water we have available to us because we cant count on a record rainfall this year. We are very thankful and we have been blessed with good rainfall in November and the early part of December. but it has tailed off lately. We will need record rainfall the rest of the season up through the spring to have the kind of water we need to get through a good crop year. In the meantime. we should be doing everything possible in government to enhance. to retain. to be smarter with the water we have. When we hear ideas of removing dams in the north part of the State. part of my district. that produce hydroelectric power because of dubious studies that might benefit fish. we are hurting our region of the State. We are hurting our grid by taking enough renewable electricity off the grid that would somehow need to be replaced with other green power to manage 70.000 homes in the State because of dubious lack of science. We need to battle through this and have smarter use of our resources. Another thing that we are very rich in in our part of the State is timber. Each summer we see the crisis of nonmanagement of our timber and what that looks like. It is in the air. It is in our brown skies. We get to breathe that. The people within those communities are wondering why their mills are shut down and why their storefronts are boarded up and why they dont have jobs and why they have things like domestic violence increasing because people dont have work in those communities sometimes because their industry has been taken away from them. I sit on the Natural Resources Committee to get after both of these and other issuesour water. our timber use. and other resourcesthat are so necessary to the rural part of the State. the rural West that has been languishing for many years. ever since the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973. for good reason at the time. to save the bald eagle. We have bald eagles in our rice fields where I live at home. But we have gone so far beyond that rural America is suffering from this type of regulation that it isnt even proven to help recover a single species. Indeed. somewhere around 1 percent. at best. of species have been recovered after 40plus years of the Endangered Species Act. That is pretty deplorable for what the cost has been to the people. to the jobs. and for the communities and their values. But I am still optimistic that America is turning the corner and seeing things a little bit differently and that the job needs to come back home. And the jobs at home need to be revived once again. As a grower of grain myself. we look at our alternatives. Do we want to be in a situation where in the past we were dependent on oil from people who dont like us much? Do we want to be in a position to have our grain crops. the breadbasket of our Nation. do we want to become more dependent on that from people who maybe arent always a reliable ally overseas? Wheat from Russia and rice from China. do we want to rely on that. or do we want to do the best we can? My fellow farmers across the country and in my area. they are good stewards of the land. Many have been there for many. many generations. Some of the ranchers I know. their families have been farming and ranching for 160 years in northern California. my own family 80plus years. We know how to take care of the land. We know what needs to be done. It is sustainable. to use that buzz word that goes around a lot these days. If it wasnt sustainable. the land wouldnt still produce. So this is the type of thing we are fighting for. If we dont have a breadbasket in this country. what will America rely on to keep us fed? With the unrest we have in the world. ultimately. if we cant fuel our own Armies if it becomes necessary. what kind of position will we be in to defend ourselves or our allies. like in Europe. like in Israel. like in Japan. or others we have great relations and great trade with? We are in great peril right now if we keep our head in the sand on these issues. We need to look at the resources we have. As I look at the young people in the audience tonight. one of the first things that I am reminded of is that we are running an $18 trillion national debt. We have lived for the future in the present on someone elses money. And so every dollar we have. every dollar that comes in. we have to be good stewards of. much better than in the past. So every dollar has to go for the type of infrastructure that will improve our transportation system. our water system. our flood control system. and keep our communities safe. and not on frivolous things. I am reminded in California. instead of this water infrastructure that we so desperately need. we have had several years of drought to remind us. they are still pursuing a highspeed rail system in California. As a former State legislator. we were right in the middle of that as it was coming to a head. What will the rail cost? Voters were told then $33 billion to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles at 220 miles per hour. It isnt even close to being that project anymore. and the price has tripled. at least. It has gone from $33 billion to at least $98 billion by the admission of the rail authority in a hearing we had in the State legislature back then. They are still chasing this dream. Now they have tried to downsize it to be a $68 billion project. To this day. right now. they have still only identified $13 billion-$10 billion from the State bond and $3 billion from the Federal Government via the Stimulus Act of 2009. So $13 billion of a needed and downsized $68 billion project. They are $55 billion short. and they still think today they are going to go find that money. From the private sector. they are staying away in droves. There is no way that it is going to be built anywhere near on time. anywhere near on any kind of budget. or that the riders they would have will ever be able to afford to ride it. Why dont we take a fraction of that money. of the $13 billion or the $68 billion. or whatever number it is. and put it towards the water storage we need? We could build two really nice dams with $68 billion. especially with private sector money that wants to come in and be a partner on this. Lets get it done. because this is the infrastructure that will help our State and help the people and help bring jobs back to rural California and rural America. I am looking for help from my other colleagues from other States. especially other Western States that have water infrastructure needs they are looking at themselves. Lets work together on this. That is what made us great back in the day. We have had these huge projects that have made so much hydroelectric power. We like green power. We like renewable power. When it rains behind a dam. you have renewable power and it is reliable. And it is low cost. much more so than windmills and solar panels that require government assistance to put them in and keep them going. Lets do the right thing here and allow these things to happen. all that private sector to happen. I am optimistic in this Congress that we can make that case and put it in front of the American people. I ask the President to join with us and help on that. whether it is that or the further development of energy that we need in this country to stay ahead of the curve. We are seeing prices coming down. amazingly. Hydraulic fracturing has played a big part in us seeing the price of fuel in some areasnot in California. but other States going below $2 a gallon. In California. we are still taxing ourselves and thinking up capandtrade measures to drive the cost up so we will be our own island of high costs. But the other 49 States. God bless you. you have it pretty good. The vision that we have had to do these things is what we need desperately going forward in 2015 because when we are productive. like what we can produce in northern California with agriculture. with timber. with our mine resources. all of the other things that come from the land. that sets the table for everything else across our district and across our State and across the whole country. That puts us back to work again. We have trillions of dollars offshore that would love to be repatriated back to this country if we had any kind of constant as to what the tax burden would be for those dollars. for those businesses and investment that needs to be here. any kind of consistency for what our regulatory burden would be so they could predict. If they are to put 30year loans and 30year infrastructure in place. will they be able to do business 5 years from now? We would be bringing American jobs back if we could repatriate that money back here. So lets get it done. We dont come here in Congressat least I haventbecause it is nice to wear a suit and tie. We come here to get results. To be results oriented. we need to use real facts. real figures. real budgets. real numbers to get to the core of what we are supposed to be doing as to what the Founders had set for our government. The government is doing a lot more things it has no business doing and it cant do well. Lets make sure that we are doing and we have the economy. we have the engineering to generate so we have a functioning school system. it has the funding it needs at fair and proper levels. for our law enforcement. so they are not left wanting for the equipment and backup they need. and for the folks deployed overseas defending our borders as well as helping our allies. We shouldnt leave them wanting while they are deployed. and certainly with the mess that the VA system is. when they come back home. the promises made to them are broken and the shame that we should all feel when our veterans. so many are left homeless or simply begging to have their claims processed. I am confident in this new Congress that the House and the Senate can work together and put these ideas forward. We can put them out in front of the American people. have the accountability. have the oversight that our job demands. We will get there. So whether it is now or 2 years from now. I challenge the President to look at these things from a commonsense way of thinking. Think about America first. That is what we will be doing in this House and over in the Senate. So from northern California to the rest of the country. help us all to be productive and to live the lives we choose to give our kids a chance to live at home. to find jobs and opportunities in their own communitiesfarming. ranching. mining. whatever it is. or related industries in those small towns that so many are boarded up now. Let them have that chance to live at home. not have to go someplace else. go to a big city somewhere. a different State. or even overseas to try to find good employment so they would have the dream they see fit and the one that their parents would like to pass along to them. My colleague from North Carolina. I appreciate the time tonight and the opportunity to talk about my district and the things we need to do there. as well as what we need to do for our country. I bid you a good evening. and thank you.",

I have invited him several times to speak and do 1minute speeches because I am the person in charge of getting people to the floor. I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to hear him speak in a little longer time because I found out how much we agree on issues. I am particularly keen about the water issue that he spent some time talking about. I grew up in a house with no electricity and no running water. I grew up carrying water. Water has always been a precious. precious commodity to me. We are the most fortunate people in the world in the United States that we have the greatest resources available to us. Many times I think we dont appreciate the scarcity of some of those resources or the need to husband those resources in a way that protects them not only for ourselves but for future generations. I have always felt that people who are farmers are among the most eloquent speakers for our environment. As",

    "speech": "saidand I completely agree with him and said it many times myselffarmers are the best stewards of our land. They believe in sustainability. They believed in sustainability long before sustainability became a catchword in the community because if they didnt keep the land sustainable. then they wouldnt have the land in order for their own livelihood. I am a person who also grew up farming. sometimes on a very small scale. My husband and I still have a garden every year. We certainly understand the importance of taking care of all of our resources. but particularly our natural resources. I think so often Republicans dont get the credit that they deserve for being good stewards and for looking after our land and all of our resources. I also am very keen on the fact that we have a diversity of people serving in Congress. Again. I think it is very important that we have people from all walks of life serving in here because it is the diversity of experiences that are so important to us in terms of having the different points of view as we consider legislation. so that there are people who grew up in cities who have no idea what it is like to farm. have no idea where food comes from exactly. and it is important for us to get the different points of view. We need farmers. we need educators. we do need some lawyers. but we need people who have had all kinds of experiences. We need people who have driven trains. train engineers. But every kind of diversity that is at all possible here. I think it is very important. though. that we have particularly a large share of farmers. Our numbers of farmers have gone down over the years. obviously. as we have left the farm and as farmers have become so incredibly productive in this country. They provide so much more than they have in the past. So I really appreciate the eloquence of my colleague from California in presenting the issues that he has presented. I want to talk a little bit about some of the other things that he talked about. He talked about our need for jobs and for. again. maintaining what we can in this country. improving the economy. I want to talk about the three focuses that we in the majority have in this session of Congress. the three initiatives that we are going to be working on: energy. jobs and the economy. and regulatory reform. This week already we have already passed two bills that we think will help us with the creation of jobs and the economy. On our first day here on Tuesday. it got very little attention. but we passed a bill. the Jobs for Heroes Act. The idea for it came from a constituent of one of our colleagues from Illinois. The constituent said: Look. I was a veteran. couldnt get a job because the employer was concerned about going over the 50 limit. or hitting the limit of 50. which then his company would be subject to ObamaCare. and companies are avoiding being subject to ObamaCare. So we passed a bill introduced by Congressman RODNEY DAVIS that said veterans dont have to be included in the 50 persons in a business requirement and then be forced to go into ObamaCare. that if they are covered by TRICARE then they dont have to do that. That is a positive bill to help create jobs. Today. we passed another bill that we think will help with employment in this country. As many people know. ObamaCare has told employers if people are working 30 hours or more then you have to cover them with ObamaCare. So we changed the definition of fulltime employment from 30 hours to restore the traditional 40hour workweek. As I have said in other comments that I have made. from adjunct professors to hourly workers. I have heard from constituents all across North Carolinas Fifth District who have one thing in common: their work hours are being reduced. ObamaCare has placed an undue burden on employers and their employees by undermining the traditional 40hour workweek. which has long been the standard for fulltime work. This legislation will help protect the estimated 2.6 million Americans at risk for lost hours and wages at work under this destructive rule. The employer mandate in ObamaCare defines a fulltime employee as someone who works an average of at least 30 hours a week. But H.R. 30. the Save American Workers Act. which passed the House today by a vote of 252172. changes that definition. and that is a good thing for American workers. As I said. we have three big initiatives: energy. jobs and the economy. and regulatory reform. So the American people are going to see us passing bills all this year and next year focused on these three issues. in addition to the other things that we work on. We work on a plethora of subjects here. But I introduced a bill on the first day which will help us deal with regulatory reform. It is a bill I am proud to say has passed the House before with bipartisan support. I am very proud to say that when I introduced the bill on Tuesday. it had bipartisan original cosponsors. I am very pleased that Congresswoman LORETTA SANCHEZ. from",

    "speech": "State of California. joined me in introducing legislation to shed light on how Federal policies impact the budgets of State and local governments and private sector employers. The bill is called the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency ActH.R. 50and it would fix loopholes within the bipartisan regulatory reform act. known as UMRA. which passed in 1995. I introduced this legislation in the past four Congresses. and it has successfully passed the House with bipartisan support on three separate occasions. Every year. Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch State and city budgets and make it harder for North Carolina businesses to hire. While Congress cannot create prosperity. we can work to ensure entrepreneurs and employers arent crushed under costly regulations. This legislation will help restore transparency and hold Washington bureaucrats accountable for the true cost in dollars and in jobs that Federal dictates pose to the economy. Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the cost of rules they create. The bill \"increases transparency in the regulatory process and protects State and local governments from the burden of unfunded and often unnecessary mandates that waste time and money.\" is what my colleague LORETTA SANCHEZ said. H.R. 50 would increase transparency about the cost imposed by unfunded mandates and holds the Federal Government accountable for considering those costs before passing them on to local governments and small businesses. The legislation would make it easier for people to determine how much these regulations are going to cost and make sure that we are not imposing unnecessary rules and regulations on both State and local governments and the private sector. So I am very pleased that that bill has passed. It is going to be a part of the regulatory reform package that passes this House. I encourage people watching this to contact your Member of Congress if you are aware of unnecessary rules and regulations that are out there that we could do something about. Obviously. we need rules and regulations. We want to make sure that we have safe food. that the airlines are flying correctly and safely. we want to make sure the railroads are operating safely. we want to make sure our cars are safe to drive in. But as we all know. often bureaucrats in Washington. and sometimes at the State and local level. look for ways to create jobs for themselves. create a reason for their being. and pass along rules and regulations that are simply unnecessary for the health and safety of the people in this country. So what we want to do is reduce those rules and regulations. That reduces cost. that helps with our emphasis on jobs and the economy. I believe that is going to be very important to us in getting our economy going again. As I mentioned. we are going to be working hard on our third initiative: energy. We will be passing another version of the Keystone XL pipeline. We will do that tomorrow. That bill will then go to the Senate. The Senate is already holding hearings on the bill. but the Senate does work a little bit slower than we do here in the House. We hope very much that the President will work with us in a bipartisan fashion and sign that bill. We are all very happy about the cost of gasoline having gone down in our country in the past few months. It. of course. doubled under President Obama. and now it is coming back down. It is because in many cases we have been able in the private sector to create more energy supply. and thats been helping bring down the cost. We know that the economies in Europe and Asia have slowed down considerably so there is less demand. We are all very grateful for the price of gasoline going down. I am very grateful for it. Every Member of Congress is very grateful. So what we hope is to help that cause even further by passing the Keystone XL pipeline and have more energy available in this country. We want to do everything we possibly can. Republicans have always believed in all of the above. As Mr. LAMALFA said. we want solar. wind. and all those other things. but they are primarily operating now because of giant government subsidies. What we would like to see is renewable and sustainable energy that doesnt require government subsidies. and we believe Keystone XL pipeline will help us along those lines. I am looking forward very much to our passing that legislation. the Senate passing that legislation. and our being able to send that bill to the President for his signature. I am hoping that he will sign it. I oftentimes get people quoting the Constitution to me and talking about what the Constitution says. Particularly. I hear from people a lot about the role of the House of Representatives. I want to talk a little bit about that in terms of our work in appropriations. In particularly the last few weeks. many people have expressed genuine concerns to me about the appropriations bill that passed Congress in December. Unfortunately. many Washingtonbased special interest groups are confusing the matter of what happened in December with the omnibus bill that we passed with incomplete and sometimes. frankly. false messages aimed more at fundraising for themselves than uniting behind our shared goal of stopping President Obamas executive overreach on immigration. One of the most misleading and commonly circulated suggestions is that the Constitution grants the House of Representatives alone the \"power of the purse.\" or giving the House exclusive authority to withhold funding for targeted initiatives. I am going to be reading a part of the Constitution in a moment that relates to this. but I want to read another part of the Constitution that I think often gets misquoted to prove this example. We often hear the quote from the First Amendment. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" This comes oftentimes from groups who protest Ten Commandments being placed in public buildings or creches being placed on public land. They often quote that. but they usually forget to quote the second part of that sentence. which says \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Congress has a dual responsibility there. It is the same when people. I believe. are attempting to quote the Constitution when it comes to their version of what they call the power of the purse. As I said. they are. I believe. misconstruing a part of the Constitution. Specifically. it is article I. section 7. clause 1. of the Constitution which states. \"All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\" I believe many wellmeaning people believe that that means the House of Representatives has total control over what happens with appropriations. but they have forgotten that there is another phrase there. and it is \"but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.\" While the House may pass an appropriations bill. it still has to go to the Senate for the Senate to pass. As we all learned in civics. the bill has to pass the House and pass the Senate in exactly the same form and be signed by the President in exactly the same form. There is another clause that people are often thinking about also. Article I. section 9. clause 7 states. \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury. but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\" Those two are often talked about as power of the purse. meaning that is what people are talking about when they talk about power of the purse. As I said. all bills. including the appropriations bills that pass the House. must also pass the Senate and be signed by the President in the exact same form. What happened. particularly last year. is the Democratcontrolled Senate could reject a Housepassed bill. It could pass liberal amendments and return it to the House. forcing the House either to accept a worsened product or risk a Federal Government shutdown. which would still not stop the Presidents executive overreach. What we did last December was pass a bill that would fund the rest of the government. except for the Department of Homeland Security. in a negotiation with the Senate because we needed to not shut down the government. Most of what was in that bill had already been passed by the House. We passed seven appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate. but the Senate had refused to act. We had also passed four more appropriations bills out of committee. but hadnt taken them up on the floor because they take so many hours to pass. and once the Senate made it clear they wouldnt take any of our appropriations bills. we thought we shouldnt waste additional time. While H.R. 83 was not a perfect bill. we are all faced here with making decisions on what is presented to us rather than what we would like to be presented. We did have a lot of conservative victories in H.R. 83. It continued our track record of cutting wasteful discretionary spending by $165 billion since FY 2010. but it is no small achievement that the Republicanled House has been able to implement overall spending cuts to save taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years since taking the majority 4 years ago. Certainly. we want to do more. but we shouldnt let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We cut back spending to the Internal Revenue Service to pre2008 funding levels. We blocked the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating farm ponds and ditches. There was no new funding for ObamaCare. and a host of prolife and conservative. progun policy \"riders\" were protected in that bill also. House Republicans have worked extremely hard in the past 4 years to stop President Obama and the Senate Democrats from furthering the damage they did to this country when they and NANCY PELOSI were in control. In fact. NANCY PELOSI and ELIZABETH WARREN both stridently opposed that legislation. However. unfortunately. when people focus on the perfect instead of the good. they dont give credit to us. and we were criticized by the liberal media and the conservative media. Despite the short time we have had. the obstacles we faced. and the enormity of our task. House Republicans have still managed a number of conservative victories. Last summer. a bill I authored was passed. It streamlined the Federal workforce development system. including the elimination of 15 duplicative programs. I would have liked to have eliminated more than that. but again. we take the victories that we can get. It is like being on a football team. You get the ball. and you look down field. and you think. \"Gosh. I cant score a touchdown.\" so I just sit down because I cant score a touchdown. No. that is not what the receiver does. The receiver says. \"If I can make a few yards. if I can make a yard. Im moving in the right direction.\" That is what Republicans have been doing for the past 4 years. moving us in the right direction. Occasionally. we are going to score a touchdown. but if we are moving in the right direction totally. then we are going to win this game. and that is what we are doing. We wish we could have done more. but we are going to have greater opportunities over the next 2 years with the Republicanled House and Senate. This 114th Congress offers us new chances to pass legislation that will lead our country down a road of economic recovery. We are going to work to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. protect against executive overreach. reform Federal spending. and keep America strong. This is Americas Congress. and we are going to be addressing the American peoples greatest priority in the 114th Congress. We are going to work hard to build a better future for American families. I believe we will accomplish that. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have great appreciation and affection for my friend from North Carolina. Dr. Foxx. and I appreciate her comments. Actually. I didnt realize at the time. but some of the things she said leads into some rather painful things to talk about this evening. Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker. I have been greatly encouraged. first of all. over the last few days to find out that Americans are paying attention. They realize what is at risk. They realize there is a great deal at stake in this country. and nowmaybe not more than ever. but as much as everwe need to be about the business of getting this country on track. I have mentioned before. Mr. Speaker. in recent yearsmaybe 3 years or so agomy wife and I had gone to Togo. West Africa. which is by Nigeria. while Mercy Ships headquartered in my district were there. It is just an awesome charitable institution. They bring a huge medical hospital ship into a dock in a Third World country. usually in Africa. and it is controlled by Christians. operated by Christians. They dont proselytize. They do the job of reaching out and ministering. After the ship has been there. blind can see. and lame can walk. People who had massive tumors that were about to cut off their breathing are able to live. Women who had a child and developed a small hole in either the urinary tract or the colon when having a child that had been banned from familiessometimes. for 20 years. they were not allowed to be with the family. They were considered unclean. They would have the fistula repaired and. after rather emotional ceremonies. for the first time. they would be reunited with family members. Sometimes. like I said. they hadnt seen them in 20 years. There were specific occasions like that. And it is an amazing thing to watch. I was there for a week. really was blessed to help out with a number of different things. But some of the West Africans wanted to meet with me before I left. They knew I was in Congress. Some of them were a little perplexed to see a Member of Congress. They were told he was a Member of Congress. but he is back there washing dishes in the kitchen. But my late mother once said: I am not going to have you bunch of boys grow up and not be able to cook and wash dishes. So she made sure we could. and we can. But we had the meeting with the West Africans there. They were Christians. And the oldest. senior citizen. hardworking man. after we had a really nice visit. he concluded. in essence. by saying: We were so thrilled when you elected your first Black Presidenthis wordsbut since then. we have seen America getting weaker. It appears you are getting weaker and weaker. And the weaker it appears America gets. the more we suffer. Please. please. go back to Washington and tell your friends there stop getting weaker. because we know where we go when we die. but our only chance of having peace in this world is if America is strong. I dont try to shove my religious beliefs on others. but it is part of who I am. just as it was with most of our Founding Fathers and those that went before us. But we were founded on JudeoChristian beliefs. If you go look at one of the most important documents that established our independenceyes. the Declaration of Independence is critical. We are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. But the Treaty of Paris. 1783. that was after the Revolutionary War. after the war had been won. but the Americans werent sure that Britain wasnt going to come back. They had the most powerful navy. the most powerful army. What is to say they wouldnt come back? So it was critical that a document be signed. and something put in that document that was so important. that would be such an oath that the leaders of Great Britain would not dare break that oath. that they truly would recognize the United States as being independent and free of Great Britain. I didnt know until I got to CongressI mean. I read history books. I read biographies. I love to learn more all the time. But I was struck when our pastor. David Dykes. his wife. Cindy. were up here and they wanted to go on a tour of the State Department. I had never been through a tour of the State Department. I went with them and. lo and behold. there was an original copy of the Treaty of Paris. the actual treaty. We were told it was an original copy. And I was surprised at the huge. big. bold letters that started the document because that document. if that is not signed. we are not free and independent. regardless of what the Declaration of Independence says. It means Britain is going to come in any time they get ready to. There had to be something so important put in that document so that when they signed it they wouldnt dare want to break it. The words that started the Treaty of Paris. 1783. were: \"In the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity.\" That is a Christian belief. That was so important and held with such reverence that neither side would want to break an oath under the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity. Mr. Speaker. for those that dont knowI know you dobut that means the Father. the Son. and the Holy Ghost. That is how the Treaty of Paris started that established not just our hopes and aspirations and principles as the Declaration of Independence did. this was the treaty that gave us the independence. So. yes. we got back into a fight with Great Britain in 1812. the War of 1812. 1814. part of that war. this building was burned and. apparently. if it had not been for a massive thunderstorm or rainstorm that night. this would have gone the waythis actual wing didnt come into existence for about 40 years. 44 years or so. but the reason we didnt get a big ruin up here on what was once called Jenkins Hill was because the rainstorm put out the fire. The roof was badly damaged. And even though sandstone. marble granite doesnt burn. necessarily. in the presence of extreme heat you get cracks and it falls. We didnt get a big ruin because of the rainstorm. Some thought maybe we ought to move the Capitol back to Philadelphia or New York. but others felt that what was here was preserved for a reason. so it was built back. It is part of our founding. And what we have seen in the last 6 years as this noble effort by our President wanting to bring peace throughout the world by showing how nice we were. by showing that we meant them no harm. we would be glad to meet with them. to sit down. we will give them offices. we will give them things. we will let murderers go from prison. and those type things will show our enemies how really decent and good we are. and so they will want to be our friends and will not want to be at war with usthe only problem is that may work in some common coretype thing taught in school. but it is not in touch with reality because there is evil in this world. and that evil has been most recently manifested repeatedly in radical Islamic jihadist actions. And there is no way around it. The more the people in this administration refuse to rise up and call evil what it is. the more the evil rises up. Last June. I was asked to go to Nigeria and meet with 23 of the mothers of daughters who were kidnapped by Boko Haram. a radical Islamic group. And I hope and pray more around this town. especially down the end of Pennsylvania Avenue. will begin to develop the courage and understanding that we are not going to bring peace to Christians and Jews throughout the world. and we are not going to bring peace to moderate Muslims who want to stand up to radical Islamists. but they know they go to the top of the death chart. But we have got to have people in the executive branch understand this is evil. and it is done in the name of Islam. and it is radical. and it is what they believe is jihad. Yes. it is their religion. It is not the religion of moderate Muslims. but to them it is their religion. It is their religion. It is their politics. It is their world view. And under their world view. you dont have freedom of expression. Ultimately. sharia law will prevail. and either they must wipe you out and kill you as dogs. or some of the more moderate of the radicals will allow you to pay a tax. admit that you are subservient to the Islamists. and they may let you live in peace. unless they feel that they are being led by some religious fanatic to do otherwise. Things around the world have gotten worse for Christians and Jews because we had an administration. as noble and idealistic as it wanted to beas wonderful as it would be if you could just say. \"We want to be at peace and we will turn the other cheek.\" that is not for a government to do. even a Christianbased government. as this one started and was for most of this countrys existence. For Christians. there is an obligation to follow the beatitudes. the teachings of Christ. But. Mr. Speaker. some get confused and think that is the governments role. that if its people get killed. well. if we just say. \"Oh. that was probably our fault. we deserved it.\" then it will stop. It does not. It gets worse. People need to begin to understand what is going on in this world. There is evil. and people are being killed and tortured and women and young girls raped and their lives stolen from them. Christians and Jews being persecuted in greater numbers than any time in the worlds existencenot a greater percentage but greater numbers. I met with many Nigerians who have been adversely affected by this radical Islamistyes. radical Islamistgroup. Boko Haram. And make no mistake. I am not advocating for sending troops into Nigeria. That would be a huge mistake. in my opinion. But we can help them. They need intelligence. We might use a drone and drop a bomb. That might help save many Christians from the horrors they are experiencing. We could work with the southern. with part of the Nigerian Government. at least. to help save those people. I mentioned before. I askedthese were all Christians. I asked did they attack this girls school. because I know they dont believe girls should be educated. And they said no. they dont believe girls should be educated. but they attacked the school because they knew it was a Christian school. And usually when they attack a school. if there are boys. they kill the boys. and then they take the girls and sell them into sex slavery. And in the case of these innocent children. these girls. they took them captive. They raped them repeatedly. They abused them severely. They demanded that they convert from Christianity to Islam. But I asked the Christian pastorand we were a couple of hours outside of town. where I had to go without the State Department or other people that would not have wanted me to put myself in that situation. but getting out to the remote location. secret location. where these survivors were. I said to the pastor: Where are the fathers? And he said: That is another part of the tragedy. They know that girls are being raped. sexually abused. abused in so many ways. They left their homes and they went into the bush because they are the fathers. They were supposed to protect their children. and they feel guilty. and they dont believe they deserve to be in a bed or a home while their daughters are being abused like they are. That is a real human tragedy. Then we hear not of just some violent action in Paris. Franceit was a terrorist action. committed by radical Islamic jihadists who are being taught. so many of them. as tiny children growing up. to hate the West. to hate Western civilization. to hate America. that it is a good thing to kill innocent Americans. and that somehow. in their weird religious beliefin this evilthey benefit by killing and harming what are really innocent people. This is a story from CNS News. on January 8. by Curtis Kalin: In the wake of the terrorist attack on the offices of French satirist paper Charlie Hebdo. one Muslim cleric justified the murders under Islamic law. Mr. Speaker. for those who dont understand. when they say they are justifying this under Islamic law. it means. to them. it is their religion. Yes. it is their religion: USA Today published a column by avowed \"radical Muslim cleric\" Anjem Choudary. The piece. titled \"People know the consequences.\" asks why France would allow the paper to mock Islam. and further excuses the systematic murders as justified under Islamic law. Then it quotes him: \"Muslims consider the honor of the Prophet Muhammad to be dearer to them than that of their parents or even themselves. To defend it is considered to be an obligation upon them. The strict punishment. if found guilty of this crime under sharia law. is capital punishment implementable by an Islamic State. This is because the Messenger Muhammad said. \"Whoever insults a prophet. kill him.\" See. for those who dont understand. those are people who are saying. \"This is our religion. it is our state. it is our lives.\" and until the people leading this administration understand that. it is going to get worse. I do believe what is in the Bible: that to whom much is given. of them much will be required. We have been put here in America in such a place and time that if we stand strong. we dont have to send American troops. who then end up being seen as occupiers. but we can help. We can give them intelligence. and we can give them the ability as we did in Africa. Within about 4 or 5 months. and with fewer than 500 American special ops people and intelligence. they defeated the Taliban by February of 2002. Then we became occupiers and added tens of thousands of troops and ended up. eventually. with over 100.000 in this administration. Occupiers dont do well in that part of the world. If we tried to be occupiers in Nigeria. we wouldnt do very well. but we can help with information and if we get weapons in the right hands. I am not talking about sending weapons to the Free Syrian Army. which is working frequently with the Islamic State. I am talking about putting them in the hands of people who are our friends. Send them directly to those we can be sure are our friends in Nigeria. Send them to Erbil. where I was 2 or 3 weeks ago. in northern Iraq with the Kurds. They didnt throw down their weapons. They didnt hand them over to the Islamic State. They stood and fought. They are still standing and fighting. They helped clear an avenue to free some people who were trapped on a mountain while I was there. My dear friend. DANA ROHRABACHER. set the trip up. He and I have traveled to so many places. My friend STEVE KING was there. and GREGORY MEEKS was therea good man. We also were in Kabul in Afghanistan. There is hope there. We have got to be smart about the way that we help. but it does not help when we cant even recognize the enemy. I warned about one of the Homeland Security adviserstop advisersfor a number of years. Finally. after all of this timeback. I believe it was. in August. he tweeted about the Islamic States beheading and killing people. This advisertop adviserin the Obama administration tweeted out. Hey. the Islamic caliphate is inevitable. so just relaxwords to that effect. Finally. that was enough. They let him resign and not renew his term again. Thank goodness. I have been talking with people in Nigeria and emailing. and I have great hopes for the girls I have met with. these young girls. that they are going to come out of it. They are still traumatized. The families are still traumatized. The girls have not been released. and it doesnt appear that this administration has done anything to really help. As I was communicating with African friends in Nigeria. we got word of this story. this one from NBC News: More than 2.000 people are unaccounted for after radical Islamist sect Boko Haram torched more than 10 towns and villages in Nigeria. a local lawmaker told NBC News. Ahmed Zanna. a senator for Borno state. where the attack happened. said the militants razed the town of Baga as well as \"10 to 20\" other communities in the countrys rural northeast over the past 5 days. \"These towns are just gone. burned down. The whole area is covered in bodies.\" Look. I know that there are people in this administration. including our President. who think you can win over evil by just being nice to itoffering to buy offices in Qatar. offering to release the evil forcesmurderersfrom captivity. and that such wonderful. gallant gestures will turn the tide. Individuals can. but governments are supposed to protect the people. It is causing this weakness to grow. which allows evil to grow around the world. There is a vacuum being filled as we have lost our leadership role around the world. and it is being filled with evil religious nastiness called \"radical Islam.\" As this administration continues to act as if it is not a religion and as if we can win them over with kindness. more people die. Now they are saying maybe 2.000 Nigerians have died today. So I couldnt help but reflect back to my senior citizen friend in Togo and his words. his imploring: \"Stop getting weaker. When America gets weaker. we suffer.\" How much suffering is this administration going to allow before it wakes up to the reality of what radical Islam is? Until such time. this Congress needs to stand up and say we are not going to keep supplying weapons to radical Islamists who are working with the Islamic State in Syria. We will help our friends. like the Kurds. We are not going to keep supplying weapons to people who may have them end up with the Taliban. We are going to help our friends like we did with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. It is time to wake up to the reality of evil that this radical Islam is because. until this administration does. it is going to get worse. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the majority leader has stated this morning that we have to stop protecting the President from good ideas and use this as his exhibit Athe Keystone Pipeline billwhich is likely to come up for debate before the Senate the beginning of next week. It is an important measure. an important issue that has been talked about over a long period of time. and the actual debate on the Senate floor will commence the beginning of next week. The majority leader has moved a bill through the rule XIV process. which under the Senate rules is an effort to bring a bill directly to the floor and not through the committee. At the same time there is a parallel effort under way in the newly formed energy committee of the Senateformed as of yesterday. I might addto consider this bill. as well. to mark it up. So I am not sure which bill will come to the floor. Perhaps the effort will be merged at some point. But there is no delay from our point of view from any of the motions or objections that we have raised. We ask only that the committee structures be established so that the bill could go through the orderly process of committee. That happened yesterday and now it is in the hands of the energy committee. If their markup is going to be perhaps later this week or next week. then we will be prepared to bring this measure to the floor after the regular order process of committee consideration of this bill. This bill. of course. is going to be subject to the new approach of the new majorityamendments on the floor. I welcome that. I have been looking forward to that and a return to that for a long time. We have already said that although we plan on being in the minority for a short period of time. while in the minority we will not be obstructionist. We are going to do our best to work in a constructive fashion toward bipartisan solutions. There will come moments of disagreement. and Members will assert their rights and privileges as Members of the Senate and will follow the traditions in the rules of the Senate in that regard. I will state that when this measure comes to the floor. there are some important questions that need to be answered. I listened to Republican Senators BLUNT and THUNE yesterday come to the floor and say something which puzzled me. I thought there was a questionat least a question was raised earlieras to whether the oil that is flowing through this pipeline is ever going to be sold as a product in the United States. I dont know the answer to that as I stand here. For the longest time. the companies that wanted to develop this pipeline and the refinery have not agreed that their product would be sold in the United States. Yet I have heard Senator after Senator come to the floor and say we have to have more oil in the United States. Initially. as I understand it. this pipeline was to end at a refinery in Texas where it could be exported overseas. meaning that the actual oil product may not benefit American consumers of gasoline and diesel fuel. So during the course of this debate on this Keystone Pipeline. amendments are going to be offered to give Members an opportunity to go on the record as to whether the ultimate product from the Keystone Pipeline is going to be sold in the United States and ultimately whether there will be jobs created in the United States as a result of it. These are worthy policy questions. and I think they will come up during the course of our amendments. I also take exception to the majority leaders suggestion that this particular measure. the Keystone Pipeline. has been studied endlessly and stranded because of the efforts of the President. Let me say. as we stand here today discussing the Keystone Pipeline. the court system in the State of Nebraska is still trying to resolve some questions about the location of this pipelinesensitive questions to our environment. There is an aquifer in this area that they dont want to jeopardize by placing the pipeline in the wrong location. They are fighting it out in the courts of Nebraska as to the right location and the authority of officials in Nebraska to choose that location. That goes on as we debate it on the Senate floor. So to suggest that this is socalled shovel ready and all we need is a green light from Congress and the President to move forward oversimplifies and overstates the case. I wanted to clarify that for the record.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to join my colleagues. both Democratic and Republican. to urge the swift passage of a bill in the Senate that would create jobs. strengthen our economy. and put more money in Americans pocketbooksthe bipartisan HoevenManchin bill to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline. I will talk about that for a few minutes. and then I might have some remarks about what the assistant minority leader has said. I wish to address the Keystone Pipeline project and why it is important. but first I will focus on how the Keystone debate reflects on the state of the Senate and on good governance more broadly. After all. this project is now in its sixth year of limbo. waiting for a single permit to be issued. This debate has gone on longer than an entire term of the Senate. My colleague from Florida. Senator RUBIO. recently commented that the America public no longer has confidence that the Federal Government works anymore. He is right. and the American people are justified in their skepticism. He is right. This project is a perfect example of why. A debate over the merits of and drawbacks to the pipelinea debate that centers upon sound science and agreedupon ground rulesis long overdue. Such a debate represents the best traditions of the Senatea meeting of minds where respect and tolerance shape the contours of debate. Such a debate is particularly valuable because a commonsense regulatory process is integral to a sound economy and the rule of law. Time and again. President Obama has suggested that an issue such as this is too important to get bogged down in politics and that we should trust in the integrity of the regulatory process. To this I have two replies. First. this is exactly the sort of debate we should be having in the Senate. This is the body that is supposed to debate the important issues of the day. When a project as important as this is stalled without meaningful justification for so long. our investment and involvement is even more important. In this case. we have sought to legislate according to the best traditions of this body. reaching across the aisle and taking all voices into account. Second. curtailing debate on this issue has only had the result of turning the construction of what should be a commonsense infrastructure project into an abstraction. a political symbol that has little to do with the actual proposal under consideration. Without discussion of facts and evidence in this Chamberall of which I believe counsel in favor of approving the projectthe opposition has been able to obfuscate the facts and avoid having to defend their position. The Senate is a place where we can best accomplish good policymaking. not political grandstanding. especially on an issue of such importance as the Keystone Pipeline. I was encouraged by yesterdays colloquy on the resolution to allow the Keystone Pipeline to move forward because it represents a return to the way we should talk about serious issues. that is. through actual debate. But that colloquy and the work we are doing today has been met with further resistance from the White House. Even before we consider any number of amendments from both sides of the aisle. the President has already threatened to veto our legislation calling for pipeline construction to move forward. This is an unfortunate way for any President to begin work with a new Congress. Our country and North American energy security will greatly benefit from this project. It improves efficiency and energy infrastructure. It takes pressure off of moving oil by rail. It will increase our GDP by approximately $3.4 billion annually. The State Department. which has provided clearheaded analysis of the benefits of this project. has found that Keystone will support roughly 42.000 jobs during the construction phase alone. It will provide refineries with up to 830.000 barrels a day of North American oil. The Keystone Pipeline is an environmentally sound way to transport this oil. In fact. the State Departments extensive environmental impact statement concluded that building the pipeline would actually be better for the environment than not. We have to be clear: The oil is going to go to market no matter whatby truck or rail. if not by pipeline. Building this pipeline takes this oil off of the tracks. off of the roads. and transports it in a way that is safer. more efficient. more environmentally sound. and better for creating goodpaying American jobs. At the end of the day. the Keystone Pipeline and so many other bureaucratic failures demonstrate that the regulatory process is broken. It should not take years and years navigating the Federal bureaucracy only to have the Federal Government decide not to make a decision. In this new Congress we are focused on helping to create jobs and getting our economy back on the right track. which is why regulatory reform will be a key part of our agenda over the next 2 years. I hope the President will change his mind and join us not only in approving this important project but also in preventing similar abuses from occurring in the future.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is my pleasure to rise to speak in favor of H.R. 26. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act or what is more popularly known as the TRIA legislation. During the last Congress my colleagues and I worked hard to put together a bipartisan bill that gained wide support. However. literally in the waning hours of the session. we were unable to complete our work at the end of the last Congress. I am very glad to see that this legislation has now been moved promptly by the House of Representatives and again promptly today in the Senate toward finalization and passage. I particularly wish to thank the majority leader for bringing this bill to the floor so quickly because reauthorization of the TRIA Program is essential for the certainty we need in our insurance marketplace and for other important functions in our markets. I also wish to recognize some of the Senators who have been very heavily involved in this process in the past. There are many who could be named. but in particular I think we need to recognize Senator KIRK and Senator HELLER on the Republican side and Senator SCHUMER and Senator REED on the Democratic side. as well as Senator BROWN. our new ranking member on the Democratic side. and many others who have worked to help us move this legislation forward. Additionally. I wish to give thanks to the former chairman of the banking committee. Senator JOHNSON and his staff. who deserve a great amount of thanks as they have worked with us very closely in moving this bill forward. and of course my own staff on the Republican side who have put in so much time and effort to make sure we got this important legislation moved over the finish line. Working together we developed a bill that was supported unanimously out of the banking committee in what was a very partisan environment that we can all recall from last Congress. We then approved it in the Senate by a vote of 93 to 4. showing the broad. bipartisan support that has been developed for this legislation. Building on the Senates framework. the House passed their own version of TRIA last Congress by an overwhelming vote of 417 to 7. Yesterday in this new Congress the House again voted by a margin of 416 to 5 to extend the program another 6 yearsthe legislation that is currently before us in the Senate. These strong votes demonstrate the importance of this program. Chairman HENSARLING. Representative NEUGEBAUER. Senator SCHUMER. and others deserve our thanks for bringing the differences to a focus and getting us to this point. This bill requires the private insurance industry to absorb and cover the losses for all but the largest acts of terrorones in which the Federal Government would almost certainly be forced to step in if this program were not in place. The bill increases the insurance industrys aggregate retention level and the company coinsurance level. meaning that it increases the participation of the private sector in responding to the insurance issues created by an act of terrorism in the United States but still provides the stability the market needs to assure there is coverage and protection. Once it reaches that level. the recoupment will be indexed to the amount of insurer deductibles for all insurers participating in the program. This is a significant reduction in the potential exposure and cost to taxpayers. Under this bill each company will take on a greater portion of losses above their deductible. This is done by increasing the coinsurance level from 15 percent to 20 percent and raising the level at which the program is triggered from $100 million to $200 million. As these levels are increased. the Federal share is reduced. This bill maintains the amendment offered by Senator FLAKE to create an advisory committee focused on finding additional private sector solutions to lowering the Federal exposure to loss from a catastrophic terrorist incident in the United States. Getting terrorism risk insurance right is important in order to protect taxpayers and to limit the economic and physical impact of any future terrorist attack on the United States. This bill will help us maintain a properly balanced terrorism risk insurance program that increases the Nations economic resilience to terrorism. The bill also includes separate legislation that will establish the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers or what is commonly known as NARAB. I have been an original cosponsor of this legislation in the past because it simplifies the process of agent licensing across State lines while preserving States rightsspecifically. the authority of state insurance regulators. The bill has broad support from the insurance community. including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America. the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors. and the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers. By reducing costs and increasing competition among insurance producers. we will generate lower costs and better service for consumers. Importantly. NARAB II. this legislation. deals specifically with marketplace entry and would not impact the States daytoday authority over the insurance marketplaces. State regulators will serve on the board of NARAB with the same objectives they have as insurance commissionsto protect the public interest by promoting the fair and equitable treatment of insurance consumers. The idea for NARAB is now 14 years old. and I am very glad to see we are now going to get it across the finish line. The final TRIA bill includes the Vitter amendment that was added in the Senate to require that the Federal Reserve Board have at least one member with experience working in or supervising community banks. Finally. the bill also includes a very critical reform to the DoddFrank financial legislation. This commonly has been referred to as the end user amendment issuea piece of legislation that historically has also received wide bipartisan support. This is a targeted fix I have been pushing for over 4 years. Ever since the DoddFrank conference. there has been a debate regarding whether nonfinancial end users were exempt from margin requirements. Most Americans wont really understand the details of these kinds of transactions if they arent involved in the derivatives industry. But it is critical that we allow end users. those who produce products or provide servicesthose are the ones who are using the financial system and the benefits it can provide to provide productive additions to our economythat they not be subjected to the rigorous requirements that were put into place to control financial sector dealings in derivatives. ThenChairman Dodd and Senator Lincoln acknowledged that the language for end users was not perfect and tried to clarify the intent of their language with a joint letter. In the letter. they stated: The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose margins on endusers. those exempt entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. If regulators raise the costs of enduser transactions. they may create more risk. It is imperative that the regulators do not unnecessarily divert working capital from our economy into margin accounts. in a way that would discourage hedging by endusers or impair economic growth. I might add to that quote from these Senators that it would also increase costs in the marketplace to consumers. Standalone legislation passed the House to fix this problem last Congress with 411 votesbroad bipartisan support. In the Senate. legislation to deal with the enduser program was introduced originally by a bipartisan group of six Democrats and six Republicans. Congressional intent was to provide an explicit exemption from margin requirements for nonfinancial end users that qualify for the clearing exemption. which this language accomplishes. Unless Congress acts. the new regulations will make it more expensive for farmers. manufacturers. energy producers. and many small business owners across this country to manage their own unique business risks associated with their daily operationsan unintended and harmful consequence of the language in the DoddFrank legislation. I mentioned in my earlier statement that this bill had the support of 93 Senators in the last Congress. The final bill before us today passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 5. Again. I encourage all of the Senators to vote for the legislation we have before us today and help this first piece of legislation in the Senate in this Congress get a quick resolution so we can resolve onein fact. two or threeof the critical issues facing our economy today. help strengthen our economy. promote jobs. and increase our movement along the pathway toward economic recovery. Again. I thank Senator SCHUMER. Senator REED. Senator KIRK. and Senator HELLER for their partnership in bringing this bill forward. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to speak on H.R. 26. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. I thank Senator CRAPO. and I appreciate and enjoy the relationship we have had over the last 8 years since I joined the banking committee. He was already a relatively veteran member of that committee and very knowledgeable and very straightforward and fair. I appreciate his work. especially on this legislation. I support the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. and I did not want it to expire in December. Many of us on both sides of the aisle in the Senate worked to try to get this reenacted in December. Unfortunately. because of partisan games in the House of Representatives. it didnt happen. But that is why I voted for TRIA reauthorization. S. 2244. in the banking committee last June. I supported the bill that the full Senate passed in July by a strong vote of 93 to 4. S. 2244 made important reforms to TRIA in order to gain bipartisan support. but it still provided longterm certainty in the marketplace. What was unfortunate was that last fall the House Republicans were unable to embrace the Senate billsimilar to immigration. if you willthat had broad bipartisan support. They waited until the last days of the last Congress to engage the Senate in an effort to reauthorize TRIA. The situation could be dangerous if it is unauthorized. Fortunately. we will be able to move today and get this to the President pretty quickly and at least protect our cities and our communities and our people. While the TRIA provisions the House and Senate eventually agreed on went further than I would have liked. they represent a compromisesomething we obviously dont see enough around here these days. Ultimately. though. the swap enduser provision that was added by House leadership to the TRIA bill at the last moment was not a compromise. It was moving in a different direction. It was a weakening of DoddFrank. It was not the way this Congress or any Congress should enact legislation and should proceed. That enduser provision did not go through regular order in the Senate. The committee held no hearings and no markups to consider its merits or its demerits. This bill was never brought to the Senate floor to be debated. That is what people. whether in Florida or Idaho or Ohio. are unhappy aboutlegislation that needs to pass. things for which there is strong. bipartisan. acrosstheboard. almost unanimous support. and then special interest groups get provisions in that dont belong there that were not debated and never discussed. Unlike TRIA. the swap enduser provision is controversial and overrides regulators proposed rules. It prevents future regulatory flexibility. It allows another avenue for derivatives risk to build up in the financial system. These actions of inserting this provision in legislation with overwhelming. almost unanimous supportadding these kinds of provisions simply doesnt work for our system. It is not the way we should be legislating. It begs the question. Did we learn nothing less than a decade ago? We know what happened to our financial system. The greed on Wall Street and the pain it caused on Main Street in Boise. Pocatello. Columbus. and Cleveland was pretty hard to measure. The financial crisis exposed risks in all areas of the market. and the provisions in Wall Street reform target dangerous exposure in the system by strengthening protections using clearing and margin requirements. Under Wall Street Reform. commercial end users are exempt from clearing requirements. and regulators have provided them with accommodations from margin requirements. recognizing the businessrelated need of the companies. The enduser legislation added to the TRIA bill goes above and beyond the existing law and the existing rulemaking and could tie regulators hands in the future if excessive risks were to develop. thus exposing the financial system and taxpayers to more harm. In just one example that this enduser provision could cut both ways. 2 days before Christmas Reuters reported that \"major U.S. airlines including Delta and Southwest are rushing to finance losing bets on oil and revamp fuel hedges as tumbling crude prices leave them with billions of dollars in losses. according to people familiar with the hedging schemes.\" We know most of us are thrilled with the price of gasoline at the pump going significantly below $2 a gallon. We know there are other people who are a little bit less thrilled. as this story illustrates with Delta and Southwest. We know the economy of Texas and North Dakota have had problems because oil revenues declined. We know all of that. but we also know that when you enact provisions such as this that arent debated and arent discussed. that havent had hearings. there could be unforeseen consequences. Less than 7 years after the financial crisis. we shouldnt forget the risks involved. Lets not forget the impact of the financial crisis on consumers. investors. taxpayers. and the financial system as a whole. What we do here has impact in Omaha and in Cleveland. and it is important that we really understand what we are doing by going through regular orders. Slipping this provision in the TRIA bill is just the latest Republican effort to roll back Wall Street reform. In December. we know the same cast of characters attached an effective repeal of section 716. the Lincoln amendment. to the endoftheyear spending bill. Yesterday they triedand thankfully failedto pass a bill consisting of 11 smaller bills that included attempts to weaken a number of important DoddFrank provisions. I dont like the way this has been done today. I want to see TRIA pass. We have seen this movie before. We will keep seeing it over and over again. This seems to be the new Wall Street playbook. It seems to be the new Republican playbook. I hope it is not the Senate leaderships playbook. where you take a bill that most people like. that has pretty much overwhelming support. is a mustpass bill. and you help Wall Street and Wall Street lobbyists get provisions in. and they can weaken consumer protections. Consumer protections rules on Wall Street will keep Wall Street safer so we dont have to have another Federal bailout. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. first. I wish to thank my colleagues who were here today. This is Senator BROWNs firstjust a day into the session as ranking member. and it is clear to all of us in the caucus that he is going to be a hardworking. conscientious ranking member. and I look forward to working with him and congratulate him on his new position. I thank my good friend Senator CRAPO. who will be leaving as ranking member. We have the new ranking member and the former ranking member. I wish that were not the case but so be it. Senator CRAPO has been a pleasure to work with on this bill and on so many other bills. I appreciate his hard work as well. I rise today in support of reauthorizing the terrorism insurance programa purpose that has brought me to the floor of this body several times in the last year. We all know what a crucial piece of legislation TRIA is for our country. It should be reauthorized and reauthorized without political jockeying and attempts at pointscoring that we have seen through several months. But the good news is that TRIA will pass today and millions of Americans can breathe a sigh of relief. not just those who insure buildings and build buildings but people who work in buildings. office workers. restaurant workers. those who work at shopping centers. sports fans. those who care about having new stadiums. All of those depend on terrorism risk insurance. We all know the history. After 9111. when my city was devastated. people could not get financing to build new buildings. Insurance said the damage from terrorism. both loss of life and property damage. is so great that they were not going to insure without a Federal backstop. In a bipartisan way we came together in 2002 and passed the TRIA bill. It helped propel the economy for the last decade. Because some on the other side are not sure this should be a government function. we could not make it permanent. It would be a lot better if we could. but we extended it for periods of years. It came to pass that it expired on December 31 of this last year. 2014. In the Senate the bill I was proud to sponsor. helped by my cosponsors. Senators MURPHY. JACK REED. Tim Johnson. MENENDEZ. KIRK. HELLER. CRAPO. BLUNT. and Johanns. we anticipated no problem. The bill passed 93 to 4. Senators from BERNIE SANDERS to TED CRUZ voted for it. Everyone thought it worked. It has not cost the government a nickel. It will pass easily. But unfortunately it got caught up in the machinations of the House. There were some on the House side who did not want terrorism insurance at all and some who were extremely reluctant. I will say this: I believe Speaker BOEHNER and Majority Leader MCCARTHY understood the importance of this. I worked with them in the latter months of last year to try and get a bill done. At the end of the day I was able to negotiate a bill with the chairman of the House banking committee who was at best a reluctant supporter of terrorism insurance and came up with a proposal that made some changes but kept the program intact. It was a good compromise. It is the compromise that is before us today. It is a little different than the original bill. Instead of 7 years. it extends us for 6 years. The $100 million limit has been raised to 200. But still. the program can function very well under these proposals. I am very glad we have brought it to the floor very early in this session. I am glad it passed the House. I am glad that hopefully by the end of today it will be moving to the Presidents desk. But there is one sour note in all of this. that is. the attemptand I agree completely with my colleague from Ohio. the ranking member. Mr. BROWN. that the idea to add extraneous measures to this provision is a wrong one. In my view. DoddFrank has strengthened the financial system. the banking system. and this country. The loose regulatory regime that was in place before. everyone agreed. helped cause the worst financial collapse we have had since the Great Depression. There are some on the other side I understand who disagree with that view. That is something that will obviously be subject to debate. But to attach a provision at the last minute. which is what the House did at the end of last year. put it on the bill and said take it or leave it. is wrong and unfair. I think every fairminded person. whatever their view of DoddFrank is. would feel that we should debate an important amendment. any amendment. that would roll back parts of DoddFrank. given the fact that most everyone who has looked at it has thought it has been a success. So that. plus a change in the NARAB provision. which my colleagues have mentioned. led to some problems. We on this Democratic side. while we do not like the rollback of DoddFrank in the end user provision. even last year were not prepared to stop the bill from going forward. But the change our House Republican colleagues made was blocked by a Republican. Senator Coburn. and at the last minute. in the waning hours of the session. it was stymied. Today Senator Coburn. my dear friend whom I missand I wish him the best of healthis not here. He will not be here. He will not be here to object to the unanimous consent request that was made in a bipartisan way. So we were voting on this bill. But the bottom line is simple. Republicans monkeyed around with the bipartisan compromise to earn a pound of flesh in what they knew was a mustpass piece of legislation. I am glad it will not kill the bill. but it never should have been there to begin with. The amendment that will be proposed will allow many on this side of the aisle who believe in TRIA but did not want to see at the last minute a rollback of DoddFrank. albeit one of the smaller rollbacks that has been proposed. to ride on the back of the important antiterrorism proposal. Using mustpass unrelated legislation to chip away at DoddFrank piece by piece. even small pieces such as the end user provision. without debate or even in the committee process. is not how we should go about the business of considering important regulations on financial services. I join Ranking Member BROWN in saying that should not happen in the future. and we should do everything to stop it from happening. The good news is in this new session there were attempts by some on the Republican side to dilute the TRIA provisions further. From what I am told. Chairman HENSARLING wanted to dilute it further. despite the negotiations we had. I thank our Republican leadership for not allowing that to happen. the Republican leadership in the House. So the same basic compromise that Chairman HENSARLING and I negotiated in the wee hours of the last years session will be on the floor today. TRIA will not be weakened any further. I am proud of the compromise Congressman HENSARLING and I reached on the substance of TRIA. I am hopeful we can pass a bill without extraneous issues. I certainly believe TRIA should be signed into law as quickly as possible. because we all know that if we do not have terrorism insurance. it is going to greatly hurt our economy. The damage has been minimized because most of the insurance clauses have 30- and 60day notice provisions. so there has been no effect up to now. But if we dither any further. it will have serious effects on our rebounding economy. effects that I think no one who cares about jobs. who cares about working people. who cares about new construction in America would want to count. I am glad TRIA will pass today. Our country needs it. I thank again all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both Houses who worked hard to do this. I hope we will not find what happened today happening again. which is adding extraneous rollbacks to DoddFrank. without debate. without discussion. to future legislation. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I do not see another speaker on our side so I would like to take a few minutes and just respond to some of the remarks of my colleagues. First of all. let me say I am very pleased to see that we have strong support across the aisle on a bipartisan basis for two of the three key parts of this legislation. the reauthorization of TRIAor the Terrorism Risk Insurance Programand the NARAB provision for the insurance industry. It appears that the focus of the debate between us or disagreement between us is going to come down to that part of the bill that deals with the end user exemption under the DoddFrank legislation. So I would like to talk about that for a little bit. because in some of the arguments about this provision there has been the implication that this is an effort to help strengthen Wall Street at the expense of Main Street. The reality is just the reverse. This is an opportunity to try to stop unintended and bad legislative language from hammering Main Street under the guise that it was to protect us against Wall Street. Let me explain what I mean. Derivatives areI am reading right now from the summary of the House bill. which is the version of the language we are going to be voting on today. I will be reading and summarizing some. But derivatives are contracts whose value is linked to changes in another variable. such as the price of a physical commodity. My colleague from Ohio. Senator BROWN. referenced Delta Airlines. which buys contracts for fuel for their airplanes. They do this in order to hedge the risk on the price of fuel. It is a critical part of their risk management for their business. Other businesses. farmers in Idaho. hedge their risks in their farming and ranching operations in the same way. by trying to make sure they have protected the price of certain commodities they need to utilize in the conduct of their business. Derivatives have historically been used by large businesses. such as Delta. and small. such as the Idaho farmer. and everything in between. to manage the risk of their business. End users trade in derivatives to hedge business and economic risk. That is very important to understand because over time derivatives have grown and the use of an investment in derivatives has grown. Instead of just end users trying to manage risks in commodities for their products and for their physical needs and business needs. many derivatives. in fact probably most of the manymore than a majority of the derivatives that are invested in today are no longer based on a physical commodity but are linked to variables such as interest rates or stock prices or currency valuations or other factors such as that. The market in derivatives has moved into areas that are similar to investments such as in the stock market. Because of that. DoddFrank sought toand one of those kinds of activities was one of the big problems in the financial collapse. So DoddFrank tried to address that abuse of derivatives that was found during the time of the financial collapse. But it was never intended to deal with the original utilization of the derivatives by end usersagain. as I said earlier. those who produce a product such as a farmer or deliver a service such as airline transportation similar to Delta Airlines or others. those who utilize derivatives in their business to hedge a business risk and economic risk as opposed to those who invest in derivatives for speculation in a market. That distinction was very important. I was on the conference committee when we did the conference committee on DoddFrank. We discussed this then. Everyone. literally all of us. including the two sponsors of the bill. Senator Dodd and Representative Frank. agreed that end users were not intended to be covered. In fact. I will quote again the language that Doddafter the passage of DoddFrankput into a letter along with his thencolleague Senator Lincoln. This is Senator Dodds language: The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose margins on end users. those exempt entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. If regulators raise the cost of end user transactions. they may create more risk. I am still quoting Senator Doddcontinuing: \"It is imperative that the regulators do not unnecessarily divert working capital from our economy into margin accounts. in a way that would discourage hedging by end users or impair economic growth.\" So it was not the intent. although it was a concern at the time that the language may have gone too far. But clearly the sponsors of the amendmentand I dont have the language in front of me. but Representative Frank has made similar comments that it was not intended for this to be covered by the legislation. But the language actually did go so far as to cover end users. Now the regulators. in hearings before the banking committee. have uniformly told us they feel their hands are tied and that following the language of DoddFrank they have to start imposing margin requirements on end users. which will cause the kind of economic harm which I have discussed earlier. So it is necessary for Congress to respond and clarify that this exemption exists for end users in our financial system. Now. one of the arguments that has been madeactually. before I move on to that. let me go back and give a couple of examples. This is. I believe. from testimony that was given in the House. where hearings have been held multiple times on this issue. It is true we havent been able to get hearings in the Senate on this issue. but it doesnt mean the issue hasnt been raised in the Senate. I personally. in 2011. brought an amendment to an appropriations bill to make this exemption part of the law and was stopped by the thenmajority. who said they would not allow either a vote or a hearing on the issue. So it is true that we have not been able to engage in hearings or votes in the Senate on this issue. but it is not true that we have not been engaging in trying to get to this issue in the Senate. In the House they were able to hold hearings. I wish to quote a couple of examples of testimony that were made in the House. This first one is from the CEO of MillerCoors. Craig Reiners. who gave this testimony said: MillerCoors uses derivatives for the sole purpose of reducing commercial risk associated with our business. At MillerCoors. we brew beer. and our commitment to our customers is to produce the best beer in the United States and to deliver it at a competitive price. In order to achieve these goals. we must find a way to mitigate and prudently manage our inherent commodity risks. This is what the end users do. The other example is Ball Corporation. which is a supplier of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food industries. In testimony in the House. the CFO of Ball stated: A requirement for endusers to post margin would have a serious impact on our ability to invest in and grow our business. For example. Ball is currently investing significant amounts of capital in plant expansions in Texas. Indiana. California. and Colorado. totaling well in excess of $150 million. and adding several hundred jobs when complete. Tying up capital for initial and variation margin could put those types of projects at risk at a time when our economy can ill afford it. The impact of posting initial margin for us can easily exceed $100 million. while the change in value on our trades over time could easily surpass $300 million. Diverting more than $400 million of working capital into margin accounts would have a direct and adverse impact on our ability to grow our business and create and maintain jobs. Again. my point is the enduser exemption must distinguish between those who invest in derivatives for speculation and those who invest in derivatives in order to control and hedge risk in their businessa critical distinction. Economists. experts. and regulators alike have said that imposing those extra margin requirements on the end user will have negative economic effects and not positive stabilizing economic effects. Having said that. I want to move forward. Again. going back to the House reportand I am almost doneit says: However. derivative endusers. the firms trying to manage their risk. rather than speculate for profits. do not pose a systemic risk. Furthermore. forcing endusers to post margin in the form of cash or government securities could cause harmful effects for the economy and consumers. If endusers are posting a margin. those funds are unavailable for investment in jobs and expansion. That means we are pulling capital out of our economy unnecessarily and in a harmful way. in the very arenanot Wall Street but Main Streetthe very arena where we need capital formation and need the kind of growth in our economy that would then cause us to generate greater jobs. strength. and stability. The examples I have used were examples of companies that were dealing in hundreds of millions of dollars of issues. But as I said earlier. this is not just that. Small businesses. ranchers. farmers. and others. all utilize this in order to hedge their commodity risks and their business risks in our economy. I want to reinforce the point and make it clear that this is something that was never intended to be in the law and that our regulators have said they have to do. In hearings before the Senate banking committee I have asked our regulators about this. In fact. frankly. that reminds me that we have actually had testimony in the Senate on this issue because I have raised it in multiple banking hearings with our financial regulators. They have told us they believe this fix is a prudent fix. We have our regulators telling us they have to issue regulations they dont feel are needed or necessary and that a congressional fix would be helpful to our financial markets and to our business productivity in America. We have those being regulated as end users pleading for relief from this harmful statutory language. and we have an opportunity today to correct that problem. I encourage all Senators to recognize the critical need to move forward rapidly on fixing this enduser exemption just as we need to move forward rapidly on reauthorizing TRIA and passing the NARAB legislation. With that. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I will be no more than 3 minutes. I wish to make a short response to my friend from Idaho that the issue here is more about process than substance. We have slight disagreement on substance. partly from the delta issue. I understand the farmer and rancher in Idaho and the farmer in Ohio and the importance of managing risks. I was also a bit amused by the examples he used of manufacturers. those same manufacturers who came in front of our committee that produce beer or soft drinks that were paying more for their metals. for their aluminum cans because of the overreach in some commodities from some Wall Street firms. But this is not the time to debate that. The issue is really the process of this change. I was part of legislation with Senator COLLINS and with Senator Johanns in the last session. It was a lengthy process. Senator CRAPO supported our efforts in committee and beyond. It was a slight change to DoddFrank. It was a change that we did cautiously. We made agreements and compromises. We brought in Sheila Bair. who had helped in some of the crafting of the language with the Collins amendment. We worked with her. we worked with Senator COLLINS. we worked with Senator Johanns. and I started the process. Senator COLLINS became the lead sponsor of itthe compromise through hearings in both Houses and hearings in the Senate banking committee. There were discussions in both Houses. We eventually came to that agreement with a freestanding bill. That is the way this should be done. I would be happy to have a debate on the enduser provision with Senator CRAPO. Senator SHELBY. and the rest of us. Then we come to a conclusion. we get compromise. and we move forward. The lesson. before Senator COATS gives his comments. is lets do this in the future the way we didSenator COLLINS. Senator BROWN. and Senator Johanns last year. and do this right so all sides can be represented. we come to a compromise. and the standalone bill goes to the President. That is the way this should have been done. and I am hopeful that is the way it will be done in the future. I yield the floor to Senator CRAPO and Senator COATS.",

    "speech": "I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding time. I dont anticipate using that much time. I apologize to my colleague from Ohio whom I didnt see standing before I rose for recognition. I very much appreciate comments made that support the legislation that is before us. However. I wish to make a few remarks relative to the start of a new Congress and a new Senate in this new cycle. This is a fresh start for us and an opportunity to reverse course after a very frustrating period of time of dysfunction in the Senate. I am hopeful and I am optimistic that all of uscolleagues. both new and old. Republican and Democratwill be able to work together to achieve serious and positive results on the many issues before our country that we face. We have to put the days behind us when Congress careened from one cliff to the next. from one crisis to another. and fail to successfully bring forward positive legislation that addresses the problems we face. There are threats to our national securityincluding radical extremism such as ISIS. terrorists such as those responsible for the horrendous murders in Paris yesterday. cyber attacks. and inadequate border security. There are a number of foreign policy issues that also threaten the security of the United States. Unfortunately. many of the administrations responses to these challenges have fallen short of what is needed to successfully address these threats. Therefore. addressing these issues and protecting our homeland is paramount in this critical time. Congress has an important role to play in 2015. I want Hoosiers whom I represent to know that I will continue to engage fully in what I believe is this essential priority. Here on the home front. the 114th Congress must prioritize legislation that sets the conditions for economic growth. I consistently hear from Hoosiers at home who tell me that Washington needs to focus on building an economic climate that encourages job creation and expands opportunity for all who seek to work. We have staggered through a very difficult period of time. I believe. personallyand I think it has been demonstrated by the resultsthat the policies of this administration have not successfully addressed this problem. falling far short of what is needed. These concerns must be addressed. They must be addressed now. There are several areas where Republicans can work with the President and work with our colleagues to grow our economy if the President is willing to work with us. Many of these issues have bipartisan support in this Congressitems that we will be taking up very shortly. such as the Keystone Pipeline. Unfortunately. the President has already issued a slap in the face to those of us who simply want to bring up something that is supported by nearly 70 percent of the American public and has been cleared of any kind of negative environmental impact. But it has been resisted over and over with less feeble and more and more feeble excuses from our President as to why we cant go forward. Repealing the excise tax for medical devices is something with very significant bipartisan support. Seventynine Members of this body in the last cycle voted for repeal of this egregious tax on gross sales that has hampered growth of one of the most dynamic industries in our country and something that provides exports. revenue. and highpaying jobs that put people back to work and give them a good income. Reforming Federal regulations. that are currently preventing businesses in my State from hiring and growing. opening more markets to Americanmade products. and reforming our Tax Code are just a few of the issues that have bipartisan support and can be addressed in this Senate. Hopefully the President will join us in that effort. In addition to what I have listed. there are many other issues the 114th Congress must tackle. For example. just last week an employer survey revealed a majority of small businesses say Obamacare has reduced their profits. causing many of them to freeze or cut workers wages or reduce other benefits. This survey affirms the constant flow of letters and emails I receive from Hoosiers who have seen their premiums and deductibles rise because of Obamacare. We were promised by the President that premiums would not risenot a penny. he said. That has obviously not been the case. We have seen egregious and crippling increases in deductibles and premiums as a result of Obamacare. Now. with a divided Federal Government and in order to achieve needed results. we have no other option but to work together on responsible legislative solutions to grow our economy. tackle our debt and deficit. and keep Americas homeland safe from terrorist threats. That is the challenge that is before us. That is the challenge the American people want us to address. So I look forward to rolling up my sleeves. redoubling my efforts. and getting to work on behalf of Hoosiers and the Nation. and I trust my colleagues will join in that effort and we can move forward in a way we havent in the last few years. With that. I thank my colleague for the time. and I yield back whatever time may be remaining.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I rise to speak on TRIA. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. Before I get started with my remarks. I thank my friend from Idaho for his hard work and efforts on behalf of all of America on this issue. I think his efforts to educate us in our conference and others on both sides of the aisle speak volumes to his ability to lead on an issue such as this. As a member of the banking committee and a coauthor of the Senate TRIA reauthorization bill. this is a critical issue I have worked on closely with my colleagues for nearly 1 year. Terrorism is a real threat to both rural and urban areas. whether it is north. south. east or west. and that is why I have been so involved with trying to get TRIA extended. When we think of terrorism. we think of Los Angeles. we think of New York. we think of Chicago. and some of these bigger cities. But as I have said before. and I will say again. in my home State Las Vegas is considered to be one of the leading international business and visitor destination cities in the world. Southern Nevada welcomes 40 million visitors annually and has a population of nearly 2 million people. We have 35 major hotels along the Las Vegas strip. many of which have 15.000 occupants at once. If a terrorist attack were to occur in Las Vegas. our entire State economy would be devastated without TRIA. But it is not just about Las Vegas. In northern Nevada our visitor and gaming industry is one of the largest employers in Washoe County. which includes the city of Reno. They know unless they have access to affordable terrorism coverage they will have difficulty starting new capital projects and creating new jobs. TRIA has helped many hotels. helped hospitals. It has helped office complexes. shopping centers. Colleges and universities have access to terrorism insurance coverage. and I want that to continue. While I was disappointed we could not reach agreement before TRIA expired at the end of 2014. I am pleased this legislation has been brought to the floor so quickly by the majority leader. This bill before us is a good bill. Yesterday it passed the House with 416 votes. Let me repeat that: 416 Members of the House. both Republicans and Democrats. supported this legislation. I strongly support this bill. and I urge all my colleagues to support passage of this bill. With that. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Madam President. a little over 5 years ago a USAID worker named Alan Grossa contractor with USAIDwent to Havana. Cuba. He took with him some Internet equipment he was going to leave at a small synagogue that has survived for decades in Havana. Cuba. He checked in at the airport when he arrived. took all of the equipment he had brought and put it right through Customs for inspection by the Cuban Government. Shortly thereafter he was arrested and charged with spy activities and the like and imprisoned for 5 yearsAlan Gross of Maryland. I am happy to report that just before we adjourned for the holiday recess we were greeted with the great news that Alan Gross. who had been jailed in Cuba for 5 years. was finally on his way home. I met with Alan in Havana at his holding area in a prison hospital several years ago. I couldnt understand how this man could survive day after weary day of being imprisoned for trumpedup charges that truly bore no relationship to reality. He was given a 15year sentence for simply bringing Internet equipment to the Cuban people. When I saw Alan. he had lost more than 100 pounds and had been unable to visit back home with his mother. who later passed away. Amid their own enormous pain. the Gross family remained tirelessly committed to ensuring his wellbeing and return to the United States. Many Members of the Senate and House of Representatives visited him in Havana. when they had the chance. to keep his spirits up. We tried everything imaginable with the Cuban Government and with our own government and others to secure his release. Tragically. Alans detention was yet another obstacle in trying to turn the page on what I considered a decadesold failed foreign policy toward Cuba. Many people helped make Alans joyous homecoming a reality. notably. President Barack Obama and many Members of the Senate. Senators MIKULSKI and CARDIN. from his home State of Maryland. helped to lead our efforts. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN. Congressman from the State of Maryland as well. and I cant leave out Senator PAT LEAHY. who truly took a personal interest. as his staff did. in trying to help. President Obama was the one who helped to finally engineer his release. but I think the President would be the first to say he could not have achieved this goal without the able assistance of an amazing man. who has millions of fans around the world. named Pope Francis. Pope Francis urged both sidesthe United States and Cubato meet and talk with one another. to work to find a solution for the release of Alan Gross and try to resolve other humanitarian issues between our two nations. Writing personally to both President Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Pope Francis played an important role in finally bringing these sides together after decades of separation. Over 18 months quiet talks moved forward. including a critical one late last year hosted by the Vatican. Pope Francis said to a group of new Vatican Ambassadors the day after the release of Alan Gross: The work of an ambassador lies in small steps. small things. but they always end up making peace. bringing closer the hearts of people. sowing brotherhood among people. ... And today were happy because we saw how two peoples. who had been apart for so many years. took a step closer yesterday. What wise and beautiful words from this impressive new Pope Francisthe first Pope from Latin America and one widely recognized for his humility. his dedication to the poor. and his commitment to dialogue and reconciliation. He is clearly continuing the role of the Vatican in pursuing peace and freedom. whether it be the role of Pope Paul II in helping to encourage the Solidarity movement in Poland or the Vaticans help in diffusing a border standoff between Chile and Argentine in the 1970s and a 2007 dispute between Britain and Iran over hostages.

    "speech": "Madam President. I rise today to pay special tribute to Rev. Michael C. Murphy. a dear friend of mine. a man of great faith who for decades inspired the people in Lansing. MI. and who passed away recently in Washington. DC. a city where he had only just begun to make his mark. Reverend Murphy talked often about being calledbeing called in the spiritual senseinto service. In the spiritual sense of the word. he followed that calling at pivotal moments in his life. and we are all better for it. For instance. even though he was born and grew up in Chicago. Reverend Murphy felt a calling not long after he arrived in MidMichigan. While enrolled at Michigan State University in pursuit of a masters degree in counseling. he got a job at the Michigan Consumers Council. As he learned about the legislative process and how public policy affects families and individuals and communities. he decided he wanted to devote himself to that kind of important work. Yet at the same time he felt a spiritual call to the ministry. which led him back to a seminary in Chicago. For some time he drove back and forth from Lansing to Chicago. balancing a public service mission with a mission that was more personal and spiritual. Ultimately. in 1987 my friend Mike Murphy. as a recently ordained minister. founded St. Stephens Community Church in Lansing. It would belong to the United Church of Christ. a denomination that appealed to Reverend Murphy because it was multicultural. committed to social justice and human rights. just like Reverend Mike Murphy himself. For the next 22 years these causes were consistent themes of Reverend Murphys sermons. Even as the minister of a growing congregation. however. Reverend Murphy felt the calling to serve a broader public. a broader community beyond his church. In the mid1990s he won election to the Lansing City Council. and then in 2000 he won a seat in the Michigan Legislature. I was honored that year to be on the ballot with Reverend Murphy. as I came to the U.S. Senate at the same time. During Reverend Murphys three terms in the Michigan house. he was a champion for improving education. enhancing access to health care for all citizens. and policies that would promote job growth in his great district and all across Michigan. More than anything. though. Reverend Murphys constituents knew that when times were tough. he would be their champion. In May 2003 a 13yearold middle school student named Jasmine Miles was struck by a car and killed. She was walking home from school on a road that didnt even have sidewalks. Reverend Murphy decided that the best way to help Jasmines family was to prevent any other family from being devastated in the same way. so he gave Jasmines family a role in the bill he sponsored in the Michigan house to require crossing guards. skywalks. and other safety enhancements at crossings used by schoolchildren. Since the Jasmine Miles School Children Safety Act became lawand with his leadership. it is lawthere is no telling how many young lives have been saved. That was one of so many ways his actions impacted the people in Lansing and in Michigan. Even after he stepped down due to term limits. he continued working with the State as an activist who offered tips on how transportation officials could improve the safety of walking routes for children across Michigan. He also continued to be a force for bringing neighbors closer together. Lansing never felt more vibrant than it did on the day of the Capital City African American Paradea great celebration. an annual event Reverend Murphy founded. There were marching bands. floats. delicious foods. music. and dancing. About 5 years ago Reverend Murphy was called again. and this time he was called to come to Washington. DC. where he would become pastor of the Peoples Congregational United Church of Christ. We tend to find comfort in knowing that a person we loved passed away while doing the thing he or she was most passionate about. and that is certainly most true about Reverend Murphy. He spent his final moments in prayer preparing for one of those wonderful sermons he always gave that were uplifting to everyone who was fortunate enough to listen. He brought his spirituality into his service to the community. and his service to the community is what strengthened his spirituality. He was a wonderful man who touched so many lives. including mine. in very powerful ways. To Reverend Murphys son Brandon. his daughter Rachel. and all of his family. we will keep you in our thoughts and prayers. We are grateful to you for sharing your fathers gifts with us. and we will dearly miss him. Thank you. and I yield the floor.",

Mike and I have known each other for more than 10 years. I was so grateful that after I was elected to the Senate his wife Chris gave her blessing so he could come to Washington to serve as my chief of staff. Mike has had a long career of public service working for his fellow Nebraskans. including two decades in the Nebraska legislature. where he provided policy and legal advice to a number of our States top leaders. In this role and in the private sector. Mike has brought a wealth of experience on a range of issues. Before coming to the Senate. he also served as executive director of the Nebraska Public Service Commission for nearly 6 years. When I chaired the Nebraska Legislatures Transportation and Telecommunications Committee. I had the chance to work closely with Mike to improve infrastructure across our State. When the time came for me to choose a chief of staff. I had exactly one name in mind. and that was Mike Hybl. His integrity. his level head. and his tireless work have served him well in Washington. Anyone who has ever opened a Senate office from the ground up appreciates the unique challenges that come with being a chief of staff and being a chief of staff for a freshman Senator. A wide range of skills are required to hire staff. establish operations. and even to pick out paint samples. Through it all Mike was patient. he was persistent. and he worked closely with me to always ensure that the interests of Nebraskans were and remain the top priority. He never lost his sense of purpose. He always kept us laughing with those deadpan oneliners. After 2 years on the job. Mike will be returning home to Gods country. the State of Nebraska. which we both love so much. I have no doubt that in whatever path Mike chooses next. he will continue to work for the people of Nebraska. I thank his family. his wife Chris. his son Patrick. his daughter Emma. for letting me have him and letting the State have him here for 2 more years. I know they are looking forward to spending more time with Mike as he moves back home in the coming weeks. On behalf of all Nebraskans. I do thank Mike Hybl for his many years of service to our State and for his leadership as my chief of staff for the last 2 years. I thank him for his counsel. his candor. and his leadership. Mike. you are going to be missed. but know you have made a difference.",

In recent months there has been an increased discussion by both sides of the aisle about the issues relating to the DoddFrank legislation and the need for fixes. Some of these fixes should not be controversial or political. There is bipartisan agreement that the DoddFrank rules go too far. and some of them need fixed. such as fixing the enduser exemption that is before us.

    "speech": "The architects of the DoddFrank legislation itselfSenators Lincoln and Dodd on the Senate sidestated their intent to provide an explicit exemption from margin requirements for nonfinancial end users. I know that is a complicated issue to explain. I have explained it in detail already. so I will not do that again now. But acknowledging that the language for end users in the draft of DoddFrank was not perfect. they sent a letter. which I quoted from earlier. to thenChairmen Frank and Peterson. stating that \"[T]he legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose margins on endusers. those exempt entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk.\" Despite the clarity of their intent. DoddFrank was not fixed in conference and regulators had interpreted that in fact the statutory language does contain an ambiguity which they interpret requires them to impose margin requirements. It is not just current or former Senators who have advocated for this clarity. Regulators have spoken out about it as well. As I mentioned earlier. in February 2013 at a HumphreyHawkins hearing. thenChairman of the Federal Reserve. Ben Bernanke. identified the enduser exemption as one of the specific DoddFrank provisions that Congress should reconsider. I specifically asked him about it. I asked: If we were able to achieve some bipartisan consensus on steps to improve DoddFrank. what are some of the provisions that you think need clarification. or improvement for reconsideration? An enduser legislation reform was one of those he identified. I also asked former Chairman Bernanke about the role of end users in our economy and whether they posed a systemic risk. He stated: I certainly agree that nonfinancial endusers benefit. and that the economy benefits. from the use of derivatives. It seems to be the sense of a large portion of Congress that that [enduser] exemption should be made explicit. And speaking for the Federal Reserve. were very comfortable with that proposal. We attempted to address this issue in the last Congress. We introduced a Senate bill with six Republican and six Democratic sponsors. which ultimately grew to 20 sponsors. but were unable to get any consideration of it in this Congress. Unless Congress acts. regulations based on the current statute will go into place which will make it more expensive for farmers. manufacturers. energy producers. and many small business owners across this country to manage their risks. There are many examples of other Members of Congress in the House and Senate. Republican and Democratic. who have spoken about the need for certainty and exemptions with respect to this provision. I will conclude by reading from a letter sent out by a coalition of end users. These are businesses. as I said. large and small across this country. that are alarmed at the damage this current statutory language will do to their business operation. I gave several specific examples of this earlier in our debate. The enduser coalition has said in a letter it sent to Congress that they represent hundreds of enduser companies that employ derivatives to manage their business risks. in other words. not to speculate in markets but to manage their business risks and that they strongly support this language. Their point is that this language \"would not help financial companies. It would not create any systemic risk. It would not reverse any regulatory policy. And it would not create an exemption that Congress did not intend. In fact. it fulfills the commitments made on the record to endusers by the committee chairs and sponsors of the DoddFrank Act at the time of its passage. The enduser language simply would protect main street companies\"-and I emphasize Main Street. we are not talking about Wall Street-\"from harmful and unnecessary margin requirements and preserve jobs.\" A Coalition survey of chief financial officers and corporate treasurers released earlier this year underscores the need ... Eightysix percent of the survey of these companies responded \"that fully collateralizing overthecounter derivatives would adversely impact business investment. acquisitions. research & development and job creation. Another Coalition survey found that a 3% initial margin requirement could reduce capital spending by as much as $5.1 to $6.7 billion . . . and cost 100.000 to 130.000 jobs.\" The issue is not just fixing an issue because it is going to have a huge. damaging impact on companies across this country that need it for their business risk management. it is an issue for developing more robust economic development and jobs in our economy which badly needs it. The idea for providing clarity to end users and regulators precedes the passage of DoddFrank. and I am hopeful that now we can get it across the finish line. Including the enduser fix provides certainty for Main Street businesses that played no role in the financial crisis by establishing a clear exemption for excessive margin requirements on our economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to express my strong support for the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. This bill will ensure that communities and businesses will continue to have the insurance protection they need to quickly recover after major terrorist attacks. You see. the September 11. 2001 attacks resulted in approximately $32.5 billion in claims paid by insurers to terrorism risk insurance policyholders. which makes the deadly terrorist attack the second most costly insurance event in the history of the Nation. Due to the catastrophic damage. the record breaking insurance payout. and the threat of future attacks. the private insurance industry stopped offering terrorism risk insurance. The aftermath of the September 11. 2001 attacks sent a shockwave through the insurance industry and the lack of the availability of terrorism risk insurance contributed to the economic recession that followed the attacks. To address the issue. Congress established the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program in 2002. The program is federally backed so private insurers can continue to offer terrorism risk insurance. The Federal Government only pays out when damage from a terrorist attack exceeds $100 million. The program is also designed so the Federal Government recoups any funds that it pays out. I also want to note that the Federal Government has not paid out a single dollar since the creation of the program in 2002. Congress has created other federally backed insurance programs to address market failures where the risk of damage due to a disaster is so large it makes insurance unaffordable. The best example of this being done at the national level is the National Flood Insurance Program. At a State level. California created a Statebacked program for earthquake insurance. Since 2002. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program has worked well to make sure the Nation. and California. is prepared to rebuild in the aftermath of a major terrorism attack. Terrorism insurance is particularly important for California. due to my States many large metropolitan areas. its public transit systems. and its many public events. The program makes sure communities and businesses across California are resilient and are prepared for the risk of a terrorist attack. The recent World Series held in California. which drew over 40.000 fans to each game at the AT&T Park in San Francisco. is a prime example of how terrorism risk insurance works to protect California. The U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles. the tallest building west of the Mississippi River. is protected by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. Terrorism risk insurance provides workers compensation protection to many of the 14.6 million members of Californias labor force. California is also home to many major airports. tourist attractions. and sporting venues that all benefit from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. The math is simple: terrorism risk insurance means businesses and local governments will have the resources to repair and rebuild should another major terrorist attack occur in the United States. I also want to point out several positive changes in the reauthorization being considered on the floor today. First. this legislation will gradually increase the ceiling at which the Federal Government would provide payments after a terrorist attack from $100 million to $200 million. It will also increase the amount of money the Federal Government would recoup after any payout from 133 percent to 135 percent. These smart reforms gradually place more risk in the hands of the private market. Due to these changes. the Congressional Budget Office actually estimates that the reauthorization of the program will save the government $450 million over the next 10 years. I do want to express my disappointment that a provision was included in the Housepassed bill which would make changes to DoddFranks approach to the regulation of the swaps market. Swaps. a kind of derivative instrument. played a key role in the financial crisis and we should tread carefully when considering any revisions to our swaps regulatory regime. The provision in question prevents regulators like the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission from imposing collateral requirements on counterparties to swaps transactions with commercial end users. While I am sympathetic to the concerns of commercial end users. preventing regulators from acting to impose collateral requirements on their counterparties could result in more costly risks building up in our financial system. This is the wrong approach. However. terrorism risk insurance is critically important to California and to the Nation. As such. I urge all of my colleagues to support the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. after 9/11. Congress passed TRIA. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. to make sure commercial developers could afford the high costs of insuring their properties against the possibility of a devastating terrorist attack. This is a bill for the people who own the tallest buildings in the world. TRIA is a critical program that helps drive economic development and create jobs. Last July Senate Democrats were united in support of a bill that would reauthorize TRIA and establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers. called NARAB. The bill passed with 93 votes. Senate negotiators then reached a compromise with the House on both TRIA and NARAB. but at the eleventh hour House Republicans tacked on a provision that would roll back an unrelated provision in DoddFrank. and then they left town for the year. knowing the Senate would either have to swallow the change or let TRIA expire. That same bill. the TRIA compromise with the extra DoddFrank change attached to it. is currently being debated by the Senate. We have seen this movie before. At the end of the last Congress. House Republicans tacked a rollback of a \"no bailouts\" provision in DoddFrank on to the mustpass funding bill. That rollback. which was literally written by lobbyists for the giant bank Citigroup. was a Wall Street giveawayplain and simple. It made our financial system less safe. and it increased the chances of another taxpayer bailoutall so the biggest banks in the country could rake in more profits. But it passed the House and then the House left town. and the only way to stop it here in the Senate would have been to shut the government down. Now. once again. the House has attached a DoddFrank change to a mustpass piece of legislation. Whatever ones views are on the substance of that provision. none of us should endorse the tactics House Republicans have used to try to achieve this change. While some might find this particular DoddFrank change desirable or unobjectionable. that may not be the case with other changes that Republicans decide to strap on to important. mustpass bills. If we fail to challenge this cynical strategy now. it will only encourage Republicans to pull our financial regulations apart piece by piece. Just over 4 years ago. every Democrat voted for DoddFrank as a necessary response to the worst financial crisis in generations. Republicans have not hidden their intention to try to undo these basic financial reforms. If Republicans want to try to roll back financial reforms. lets have that debate on the merits of each proposal. But we cannot have that debate if we permit Republicans to attach financial reform rollbacks to mustpass pieces of legislation such as government funding bills and the TRIA reauthorization bill. That is why Senator SCHUMER and I are offering a substitute amendment that reflects the original compromise between the House and the Senatean amendment that includes the compromise language on TRIA and NARAB but omits the DoddFrank change. A vote for this amendment is fully consistent with the vote that 93 Senators took last Julya vote in favor of a clean reauthorization of TRIA and establishment of NARAB. For that reason. I am hopeful it will pass. we can send the President a clean TRIA bill. and we can debate this DoddFrank provision separately. I am also hopeful Senate Democrats in particular will support it on the principle that the Senate expects the House to honor the results of goodfaith negotiations and will not support procedural tricks to tack on DoddFrank changes to unrelated. mustpass billsno matter what those changes might be. The Treasury Department supports this amendment. Here is what they said: We support a longterm renewal of TRIA. given the important role it plays to our national security and economy. while making sensible reforms to further reduce taxpayer exposure. It is unfortunate that some are attempting to use TRIA legislation to modify the Wall Street Reform Act. We support the Warren substitute amendment which represents the bicameral. bipartisan TRIA compromise from last year that would have averted any lapse in the program. I agree with the President. I voted for TRIA in the banking committee. and I was one of 93 Senators who voted for it on the Senate floor. But I cannot support Wall Street reform rollbacks through these hostage tactics. So if we are unable to pass a clean TRIA amendment. then I will also vote no on the bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today the Senate is considering the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. which I strongly support. As I have emphasized in the past. reauthorizing TRIA is vital. In addition to serving on the Banking Committee. I also now serve as the Ranking Member on the Armed Services Committee. and it is through this dual perspective. and from what we know of the significant terrorist threats our Nation still faces. that I am convinced that there is value in reauthorizing TRIA. We must keep markets effectively operating in light of these threats. We must continue to have policies in place to make sure our economy stays on track in the event of another attack on our nation. In short. reauthorizing TRIA is not only a matter of economic security. it is also a matter of national security. I believe most of my colleagues share this view. and it is one of the many reasons why the Senate in the last Congress was able to pass a TRIA reauthorization bill on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis by a vote of 93 to 4 in July of last year. This did not happen by accident but through a concerted bipartisan effort in the Senate to steer clear of controversial and ideological demands on both sides of the aisle in an earnest attempt to work together in defense of our country and our economy. We are here today because the House of Representatives did not abide by these same principles and insisted on including in the reauthorization bill an unrelated provision that would weaken the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. This provision effectively prevents the banking regulators. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. CFTC. and the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC. from calling for margin or collateral protections if they happen to notice excessive risk in derivatives transactions with commercial end users. In short. this bill would prevent our financial regulators from utilizing this tool to protect our markets. Especially in the wake of the financial crisis. it would seem that we should be providing our regulators with all the necessary tools to limit excessive risk instead of limiting their ability to protect our markets. Indeed. the financial regulators have already been exercising the discretion we gave them in DoddFrank to exempt commercial end users from having to post margin through a proposed rule. But by passing this provision today. we eliminate this discretion to protect our markets through this particular tool even when the facts on the ground may call for its use in the name of market integrity. For example. in December of last year. Reuters published an article that explained the unexpected risks that certain commercial end users are facing in light of falling oil prices. The article noted. \"with oil prices tumbling faster and further than anyone had anticipated. the collar hedges left the airlines with insurance against high costs they no longer need and on the hook for protection they sold against a further slide. with potential liabilities on the rise.\" In short. even commercial end users face risks. both expected and unexpected. in their derivatives transactions. and if the circumstances call for it. we should be giving our regulators the necessary tools to police and protect our markets. not further restricting them. All of this goes back to the need for considering these very complicated and consequential bills that impact our financial markets in a deliberative manner. not through attaching them at the last minute to unrelated and must pass bills. I voted against the Omnibus Appropriations bill in the last Congress. in part. because it repealed section 716 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. which sought to prevent bank subsidiaries that are covered by federal deposit insurance or that take advantage of Federal Reserve lending programs from engaging in the riskiest derivatives trades. In essence. the riskiest derivatives trades would have been pushed out from these subsidiaries in an effort to reduce systemic risk and provide greater assurances that Wall Street gambles would not be subsidized by taxpayers. Unfortunately. this provision was repealed before it even had the chance to be fully implemented by the regulators. During my tenure as the thenchairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Securities. Insurance. and Investment. I spent many hours working on a bipartisan basis with Senator Gregg of New Hampshire to thoughtfully and carefully develop a derivatives compromise. While our effort was transformed during the conference on the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. I am keenly aware of just how complicated derivatives can be. and I have come to see that even the most seemingly innocuous provisions can have devastating and unintended consequences. Everyone should understand by now that the last thing Congress should be doing is passing derivatives legislation with little deliberation as part of any must pass legislation. This assault. bit by bit. on the DoddFrank Act must stop. It is a disservice to the seriousness of this issue. to our constituents. and to our economy. Lately. my Republican colleagues have called for working cooperatively through the committee process. and I welcome this opportunity. While this did not happen with this particular derivatives provision. I hope my Republican colleagues will do so in the future. For these reasons. I support the Warren amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am in strong support of Sen. WARRENS amendment to strike the unrelated swaps provision from this very important TRIA legislation. While I am sympathetic to the concerns of commercial end users about increased transactions costs. it is simply the wrong approach to prevent regulators from acting. if needed. to protect our financial system from risky transactions. We must afford our financial regulators with sufficient discretion to act to prevent more financial crises. The financial market regulators have already acted to provide relief for counterparties to swaps transactions with commercial end users. That makes the inclusion of this swaps provision in the TRIA legislation unnecessary. Sen. WARRENS amendment would preserve the current regulatory approach to uncleared swaps transactions with commercial end users. while also allowing for sufficient regulatory discretion to impose margin requirements on the counter parties to these transactions in the future should it become necessary to protect our financial system. The inclusion of the swaps provision in this critically important terrorism risk insurance bill is a part of a disturbing trend. Some policymakers believe that DoddFrank should be undone. They believe that the derivatives reforms which for the first time regulated a market that contributed to the financial crisis should be dismantled piece by piece. Just last month. a major reform was repealed in a must pass appropriations bill. despite being an objectionable policy which would not have passed were it considered on its own merits. This is a troubling trend because the derivatives reforms are in place to protect our financial markets and protect the taxpayer. Title VII of DoddFrank introduced historic reforms of the derivatives market establishing transparency and accountability. Those who would dismantle DoddFranks derivatives reforms should explain to the American people why they should once again be on the hook for deep systemic losses caused in part by these high risk financial products. It does not make sense to undo this important set of reforms. I am pleased to stand with Senator WARREN and with any other Senator on either side of the aisle to defend these important reforms and defend the taxpayer. DoddFranks swaps reforms are critically important to addressing the regulatory gaps in the swaps markets which contributed to the magnitude of the crisis and the costs of the response to it. We should not roll back these needed reforms. Regulators have already provided sufficient relief to counterparties on this matter and moving forward with the provision. as it is creates new risks that are unnecessary and which we may one day regret. There is no need to tie their hands on this point. I firmly support Senator WARRENs important amendment because it protects the critical swaps reforms made by DoddFrank at a time when financial stability is important in our economic recovery. I urge my colleagues to do the same.",

I know he will do a very outstanding job there and we look forward to it. Before we vote on the amendment before us. which I urge my colleagues to support. I wish to reiterate the importance of reauthorizing the TRIA program. Undoubtedly. TRIA is a national priority. but it is particularly important to my home State of New York. one of the worlds most targeted cities. After 9111. I helped introduce and pass the program as a solution to what was a vexing problem in the insurance industryhow to calculate the risks associated with a terrorist attack. It was an issue we never had to deal with before. Construction and economic growth did not depend on whether developers could ensure their property against a terrorist attack. But. of course. 9/11 changed that as it changed so many things that day. TRIA emerged as a responsible partnership between the public and private sector. with the government providing a backstop for private insurers. As far as new programs go. it has been extraordinarily successful. Over the past decade. TRIA fueled the rebirth of Lower Manhattan. I see it every time I drive through it. One only needs to look at the skyline because we now have a new World Trade Center which has emerged from the shadow of the old towers. One need only ask the construction workers who have helped rebuild the area or look at the tens of thousands of jobs that came back after we rebuilt. The redevelopment of Lower Manhattan is first and foremost a symbol of our city and our Nations resilience. but it is also a testament to how effective TRIA insurance has been at creating the right conditions for growing our economy and creating jobs in our cities. Passing TRIA today will keep the program alive and continue the remarkable growth we have seen in New York over the past several years. It will do the same for the skyscraper in Los Angeles. the stadium in Nebraska. the shopping center in Tennessee. So this program affects the whole country. Any large project depends on terrorism insurance. I know there are some of my colleagues. particularly those in the House. who say this isnt the governments role. Well. government hasnt spent one nickel on this program. It has been fully reimbursed. and it is the governments role to foster jobs. to foster economic development. to step in not when the private sector can do the job well but when the private sector cant do the job. After 9111 people werent building. construction wasnt going forward not only in New York but in the country. because people could not get terrorism insurance. That is why I am glad TRIA will pass today so we can put the temporary expiration of the program behind us. I am proud to say that attempts by the other body to either not pass the program or so limit it that it would be ineffective. which happened as recently as within the last few days. have failed. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I thank MIKE CRAPO who was the ranking member of the banking committee. and I thank Speaker BOEHNER and Leader MCCARTHY for understanding the importance of passing this legislation. The negotiated bill between Chairman HENSARLING and me preserves the terrorism insurance program largely intactjust about fully intactto what it was before and has successfully worked. We did not back off on what we had to do. As I have said before. it is regrettable that extraneous measures were attached. They should be openly debated. That is why I will be fully supporting the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. But terrorism insurance will be renewed. and I am very glad for that. I thank Senator JOHNSON. the former chairman. I thank Senator BROWN. the present ranking member. and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. particularly those who voted yesfrom BERNIE SANDERS to TED CRuzwho saw the worthiness and the necessity of this program. which will now go forward.

Let us look at this one from Oklahoma. I want to remind everyone that we had a visitor to the State of Oklahomathe only time. I understand. the President has been in Oklahoma. President Obama came to Cushing. OK. Let me explain where Cushing. OK. is. It is in the central part of the State. and it is the hub of all the pipelinesall the way from Canada down to New Mexico. Of course this is the pipeline in question here that we have been talking about over and over now for months and months and months. and it is one we understand just how great it would be. So the President. knowing this is very popularand this trip was. in fact. actually before the electionmade a trip to Oklahoma and talked about how goodwell. I will actually read the quote. Keep in mind this was in Cushing. OK. right in the middle of the hub of the pipelines going through. The President said he was directing his administration \"to make this project a priority. to go ahead and get it done.\" That sounded real good. The problem was everyone in Oklahoma knew he wasnt telling the truth. I dont like to stand here and use the \"L\" word. because nothing really gets done by it. but he has done everything since that time to destroy the pipeline. The President was making the statement then that he was not going to stand in the way of furthering the production of this pipeline to go down south through Texas. Well. there is good reason for that. because he couldnt do anything about it. It doesnt go across any international borders. But where he has blocked this is where he can do so. because it crosses the international border between Canada and the United States. I want to mention that there is a person who has been very active in the political realm. His name is Tom Steyer. He has been very much involved. Quite frankly. I dont object to people who are right forward and honest about what their intentions are. This is the manTom Steyer. who is a billionaireand he has had several meetings and said that he was going to put up $50 million of his own money and raise an additional $50 millionthat is $100 millionto put in races in the coming election. meaning this last November. It is my understanding that. in the final analysis. he wasnt able to raise the extra money. but of his own moneyand these are his words. not minehe put in $70 million. Mr. Steyer said: It is true we expect to be heavily involved in the midterm elections . . . we are looking at a bunch of . . . races . . . . My guess is that well end up being involved in 8 or even more races. So we are talking about some $70 million that was going to be involved. and I would say that wasnt a real good investment because he didnt win any of those 8 races and actually netted out a loss of 9 races. So again. he has a stated goal to try to do two things with his influence and his money. Again. I dont criticize him for this. He believes in his cause. His two causes are No. 1. to try to stop any further development on Federal landin other words. to try to do what he can with some of the suggested pollution and all these things that are supposed to go with itand another thing is to stop the pipeline. Again. he was the one who made the statement. He also has been very influential in this administration. It has been reportedthis was about 2 weeks agothat he had visited the Obama White House some 14 times. which led a member of the watchdog group Public Citizen to say: \"Tom Steyer has not just got the ear of the President. but he clearly has the Presidents attention.\" Now. these White House meetings were often with President Obamas counselor and chief environmental adviser John Podesta. We all know John Podesta. We have known his background for a long time. Personally. I have known him. He has lobbied for Mr. Steyer to be the U.S. Secretary of Energy. saying. \"I think he would be a fabulous choice for energy secretary. and Ive let my friends in the administration know that.\" The reports also show that Mr. Steyer and Mr. Podesta have met with George Soros. one of the liberal billionaires. So this effort is going on. and I think it is necessary to remind the American people because it has probably been about 6 months since anyone has even talked about some of the obstacles we can look forward to that are in the way of getting the things done that need to be done. The President tries to downplay the job numbers. We talk about the 42.000 jobs. The President said a couple days ago: Wait. those are just temporary jobs. Well. all jobs are temporary. but these jobs will be there for a number of years and will lead to others. The President tries to downplay the numbers by using rhetoric that has earned his statements multiple Pinocchios. The Washington Post has a program where they check the facts. and several times he has been the recipient of these Pinocchio awards. Unfortunately. his attitude toward construction and manufacturing jobs is one that would stop jobs for hardworking Americans. So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisleand this is very significant. We are talking about jobs. We are talking about important jobs. We are talking about highpaying jobs. I am a little biased because in Cushing. OK. we are the hub of these pipelines going through America. So what is going to positively affect our economy nationwide will probably be even more in my State of Oklahoma. The President has done a lot of talking about the transportation infrastructure. Of course. this pipeline is part of it. We think about transportation infrastructure as roads. highways. and bridges. I applaud every time I hear him saying we need to do something about our transportation infrastructure. Unfortunately. it is always just words. He never follows through. He had a program on two different occasions that was going to be very ambitious and was going to start constructing new highways. He was very specific about where they were going to go. But then that was the end of it. He got the word out there. and everyone heard about it and agreed that he must be for highways. but then he forgot about it. I am pretty biased here because I chair the Environment and Public Works Committee that deals with all the infrastructure. I would say this: We are embarking on a very ambitious transportation reauthorization bill. and it is one that is going to include lots of modes of transportation. Of course. it would all be a part of this pipeline and the benefits that are coming through it. So I would say he does a lot of talking about that. but we are going to really have to get down and do it. I often wonder what could have happened 6 years ago. Just to refresh our memories. the first thing this President did was his $825 billion stimulus bill. How better could you stimulate the economy than having an ambitious transportation bill? I remember my colleague on the other side of the aisle. BARBARA BOXER. and I offered amendments on this amount. I. of course. vigorously opposed the $825 billionthat was a checkbook given to the President in the opening months of his office. But the fact was that it was going to pass. and we knew they had the votes to pass it right down party lineswhich it didand then he was going to be in a position to say: We are now going to be doing these things. So BARBARA BOXER and I thought. well. lets get a percentage. I think our amendment was 8 percent would be reserveda modest amountfor highways. If we really want to stimulate the economy. there is no better way to do it than that way. That is kind of a background of what has been happening. I really believe. now that we have a majority. that we are going to get busy and try to get this done and will be successful in doing it. We have a lot of critical infrastructure projects. This is supported by the chamber of commerce and by labor unions. Almost everyone out there is in support of this. Yesterday. I think it was. in one of the committee hearingsI wanted to make sure this was properly answered in the committee hearing because it was in a committee that I am not on. the energy committee. One of my good friends on the Democratic side of the aisle made the statement: We are very proud of the President because our production has dramatically increased during the 6 years he has been President of the United States. Yes. that is true. but it has been in spite of the President. Let me give a couple statistics that people are not aware of. In the shale revolution taking place in this country. we have increased. during that period of time. our productionwe are really talking about shale productionby 61 percent. So 61 percent in 5 years. That is what it has been. But all 61 percent of that has been on private and State land. On Federal landover which President Obama has jurisdiction and can stop itwhile the rest has increased by 61 percent. it has decreased by 6 percent. I think we need to make sure to remind people because we dont want the public thinking that somehow the President is not involved in a war on fossil fuels. He is definitely involved in a war on fossil fuels. Let me mention one other thing about the shale revolution. Because of the Marcellus. what is happening back Eastpeople have always historically thought about the West and the State of Oklahoma as being kind of where all the oil is and where the production is. That really was true for a long period of time. but with the Marcellus coming in. Pennsylvania. New Yorkthe Northeast has been a heavy production area. In fact. I have heard figures that in Pennsylvania. the second largest employer right now is people involved in the shale production that is taking place there. I dont know that it is the second largest. but that has not yet been refuted. So very important things are happening there. but the key to making all of this happen is the pipeline. We know that eventually we are going to be there. but there has already been a veto threat. We are going to pass a bill. I know we are going to pass a bill. It is going to pass the House and the Senate. The President will probably veto it. He said he would. I am inclined to think that a lot of my friends on the Democratic side are going to stop and think \"Wait a minute. this is good for everyone.\" and there will be a bunch of people overriding a veto. I really believe something like that is going to happen. this is so significant. People have said: The reason we dont want this is because it is dirty. This is up in Alberta. Canada. This is going to affect the environment. First of all. it wont. People understand that is just not a true statement. But if it were true. it is something that is ridiculous because China is already making their deal. It has been made public that China wants to have transportation across Canada that would go to the west coast and be able to be sent over to China. If that should happen. in terms of the pollution. since they dont have any safeguards over there. that would result in increasing. not decreasing. any pollution that would be associated with this production. I know a lot of people want to talk about this. To give an idea of what all is there in moving this production around. this is a very significant chart because it shows what is out there today and what can be produced. A minute ago I talked about the Northeast. That is the Marcellus we are talking about. It is a huge benefit out there. Yet a lot of the people who represent that part of America are not even aware that this is not just the Western United States. Just look at that. and we can see. We have an opportunity here. I feel very strongly that our friends up there with the pipeline coming downeveryone is going to benefit. We have seen the charts. Certainly the Presiding Officer has many times pulled out the charts that show the great benefits that are going to be there for the entire country. along with our rapid path to be totally independent of any other country in our ability to produce our own energy. This is a winwin situation. We are eventually going to get it but the sooner the better. I applaud the Chair and others involved in the legislation we are going to be considering. Mr. President. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we have begun the new year of the 114th Congress with a Republican majority and a fresh commitment to get Congress working again. Overwhelmingly. Americans supported the progrowth ideas of the Republican Party in the polls in the November election. sending a strong message about their frustration with the gridlock we have experienced in the Democraticled Senate. So it is time to get to work. time to return to regular order and to debate openly legislation. to move bills through committee. to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. and to get the Senate back on track passing bills the way it should be. The American people deserve a Senate that works. and the new Republican majority intends to deliver. That is why it is so disappointing that President Obama would threaten to veto the very first bill Republicans plan to bring to the Senate floor for a votea bipartisan vote to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline. a bill that was introduced here in the Senate with 60 cosponsors. The Keystone XL Pipeline enjoys widespread public support. and that is not surprising. Polls have demonstrated that the American people are concerned about jobs and the economy. and they want to get the country working again and to strengthen our energy independence. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help do just that. Yet President Obama would rather hold the economy hostage to the far leftwing of his party than put American workers first. His war on energy runs counter to what this country needsjobs and the affordable energy that will support them. I have shared time and time again on the Senate floor what President Obamas own State Department has said about the project. The State Department has concluded the pipeline will not only support 42.000 jobs during construction. but it will do so without significant impact on the environmentand. I might add. without spending a cent of taxpayer money. The Keystone XL Pipeline has been stuck in limbo for over 6 years and has become more than just an energy issue. In my own State of South Dakota. rail backlogs have caused tremendous delays for farmers trying to get their harvests to market. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help alleviate this backlog by taking 100.000 barrels of Montana and North Dakota oil off the rails. freeing up nearly two unittrains per day of capacity that is sorely needed by other rail shippers. The pipeline will also bring tax revenue to South Dakota. The State Department estimates that in my home State of South Dakota alone. the construction of the pipeline will support 3.000 to 4.000 jobs during construction and generate well over $100 million in earnings. It will bring more than $20 million in annual property taxes to South Dakota counties. Places like Jones County. where I grew up. could greatly benefit by having this added tax revenue for their schools. The Keystone XL Pipeline will also decrease our reliance on oil from dangerous countries such as Venezuela. Yet President Obama and some Democrats continue to downplay all these benefits. They say the jobs are mostly temporary. Well. construction jobs are temporary by nature. but that doesnt mean they dont matter. Rather. it means we need to keep new projects such as Keystone XL coming to spur growth and to develop new infrastructure. By shutting down what would be a routine energy infrastructure project. President Obama is creating a difficult environment for future development and projects. The far leftwing of the Presidents party claim the pipeline will increase greenhouse gases. but reports from the Presidents own State Department undermine his claim. In its final supplemental environmental impact statement. the Presidents State Department noted that the Keystone XL Pipeline is \"unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States.\" In other words. the emissions associated with the oil sands extractions will not change whether or not the pipeline is built. While oil prices may impact the production rate of oil sands. the State Department also found that \"the dominant drivers of oil sands development are more global than any single infrastructure project\" and that \"the industrys rate of expansion should not be conflated with the more limited effects of individual pipelines.\" And mind you. this is again from one of the five exhaustive reports we have seen from the State Department about this project. In fact. the State Departments final environmental impact statement also compared the operational greenhouse emissions that would result from the pipeline to those that would result from various transportation alternatives such as rail. rail and pipeline. and rail and tanker. The report found that the annual emissions from these alternative transportation modes would be anywhere from 28 percent to 42 percent greater than if the oil were shipped through the pipeline. Plus. a pipeline is safer than truck or rail. The American people have been clear on their feelings about this project. Poll after poll has shown their strong support for it. Republicans support the pipeline. Democrats in both Houses of Congress support the pipeline. and unions support the pipeline. The only people who seem to oppose it are President Obama and members of the far leftwing of the Democratic Party. After the Senate passes the bill. it will have one final hurdle to clearthe President of the United States. I very much hope he will reconsider his veto threat and listen to the voices of American workers and the bipartisan majority in both Houses of Congress. If the pipelines economic benefits. the support of the American people. and five successful environmental reviews have not yet convinced the President to approve this project. I am pretty skeptical that he ever will approve it. but I hope I am wrong. I hope even more Democrats here in the Senate will join us and send a message about their readiness to work with Republicans in this 114th Congress. My colleagues can help show the American people that Congress has heard their demands for change in Washington and that their economic priorities will be addressed. I am sorry American workers have had to wait years for this project. but I am hopeful we can resolve this issue once and for all. The new Republican Senate majority is about creating jobs and economic opportunities for the American people. and it starts right here. right now with the Keystone XL Pipeline. We hope Democrats and the President will join us. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. even during moments of intense polarization here in Washington. especially over the past 6 years. it is really kind of refreshing to find a topicmaybe a handful of topicson which there appears to be bipartisan consensus. and that includes the topic du jour. the Keystone XL Pipeline. I wish to share a few reasons why I believe that is the case. First. the Keystone XL Pipeline will be good for our economy. and it will be good because it will create jobs. I know there is some hairsplitting out there. Some people say: Well. these are not really good jobs. they are only temporary jobs or some such thing. But the truth isI will tell you what the Presidents own administration said about that. The State DepartmentPresident Obamas State Departmentsaid that roughly 42.000 American jobs would be created directly and indirectly from the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now. it is true that some of these would be temporary construction positions. but by there nature. construction positions are such that you go to work on one job. finish that job. and move on to the next job. If the President has a problem with that. I am not sure what he or anybody else can do about it. There are also other permanent jobs that will be created by this Keystone XL Pipeline related to refining and transporting this oil. and many of them will be in Texas. As a matter of fact. this pipelinewhich will go from Canada into North Dakota and across the United Stateswill end in southeast Texas. where we have most of our refining capacity here in the United States. It will then be refined into gasoline and other types of fuel. By the way. one of the blessings of having a plentiful supply of oil as a result of what has happened here in the United States is lower gasoline prices. Boy. those came just in time for the Christmas holidays and put money in peoples pockets. It was like a pay raise for hardworking American taxpayers. The President has also tried to downplay the jobcreation impact of the Keystone XL Pipeline by saying it would have a \"nominal\" impact on consumers and the Nation. I am curious. At a time when the national labor participation rate is hovering at its lowest point in three decades and we are coming off of the financial crisis that we have had since 2008which has finally. after all of these years. recovered many of the lost jobs that were lost as result of that crisisdoes the President truly feel that any additional jobsespecially 42.000 additional jobsare just nominal and not worth the candle? Well. for those people who dont work and are now able to find work. those jobs are not nominal. For the people who are working part time and want to work full time. those jobs will not be nominal. When we need to grow the economy so we create more opportunity for more hardworking taxpayers. no job. in my view. should be deprecated as just a nominal job and not worth having. That is what the President is saying. I would also ask that the President visit the Texas leg of this pipeline. As a matter of fact. the President did go to Cushing. OK. The irony of that is. once again. the President seems to be taking credit for something he didnt have anything to do with because this domestic portion of the pipeline from Cushing. OK. down to southeast Texas didnt require his approval at all. But what does he do? He holds a press conference there. It is just like the President taking credit for this renaissance of American energy. He has had absolutely nothing to do with it. All of that has happened as a result of private investment on private lands and not on public lands. As a matter of fact. the Federal Government continues to make it harder and harder to produce more American energy. which. again. according to the laws of supply and demand. as we have seen. will bring down gasoline prices for American consumers. At a time when wages have been stagnant for so long as a result of the policies of this administration. why wouldnt we do something to put more money into the pockets of hardworking American families? Why wouldnt we do that? Well. I would ask the President to visit the Texas leg of the pipeline. which was constructed and went operational about a year ago this month and is already transporting about 400.000 barrels of oil a day to gulf coast refineries. Of course. again. this does not require his approval. but that didnt stop him from claiming credit for it. I think he would find it edifying and educational to go there. In Texas alone more than 4.800 jobs were created to construct that gulf coast portion of the pipeline. That includes heavy equipment operators. welders. laborers. transportation operators. and supervisory personnel. When our friends across the aisle spend so much time and effort trying to argue for a minimum wage increase. they turn around at the same time and deny hardworking Americans from earning these highpaying wages and these highpaying jobs. I was reading an article today about a welder in Texas who went to school to learn how to be a welder. Now. it was not a 4year liberal arts education such as many of us have had. He didnt go to law school or medical school. but he is earning $140.000 a year as a welder. Those are good jobs. Those are the kinds of jobs we ought to encourage. and they are the kinds of jobs that the Keystone XL Pipeline would help pay for. Well. perhaps these kinds of jobs dont count in the Presidents book because they are not funded by the taxpayer. In other words. they are not a result of stimulus funds. The President seems to believe that the only jobs worth having are those that are paid for by borrowing money. increasing the debt. and having the Federal Government pay for them. We have recently been down that road once before when we had the nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Remember that? The President said these were shovelready jobs. I remember at the time Speaker PELOSI said they were targeted. temporary. and timely. I think it was. It was the three ts. The President came back later onwhen the stimulus did not have the desired effect and the $1 trillion of borrowed money. including interest. didnt create the kind of economic recovery he had hoped forand said: Well. I guess shovel ready didnt really mean shovel ready. as if it were a joke. Well. this Keystone XL Pipeline is paid for as a result of private investment and not as a result of tax dollarsyour money and my money going into this pipeline. The Texas portion of the pipeline was a $2.3 billion private sector investment. The taxpayer funded infrastructure project seemed to be the only kind of investment the President actually wants to see and encourage. There are many examples. and perhaps the most notorious of which was Solyndra. where the Federal taxpayer was asked to sink a bunch of money into a project that basically flopped because there was no market for what they were making. It was not economically viable. But that is the kind of investment the President wants to encourage while discouraging private investment that creates jobs. Now. in Texas we are proud of that portion of the Keystone XL Pipeline. and like so much of what makes my State successful. it was not built by the government. I am proud of the fact that my State is doing better than the rest of the country. I wish the rest of the country would do as well when it comes to job creation and opportunity because I worry. as I think many parents worry. that we are somehow losing the hope and the aspiration for the American dream. When young men and women graduate from college and cant find jobs so they end up living with their parents. we here in Washington say. that is OK. because we will let your parents keep you on their health insurance coverage until you are 26. as if that is supposed to be some kind of answer to their inability to find work commensurate with their education and training. Well. this is not a government solution. Of course. we all remember the President notoriously said to the private sector: Well. you didnt build that. That certainly doesnt apply here because the private sector did build the Texas portion. and what we would like to do is complete the CanadianU.S. portion so we can get even more of this oil down to Texas and refine it into gasoline so it is available to consumers here in the United States. The President acts as though if we dont complete this pipeline. this oil is not going to be produced. That is malarkey. We know that China is starved for natural resources. and Canada is not just going to sit on this valuable natural resource. They are going to build a pipeline to the Pacific Ocean. put it on a tanker. and send it to China or other countries that need those natural resources. Well. I am beginning to think the one reason why the Texas leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline was so successful is because the Federal Government didnt have anything to do with it. That seems to be the test. If the Federal Government has something to do with it. it ends up not delivering as promised. But if the private sector does it. it has the potential of living up to expectations. Well. we all know the President has continued to delay making a final decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. I know last year the distinguished Presiding Officer sponsored the bill in the House that approved the Keystone XL Pipeline. Over here in the Senate. I remember the Senator from Louisiana. Ms. Landrieu. was urgingin almost desperate termsthat Senator HARRY REID allow a vote on the Keystone XL Pipeline after denying it for many months. even years. Well. we know what happened. It failed because very few Democrats on that side of the aisle decided to support the Keystone XL Pipeline. Perhaps it was because even at that time the President said he was undecided whether to sign it or to veto it. There have been times when the President has saidof course. he says lots of things. but I have learned one thing around Washington. DC: We cant just listen to what people say. we have to watch what they do. The President indicated. with the start of this new Congress following the November 4 election. that he was looking forward to working with the new Congress in a constructive way. I just have to ask you. Mr. President: Is it constructive to issue a veto threat on a piece of legislation before it is even voted out of the energy committee and isnt even on the floor for consideration by the Senate? The majority leader. Senator MCCONNELL. the senior Senator from Kentucky. has said we are going to have an open amendment process. a procedure many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. and actually many on this side of the aisle. havent experienced under the former majority leaderan open amendment process. I anticipate there are going to be a number of amendments offered. some of which will succeed and some of which will not succeed. I dont know anybody who can tell us right now exactly how this bill will leave the Senate. although I am confident it will pass since there are at least 63 Senators. on a bipartisan basis. who said they will vote for it. As we know. 60 is the magic number in the Senate. so we have a pretty good idea it will pass. But we dont know what other measures will be attached to it. some of which may command more Democratic votes. some of which may make the President more interested in taking another look at this legislation. So to prematurely issue a veto threat before the Keystone XL Pipeline is even voted out of committee. much less comes to the Senate floor. does not strike me as wanting to work with the Congress. just the opposite. I say enough is enough. That is what we heard from the voters on November 4: Enough is enough. They are sick and tired of the dysfunction in Washington. DC. I heard that story daily back in Texas and around the country as I traveled: Enough is enough. We want Congress to function. We want our elected representatives to work together to find solutions to the problems facing our country. and the No. 1 problem is not enough jobs. There are not enough good jobs for hardworking Americans. So now the President has. in spite of this. said: I am not going to sign that legislation once it reaches my desk. He said this before the Senate has even acted on it. It is just breathtaking. Is that within the Presidents authority under the Constitution? Yes. it is. The President can either sign legislation or he can veto legislation. The Constitution gives him that authority. But I think the President ought to have to explain to the American people his reasons for saying he will not sign this legislation. Again. this is the same project his own State Department said would create 42.000 jobs. again at a time when the percentage of people in the workforce is at a 30year low. While unemployment is coming down. unfortunately a lot of it has to do with the fact that people are not looking for work and have dropped out of the workforce. They have given up. Hopefully. in spite of the Federal Governmentand I say it is in spite of the Federal Governmentthe economy seems to be strong enough to be growing. finally. but we need to continue to have our economy grow. We need to continue to let this American economy create jobs for hardworking American taxpayers. I say in closing that I hope the President makes his decision not wearing ideological blinders. not just listening to the hard left base of the Democratic Party that thinks we can somehow survive and prosper with only wind turbines and solar panels. By the way. Texas actually produces more electricity on wind energy than any other State in the Nation. We do believe in an \"all of the above\" policy. The President says he does but apparently does not. at least his actions would so indicate. So we are missing out on a golden opportunity to further enhance North American energy security with one of our strongest allies. and that is another very important reason for this. Why in the world would we continue to import oil from Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East that have their own problems. in an unstable region of the world. when we could import that oil from our best ally and nextdoor neighbor. Canada. and in a way that benefits our economy and creates jobs. I believe what the American people said on November 4 is they want effective. efficient. and accountable government and one that benefits all hardworking Americans and especially hardworking American taxpayers. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to recognize Jeanne Atkins. my Oregon State director. who is retiring from team Merkley this month. Jeanne is a longserving member of my team. and she is an outstanding public servant. an individual who has dedicated her life to making the world a better place. Jeanne Atkins and I first began working together a decade ago after I took up the post of Democratic leader in the Oregon State House. It was a challenging but exciting time as my leadership team worked to build our policy agenda and get our caucus operations up to speed. A key component of that effort. of course. was to hire a superb caucus director. Thus. it came to pass that four members of my leadership team were seated in the Old Wives Tale restaurant brainstorming over candidates for the position. That group consisted. in addition to myself. of Diane Rosenbaum. who is now majority leader of the Oregon Senate. Dave Hunt. who became majority leader of the house and then speaker of the Oregon House. and Brad Avakian. who is now Oregons labor commissioner. As we were brainstorming. Diane spoke up and said: I know someone who would be tremendous. but I am sure she would never take the position. Dave Hunt encouraged Diane to put the name forward anyway. and when Diane said the person is Jeanne Atkins. Brad Avakian responded: Jeanne? I know her. and she would be great. We immediately called Jeanne. and by that evening I was sitting in her living room attempting to persuade her that she would be just the right person for the position and that. moreover. she would enjoy the challenge. Fortunately for us. Jeanne did take the position. and thus began a decade of close collaboration. The leadership. conviction. and hard work Jeanne Atkins brought to our team allowed us to make a big impact as the minority party during the legislature and an even bigger impact when we won the majority 2 years later. At that point I became speaker of the Oregon House and Jeanne became my chief of staff. Few legislative sessions in Oregon history have seen the passage of as many major bills as that 2007 session. and no individual was more important to the success of that session than Jeanne Atkins. We passed domestic partnerships and a broadbased civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination against LGBT Oregonians in employment. in housing. and in public accommodations. We passed legislation setting ambitious renewable energy standards and making Oregon a national leader in the transition to green energy. We cracked down on predatory payday lenders that were bankrupting our working families. We passed the Access to Birth Control Act requiring insurance plans in Oregon to cover contraceptives just as they do other medication. a law that is now helping to shield Oregon women from the misguided Hobby Lobby decision. Through this all. we worked across the aisle. encouraging bipartisan cooperation. and were able to put together a session that a major newspaper. The Oregonian. deemed the most productive in a generation. After I was elected to the U.S. Senate and took that office in January of 2009. Jeanne stayed on in the Oregon House as chief of staff to the new speaker. Dave Hunt. who had helped to hire her 6 years earlier. In that role. Jeanne played a pivotal role in expanding health care to Oregon children. As Dave relates. after Oregonians rejected a ballot measure in 2008 that would have raised the cigarette tax to expand health care to lowincome children. the Oregon Legislature was seeking an alternative strategy to fund that expansion. Jeanne was the key staff member who brought a contentious dialogue among legislators to a compromise funding strategy that was successfully passed into law. That achievement brought health care to an additional 90.000 children per year. Well done. Jeanne. That was an extraordinary accomplishment. After the completion of that Oregon legislative session. I was hoping I would have the opportunity to bring Jeanne back onto team Merkley. The stars aligned and she became my Oregon State director in August of 2009. Oregons House loss was the U.S. Senates gain. In her more than 5 years as State director. Jeanne has overseen hundreds of townhalls. thousands of meetings. and has made sure the millions of Americans who call Oregon home have a voice in the U.S. Senate. I wrote the day I hired her as Oregon State director that \"Jeanne is greatly respected by Oregonians of all political stripes for her hard work and her dedication to this State.\" Today. that statement is even more true than 5 years ago. Jeanne is known across the State as an honest broker who works hard to bring the voices of all Oregonians into our office. She is a tough advocate for our State and has never hesitated to stand up for what she thinks is right and what she thinks is best for Oregon. Of course. over the last 5 years. we have also had the chance to get into a few adventuresand a few misadventurestraveling around the State. On one memorable townhall swing. we were on our way between rural townhalls when I suggested an impromptu revision of our route. I thought it would be interesting to take a shortcut via a minor semipaved road. That road turned out to have been abandoned so long ago that after a few miles it was no longer even visible. So there we were traveling offroad in a van that was not designed for offroad navigation. wondering if we were choosing the right path through the field or between the trees. To make matters worse. we quickly lost cell phone communication and couldnt alert the advance team that we were going to be late to the townhall. In fact. we were wondering whether we might be out there in the woods for a night or two as we worked to walk our way out should we break an axle or blow a tire. Through this all. though I could tell Jeannes blood pressure and distress were elevating. she displayed the same unflappable demeanor that made her so effective in contentious policy dialogues with overwrought legislators. In that moment and in so many others. Jeanne was grace under pressure personified. Jeanne is not someone who got into politics to be important or powerful. She got into policy and politics because she believed in public service and she believed that each person has the power to make a difference. It is one of the attributes I most value about having her on my team. It is an attribute that has allowed her to make a huge impact in many of the different positions she has held. Today. as Jeanne looks forward to the next chapter of her life in retirement. it seems only appropriate to reflect back and look at the huge difference Jeanne has made not just in our office but over the course of her career. She has been a longtime advocate for womens rights. This comes from her childhood growing up in Bremerton. WA. in the 1960s. Her own experiences also shaped Jeannes steadfast determination for equality. She told me a story about her first job out of college as a bank teller in Seattle. WA. During that first job. the women in the bank. regardless of their position. were required to take turns making lunch for the entire bank every Friday. Jeanne worked hard to shine at this task. just as she worked hard to shine at all her other tasks. but she knew it was wrong that all the women in the office were treated differently than the men. and she carried her passion for that throughout her career. Jeanne went to work for the Womens Equity Action League here in Washington. DC. and when she and her husband John went back to Oregon she worked for the Oregon Womens Rights Coalition. the United Way of the Columbia/Willamette. Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette. and then as manager of the Womens and Reproductive Health Section of the Department of Human Services. Her long and storied career has been powerfully connected to equality and an unshakable commitment to womens health. Along the way. Jeanne also engaged in electoral politics. She ran for the Oregon house twice in the early 1990s. narrowly losing against a wellestablished incumbent in her second race. As Brad Avakian relates. in the process. she restored doortodoor canvassing and relationship building in Washington County as a political art form. Jeanne Atkins is an Oregon gem. I wish her the best in retirement and know that she has many more adventures ahead and many more contributions to make. Thank you. Jeanne. for working hard to make Oregon. our Nation. and our world a better place. We will miss you. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I come to the floor today at the start of this new year and this new Congress to speak about how we can and why we must work together to improve the Affordable Care Act. Since work on health care reform really began in earnest in 2009. debate in this Chamber and across this country has too often been defined by fantastic claims and fearmongering. In the midst of this division. I believe that too often the experiences of real people have been lost. While politicians on both sides cling to their sacred cows. too many Americans become casualties of our divided politics. On few issues has this been more true than on health care. Critics of the Affordable Care Act seem locked into the belief that it will bring about Americas demisedespite little evidence to support them. Too often they have been unable or unwilling to grapple with the reality of those whose lives the law has forever changed for the better. Now. on the other side of the aisle. wemostly Democratshave often shied away from acknowledging some of the laws weaknesses. I know many of my colleagues have been eager and have offered fixes to the law. But without willing Republican partners. we have not made enough progress. As I have spent time in my home State of Delaware in recent months listening to families and other folks who have been affected by the lawfor better or for worseit has become clear to me that this stalemate is unsustainable. On many days. I have met Delawareans who love the Affordable Care Act. whose lives have literally been saved by it. But in between those encounters. I have also met many. small business owners in particular. who want to offer health insurance to their workers and are struggling to afford it. This much has become clear to me: No conversation about the Affordable Care Act and how to improve it can be complete without reconciling the reality of the millions of Americans it has helped and the many others for whom it falls short. Michelle Reed is the Delawarean whom I have come to know and admire with breast cancer and who contacted me first about this issue last fall. She is an example of why the Affordable Care Act is so important. Michelle was first diagnosed with cancer back in 2008 and went through month after painful month of chemo and radiation therapy as well as surgery. Over the next few years since her cancer nightmare began she faced problems that were sadly typical of how our health insurance system used to work. At the time she was first diagnosed. she and her husband received health insurance through her husbands employer. Her husband is an auto mechanic and worked for a small auto body shop. But though the insurance he got through his work was helpful for routine minor health care needs. it was a barebones insurance policy. as she explained it to me. It left her and her husband with extremely high copays. straining their family budget. Naturally her husband began looking for a new job to provide better health insurance. But this ended up being much more difficult than it seemed. because transitioning to a new job often required accepting a large 3month gap in coverage. a gap Michelle just could not afford. as insurance companies would then deny her care considering her cancer a preexisting condition. At one point during Michelles years of treatment. her husbands employer switched health care plans and in the process missed one premium payment. Suddenly. after months of having had steady. positive progress in her care. without any warning or notification. Michelle started getting billsnot just small bills but huge bills. a bill for $23.000 for radiation. It took her months of going back and forth between employer and insurance company. all the while as she is also trying to overcome her disease. before Michelle and her husband got a straight answer about why they were suddenly facing these huge costs. Now. lets step back for a second. Just imagine where she was. Michelle has cancer. She is shuttling from chemo to radiation. Her husband is working constantly to try to cover the high premiums. trying to get all of the overtime he can. During this. they are also going back and forth between employer and insurance company. trying to figure out where this new high charge they cannot afford had come from. Meanwhile. Michelles husband was out looking for a new job with better insurance. struggling to find one because Michelle would face discrimination and could not get coverage. The emotional strain on a family and a loved one battling cancer is enormous. almost unimaginable. But if you add to that the financial and the emotional stress caused by our relic of a health care insurance system of that time. that is unimaginable. Yet this is the reality that Michelle and her family faced. Unfortunately. it is the reality that millions of Americans used to face before the Affordable Care Act. These problems all changed last year when the ACA exchanges came on line. As Michelle wrote to me: The ACA open enrollment began and we could not get signed up quick enough. although it did take her a little while because the administrations Web site had some problems. She persevered. As she said to me in her note: We have no problems now. We have what we need. and we need what we have. People like Michelle are why Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in the first place. It is because of the law that millions of Americans now have access to quality and affordable health insurance that was once desperately out of reach for them. But the story is not complete. unless we are cleareyed about where this law also falls short. As the President and many have recognized. any significant reform such as the Affordable Care Act is going to have weaknesses and unintended consequences that only become apparent after the law is being implemented. This has been true throughout our history with every major event. and health care reform is no different. In Delaware. among the many whom the law has helped. I have also seen how some of those reforms in the costs they have incurred have hurt small business. To the small business owners with whom I have sat down and listened to. their employees are not labor costs or rows on a balance sheet. They are family. They have worked together for years and owners provide health insurance because they believe it is the right thing to do for the workers who help their business grow. Many of the folks I have sat down and visited with are not required to provide insurance because they have fewer than 50 fulltime workers. They still want to do so because it is the right thing to do. It helps them incentivize and support their best employees. Many. though. are struggling today because of higher costs and the challenges that come with navigating a changed insurance market. This year the biggest issue they face is how higher quality standards have also caused premiums to increaseoften to unaffordable levels. This has been especially true for a small State such as like Delaware. where there is not a lot of competition in the provision of health care or in our insurance market. Unfortunately. some of the increases are also due to insurance companies using the health care law as an excuse to charge more. Some of this is simply the result of plans that now cover more are costing more. For the most part. that is not a bad thing. But the Affordable Care Act was designed to compensate for increased quality with financial assistance to those who cannot afford it. In Michelle Reeds case. this increased quality was greatalmost literally life saving. For people such as her. those insurance plans now need to meet certain standards. and in particular. that they can no longer discriminate against preexisting conditions. But we have also seen that even though there is assistance to many. some individuals and some small businesses have fallen into gaps where they have to deal with higher costs and they are not getting the help they deserve. Here is where we are. The Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans. It also can be improved to help many more. When we talk about health care. it is simply dishonest to leave one side out when talking about others. In this new Congress. I know many of my Republican colleagues are eager to continue the efforts of their colleagues in the House. In their majority. I know many will seek an opportunity to vote on repealing or dismantling the Affordable Care Act. But I ask them for an answer to Michelle Reed and to the many Americans such as her who have had their lives changed or even saved by this law. I know many of my Democratic colleagues are as well eager to work together to improve our health care system. to ensure small businesses do the right thing and can be successful and to ensure that no American gets left behind. We know this is possible. There is no reason to believe that we as a body lack the creativity. the drive. and the ability to work together across the aisle on these important issues. Surely there is much we can do to reduce the costs through more competition. to develop new and more efficient delivery systems and innovative payment models. The Affordable Care Act took critical steps to move forward in each of these areas. Millions more have health insurance and costs across our health care system have actually increased at the slowest rate in decades. For most. costs have been manageable or even decreasing. But critical work remains. We now have the opportunity. to take the next step to build a health care system that works for every American. It is my sincere hope that we can come together and seize that opportunity. I yield the floor.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. these will be my first remarks of the 114th Congress. I am encouraged by the commitment of many of my colleagues. including the majority leader. to restoring the Senate as one of Americas great institutions. It is time for us to get to work. We begin this Congress with a number of urgent prioritiesnot the least of which is job creation. More than 9 million Americans are still unemployed. More significantly. perhaps. millions more have given up looking for work. The latest jobs report from the Department of Labor shows that the labor force participation rate is only 62.8 percentone of the lowest levels in 36 years. This number matters because it reflects the size of the U.S. workforce. It reflects how many workingage Americans have a job or are actively looking for one. Now. some people have suggested we should take heart in the latest job figures. that this points to an improving economy. I disagree with that. I am not at all satisfied with these employment numbers. particularly with the fact that only 62 percent of eligible members of the labor force actually are choosing to participate. To me. a shrinking workforce points to a weak economy. Boosting the job market is important to boosting future economic growth. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance jobcreating legislation that has a positive impact on Americans daily lives. Fortunately. dozens of job bills were passed during the last term of Congress by the House of Representatives. These ideas deserve consideration and debate in this Chamber. I think in the new Congress. these ideas will receive that consideration. I am aware that there is likely to be disagreement about the details. disagreement about the merits of some of the progrowth ideas that have come over to us from the House of Representatives. as well as proposals concerning energy and health care. to name a few. But resolving our differences is part of what make this Chamber and our country unique. In a floor speech early last year. Leader MCCONNELL said: I am certain of one thing. The Senate can be better. I think that is one of the messages from the American people in last November and last Decembers election. The American people believe the Senate can be better. We each have a responsibility and a role in making the Senate better. We could start by legislating through the committee process. We have begun doing that already. Instead of backroom deals. pushed through at the last minute. which has been the order of the day in past years. bills should be thoroughly debated and vettedfirst in committee and then on the Senate floor. The issues of our day deserve that attention. Forging consensus takes effort. but that is how the Senate is supposed to work. Our consideration next week will demonstrate that this is a new day in the Senate. I look forward to being a part of the debate and the amendment process on the Keystone XL Pipeline proposal. Offering amendments is a way in which each of us can have input on the legislation at handinput on behalf of our constituents. the people who sent us here. For too long the amendment tree has been filled by the majority leader. essentially limiting the right of every Member to voice the concerns and opinions of the people they represent. essentially limiting the our right to represent the people of our States who sent us here. Instead of a series of continuing resolutions. we should return to the process of 12 separate appropriations bills. In doing so. we could carefully assess Federal spending and reduce waste. and I think the American people sent that message to us also in November and December. The Federal debt has reached unprecedented levels. forcing us to make tough decisions on how to do more with less. With regard to national defense. I look forward. during the 114th Congress. to serving as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower. Our subcommittee has a wide range of oversight responsibilities. including the procurement. sustainment. and research and development needs of the Navy and Marine Corps. From classified briefings and other hearings with senior officials in the Navy and intelligence community. I am well aware of the imminent and emerging threats facing our sea services. America should maintain its ability to project power around the world while upholding our obligations to our friends and allies. Our Navy is now the smallest it has been since World War I. demanding. I believe. a robust investment in sea power. In the coming weeks the Seapower Subcommittee will hold hearings to determine whether the Presidents budget proposals for the Department of the Navy are sufficient to meet our national security requirements. Following these hearings. we will draft the Defense authorization bill to deliver important capabilities and support for our sailors and marines. This support includes funding for construction of various types and classes of ships. such as aircraft carriers. amphibious ships. submarines. and large and small surface combatants. I wish to note that supporting the Department of Defense is best done when Congress legislates under regular order. The Republicanled Senate should take up a defense authorization bill and a defense appropriations bill. and we are committed to doing so. Regular order will help provide our military planners with valuable budget predictabilitysomething they have suffered without in past years. I was very pleased to learn this week that Chairman MCCAIN plans for the Armed Services Committee to mark up a defense authorization bill before Memorial Day. Our committee did that under the leadership of Senator Levin last year. but where this Senate fell down on its responsibility is that we didnt get the bill to the floor until December. and then it was in a rushed and unamendable form. Our goal under regular order is for us to take up the bill on the floor this summer and have a conference report between the House and the Senate reported before August. I am heartened that Chairman MCCAIN intends to do this. I am heartened by the commitment of the distinguished majority leader that we will indeed take up that legislation before the end of the fiscal year. I should also observe that. absent congressional action. budget sequestration will return to the Defense Department in October of this year. Sequestration remains one of the greatest challenges facing our military. Unless we take action. the ability of our military and our industrial base to react to unforeseen contingencies will be severely eroded. and there will undoubtedly be unforeseen contingencies. There are always unforeseen contingencies. and we will be unprepared for them unless we take action to prevent sequestration. As a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Budget Committee. I will work to help forge a bipartisan path so we can avert a return to the acrosstheboard defense cuts under sequestration. I am so pleased that a bipartisan task force within the Armed Services Committee is already taking shape to discuss this issue. We will begin to have discussions beginning Monday and Tuesday of next week. With regard to commerce. I also look forward to assuming the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Communications. Technology. and the Internet. My chief focus will continue to be the deployment and adoption of broadband in rural Americasomething I am interested in as a Senator from Mississippi and something the distinguished Presiding Officer is interested in as a Senator from Louisiana. Broadband has become a vital economic engine in this country and around the world. In many ways. the proliferation of the Internet is like the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. We need to ensure that people in rural areas have the same quality broadband as those in urban areas. To that end. our committee will continue to examine ways to foster broadband growth and development. We also need to find ways to make more spectrum available for wireless. which can help spur innovation and economic growth in the mobile broadband space. I also expect the Senate this year to deal with legislation regarding the Environmental Protection Agency and the Obama administrations environmental executive overreach. The administration has proposed a litany of costly environmental rules. targeting everything from coalfired powerplants. to small streams. to small ponds. Many would cause significant economic harm. while providing little or no help to the environmentno help to the environment but significant economic harm. By EPAs own estimates. its recently proposed groundlevel ozone rules could cost taxpayers as much as $44 billion per year. making it the most expensive rulemaking to date. Meanwhile. EPAs clean powerplant rule could lead to a loss of 224.000 jobs each year. These costs are staggering. I am pleased that the final omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015. which was passed in December. included limits on the controversial waters of the United States proposal. which regulates small ponds. streams. and puddles. However. I remain committed to ensuring that this rule will not be implemented at all. By broadening the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" Washington bureaucrats would potentially regulate puddles and ditches on farms and in backyards. Is this really what is necessary to protect the environment? Is this really what the American people require? These regulations would have significant impact on the State of Mississippi. Our economic growth depends on agriculture. and it depends on manufacturing and other energyintensive industries. With each new environmental regulation. the administration is compounding the financial burden on the American people without delivering any environmental benefits. We can have clean air and we can have clean water without losing 224.000 jobs. We can have clean air and water without the cost of $44 billion per year for one single regulation. Lowcost and reliable energy is at the core of economic growth. Economic gains from the abundance of affordable energy could be lost if these rules are allowed to be put into place. In an economy desperate for growth. a regulatory onslaught is the worst way to encourage jobs and investment. The American people also want us to address the Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare. I was particularly interested in the thoughtful remarks of the Senator from Delaware. who spoke immediately before me. The remarks of my distinguished colleague suggests that Members on both sides of the aisle heard the message from the American people in November and December in the elections. I think both sides recognize that the Affordable Care Act is not affordable and as a matter of fact is causing great hardship and pain to the majority of the American people. So I am pleased to hear Members on the other side of the aisle at least acknowledge that many major. significant changes need to be made to ObamaCare. Overall disapproval of the Presidents health care law is at an alltime high of 56 percent. Americans are suffering under the laws mandates and taxes. Many are faced with the financial burden of higher copays and higher deductibles. This is a reality. I must say that I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished senior Senator from New York recently when he acknowledged that passing ObamaCare in the way previous Congresses did was a mistake. that most Americans were satisfied with their coverage and it was a mistake to turn that entire system on its head to solve a problem which we very much needed to solve with regard to the uninsured and underinsured. There was a better way to provide health insurance to those individuals without disadvantaging the vast majority of people who were satisfied with their health care and who now find themselves in a much worse position. Congress has the responsibility to ease the burden of ObamaCare by repealing the laws most onerous provisions. I would like to repeal the entire act and start over with some good aspects that we could incorporate into a better bill but also start off with a better way to provide health care for Americans and provide those who were uninsured with the opportunity to get insurance. At the very least. we should pass legislation restoring the 40hour workweek. I hope this is one of the things my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about. I note that the President of the United States has threatened to veto Affordable Care Act amendments that would restore something that has become very traditional in the United Statesthe 40hour workweek. It is very surprising to me that it would be on that proposal that the President of the United States would say: No. I will not even sign legislation to restore something as traditional as the 40hour workweek. We need to repeal the medical device tax. and clearly there are well over 60 votes in this body today to do just that. We need to exempt veterans from the employer mandate. to provide relief to rural hospitals. and we need to repeal the health insurance tax. I hope we can do that. and I hope the sounds I hear from the other side of the aisle indicate that we can reach bipartisan consensus and send legislation to the President persuading him that there is such broad support for that and he should sign it. We can do better for the American people than the higher copays. the higher deductibles. and the broken promises they received under the ACA. Americans were flatly told: If you like your doctor. you can keep your doctor. That turned out to be a promise the administration could not or would not keep. They were told: If you like your health care plan. you can keep your health care plan. It turned out the administration was not able to make good on that promise. We can do better. With regard to the Federal budget. the national debt now exceeds $18 trillion. During the next 10 years. interest payments on the debt will be the fastest growing budget expenditure. Interest on the debt will be the fastest growing expenditure. more than tripling to $800 billion. Put in perspective. one out of every seven tax dollars taken in by the government will be used to service the Federal debt. Why is regular order important in this regard? In returning to regular order. the Senate Republicans will enact a budget resolution each year as required by law. We havent done this. The law requires it. but somehow Congress has waived this requirement for themselves. This contrasts sharply with the past 5 years. during which the Democraticled Senate passed only one budget. As a result. Congress has not adopted a joint budget resolution since 2009. This will change in this new day of Congress. Under the previous majority. spending bills were not brought to the floor to be debated. Budget laws were routinely waived or ignored. and there has been no plan whatever for finally bringing the Federal budget under control. These are facts. We need to change that. and I hope we will do so in this Congress. In conclusion. we have plenty of work to do. People in my State of Mississippi. like most Americans. expect results from this Congress. The challenges of our economy. the importance of our national defense. and the negative impact of intrusive executive overreach are too great not to address. We need to meet the expectations of the American people in this regard. The distinguished majority leader reminded us earlier this week that Americans want a government that works. one that functions with efficiency and accountability. competence and purpose. I believe we can do that. but it will take a return to regular order. It will take faith in the committee process. It will take faith in returning this institution to functioning the way the Founders intended. And it will take meaningful legislation. It is time to put the priorities of the American people first. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. when Sarah Kenney decided to volunteer with the Womens Rape Crisis Center in Burlington. VT. in 1997. she may not have realized just how that experience would shape nearly two decades of her life. There. in cramped offices furnished with old futons. she recalls. \"I fell in love with the passion of the place.\" That passion led Sarah to the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. where she has spent the past 13 years advocating to end such violence and to raise public awareness about the abhorrent crimes that account for roughly half of all homicides in Vermont in any given year. Over the years. Sarah has been a trusted and valuable partner in my work to strengthen support for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. including the successful reauthorization and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act so that it better protects all survivors. Her understanding of the legislative process. combined with her ability to work with all sides. have been the hallmark of her effective advocacy. Sarah has also spent much time at the Vermont State House. testifying on legislation to strengthen protections against victims of crime across our State. Sarah will be leaving her post as the Vermont Networks Associate Director of Public Policy this month. to take on a new advocacy role as Deputy Director at Lets Grow Kids in Burlington. where she will use her tremendous skills on behalf of bettering childrens lives. I am proud to note that Sarah holds a bachelors degree in political science from my alma mater. St. Michaels College. Her contributions are too many to list here. but her work in shaping policy has undoubtedly resulted in stronger protections for women and families in Vermont and across the Nation. In my 40 years in the U.S. Senate. I have worked with many advocates who are passionate about the work they do. I can say that Sarahs passion and commitment make her one of the best. She is superbly effective in turning advocacy into action. In Vermont. we are fortunate to have an organization such as the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. and even more fortunate to have someone of Sarahs talents advocating on behalf of victims. It has been an honor to work with someone whose commitment to a cause is so distilled and focused. The Vermont Network will miss Sarahs many talents. but Vermonts children have just gained a passionate advocate. I wish Sarah and her family all the best in her new role.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to express my gratitude for the service of my longtime aide. Stewart Holmes. who is leaving the U.S. Senate to pursue a new career. Stewart has served the Senate in different capacities over the past 17 years in a manner that reflects credit on the institution and our Nation. During this time. I have valued Stewart as a trusted and loyal advisor with sound judgment on complex national security issues. More broadly. his public service on Capitol Hill has contributed to the safety of the American people and our Nation. Stewarts sense of service. responsibility. and dedication to the United States is closely linked to his own 22year military service career. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1979. and was appointed a 2nd Lieutenant in 1986. He was deployed during Operation Desert Storm. While in the military. he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Citadel in South Carolina and a Master of Arts degree in Financial Management from the U.S. Naval Post Graduate School. In 1997. he became the first military fellow to serve in my Senate office. a position that preceded his becoming the Marine Corps Appropriations Liaison. In 2001. Stewart Holmes retired from the Marine Corps as a major and joined my staff as a military legislative assistant. In 2005. he joined the Senate Committee on Appropriations and served as an intelligence and military advisor to me. He became minority clerk of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 2009. Throughout my association with Stewart. he has been a hard worker. He has demonstrated consummate professionalism. attention to detail. and dedication to the Senate as an institution. These qualities have served him well as the Defense Subcommittee has worked to overcome the fiscal and political challenges inherent in funding our national security priorities. I appreciate his work on various issues of importance to our national interests and to my State of Mississippi. including shipbuilding. supercomputers. next generation technology. shipbuilding. NASA and others. As Stewart moves on with the next chapter of his career. I wish him. his wife. Maren. and their children every success and happiness. We will miss him here in the Senate. I am pleased to extend my thanks to him for the great job he has done in the Senate.*",

Sheila Dwyer. who served as Assistant Secretary of the Senate since 2007. will be deeply missed by many. She worked closely with former Majority Leader HARRY REID and with current Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. who had passionate. strong praise for Sheilas dedication and devotion to this institution. Both recognized that she became known as the \"Mayor of Capitol Hill\" for the skill and poise she consistently demonstrated in handling the needs of 100 Senators at a time. Sheila was born in Waterbury. CT. and she has remained very proud of her roots in our great State throughout her career. While still in high school. she served a semester as a Senate Page. and she later returned to spend her career here. After working for such luminaries as Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. and Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina. she joined Senator REIDs office. Along the way. Sheila amassed an impressive record of accomplishments that included overseeing logistics for two national Democratic conventions. assisting in Presidential inaugurations and countless ceremonial events. and coordinating the myriad departments and behindthe- scenes operations that keep the Senate running. Throughout. she has built and maintained friendships with Senators and staff from all corners of the Capitol and the country. Leader REID spoke quite movingly about how. in addition to her professional achievements. she has been a strong source of personal support for his family and others. My wife Cynthia and I are honored to know Sheila. and we wish her all the best as she begins the next chapter of her life. I know that all of Connecticut joins me in congratulating her on her exemplary achievements here in the Senate.",

I am pleased to congratulate the Reverend Louis Lohan who is retiring after more than 40 years of distinguished service as a Roman Catholic priest serving the Diocese of Biloxi in Mississippi. Born in Ireland. Father Lohan attended schools there and graduated from St. Patricks College in Carlow. Ireland. He became an ordained priest for the Catholic Diocese of Biloxi in June of 1971 and moved to the United States shortly thereafter. Father Lohan served at several different ministry locations. such as Our Lady of Victories in Pascagoula. Mission in Saltillo. Mexico. Our Lady of the Gulf in Bay St. Louis. Sacred Heart in DIberville. and at the churches in Wiggins. Lucedale. and Leakesville for 9 years. In 1993. Father Lohan began service as pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Long Beach. MS. where he remained for the next 21 years. In 2005. he participated in the rebuilding effort of the church. community center. office complex. and elementary school after they were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Father Louis Lohan has diligently served the Diocese of Biloxi. and I am pleased to congratulate and thank him for his many years of devoted service to the people of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to recognize the Henderson Veterans Treatment Court Program for its commitment and dedication to providing our veterans with vital services that range from job placement to suicide prevention. Located in Henderson. NV. this unique program assists our Nations bravest as they return from the battlefield and readjust to life in their communities. The brave men and women who served the United States and fought to protect our freedom have often come home to a struggling economy. All too often. returning veterans are unable to find a job or afford to buy or rent a home. As the demographics of our Armed Forces have changed throughout the years. so. too. have the needs of our Nations heroes. The Henderson Veterans Treatment Court. founded in 2011 by Henderson Chief Judge Mark Stevens. received national recognition and is illustrative of how the program should be implemented. With 53 graduates and 41 active participants. this program is a shining example of the type of initiatives that will help get our veterans back on their feet. Although there is no way to ever adequately thank the men and women that lay down their lives for our freedoms. the Henderson Veterans Treatment Court acts as a onestop solution for veterans who find themselves in a position of need. As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. I know the struggles that our veterans face after returning home from the battlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals but also to ensure they receive the quality care they have earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. I am very pleased that veterans service organizations like the Henderson Veterans Treatment Court are committed to ensuring that the needs of our veterans are being met. Today. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing the Henderson Veterans Treatment Court. a program with a mission that is both noble and necessary. I am honored to acknowledge the Henderson Veterans Treatment Court and its tireless efforts to put veterans back on their feet in Nevada and throughout the United States. Their duty to provide veterans with the skills that will allow them the opportunity to change their circumstances is admirable. and I wish the program the best of luck in all of its future endeavors.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am proud to introduce the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. Once enacted. this legislation will continue for another five years the immensely successful grant program that provides matching funds for State and local law enforcement agencies to purchase protective vests for officers serving in the field. Our Nation needs no additional reminders of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers each and every day. Far too often we have grieved as officers are killed in the line of duty. In 2014 alone. 126 men and women serving in law enforcement lost their lives. Although protective vests cannot save every officer. they have already saved the lives of more than 3.000 law enforcement officers since 1987. Vests dramatically increase the chance of survival when tragedy occurs. I have met personally with police officers who are living today because of a bulletproof vest. and they will attest to the fact that the vests provided through this program are worth every penny. No officer should have to serve without a protective vest. Yet we know that. for far too many jurisdictions. vests can cost too much and wear out too soon. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program helps to fill the gap. Since it was first authorized in 1999. it has enabled more than 13.000 State and local law enforcement agencies to purchase more than one million bulletproof vests. including more than 4.000 vests for officers in Vermont. As these officers have helped to protect our communities. these grants have helped to protect them. Unfortunately the authorization for this grant program lapsed in 2012. We must not delay any longer in reauthorizing this program This bill also contains a number of improvements to the grant program. It provides incentives for agencies to provide uniquely fitted vests for female officers and others. It also codifies existing Justice Department policies that grantee law enforcement agencies cannot use other Federal grant funds to satisfy the matching fund requirement. and they must also have mandatory wear policies to ensure the vests are used regularly. Protecting those who serve has historically been a bipartisan effort in Congress. Republican Senator Ben NighthorseCampbell and I worked together to create this program more than 15 years ago. It was so successful that. in the past. it was reauthorized with a voice vote. It was the right thing to do. it saved lives. and that was enough for both Democrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue. and I am pleased that Senator GRAHAM is the lead cosponsor of this measure. Senators COONS and BLUNT are also original cosponsors of this bill. The law enforcement community speaks with a single voice on this issue. And I am proud that this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police. International Association of Chiefs of Police. National Association of Police Organizations. National Sheriffs Association. Major County Sheriffs Association. Major Cities Chiefs Association. Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. National Tactical Officers Association. and Sergeants Benevolent Association. There are very few bills that can so directly affect and improve the safety of those who serve and protect our communities. This program saves lives. and I am hopeful that all SenatorsDemocrats. Republicans. and Independents alikewill join us now to ensure its swift reauthorization. By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. MERKLEY):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I reintroduce a bill that will end the gridlock on the Oregon and California. O&C. lands found in my home State. I am pleased that my colleague Senator MERKLEY is joining me in this effort. Last Congress. I introduced this legislation. which went on to be reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee after continued work with stakeholders and resulting modifications. I feel that a great deal of progress was made in the last Congress to find a solution for these lands in Oregon. but Congress ran out of time to complete work on this bill. Thats why I am back at it here today. The bill I introduce today is intended to advance the progress made. adopting the modifications from the bill that was reported out of Committee. and paving the way to pass legislation regarding management of these lands. My legislation will end decades of uncertainty and broken forest policy with a sciencedriven solution that moves past the decades old timber wars. It does this by using science to guide management of the O&C lands while upholding bedrock federal environmental laws. This bill provides the jobs that Oregonians need. certainty of timber supply that timber companies require. and continued environmental protections that our treasures deserve. First. my legislation divides the O&C lands. with roughly half set aside for forestry emphasis and the other half for conservation emphasis. to put a stop to the uncertainty and conflicting priorities that have contributed to federal management failure on these lands and produce wins on both sides of the historic timber conflict. The forestry emphasis lands will employ proven forestry practices. known as \"ecological forestry.\" to mimic natural processes and create healthier. more diverse forests. Modeling using Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service analysis confirms that ecological forestry will more than double the harvest on O&C lands. producing approximately 400 mmbf on the landscape covered by this bill. On the conservation side. my bill provides permanent protections for approximately 1.35 million acres of land. while designating wilderness lands. wild and scenic rivers. and other special areas. It creates 87.000 acres of wilderness and 252 miles of wild and scenic rivers. All told. this would be the single biggest increase in Oregons conservation lands in decades. That includes special areas protected for recreation. which is an increasingly important part of our rural economy. and is responsible for 141.000 jobs in Oregon alone. Perhaps the most important conservation win in the bill is the firstever legislative protection for old growth on O&C lands and the designation of Late Successional Oldgrowth Forest Heritage Reserves. The approach of dividing the lands into conservation and timber emphasis and protecting old growth will provide clear management direction for the landscape and take the most controversial harvests off the table. Significantly. the bill streamlines and front loads environmental analysis into two large scale environmental impact statementsone each for moist and dry foreststhat will study 5 years of work in the woods. rather than a single project. It does this while upholding the Endangered Species Act and other bedrock environmental laws. Critical to the bill is the belief that forest policy should be dictated by science. not lawyers. The forestry principles used in this bill are based on the work of Drs. Norm Johnson and Jerry Franklin. two respected Northwest forestry scientists. and built off of forestry approaches used around the globe. The bill also establishes the first ever legislative protections for O&C streams thanks in large part to the work of one of the Northwests foremost water resources experts. Dr. Gordon Reeves. The Northwest Forest Plans stream protections are extended to key watersheds and four drinking water emphasis areas. with additional lands designated for conservation. to protect drinking water. Science also guides how the agency can treat trees near streams and a scientific committee will evaluate stream buffers and reserves in areas dedicated to timber harvests. increasing or decreasing the boundaries as needed to address the ecological importance of streams. This acknowledges that one size does not fit all. Most important is the fact that I will continue to advance efforts to secure a new future for the O&C lands. My bill certainly doesnt provide everything all sides want. but it can get everyone what they need. I look forward to working with Congressmen DEFAZIO. WALDEN and SCHRADER and our colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives to pass an O&C solution into law. By Mr. WYDEN (for himself. Mr. MERKLEY. Mrs. BOXER. and Mrs.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I rise to reintroduce a bill that would authorize the implementation of three landmark agreements that settle some of our countrys most complex and contentious water allocation and species preservation issues. Water management crises this century have plagued the Klamath Basin. leading to devastating water years for communities throughout the Basin. Overcoming that adversity. stakeholders including State and Federal agencies. tribes. farmers and ranchers. and environmental groups. have spent years coming together to hammer out solutions. They swallowed hard and worked together to bring costs down and deliver economic certainty and stability for the Basin in the name of the greater good. Last year. I introduced the Klamath Basin Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2014 to finally authorize the three historic agreements reached by Basin partnersthe Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement. the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement. and the Upper Basin Agreement. I was deeply disappointed that the bill did not get passed into law last Congress. delaying the implementation of these important agreements and creating even more uncertainty and anxiety for stakeholders in the Basin. Inspired by the perseverance and dedication demonstrated by the stakeholders. today I once again bring forward this bill. the Klamath Basin Water Recovery and Economic Restoration Act of 2015. to put a rubber stamp on the historic agreements and finally help heal the Klamath Basin. With this bill. the Basin will no longer be known for persistent drought. water disputes. and conflict. but rather for the dedicated and enduring collaborative efforts that have honed in on a sustainable and more economically certain future. an example that other regions can emulate for their watershed challenges. I continue to express my gratitude to the interested groups who came to the table and formed partnerships. engaged in conversations. made agreements and concessions. and ultimately found a path forward. Im pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators MERKLEY. BOXER and FEINSTEIN on this bill. Senator MERKLEY has worked tirelessly to encourage and support the years of conversations and collaborative efforts of the countless stakeholders who have committed to finding a balanced solution. Senators BOXER and FEINSTEIN have provided unwavering support for the communities impacted by unprecedented drought in the Klamath Basin. which spans Oregon and California. while also reaffirming the need to support fish and wildlife. Together. we are committed to working with our colleagues in the Senate and House to advance this bill and get it signed by the President. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am pleased to be joined by Senators MERKLEY. MCCONNELL. and PAUL in introducing the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015. I introduced this bill during the 113th Congress with these same colleagues to amend a regulation that is holding Americas economy back. I am committed to empowering American farmers and increasing domestic economic activity. and that is exactly what this bill will do. The United States is the worlds largest consumer of hemp products. yet it remains the only major industrialized country that bans hemp farming. As the United States imports millions of dollars of hemp products. such as textiles. foods. paper products and construction materials. American farmers who could grow hemp right here at home are unable to profit from this growing market. This is an outrageous restriction on free enterprise and does nothing but hurt economic growth and job creation. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 would amend the definition of \"marihuana\" in the Controlled Substances Act to exclude industrial hemp. allowing American farmers to produce domestically the hemp we already use. Industrial hemp is a safe. profitable commodity in many other countries. and Ive long said that if you can buy it at the local supermarket. American farmers should be able to grow it. This commonsense bill would end the burdensome restrictions on industrial hemp and is proenvironment. probusiness. and profarmer. I encourage my colleagues to take the time to learn about the great potential for farming industrial hemp in the United States. and to understand the real differences between industrial hemp and marijuana. Under our bill. industrial hemp is defined as having extremely low THC levels: it has to be 0.3 percent or less. The lowest commercial grade marijuana typically has 5 percent THC content. The bottom line is that no one is going to get high on industrial hemp. And to guarantee that wont be the case. our legislation allows the U.S. Attorney General to take action if a state law allows commercial hemp to exceed the maximum 0.3 percent THC level. I urge my colleagues to join Senators MERKLEY. MCCONNELL. PAUL. and me by cosponsoring and ultimately passing this important bill. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am reintroducing legislation that I introduced at the end of the last Congress along with a bipartisan group of colleagues in the House of Representatives. We call it the Secure Data Act. because it is designed to help protect the sensitive data of American citizens and businesses from being compromised by foreign hackers. And I believe it will also help protect and promote the American digital economy at a time when growing the number of familywage jobs is so important both to Oregonians and to people across the country. Hardly a week goes by without a new report of a massive data theft by computer hackers. often involving trade secrets. consumers financial information. or sensitive government records. It is well known that the best defense against these attacks is strong data encryption and more secure technology systems. This is why I and many others have been troubled by suggestions from senior officials that computer hardware and software manufacturers should be required to intentionally create security holes. often referred to as back doors. to enable the government to access data on every Americans cell phone and computer. even if that data is protected by strong encryption. The problem with this proposal is that there is no such thing as a magic key that can only be used by good people for worthwhile reasons. There is only strong security or weak security. Americans are rightly demanding stronger security for their personal data. And requiring companies to build back doors into their products would mean deliberately creating weaknesses that hackers and unscrupulous foreign governments could exploit. The results of this approach can be seen elsewherein 2005. citizens of Greece discovered that dozens of their senior government officials phones had been under surveillance for nearly a year. The eavesdropper was never identified. but the vulnerability wasit was builtin wiretapping features intended to be accessible only to government agencies following a legal process. Mandating back doors would also remove incentives for innovation. If youre required to build a wall with a hole in it. you arent going to invest a lot of money in developing better locks. And these mandates could also do enormous harm to U.S. technology companies that are working hard to overcome the damage that has been done by recklessly broad surveillance policies and years of deceptive statements by senior government officials. This legislation would expressly prohibit the government from mandating that tech companies build security weaknesses into their products. I would note that similar legislation from Representatives MASSIE and LOFGREN passed the House of Representatives on a bipartisan vote of 293123 in June of last year. So. I look forward to working with colleagues on a bipartisan basis to advance this bill. and to receiving feedback and input from colleagues and interested stakeholders. so that it can be further improved as it moves forward.

    "speech": "Mr. President. our country has asked a lot of our soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines throughout its history and it will continue to do so as long as the world looks to America for leadership in crises. These brave men and women dont join the military looking for public accolades and all they ask in return for their many sacrifices is for the government to honor its commitments to themsomething I have certainly always tried to do. Of course our men and women in uniform and our veterans arent the only folks who make sacrifices in the name of national security. From child care. to household repairs and bills. to legal issues. our military families are called on to provide support in innumerable ways as their loved ones serve and deploy. While we hope and pray that all those sent abroad return safely to the arms of their loved ones. we know that this isnt always the case. When servicemembers return home wounded or weakened as a result of combat. it is our military families who step up to take care of their son or daughter. husband or wife. When servicesmembers do not return. it is our military families who endure that searing pain that comes with such a terrible loss. It is an understatement to say that government cannot take away that pain. but what government can. and must. do is honor that sacrifice. One way we do that is by extending certain benefits to the families of those who are killed or permanently and totally disabled in action. Today. along with Senator BROWN. I am introducing the Gold Star Fathers Act to update one of those benefits. The Office of Personnel Management currently allows unmarried mothers of fallen soldiers to claim a 10point veterans preference when applying for Federal jobs. Our legislation would simply extend this preference to unmarried fathers of fallen soldiers. Updating this preference is about fairness and recognizing that fathers. too. share in the sacrifice that their family has made for this country. Updating this preference will also expand opportunities for Gold Star families to bring their dedication and compassion into the federal government. where it can be put to great use. Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Fathers have incurred a debt that Congress cannot ever hope to repay. All we can hope to do is ensure that these sacrifices are acknowledged and honored. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation swiftly. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. if you go to get your hair cut. your barber or stylist must be licensed. If you need to get the locks on your home repaired or replaced. the locksmith needs a license. But if you have someone prepare your tax return. there is no requirement that the preparer meet any minimum competency standard. It is time for that to change so taxpayers are protected when they file their taxes. On April 8 of last year. the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing to discuss ways to protect taxpayers from incompetent. unethical and fraudulent tax return preparers. There is no question the tax code is overly complex and confusing. For that reason among others. more than 80 million Americans pay someone else to prepare their income tax return each year. Thats why it was so alarming to learn that most paid tax return preparers dont have to meet even basic standards of proficiency or competence to prepare someone elses tax return. A series of investigations by the GAO and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. TIGTA. illustrated some of the problems with incompetent tax return preparers. As a consequence. the IRS took steps to require paid tax return preparers to demonstrate they have the knowhow to provide the taxpayer with a service he or she can reasonably rely upon. I am proud to say my home state gets this issue right. Tax preparers in Oregon study. pass an exam and keep up with the changing landscape of the tax code in order to maintain their licenses. and those standards work. The GAO took a look at the system a few years ago and found that tax returns from Oregon were 72 percent likelier to be accurate than returns from the rest of the country. That puts fewer Oregonians at the mercy of unscrupulous preparers and reduces the risk of the dreaded audit. These independent analyses. combined with too many taxpayer horror stories of identity theft. refund and liability errors. and audit challenges. demonstrated clearly that a lack of basic tax return preparer competency standards is a serious consumer protection issue. Today. I am introducing legislation that will help restore standards to protect American taxpayers. This legislation. the Taxpayer Protection and Preparer Proficiency Act of 2015. which I am pleased to introduce with the distinguished Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDINwill grant the IRS the ability to move forward with the type of education and examination program contemplated under the 2011 Circular 230 program. specifically. the Registered Tax Return Preparer. RTRP. Program. Testing and minimum competency requirements have been clearly shown to be effective at reducing error. fraud and tax preparer incompetence. We need to protect American taxpayers. and this bill helps do just that. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today. I am introducing the Incentives to Educate American Children. the \"I Teach\" Act. which would provide a $1.000 refundable tax credit to elementary and secondary school teachers who teach in schools located in rural or impoverished areas. It would also provide a $1.000 credit to teachers who achieve National Board certification. and provide National Board certified teachers serving in rural or impoverished schools a $2.000 credit. It was previously introduced in the 113th Congress by Senator Rockefeller. U.S. classrooms are increasingly filled with less experienced teachers. as older teachers retire and the retention rate among young teachers continues to decline. According to the most recent data. 1.7 million teachers. representing 45 percent of the workforce. had less than 10 years of experience. Policy makers need to take steps to ensure that students have the most qualified and best trained teachers possible. Nearly a third of public schools in the United States are in rural areas. And rural schools often face challenges that others dont. like smaller tax bases and higher recruitment costs. which means they often have less money for classroom materials and salaries. Department of Education data show that rural school districts have the lowest base salaries for starting teachers. a trend that continues even as teachers move to the top of the local salary range. Rural schools face these challenges across the country. The most recent study by the Education Trust found that high schools with high poverty rates are twice as likely to have teachers who are not certified in their fields than high schools with low poverty rates. The same study found that schools serving impoverished areas have a higher percentage of first year teachers. Rural schools face similar problems. According to the Department of Education. Oregon faces a shortage of certified teachers for the 201415 school year in subject areas such as math. science. Spanish. special education. English as a second language. and bilingual education. A major deterrent to pursuing a masters degree in teaching is the soaring cost of tuition. which. especially for those candidates with strong science and math backgrounds. drives them into other fields instead of educating the next generation of scientists and researchers. In other words. due to the high cost of education and teachers salaries which have failed to keep pace. additional incentives through the tax code could encourage highly qualified individuals to look to or continue to pursue teaching as a viable profession.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the bipartisan Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. I would like to begin by thanking Senators HATCH and MARKEY for joining me in cosponsoring this legislation. I would also like to thank the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for working with me on this important issue since 2010. This bill is simple: it would remove a sunset that exists for a law we passed in 2010 making it easierand more likelyfor people receiving Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid to participate in rare disease clinical trials. As I explained in 2010. we wanted to proceed carefully when altering how compensation for participating in clinical trials is treated for SSI and Medicaid purposes. That is why we included a 5 year sunset and asked GAO to report on how the law is working. Five years have passed and GAO has issued its report. GAOs frank assessment is that not a lot is known about how the law may or may not have affected the decisions an SSI recipient makes about participating in clinical trials. At the same time. GAO provided important context about factors affecting a decision to participate. such as time and travel. The GAO report suggests that the law has removed a barrier to participation for the individuals that rely on SSI and Medicaids safety net. and GAOs consultation with the National Institutes of Health. the National Organization of Rare Diseases. and the Social Security Administration did not identify any negative aspects from the change in the law. That is comforting and important. and it is reason enough to make this law permanent. We all know whats at stake and how its often difficult to find participants for rare disease clinical trials. This law has helped increase the number of people who can participate and. hopefully. be a part of the effort to improve treatments and find cures. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that recipients of SSI and Medicaid can have the same opportunity to participate in clinical trials as individuals who do not rely on these important safety net programs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to reintroduce. along with Senator PORTMAN. the Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015. Human trafficking is estimated to be a $32 billion criminal enterprise. making it the second largest criminal industry in the world. behind the drug trade. Many steps need to be taken to combat this problem. But we cannot escape this simple truth: without demand for the services performed by trafficking victims. the problem would not exist. The bill we are introducing today would reduce the demand for human trafficking. particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of children. by holding buyers accountable and making it easier for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute all persons who participate in sex trafficking. Sex trafficking is not a victimless crime. In the United States. the average age that a person is first trafficked is between 12 and 14. Many of these children continue to be exploited into adulthood. A study of women and girls involved in street prostitution in my hometown of San Francisco found that 82 percent had been physically assaulted. 83 percent were threatened with a weapon. and 68 percent were raped. The overwhelming majority of sex trafficking victims in the United States are American citizens83 percent by one estimate from the Department of Justice. I am encouraged that Federal. State. and local law enforcement agencies are taking steps to combat human trafficking. Between January and June of last year. the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered 168 trafficking victims and arrested 281 sex traffickers in \"Operation Cross Country.\" I commend these efforts. but more needs to be done to target the perpetrators who are fueling demand for trafficking crimesthe buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims. Many buyers of sex are \"hobbyists\" who purchase sex repeatedly. Because buyers are rarely arrested. much less prosecuted. the demand for commercial sex continues unabated. Without buyers. sex trafficking would cease to exist. As Luis CdeBaca. the U.S. AmbassadoratLarge for the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. noted. \"[n]o girl or woman would be a victim of sex trafficking if there were no profits to be made from their exploitation.\" The Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015 would address this problem by incentivizing Federal and State law enforcement officers to target buyers and providing new authorities to prosecute all who engage in the crime of sex trafficking. First. the bill would clarify that buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims can be prosecuted under the Federal commercial sex trafficking statute. This provision would codify the Eighth Circuits decision in United States v. Jungers. which held that this statute encompasses buyers. in addition to sellers. Despite this favorable ruling. there is no guarantee that other courts will follow this precedent. Second. the bill would hold buyers and sellers of child sex acts accountable for their actions. even if they claim they were unaware of the age of a minor victim. At times. it can be difficult for a prosecutor to prove that a buyer was aware of the victims age. Successful cases can require the child victim to testify to this fact. subjecting the victim to retraumatization. The bill would draw a clear line: if you purchase sex from an underage child. you can be prosecuted. Period. Third. the bill would grant judges greater flexibility to impose an appropriate term of supervised release on sex traffickers. Current law contains an anomaly: a person convicted of violating the commercial sex trafficking statute or attempting to violate the statute may be subject to a longer term of supervised release than a person who is convicted of conspiring to violate the statute. Conspiring to traffic underage children is as serious as attempting to commit this crime and should be punished the same. Fourth. the bill would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics to prepare annual reports on the number of arrests. prosecutions. and convictions of sex traffickers and buyers of sex from trafficked victims in the state court system. Very little data is available on the prosecutions made under antitrafficking laws. This provision would provide additional data and encourage State and local governments to increase enforcement against sellers and buyers of sex from trafficked victims. Fifth. the Combat Human Trafficking Act would strengthen training programs operated by the Department of Justice for Federal. State. and local law enforcement officers who investigate and prosecute sex trafficking offenses. Under the bill. such training programs must include components on effective methods to target and prosecute the buyers of sex acts from trafficked victims. This would equip prosecutors with the tools they need to target buyers. encouraging prosecution of these perpetrators. Training programs must also train law enforcement in connecting trafficking victims with health care providers. so that victims receive the health care services they need to recover. In addition. the bill requires that training programs for federal prosecutors include components on seeking restitution for victims of sex trafficking. An October 2014 study by The Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Center found that federal prosecutors did not seek restitution in 37 percent of qualifying human trafficking cases brought between 2009 and 2012. even though restitution for trafficking victims is mandatory under federal law. When the prosecutor did not seek restitution. it was granted in only 10 percent of cases. These results make clear that prosecutors play a critical role in providing justice for trafficking victims. Our bill would ensure that prosecutors are specifically trained to seek restitution for victims. The bill would also require the Federal Judicial Center to provide training to judges on ordering restitution for human trafficking victims. so that judges are fully aware that federal law mandates that restitution be ordered for these victims. Overall. restitution was awarded in only 36 percent of qualifying human trafficking cases brought between 2009 and 2012. according to The Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Centers study. Too many trafficking victims are not receiving the compensation they need to rebuild their lives and to which they are entitled under the law. Sixth. the bill would authorize federal and state officials to seek a wiretap to investigate and prosecute any human traffickingrelated offense. Under current law. a federal law enforcement officer may seek a wiretap in an investigation under the commercial sex trafficking statute. but not under a number of other statutes that address human traffickingrelated offenses. such as forced labor and involuntary servitude. Similarly. a state law enforcement officer may seek a wiretap to investigate a kidnapping offense. but not an offense for human trafficking. child sexual exploitation. or child pornography production. Our bill would fix those omissions. Finally. this legislation would strengthen the rights of crime victims. The bill would amend the Crime Victims Rights Act to provide victims with the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea agreement or deferred prosecution agreement. The exclusion of victims in these early stages of a criminal case profoundly impairs victims rights because. by the nature of these events. there often is no later proceeding in which victims can exercise their rights. The bill would also ensure that crime victims have access to appellate review when their rights are denied in the lower court. Regrettably. six appellate courts have misapplied the Crime Victims Rights Act by imposing an especially high standard for reviewing appeals by victims. requiring them to show \"clear and indisputable error\". Three other circuits have applied the correct standard: the ordinary appellate standard of legal error or abuse of discretion. This bill resolves the issue. setting a uniform standard for victims in all circuits by codifying the more victimprotecting rule. that the appellate court \"shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review.\" I am pleased that this bill has the support of numerous law enforcement and antitrafficking organizations: the Fraternal Order of Police. Shared Hope International. ECPATUSA. Coalition Against Trafficking in Women. CATW. Human Rights Project for Girls. Survivors for Solutions. Sanctuary For Families. World Hope International. Prostitution Research & Education. MISSSEY. Breaking Free. Equality Now. National Organization for Victim Assistance. Seraphim Global. Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. City of Oakland. Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation. Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition. and Casa Cornelia Law Center. These groups are on the forefront in the fight against sex trafficking. and I am proud to have their support. Many of the provisions in the Combat Human Trafficking Act were included in the substitute amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act. S. 2646. 113th Congress. which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee last September. However. that bill was not enacted into law before Congress adjourned. I am hopeful that we can pass the bipartisan Combat Human Trafficking in this Congress. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator PORTMAN in supporting this bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. we all recognize the danger that many hazardous chemicals and overthecounter drugs pose to children. Thats why we require childresistant packaging for these substances to prevent accidental poisonings that could result in serious injury or death. Unfortunately. there is no childresistant packaging required for concentrated liquid nicotine. which can be toxic if ingested or even absorbed through the skin. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics. AAP. some of these small bottles of liquid nicotine contain a concentrated and deadly amount of the substance. The AAP notes that this small bottle contains enough nicotine to kill four small children. Just a few drops of the liquid splashed on a childs skin can make the child very ill. The American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that poison control centers received 3.957 calls in 2014 related to liquid nicotine exposure. This is more than twice as many calls as in 2013. when AAPCC reported 1.543 calls related to liquid nicotine exposure. Sadly. it was only a matter of time before one of these accidental nicotine poisonings resulted in death. This past December. a 1yearold boy in New York State died after ingesting liquid nicotine in his home. We have to do more to protect children from deadly accidents like this. Today I am reintroducing the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act with Senators AYOTTE. BENNET.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to highlight a Presidential message that was delivered to Congress 50 years ago today. But before I reiterate the importance of Medicare and Medicaidfacts that I think my colleagues and I can all agree to I would like to look back at where we have been. to recall what life was like for so many people who were poor and disabled. uninsured or unlucky before these vital safety net programs were here. Those were the days of the \"poor farm\" and the \"almshouse.\" places the poor and uninsured would go for care. It wasnt a happy choice and more often than not. it was the only choice. These places provided care. often rudimentary. and often carried a stigma. Accommodations were sparse at best. In return for health care and housing. residents were expected to work in the adjoining farm or do housework or other menial labor to offset the cost of their stay. This was the primary option for someone whose extended family couldnt provide help or didnt want toright here in the USA. Few Americans today remember those days. When President Johnson submitted his message to Congress 50 years ago today. fewer than half of Americas elderly even had health insurance. In that era. and it wasnt that long ago. it wasnt uncommon for the sick elderly to be treated like second class citizens. and as a result. many aging Americans without family to care for them ended up destitute. without necessary health care. or on the street. It was a time no one wants to revisit. a time that one sociologist said was \"another America\" where \"40 to 50 million citizens were poor. who lacked adequate medical care. and who were .socially invisible to the majority of the population.\" It is worth remembering how far we have come. Today. I ask my colleagues to use this anniversary as a vivid reminder of the difference Medicare and Medicaid make in the daily lives of Americans. and also the health care advances that have occurred as a result. A couple facts to highlight for my colleagues: Today. with rocksolid essential health services. 54 million Americansnearly every senior and person with disabilitieshas access to Medicares guarantee. Meanwhile. Medicaid has made a critical difference for 68 million of the Nations most vulnerable. including more than 32 million children. 6 million seniors. and 10 million persons with disabilities. Because Medicare and Medicaid made health care possible for millions of people. they have also been the catalyst for innovations in treatment that benefit people of all ages. Heres one example: In the first 30 years of Medicare alone. deaths from heart disease dropped by a third for people over age 65. By providing coverage and access for millions. these programs became catalysts for changes in how medicine is practiced and paid for. while finding the root causes of disease and perfecting better therapies to treat them. As time has marched on. these programs evolved and improved. and the rest of the health care system followed. In 1967. Early and Periodic Screening. Diagnosis. and Treatment. EPSD. comprehensive health services benefit for all Medicaid children under age 21 was createdhelping improve the health of our Nations kids. In 1981. home and communitybased waivers were established so that states could provide services in a community setting. allowing individuals to remain in their home for as long as possible. Every state now uses this option to facilitate better care and services to their Medicaid population. In 1983. Medicare took one of many legs away from feeforservice with the advent of the hospital prospective payment system. a system that pays hospitals based on a patients illness. and how serious it was. not based solely on how much it cost to treat them. This change. once considered drastic. has become common place and accepted. In 2003. the prescription drug coverage was added to Medicares benefit. providing access to necessary medications for those most likely to need them. As a result of greater access to prescription drugs. beneficiaries health have dramatically improved. In 2010. as a result of health reform. preventive services became free to patients. prescription drugs became cheaper for those beneficiaries who fell in the donut hole. Medicare began to move away from purely volumedriven care. and onto paying for quality and value. and the life of the Medicare trust fund was extended. Finally. in 2012. the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid began releasing loads of claims data for the public to use. Access to this information has been gamechanging in understanding the cost of care and variations in the way medicine is practiced across the country. Today. any of these examples are easy to forget because they are commonplace. But that makes them no less remarkable. I will close by noting something else. just as striking about Medicare and Medicaid: It was a bipartisan effort. The enactment of these programs shows that Congress can craft bipartisan solutions to very complex and politically difficult problems. Thats what happened in 1965 when the Senate passed the legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid by a 6832 vote after the House approved it three months earlier on a robust 313115. As the 114th Congress gets underway. my colleagues and I could all take a page from President Johnsons playbook: Congress shouldnt use partisan tactics when the solutions can be bipartisan. And theres the lesson. that despite sharp differences and partisanship. the Congress of Johnsons day was able to rise above that culture and those challenges to find agreement and make America a much better place. As this new Congress begins. I hope we can use that 50yearold spirit to strengthen. protect and improve Medicare and Medicaid to keep the guarantee strong and ensure health care to those who need it most.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit the following article. [From the New York Times] (By Robert Pear) WASHINGTON. Spending on health care in the United States grew in 2013 at the lowest rate since the federal government began tracking it in 1960. the Obama administration said Wednesday. It was the fifth straight year of exceptionally small increases in the closely watched indicator. The data defied critics who had said such slow growth would not continue for long once the recession ended in mid 2009. Health spending totaled $2.9 trillion last year. up 3.6 percent from 2012. the administration said. The share of the economy devoted to health care. which appeared to be growing inexorably for decades. has been the same since 2009. \"The 3.6 percent increase in 2013 is the lowest increase on record in the national health expenditures going back to 1960.\" said Micah B. Hartman. a statistician at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and lead author of the report. published in the journal Health Affairs. \"The next lowest increase was 3.8 percent in 2009. These rates are within the range of the recent low rates of growth in health care spending. between 3.6 and 4.1 percent from 2009 to 2013.\" Spending for health care in 2013 averaged $9.255 a person. government economists and statisticians reported. Health spending grew at about the same pace as the economy and accounted for 17.4 percent of the gross domestic product. which reflects the total output of goods and services. Among factors restraining the growth of health spending. the administration pointed to new limits on Medicare payments to hospitals and health maintenance organizations. automatic acrosstheboard cuts in federal spending required by a 2011 law. and the proliferation of highdeductible health insurance plans. which tend to discourage the use of care by requiring consumers to pay more of the cost. Faster growth in Medicaid spending offset some of the slowdown in spending by Medicare and private insurance in 2013. officials said. The 2013 figures did not show the effects of major expansions in coverage that took effect this year. Moreover. the data did not answer a question hotly debated by health policy experts and economists: whether the recent slowdown in health spending was attributable to aftereffects of the recession or to costcontrol features of the Affordable Care Act. signed by President Obama in 2010. The civil servants who wrote the report said some provisions of the law \"exerted downward pressure\" on health spending while others \"exerted upward pressure. \"The key question is whether health spending growth will accelerate once economic conditions improve significantly.\" the report said. \"Historical evidence suggests that it will.\" Marilyn B. Tavenner. the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. said the report was \"another piece of evidence that our efforts to reform the health care delivery system are working.\" Retail sales of prescription drugs totaled $271 billion last year. accounting for 9.3 percent of all health spending. This proportion has not increased substantially in recent years. but it results from two divergent trends: an increase in the use of highcost specialty drugs and greater use of lowcost generic medicines. \"Higher prices for specialty drugs were due in part to expensive new medicinesin particular. those used to treat multiple sclerosis and canceras well as more rapid price increases for existing specialty drugs.\" Mr. Hartman said. \"Although specialty drugs accounted for less than 1 percent of prescriptions dispensed. they represented almost 28 percent of total pharmacyrelated prescription drug spending in 2013.\" At the same time. the report said. the share of prescriptions filled with generic drugs climbed to 80 percent in 2013. up from 73 percent in 2011. Under the Affordable Care Act. federal and state officials review insurance rates to identify \"unreasonable increases in premiums.\" and the government requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care and quality improvement activities. These provisions helped hold down health spending. the report said. The government reported lower use of inpatient and outpatient hospital services in 2013. coinciding with requirements for patients to share more of the cost under some types of insurance. For example. the report said. \"the average patient costsharing charge per day increased 19.5 percent in 2013. while the average costsharing for an outpatient surgery episode increased by 10 percent.\" Over all. the report said. medical prices increased just 1.3 percent in 2013. slightly less than prices in the general economy. Prices for doctors services increased less than onetenth of I percent. the smallest change since 2002. and prices for home health care services declined. While Medicare spending for doctors services increased 2.5 percent last year. Medicaid payments to doctors increased 14.9 percent. mainly because of a temporary increase in payment rates for primary care doctors treating Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare. for older Americans and people with disabilities. and Medicaid. for lowincome people. accounted for more than onethird of all health spending.",

The Moles is a national organization of professional women that strives to promote the civic and social welfare of its members. The Columbia Moles was sponsored for membership in the national body by the Charlotte. North Carolina Chapter and was chartered on January 16. 1965 as the 19th of what are currently 30 chapters. Incorporated in 1950. The Moles seeks to distinguish itself from similar social and civic organizations by supporting its national and local projects without public solicitation or fundraising. The Moles 30 chapters are located in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Each chapter meets monthly. and a National Conclave is held annually. As energetic. talented. and productive women who meet regularly to engage in organized social activities and sisterly exchanges of ideas. they have demonstrated great vision and leadership for five decades. However. the true foundation of The Moles success is its enduring sisterhood which has been indelibly forged in mutual love and respect. Their motto. \"enjoy yourself. its later than you think.\" reflects the primary purposes of The Moles: to individually and collectively enhance the social graces while pursuing educational opportunities and to enhance the civic welfare of its members. Since 1965. The Columbia Chapter has fulfilled these purposes through its elegant social events for members and guests. including fellowshipfilled monthly meetings and its renowned Labor Day Weekend retreats. The chapter also honors historic community leaders through the presentation of national Moles Resolutions and local recognition. The Columbia Chapter also makes annual contributions to numerous charitable and service organizations as part of the National Conclave. The Moles currently sponsors two fouryear scholarships to deserving students who are E30 competitively selected. The first scholarship was established in 1968 following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. and is appropriately named the Martin Luther King. Jr. Scholarship. In 2007. a second fouryear scholarship was established and named The Moles Scholarship. It is a great honor that the Columbia Chapters 2013 nominee. Mr. Lindsey Hallingquest. received the Martin Luther King. Jr. Scholarship. Lindsey. a Columbia. South Carolina native. is currently a sophomore at Duke University.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I wish to begin by saluting Congresswoman BARBARA LEE for hosting this Special Order. as well as her three decades of advocating for the normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. and to Congressman SAM FARR for devoting years of service to this issue. and working with so many individuals and organizations to bring down the walls of division between the two countries. On December 17. 2014. President Obama announced a major prisoner exchange with the Cuban government. Alan Gross. a USAID contractor who had been held captive for five years was finally reunited with his family. as were three Cuban intelligence agents who had been imprisoned in the U.S. since 1998. Rolando Sarraff Trujillo. a cryptographer in Cubas Directorate of Intelligence who reportedly provided information to the FBI. was also freed in the prisoner exchange. This announcement was highly significant and it is historic as well. In a televised address that followed the exchange. the President announced a major shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba: the reestablishment of diplomatic relations that were severed in 1961. thus drawing a curtain on many of the provisions of the longest standing embargo in U.S. history. The President stated that while the embargo was rooted in the \"best intentions.\" it ultimately failed in its goal to incite change in the communist government and has only served to isolate and hurt the Cuban people. I continue to harbor deep concerns about the reported human rights abuses in Cuba and limitations of speech and political expression. E31 but it is clear that our current policy has failed to end these practices. So just how will these policy changes positively affect the Cuban people and the United States? Remittances from the U.S. are a vital resource to millions of Cubans and to humanitarian projects in Cuba. Between $1.4 and $2 billion in remittances are transferred from the U.S. to Cuba each year. often from Cubans who immigrated to the U.S. to seek new opportunity. Cubans rely on this money to pay for food. monthly electricity bills. or for the daily expenses of life. And humanitarian projects receiving this aid provide food. clean water. essential infrastructure and education to Cubans. When the average monthly salary in Cuba is a mere $20. the significance of this transfer of money comes into full view. Limits on remittances have stifled real progress. and raising these limits from $500 to $2.000 per quarter will usher in a new wave of much needed aid to counter the Cuban governments infliction of serious harm to the wellbeing of its people. Despite harsh government regulations. Cuba does have a nascent burgeoning private sector economy. I saw this firsthand last year when I visited Cuba as part of a Congressional delegation. During the trip. I participated in a roundtable with a number of Cuban female entrepreneurs to hear their concerns and discuss what can be done to support their efforts to create new business. I believe this shift in U.S.-Cuba relations will act as a healthy seed for entrepreneurial growth in Cuba. From authorizing expanded commercial sales and exports. to facilitating an expansion of travel to Cuba from the U.S.. we will do more to empower the Cuban people than we have in the over 50year embargo. Today. Cuba imports approximately 80 percent of its food. a stunning statistic. American agriculture has long supported an opening of relations and now Cubas economy will be bolstered and this in turn will bring enormous value to American farmers. Even more empowering is an emboldening tool of democratization. the Internet. As weve seen in countless other countries around the world. the Internet is an individuals megaphone. It is the place for discourse. For collaboration. For free speech. For democracy! By extending telecommunications and technology services to Cuba. the Cuban people will have access to a tremendous exchange of knowledge and ideas with unparalleled power to inspire change. These efforts by the U.S. are not exhaustive. Only our vigilance and continued assessment of our relations with Cuba will provoke lasting change for Cubans. But it is also imperative for Latin American countries to reinvigorate their ties with Cubas civil and political leaders. Democratic Latin American countries. such as Mexico and Brazil. can send a strong signal of support to the Cuban Democratic movement by reinvigorating their relations with Cuba. just as the U.S. is doing. I have supported a change in U.S.-Cuba policy since I was elected to Congress in 1992. and I welcome and celebrate the decision of the President to make this a reality. Its very exciting to look forward to heralding a new era of opportunity and democratic values for Cuba. a pragmatic partnership with the U.S.. support from other Latin American countries. and the abandonment of oppression of the Cuban people by the U.S. embargo. as well as the Cuban government itself.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize H&H Soul Food at 807 Forsyth Street in Macon. Georgia. The popular Southern restaurant has been named the \"most iconic restaurant in Georgia\" by Thrillist.com. a website that specializes in food. beverage. and entertainment. In order to earn this honorable designation. a restaurant must have been in existence for at least 30 years. and yet still maintain its popularity among its clients. In other words. title winners not only survive the test of time. but they do so while remaining an \"icon\" in the community. H&H effectively does both. The restaurant traces its roots all the way back to the civil rights era. when owners Inez Hill and Louise Hudson. known affectionately as Mama Hill and Mama Louise. first opened the doors in 1959. They have been serving Southern classics ever since. with crowd pleasers such as fried chicken. peach cobbler. and of course. sweet tea. Historically. the eatery was frequented by prominent musical figures such as The AlIman Brothers Band. Wet Willie. and the Molly Hatchet Band. Legend has it that The AlIman Brothers Band in their early years did not have enough money to pay for the food but Mama Louise took care of them anyway. She continued to serve other Southern musicians over the years and the restaurant also became a common meeting place for influential civil rights activists. including members and officers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Adding to its list of modern celebrities and changemakers. H&H even welcomed a visit from Oprah Winfrey in 2007. CoFounder Inez Hill passed away that very same year. and the restaurant suffered a brief closing at the end of 2013. Nevertheless. H&H overcame adversity and recovered successfully from financial difficulty with the assistance of Macons Moonhanger Group. The restaurant is thriving again today and continues to welcome its regular patrons as well as new guests from all over. H&Hs enduring imprint on Macons landscape bears tribute to its lasting influence and historic renown in the hearts of the people of Georgia. Mr. Speaker. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the iconic H&H restaurant in Macon. Georgia for its rich history. its perseverance. and its dedication to serving the community the most delicious soul food around.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I submit the following letters. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the three million members of the National Education Association. and the students they serve. we urge you to vote NO on the Save American Workers Act of 2015 . scheduled for a floor vote this week. Votes associated with this issue may be included in NEAs Report Card for the 114th Congress. We oppose the bill because we believe it would create a disincentive for employers to provide health care coverage. negatively impacting employer- sponsored health insurance and harming families. children and educators who need coverage. We believe that the Affordable Care Acts (ACA) shared responsibility for employers. sometimes referred to as the employer penalty. supports the overall goal of expanding quality. affordable coverage to all Americans. We are concerned that this bills changes to the ACAs definition of what constitutes fulltime employment from \"on average at least 30 hours of service per week\" monthly to an average of 40 hours per week monthly would adversely affect overall employersponsored health coverage. That change would make a shift towards parttime employment much more likely. Employers could respond by cutting employees hours to under an average of 40 per week to avoid possible shared responsibility penalties and could eliminate coverage for these employees without fear of penalties. The result of a cut in employee hours would be substantially less employersponsored health coverageand as a result. a potentially large increase in federal spending for the premium tax credits that many lowand moderateincome people will receive under health reform to help them buy coverage through a health insurance marketplace (exchange). Employers and employees would also face a complex new administrative burden as they tried to determine which employees paid on a salaried basis fell above or below the 40hour mark. salaried school employees exact hours of service are generally not counted the same way as hourly employees hours. but tallying their inschool and outofschool hours would suddenly become issues of concern to employers interested in avoiding penalties. Additionally if employmentbased coverage is reduced. an even greater number of lowincome individuals and their families in the 23 states that have failed to expand Medicaid would be unable to afford to buy health coverage. In those states. childless adults whose incomes fall below 100 percent of the federal poverty line would not only be denied access to Medicaid coverage. but they would be ineligible for premium tax credits and costsharing reductions through a health insurance marketplace. Moving the fulltime definition from 30 hours to 40 hours. as this bill does. would only expand the number of people hurt by this coverage gap. We believe H.R. 30 misses the mark by substituting \"40 hours\" for \"30 hours\" because it would do nothing to stop employers misuse of the ACAs employer penalty provisions as a justification for cutting employees hours of service and health coverage. Experience with this portion of the ACA shows that one of the biggest implementation challenges in the education sector consists of making sure that employers and other health plan sponsors fully understand the laws provisions related to shared responsibility for employers. For years. we have engaged with the Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service to ensure that regulations on shared responsibility for employers work consistently well in the education sector. and believe regulators have taken important steps in this direction. E32 The changes contemplated in this bill. however. would simply shift the hoursrelated context in which these common errors take place: Mistakenly believing that the only way to avoid employer penalties is to cut employees hours to under 30 a week or to under six hours a day. In fact. school calendars include so many unpaid days during the school yearfor spring break. winter break. federal holidays. and other such timesthat hourly employees can normally work more than 6 hours a day without ever being considered a fulltime employee. Misunderstanding how and when to use proposed regulations related to an optional hourscounting method called the lookback measurement method. Its unfortunate that some school employers wrongly blame the lookback measurement method for limiting their hourscounting options when regulations recognize four different ways that employers can calculate whether an employee is a fulltimer or not. Overestimating the potential cost of complying with the laws provisions on shared responsibility for employers. Regulations in lude many ways that employers can minimize or even avoid penalties. but some employers fail to factor these options into their analyses. so they exaggerate and often incorrectly state the potential for penalties. Failing to incorporate into their decisionmaking the statutory and regulatory provisions that ensure that this part of the ACA establishes the possibility of a penalty on large employers rather than an \"employer mandate.\" Just like before the ACA became law. there is no federal law that requires employers to offer coverage to employees. Many large employers will not face penalties at all. or will face smaller penalties than they initially thought. These and other ACAimplementation errors can lead to exaggerated responses that hurt students. workers. and families alike. Unfortunately. H.R. 30 would just shift the hoursrelated focal point for such errors. Employers who take the time to understand the law and regulations as they currently stand can develop common sense. constructive. and consensual approaches to properly implementing the law. Again. we urge you to vote NO on Save American Workers Act of 2015. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday. the House voted on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. H.R. 26. and today. the House will consider the Save American Workers Act of 2015. H.R. 30. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 amends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to extend the Terrorism Insurance Program through December 31. 2020. and revises certain requirements of the program. It also establishes the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB). which will have the authority to license insurance agents and brokers to operate in multiple states. The House passed this bill on December 10. 2014. by a vote of 4177. However. because the Senate did not act on the House passed bill before the end of the 113th Congress. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program expired on December 31. The Save American Workers Act of 2015 changes the definition of \"full time employee\" as applied to the Affordable Care Acts (Obamacare) employer mandate. This will prevent small businesses from reducing employee hours solely because they cannot afford to comply with the Obamacare mandate. The House passed this bill on September 16. 2014. by a vote of 320102. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 increases direct spending in the budget year as well as over the tenyear budget window. bringing the Committee on Financial Services over its 302(a) allocation in the first year and over ten years. violating section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA). Additionally. the bill violates the Houses \"Cut As You Go\" rule (Rule XXI. clause 10) by increasing direct spending over the relevant enforcement time periods. without being offset by direct spending cuts of equal or greater value. The spending increases in this bill are fully offset through a surcharge on commercial property and casualty policyholders and NARAB fees. and the bill as a whole provides deficit reduction over the relevant enforcement time periods. As a result. I did not oppose a waiver of section 302(f) of the CBA and the \"Cut As You Go\" rule for consideration of this bill on this occasion. The Save American Workers Act of 2015 also increases direct spending in the budget year and over the tenyear budget window. violating section 302(f) of the CBA and the Houses \"Cut As You Go\" rule (Rule XXI. clause 10). The bill also reduces revenues over the tenyear budget window. violating section 311 of the CBA. Because the revenue loss results from a repeal of Obamacare tax increases. and the bill increases cash wages and opportunities for workers. I support granting a waiver of sections 302(f) and 311 of the CBA and the \"Cut as You Go\" rule for consideration of this bill on this occasion. However. my lack of opposition to these waivers should not be interpreted as a willingness to support similar waivers in the future. Budget enforcement is among my top priorities for the 114th Congress. As we move into the 114th Congress and begin drafting new legislation. it is my intention to ensure compliance with the CBA and House Rules as they apply to budget enforcement and the budget resolution in effect at the time of enforcement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. along with twelve of my colleagues. I am reintroducing the Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act. This bill will ensure that oil companies can no longer sidestep paying their fair share into the dedicated trust fund created so that. in the event of an oil spill. there are resources immediately available for cleanup. If enacted. the legislation would generate approximately $665 million over ten years. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. authorized in 1990. ensures we have funding available to pay for the immediate costs of cleaning up oil spills. It is funded by an eight cent per barrel excise tax on crude oil and petroleum products. In 2011. however. the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a misguided decision stating that oil derived from tar sands. the same type that will flow through the Keystone XL Pipeline if approved. is not considered crude oil and is therefore currently exempt from the tax that pays into the Fund. E34 In 2013. we imported approximately 925 million barrels of crude oil from Canada. with over 400 million of these barrels coming from tar sands and not subject to the tax that goes into the cleanup fund. This is a significant liability. without any investment being made for if and when there is a tar sands spill. Oil that comes from tar sands is a thick. sticky form of crude oil that can be more difficult and costly to clean up than other types of crude. In 2010. for example. a pipeline owned and operated by a Canadian company. Enbridge. spilled more than 850.000 gallons of tar sands oil into a waterway that flows into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. That has been one of the largest and costliest pipeline spills in American history. with the price tag now at $1.2 billion dollars. I do not support the development of tar sandsdoing so is environmentally destructive and carbonintensive. Moreover. we should not keep in place a loophole that lets big oil companies off the hook for cleaning up their tar sands spills. The Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act would add oil derived from tar sands and oil shale to the definition of crude oil. closing the current loophole and ensuring that oil companies pay into the fund. Oil companies already get billions of dollars in taxpayerbased subsidies. and this bill will ensure they will not be given an additional free ride on tar sands and any future oil shale development.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Floridas LGBT community in their fight against discrimination. In particular. I would like to commend their commitment to bringing marriage equality to the great State of Florida. Following decades of advocacy and exhaustive legal battles. marriage equality finally became legal this week in Florida. At 12:01 a.m. on January 6. 2015. the Osceola County Courthouse opened its doors. I stood with Armando Ramirez. the countys Clerk of Courts. as he conducted the first samesex marriage ceremony in Central Florida. which united County Commissioner Cheryl Grieb and her partner of 22 years. Patti Daugherty. At long last. the promise of marriage equality was fulfilled. More than twenty couples participated in marriage ceremonies. before the courthouse doors closed at 2 a.m. These couples had at last achieved one of the greatest promises of this nation. the promise of equal protection under the law. What this demonstrated is that the American Dream is not really about a house. a job. or a 401(k) plan. The American Dream is also about love. opportunity. and equalitythe promise that each and every one of us has the right to love whomever we please. and the opportunity to have our love recognized equally by the law. Thanks to the unrelenting efforts of Floridians fighting for marriage equality. samesex couples in Florida finally had that opportunity. The marriages that began on January 6th at 12:01 a.m. could not have happened without the perseverance of these individuals. To those Floridians who fought for this day. I say \"congratulations\" and \"thank you.\" Thank you for helping our State and our communities come one step closer to true equality. I am proud to have worked with you to achieve this goal. There is more work to be done. and I look forward to serving as your ally in the years ahead. The Osceola County Commission and the Osceola County Clerk of Courts Armando Ramirez also deserve thanks for their efforts. When county clerks in Florida were advised that they would face arrest if they issued samesex licenses. Commissioner Grieb and I called on State Attorney Jeff Ashton to promise that he would not prosecute clerks for doing so. Thankfully. he agreed. Following my letter urging the County Commission to ensure that samesex marriages could take place in Osceola County immediately. the Commission and the Clerk worked together to issue licenses and conduct ceremonies as soon as legally possible. I also want to acknowledge the Floridians who fought for marriage equality but never lived to see this dream become reality. For those who called for marriage equality when others said it was impossible. those who had the audacity to believe in equality when many could not. and those who paved the way for this historical achievement but never experienced it for themselves. This is their legacy. May their memory serve as an inspiration for the next generation of Floridians striving to achieve a more equal and just world. Thank you. Mr. Speaker. for allowing me to celebrate this enormous accomplishment and honor the Floridians who made this happen.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise as cochair of the Congressional Polish Caucus to announce that this week in Washington. at an historic ceremony to be held today at the Polish Embassy. Thursday. January 8. preeminent American scholar and historian Dr. Timothy Snyder will be awarded the Officers Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland by Minister of Foreign Affairs Grzegorz Schetyna on behalf of the nation of Poland. We in Ohio are celebrating this occasion because we know the global significance of Dr. Snyders work. His scholarship allows libertys flag to fly higher. An Ohioan by birth. Dr. Snydernow Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale Universityhas been documenting the complicated. epic history of what he terms \"The Bloodlands.\" the 20th century history of Europe between Hitler and Stalin. With the opening of the Soviet archives after the fall of the Soviet Union. Dr. Snyder has led a team of incredible scholars from many nations in piecing together the complex. and often under reported history. of what happened to people in Europe before. during. and after World Wars I and II. He places the historical and political complexities that led to World War II in a broad. contextual framework unparalleled by other efforts. He factually documents the suffering that innocent people from various nations endured in places that still today have seriously inadequate archival memory of what occurred. Dr. Snyder. in my opinion. is one of the most indefatigable and profound scholars of our time. As author of the bill that created the World War II Memorial here in our nations Capitalwhich has now been visited by over 42 million peopleit is clear to me the American people through their own families understand the magnitude of what was at stake. But as Dr. Snyder rightly points out. \"Americas soldiers never reached far enough east. He states. \"American and British forces liberated German concentration camps such as Belsen and Dachau. But the western Allies liberated none of the important death facilities . . . the Red Army liberated Auschwitz. and it liberated the sites of Treblinka. Sobibor. Belzen. Chelmno. Majdanek. American and British forces reached none of the bloodlands and saw none of the major killing sites.\" Even America was shielded from the bloody truth of tyrannys grip on the continent of Europe. The people of Poland even more fully comprehend the betrayal and suffering that their Slavic ancestors endured in Poland and Sovietized Ukraine. The Jewish people of the world know too what happened there and why the struggle for Israels existence continues to this day. The people of Belarus. Hungary. Latvia. Estonia. and Lithuania and adjoining nations know too. With the systematic ethnic slaughter that occurred. Dr. Snyders masterful work pays homage to all victims. in the most complete and objective presentation I have read. Yet. still more scholarly work needs to occur. This past August. the people of Poland commemorated the memory of the Warsaw Uprising. Those brave Poles honored at that national remembrance lived and died by the motto \"Freedom Means Never Surrender.\" Poland never surrendered. Her capital was levelled. And the martyrdom of Polesfully twenty percent of the people of that nationhumbles us mortals who stand in awe of their valor against insurmountable odds. What distinguishes Snyders work is its comprehensiveness and depth in paying tribute to the fallen across that entire war torn region. We will fly a flag over the U.S. Capitol honoring the work of American scholar Dr. Timothy Snyder and his legion of dedicated scholars. I have come to respect Dr. Snyders work because his scholarship helped me reach my own epiphany and conclusion about why it has taken the world so long to appreciate what the people of Poland suffered during that gruesome period. Nearly all of the educated and academic leaders of Poland were annihilated at Katyn in 1940. when over 23.000 were rounded up and summarily shot by Stalins NKVD. the Soviet secret police. There simply was almost no Polish memory left able to record and relate. It has taken new generations of those able to probe the carnage to enlighten the pages of memory. So. please let me express sincere gratitude to the government of Poland for bestowing this great honor on a native son of Ohio who has gone on to serve the cause of historical truth. As a history major myself from my own alma materthe great University of WisconsinI E35 recall the words of that Universitys motto: \"Whatever limitations may trammel inquiry elsewhere. we believe that the great State University of Wisconsin should encourage the continual sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found.\" Dr. Timothy Snyder and his associates surely live those words. Congratulations! Onward truth. Onward liberty.",

Sadly. JoJo passed away on Tuesday. December 23. 2014. A homegoing celebration was held in his honor on Saturday. January 3. 2015 at 1:00 p.m. at the Occasions Event Center in Columbus. Georgia. JoJo was born in Phenix City. Alabama where he attended Mother Mary Mission School. He and his brothers. Gene and Fletcher. were gifted with musical talents which they shared performing together across the Columbus area. But JoJo was destined for greatness and he rose to become an incredibly wellknown and adored American blues and soul singer with a distinctive style. JoJo was a passionate and dedicated artist who captured the hearts of hundreds of fans with his duets with Peggy Scott. Their best hits made it to the Billboard charts and eventually became gold records. The hit \"Pickin Wild Mountain Berries\" was also nominated for a Grammy. For over 40 years. JoJo worked to accomplish his dream of making his music heard all around the world. His music traveled across nations delighting the ears of many fans of different backgrounds. and he became known as a great International Recording Artist. In 2004. JoJo was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame for his wondrous musical talent. He was also elected to become Ambassador of Music in Columbus. Georgia. Throughout his life. he continued to receive honors and accolades as he became a successful entrepreneur while still recording music and performing shows. JoJo was also an avid golfer. He loved the game and his life in many ways reflected it. On the front nine. he always managed to land in the fairway. with long beautiful drives. great approach shots. excellent chips. solid putts and thunderous cheers from the gallery. On the back nine. he struggled not to land out of bounds. to get back to the fairway. to avoid the hazards and to reach the greenswith loud groans from some in the gallery. But he did not pick up his ball and quit! He kept his pride. never gave up and continued planning his next shot and his next big show! As a man. JoJo was charming and his silver tongue and flamboyant persona melted the hearts of countless ladies who found themselves overcome and taken by his infectious charisma. But watch out! If you crossed him. that same tongue using the most acid invective and most colorful expletives could inflict a sharp and cutting tongue lashingan old fashioned \"cussing out!\" JoJo is survived by his children. Joseph Hewell. Jr.. Gregory Henley. Dionne Henley. Collette McCoy. and Josette McCoy. a host of grandchildren. greatgrandchildren. nieces. and nephews. siblings. Walter Gene Hewell. Vera Harris. Windon Harris. Litton Harris. Rita Harris. Lois Hewell Hall. Sherwood Hewell. Jessie Hewell. Michael Hewell. Danny Hewell. and Carl Stevens. lifelong companion Angela McCoy. lifelong friend Shirley Sturgis. and many. many friends. JoJo loved life and lived it to the fullest. He was my friend and he touched all of our lives in ways we will never forget. JoJos legacy will live on in the spirit of his children and many stories and anecdotes will be enjoyed by his grandchildren. greatgrandchildren. nieces. and nephews. JoJos eleven siblings and many friends will always recount the joy of knowing. loving. and sharing the life of such a unique and accomplished man. Mr. Speaker. my wife Vivian and I. along with the more than 700.000 residents of Georgias Second Congressional District and adoring fans across the world. continue to enjoy and cherish JoJo Bensons remarkable musical achievements. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest sympathies to JoJos family. friends and loved ones during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days. weeks and months ahead.",

Last years murder of two NYPD officers is a sober reminder that our Nations law enforcement officers face danger every day as they carry out their duty to protect the American people.

In 1990. we authorized the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for the immediate costs of cleaning up oil spills. and it is funded by an excise tax on crude oil and petroleum products. but the oil derived from tar sands that would be transported through the Keystone XL pipeline is not subject to this tax. Since that oil is a thick. sticky form of crude. more difficult and costly to clean up than other types of oil. the exemption makes no sense. especially if it is as safe as some allege. That is why yesterday I reintroduced the Tar Sands Tax Loophole Elimination Act. which would ensure that oil pays into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that travels through this pipeline if it is ever constructed.

I share with the President the goal of giving more Americans the opportunity to go to college. but I would submit to him he should not be holding up the Tennessee Promise plan in Tennessee as an example. He should be holding up the Tennessee HOPE Lottery Scholarship program. which I worked 20 years to achieve in Tennessee and has provided over $3 billion to education. $250 million a year. Scholarship programs such as the President is talking about should have standards for students in high school to achieve to get a scholarship. They should have strong standards in college to maintain them. They should be in addition to Pell grants and in addition to other scholarships to pay for books and tuition. The Promise plan takes from middle class and lower income students and gives to higher income students. doesnt have standards in high school to get the scholarship. and doesnt have high standards to keep it. It is a last dollar scholarship. The Presidents plan should be more like the Tennessee HOPE Lottery Scholarship: assure students have an incentive in high school to get it and incentives to keep it with high grade standards. and it shouldnt go to forprofit schools. for that is an invitation to abuse.

JEFF SESSIONS. had already generated some great model language doing just that. so we crafted that into the House bill. We are still working on it. but I am confident that strong defund language will be presented to this House for inclusion in the Homeland appropriations title.

And for those who have not heard. according to the administration. the final hurdle has been removed. and that is that the Nebraska Supreme Court this morning has approved the pathway for the pipeline. the routing of the pipeline. the Keystone XL pipeline. Again. the administration has said that was the major hurdle. It has fallen. So I hope the President is not going to establish another hurdle. that being himself. America is undergoing an energy renaissance. and the prospect of securing North American energy independence is in sight. However. to achieve our goal of energy security. we need to make sure we have the infrastructure in place to keep pace with the changing energy landscape. Keystone will be a critical addition to the Nations pipeline network. increasing our supply of oil and helping to reduce its cost. The State Department completed its environmental analysis a year ago. However. there has still been no action by the administration on the pipeline. There is simply no reason to delay this important project. As I mentioned. the Presidents main argument in this premature veto threat is that the bill would authorize the pipeline despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in Nebraska. Well. that uncertainty has ended this morning. and the Supreme Court of Nebraska has allowed the planned route to go forward in Nebraska. Again. there is simply no reason to delay. In fact. the southern leg of the pipeline has already been built. In March 2012. in Oklahoma. the President expressed his support for expediting construction for the southern leg of the Keystone pipeline. and I agree with the President when he stated at that ceremony that he was directing his administration to cut through red tape. break through bureaucratic hurdles. and make this project a priority to go ahead and get it done. It was the right thing to do then. it is the right thing to do now. and it is exactly what this bill does. We should move forward because this pipeline will be a tremendous boon to the economic development and one that doesnt require a single Federal dollar. The very nature of infrastructure improvement creates jobs. and Keystone is no exception. I know my colleagues have made the argument that it is only temporary. but every infrastructure job is a temporary job. When a road is completed. when a bridge is completed. when a pipeline is completed. those construction workers move on to hopefully other construction jobs. Indeed. five unions representing over 3 million workersand I repeat that to my Democratic colleagues. five unions representing 3 million hardworking Americanssupport this project. and I would like to submit their letter in the RECORD for support of this project.",

When these jobs are completed. they will move on to other. hopefully. construction jobs. but what is left behind will have a positive impact to our economy. to job creation for a generation. Our energy renaissance is helping make North America more secure and energy independent. and. in fact. I want to quote the President: In this time of significant political uncertainty in key oilproducing countries and regions. and in the context of a difficult economic situation. nonOPEC Canada crude oil supplies advance the energy security of the United States. Now. I wish he would have said that about this pipeline. but he didnt. He said it in 2009 about the Enbridge pipeline. which started transferring oil sands from Canada to the gulf coast last month. The President. 5 years ago. supported this type of thing. He should support it now. So other than politics. I dont understand why he hasnt approved this project as he did with Enbridge. It is time to build. Ladies and gentlemen. I especially look to my Democratic colleagues. Lets put down our gloves. Lets do something positive for America. for those 3 million union workers that are out there supporting this. Lets do what is good for the environment. Lets do what is good for energy independence. Finally. lets be fair to our greatest friends in the world. our Canadian neighbors. They allowed us to build a pipeline across their land. We should allow them to do the same in ours. They are our best allies. They are our greatest friends. They are a great neighbor. So let us. today. pass this bill and build the Keystone pipeline. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

It is cold enough I guess for Groundhog Day. but this will be the 10th time in the last 4 years that the House of Representatives has moved this bill with the assertion that somehow it leads us to energy independence. energy security. lower prices at the pump. Well. the reality is a Canadian corporation is going to build a pipeline from Canada to Texas. They are going to be exempt from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. unlike most other projects in this country. because of a stupid ruling by the IRSbut that is nothing newregarding tar sands. So they will be exempt from paying into that. So if this thing bursts. there is an accident. the taxpayers of the United States get the bill. not the taxpayers of Canada. They dont get the bill. The taxpayers of the United States get the bill. Now. that is one of a number of problems regarding this project. It is somewhat unprecedented. I believe. This may have happened at some other time in American history. but I do find it particularly ironic today. when we had the reading of the Constitution. that the effect of passing this bill. if it were to become lawand the President has already said he will veto it. But if this were to become law. the effect would be to give a foreign corporation the right to take private property from American citizens. I am not aware of any other time in the history of the Union where we have given a foreign corporation the right to take Americans private property. And. yes. some people were happy to sell the rights. but many others werent. including some in Nebraska and some in Texas. It has been quite contentious among landowners who are just having this corporation come. I would like to put in the RECORD a letter from TransCanada. We have blacked out the name of the recipient of the letter. but it is a true copy of a letter to a person who will have their private property taken by eminent domain by a foreign corporation. and the foreign corporation informs them that they will begin proceedings this month. I guess because of the anticipated Republican action. to take their private property away.",

Yes. there will be construction jobs. and I am the first to admit we need more jobs in America. In fact. I voted against the Presidents socalled stimulus bill because it didnt invest enough in building infrastructure in this country. Instead. it did a whole bunch of stupid tax cuts because of Larry Summers. a highly acclaimed hack economist. and we didnt put a lot of people back to work. Seven percent went to infrastructure. that created jobs. 42 percent went to tax cuts. didnt create jobs. But that is another agenda the Republicans are pursuing is tax cuts to create jobs. but we wont get into that here today. So. yes. that will happen. but there are a lot of other investments we should. could. and I believe the chairman supports making that will create significant construction and infrastructure jobs. Now. were this just in isolation and it didnt involve the total destruction of the boreal forests of Canada. if I were Canadian I would be pretty upset about that. and perhaps the dirtiest. most environmentally problematic way of extracting fossil fuels from the ground to get these oil sands. the construction jobs might carry the day. but sometimes you have to draw a line. In this case. we also hear it is going to lead somehow to energy security. Well. that is interesting because the crude. tar sand oil. or whatever you want to call it. is going to come down to Texas without paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fundcreating a potential problem for the future taxpayers of the United Statesgo to a refinery in an export zone in Texas. and. yes. it will be refined and then it will be exported. We are exporting millions of gallons of fuel every day. so to somehow say this is going to lead to lower prices at the pump in Americamaybe it is lower prices at the pump in China or I dont know where else. Japan or someplace. but it isnt going to be here because the product is ultimately going to be exported. So it is also not going to do anything for our energy security. and at the moment we have kind of a surfeit because of fracking and other things of fuels. and prices are down considerably. So those are just a few of the problems. And by passing this bill. the House of Representatives will attempt to preempt the executive authority of the President in this matter because this pipeline crosses an international border. The President has authority. and the State Department has been considering it. And even with the Supreme Court of Nebraska refusing to make a judgment. they didnt uphold the law of the Nebraska legislature. In fact. four out of seven judgesnormally a majority in most placessaid it was unconstitutional. but Nebraska has a peculiarity that if the other three judges take a walkwhich they didthen even though a majority found it unconstitutional. it is not found unconstitutional. and that is the end of the proceeding. So that is the big news out of Nebraska. They need a little work on their constitution. I think. So it hasnt received a stamp of approval there. There are still aggrieved landowners in Nebraska who object to the route and who are going to have their private property taken by a foreign corporation. So other than that. it is a great idea.

It speaks volumes about the Republican agenda. as this new Congress convenes. that the first order of business in the House and Senate is to rubberstamp the Keystone XL pipeline. We have not dealt with unemployment benefits that the American people need that have lapsed for more than a year. Millions of Americans are suffering from a low minimum wage and income disparity. but we are not helping them. Women in this country still only earn 77 cents to every dollar their male counterparts earn. but we are not trying to end that disparity. Instead. they are forcing Keystone through without the proper approval process. Building a pipeline clear across the United States so that TransCanada can sell its dirty tar sands oil to the highest biddernamely Chinais not in the American peoples best interests. We take on the risk to our lands. the American people face threats to their health. and TransCanada gets to reap the rewards. That is not a winning formula for our country or the economy. In fact. it is a sham. And yet the Keystone XL pipeline continues to be sold to the American people on blatantly false pretenses. We are told by proponents that this is about job creation. yet not a single independent analysis supports these claims. The burden of proof is on the GOP. They pull fantastic claims out of thin air. and yet they refuse to back them up. Instead. we are told to take their assertions at face value. Here is what we actually know. These are the facts that can actually be substantiated: The State Department found in its supplemental environmental impact study of the Keystone pipeline that it will generate less than 2.000 jobs a year for 2 years and only during the period of construction. Once the pipeline is built. these jobs will disappear. leaving a mere 35 permanent jobs that will result from this project35. To put that in context. under President Obama. 353.000 jobs were generated in November and a total of 2.9 million in 2014. There is also the claim that it is going to lower gas prices for the American people. Please. Gas prices have been dropping for more than 100 straight days and are at the lowest level in more than 512 years. They wont go any lower by allowing oil to be piped across our country just to be sold abroad. In contrast to fantasy impacts on gas prices. the potential impacts on our environment are very real. Not only will burning these tar sands add to global climate change. but any leak. failure. or. God forbid. explosion will have disastrous impacts on our environment. And because tar sands importers are exempt from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. the American taxpayers will have to bear the cost of cleaning up any spills. The public needs to know these facts. and that is why allowing 1 hour of debate with not a single. solitary amendment today robs the American people of a full debate and discussion. On top of all that. this bill is being pushed through despite the fact that it violates not one but two treaties with American Indian nations. What does this say about the GOPs respect for the rule of law? If the Republicans truly want to generate jobs for the American people. they should fully fund the highway trust fund and support the GROW AMERICA Act to invest in the crumbling infrastructure all across this country. not help Canadians build a superhighway for their dirty tar sands oil. We would be supporting not just 2.000 jobs per year for 2 years but millions of jobs for American families. across every congressional district. Mr. Speaker. my colleagues have a chance to take an important stand today early in this Congress on behalf of taxpayers. the environment. Native American communities. and the rule of law by supporting President Obamas veto and rejecting this toxic giveaway to foreign corporate oil interests.",

And let me give a real example: In 2010. a Canadian company. Enbridge. had a pipeline burst in Marshall. Michigan. spilling 1 million gallons of tar sands oil. Now. here is the thing. All oil has viscosity and other characteristics. The thing about tar sands oil is. it doesnt float. It goes right to the bottom. They are still dredging Canadian tar sands oil out of the bottom of the Kalamazoo River 4 years later. And so far. claims of $53 million have been made. which will have to be paid by American taxpayers against the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and not by Enbridge. the Canadian corporation. Which is what we are setting up here: an even greater transshipment by a foreign corporation. exempt from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. creating even bigger potential for spills with this oil. which has unique characteristics which are much more difficult to clean up if it comes in contact with water and. God forbid. it gets into the aquifer in one of the States that are being transected. The chairman did reference the 15 hearings. We have a difference in counting. But lets say 15 hearings. Three were in the Rules Committee. Those arent hearings. That is sort of a little star chamber where you take things before you bring them to the floor of the House. You dont discuss substance there.

And of course the bill that was marked up by the Transportation Committee in the first session of the last Congress was very different than the bill that is being advocated for today. which has not been marked up. And we heard a lot about regular order. read the bill. and all that stuff. It is fine to say. gee. we have voted on this a lot of times before. With 61 new Members of the House. gas prices are down by almost 50 percent. a lot of things have changed. I would even wonder about the viability of this project.

Mr. Speaker. this is a bill that makes numerous project benefits a reality. According to the Department of Energy. the pipeline will transport over 800.000 barrels per day of oil from Canada to the gulf coast. which will help reduce reliance on more hostile nations. Some have argued that the oil will just be exported. but the administrations own environmental analysis denies that that will ever occur. It will also create goodpaying jobs now. while promoting the growth of our energy economy for the future. This is the most studied pipeline in our history.

I could support the construction of this pipeline but do not believe Congress should circumvent the administrative view. Mr. Speaker. let me just recommend something perhaps through you to the Chair.

Canada. is a big part of that. In August of 2009. President Obama signed off on a new pipeline called the Alberta Clipper. Guess what? It brings 400.000 barrels of oil a day from western Canada to the United States. We have been waiting for the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline for yearsover 6 in fact. I remember well when President Obama promised to do whatever it takes to create American jobs. That was followed by a socalled year of action. yet here we are. 6 years later. and nothing has happened. By the administrations own estimates. tens of thousands of jobs will be supported by this landmark project. Bringing oil from Canada to the U.S. displaces imports from Venezuela and the Middle East. Isnt that a good thing? I also note that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signaled that she was inclined to support the project. and that was way back in 2010. In fact. in the summer of 2011. the White House issued its first veto threat against congressional action on the Keystone XL. claiming that legislation was unnecessary because their process was working and a decision would be reached by the end of that year. Since then. we have upgraded new oil and gas pipeline standards. and Keystone will exceed those. Mr. President. as it should. We used to be a nation of big ideas and big dreams. We imagined building the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge and accomplished both in far less time than it has taken the President to muster the courage to simply say \"yes\" or \"no.\" We can do better. The election. Mr. President. is over. There has been broad. bipartisan support for this project from the very first day.

I rise in support of this bill because I support North American energy development. Today. the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed that Keystone XL should be built. Keystone XL pipeline not the first crossborder pipeline project built in North America. But if some opponents had their way. Keystone XL pipeline would be the last pipeline we built in North America. Energy prices are at their lowest point in the last decade. Energy imports from partners like Canada and Mexico. and domestic production. have put more than $900 a year in the pockets of the American people. Keystone XL will continue this success in a time of struggle. The United States still imports approximately 40 percent of the oil we use domestically. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has decided to directly challenge the new North American energy market by maintaining. and in some cases. increasing production. This is a direct affront to North American producers and an allout price war. This. however. is a struggle we can win. with the help of our North American partners. Breakeven prices for North American crude. including Canadian oil sands and United States shale oil. are as low as $40 per barrel. Our producers can support our domestic demand while further driving out more expensive competitors. Unfortunately. our domestic producers cannot win without costeffective and environmentally sound transportation. Keystone XL offers that advantage and I support it. although I do not believe H.R. 3 is the perfect legislation. I believe that oil sands should be subject to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Almost every other source of crude oil that transits the United States is subject to the Trust Fund tax and oil sands should be as well. It makes fiscal sense. it makes environmental sense and it makes competitive sense. Oil sands should not be favored over any other sources in our country. The Keystone XL pipeline is the most scrutinized project in as long as I can remember. As we face the 114th Congress. we have real problems that require answers. Keystone XL pipeline is good for the United States. its good for North America and we should support this bill.",

It is the 10th time since Republicans took control of the House. American families face many pressing problems. and they want us to use this new Congress to work together to solve them. Unfortunately. we will begin this new year with a bill crafted solely to help the Canadian tar sands industry. The administration issued a statement in opposition to this legislation and indicated that the President will veto the bill. I heard my Republican colleagues talk about the action or inaction. whatever it was. by the Nebraska Supreme Court today. but I would stress that the White House press office still says in a statement that regardless of the Nebraska ruling today. the House bill still conflicts with longstanding executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests. and if presented to the President he will veto the bill. So the bill will still be vetoed by the President. which is another indication why we are wasting our time today. Mr. Speaker. oil prices are at their lowest level in more than 5 years. Gas prices are now below $2 a gallon. Domestic U.S. oil production is skyrocketing. Tar sands are among the dirtiest and most carbonintensive of all fossil fuels. Approving the Keystone XL pipeline will create a dependence on tar sands crude. reversing the carbon pollution reductions we have been working so hard to accomplish. According to some experts. building the Keystone XL pipeline will triple production of the tar sands. and that is totally inconsistent with any future scenario for avoiding catastrophic climate change. We dont need this oil. Approving and constructing this pipeline wont lower gas prices for Americans. In some areas. it may even raise prices. This pipeline is a terrible deal for the United States. We get all of the risk while the oil companies will reap all of the rewards. I was at the Rules Committee the other night and all I kept hearing was how wonderful Canada is. how we have to help Canadian companies. This is all about Canada. Frankly. I dont know why we are so worried about a Canadian corporation. It wasnt clear during the Rules Committee hearing. based on the conversations and debate we had with the Republican side. that this pipeline would even ever be built. And yet here we are rushing to basically say to the President: We dont care what you or the State Department or the Department of the Interior says what is in the national interest. we are just going to do this because of some Canadian interest. Mr. Speaker. this is a new year and a new Congress. We have new Members who will vote on this bill without the benefit of any hearings or markups or floor amendments. without the benefit of learning how our changing energy picture alters the need for this pipeline. and without considering whether our time might be better spent on efforts to promote other cleaner energy sources. We need sound energy policy in these challenging times. As the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I am anxious to begin working with all of my colleagues on pragmatic energy policy. but we need a balanced energy policy. one that takes into account current circumstances. one that takes into account our need to combat climate change. and one that works with the President rather than against the President to actually deliver legislation that the President can sign rather than veto.

In anticipation of the construction of this pipeline. the owners have spent $4 billion upgrading the facility and created about 2.400 jobs over a 4year period. Construction of the Keystone XL extension would deliver similar benefits to other regions of the country. creating over 42.000 jobs in construction. manufacturing. transportation. and services industries. It is for these reasons that a diverse coalition of businesses and labor unions in the construction and building trades industries have come out in support of H.R. 3. and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.",

We currently have a sprawling. 185.000mile network of oil pipelines in the United States and a regulatory process to ensure that they are operating safely. So why are we spending so much time trying to exempt a Canadian company from the environmental reviews that every other company in America has to abide by? And the big question. Mr. Speaker: Who will pay for any future oil spills? Not Keystone. This bill exempts Keystone from contributing the same 8 cents per barrel that every other oil company is required to pay into the oil spill trust fund. Tell me. Mr. Speaker. why is this? If the authors are so certain that this pipeline does not carry any environmental risk. wont they allow the review process to run its course? I stand with my colleagues. I want those jobs.

Lets be clear about what we are getting with Keystone: a dirty and dangerous pipeline running through the heart of our country which will help Canadian oil companies export their oil. and it happens to be the filthiest possible energy form. I would like to say that if we put the same time and energy into a transportation bill as we have to this Canadian pet project. we could upgrade our crumbling roads and bridges. expand our mass transit system. provide a huge boost to the American economy. and create jobs in almost every single congressional district in this country. thousands and thousands of permanent jobs in our good country. We dont need another pipeline dividing our country. polluting our water. pushing us closer and closer to the climate tipping point. A transportation overhaul will actually create jobs that Americans can live off of. Keystone will not. unless what they are considering with these jobs are just the 35 permanent jobs. And maybe they are considering that there will be jobs to create the leaks and the pollution and treat the pollution and illnesses that may be associated with the pollution. I urge a \"no\" vote. We should invest in American companies. We should invest in American pipelines. We should invest in American jobs that are here in America for Americans and are permanent.

    "speech": "I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to address a couple of things. First of all. I will place in the RECORD letters I received from the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council and Caterpillar. Hon. KEVIN CRAMER. Longworth Building. Washington. DC. DEAR REPRESENTATIVE CRAMER: The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SHE Council) and our nationwide membership of business owners and entrepreneurs strongly support H.R. 3. the \"Keystone XL Pipeline Act.\" Delays in approving this important project cannot be justified on any grounds. This is a critical energy supply and security issue. as well as being vital for U.S. economic growth. job creation and small business development. This project means quality job growth. new business formation. and an increase in oil supplies from reliable sources. The building and operation of Keystone XL would benefit small businesses via affordable energy and economic growth. Small businesses within the energy sector would see growth opportunities as a result of the pipelines construction and operation. An underreported fact is that the U.S. energy sector is dominated by small businesses. Consider the latest U.S. Census Bureau data: Among oil and gas extraction businesses. 91.1 percent of employer firms in 2011 had less than 20 workers. Among oil and gas pipeline and related structures construction businesses. 65.5 percent of employer firms in 2011 had less than 20 workers. And among oil and gas field machinery and equipment manufacturing businesses. 57.6 percent of employer firms in 2011 had less than 20 workers. Among support for oil and gas operations businesses. 83.3 percent of employer firms in 2011 had less than 20 workers. Among drilling oil and gas wells businesses. 79.8 percent of employer firms in 2011 had less than 20 workers. The energy business is all about small business. A new study released by SHE Council on November 13. 2014. found that small businesses are driving Americas energy renaissance. For example. from 2005 2012. construction businesses related to oil and gas pipeline and related structures grew by 12.2 percent among firms with less than 20 workers. oil and gas extraction businesses grew by 4.1 percent among firms with less than 20 workers. businesses drilling oil and gas wells grew by 7.9 percent among firms with less than 20 workers. businesses supporting oil and gas operations grew by 29.1 percent among firms with less than 20 workers. and manufacturing businesses related to oil and gas field machinery and equipment grew by 8.5 percent among firms with less than 20 workers. It is important to understand that during this same period. the total number of small and midsize employer firms declined. but the opposite was true in the energy sector. Construction of Keystone XL would mean increased small business growth. opportunities for entrepreneurs. and a stronger economy for America. A vote in favor of H.R. 3 is a vote for small business and quality job creation. Thank you for considering Americas small business sector on this critical issue. SHE Council and its members look forward to House passage of H.R. 3. Sincerely.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. In conclusion. I would like to point out a couple of things. First of all. this was a significant issue in the last election just a couple of months ago. This is a piece of legislation about the American people. not a Canadian oil company. In polls. 72 percent of the American people say they support this legislation. This is about jobs for people in America who need jobs. This is about increasing the energy infrastructure of our country. This is also a project that would not include one dime from the Federal Government. It is going to be at a cost of approximately $7 billion of private funds that will create a lot of jobs and make us less dependent on foreign oil. The application for the Keystone pipeline was filed in September of 2008. There are 2.6 million miles of pipelines in America. Most of those pipelines do not have to be approved by the President of the United States. but in this particular pipeline. since it crosses into the country from Canada to the U.S.. the President must approve it. The President has said that one reason he is not going to approve it is because of litigation in Nebraska. which ended today in favor of the Governor of Nebraska who supports this pipeline. The second ostensible reason for the President to oppose it is CO2 emissions. yet the Secretary of States office under Hillary Clinton and Mr. Kerry in their final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement have said on three occasions that it will have minimal impact on the environment. Today. we want to pass this legislation once again for the American people. The U.S. Senate said that they will pass it. and we would ask the President to join us and sign this legislation. I would urge the passage of H.R. 3. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

Mr. Speaker. the fact that oil produced from tar sands creates 17% more carbon emissions than other crudes. the potentially devastating impact wrought by this heavy crude should a pipeline rupture occur. or that my constituents are enjoying the best prices at the pump in several years without the completion of this pipeline due to the record glut in global oil supply. Without even getting into the disappointing number of permanent jobs created by this project. which is 50. Mr. Speaker. the President has already clearly stated that he will veto this measure should it ever make it to his desk. So at the end of the day Mr. Speaker. what are we really talking about here? It would seem to me that instead of trying to score political points and refighting old battles. the 114th Congress should be using its first week to bring legislation to the floor that fosters an environment of innovation. energy diversification and an investment in clean. domestic forms of renewable energy. Policies that would create hundreds of thousands of new. permanent jobs while also ensuring energy independence for years to come.

This is no way to legislate. The people of Michigan sent me to Congress to fight for our shared values. And no one knows better than the people of my state the importance of protecting our natural resources. This legislation puts those resources at risk by exempting the operators of the pipeline from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. which helps the federal government respond to oil spills. It also waives all the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. both of which contain critical environmental protections that cannot be ignored. I simply cannot support legislation which sets these landmark laws aside. Congress needs to have a real and thoughtful debate on how we promote clean energy in the United States.

Is this Groundhog Day? I am curious. This is the 10th time this bill has been before the House. and those who are in support would argue. \"Enough is enough. Lets pass it and get on with it.\" Those of us in opposition would say. \"Well. why havent you written a bill that is sufficient to the problems raised by the pipeline?\" Specifically. 10 times on this floorand even additional times in committeethe issue of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has been raised. We have raised that issue 10 times. It has been debated here on the floor. I have heard five. six people speak to that issue. The chairmen of the committee are well aware that this bill has a huge loophole in it allowing one company that owns a pipeline to avoid paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Why in the world would we move a bill that allows this company. unique among all others. to not participate in a very. very important part of the protection of communities and the environment? The Kalamazoo issue has been raised herethe spill. Over $60 million was paid for by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and then reimbursed by the pipeline company. Lets do something right. This is great fun: back and forth. back and forth. We kick this thing around. We may get some political points on one side or the other. But why in the world dont we write a decent piece of legislation? Why dont we do it right? Why would we exempt one company among all of the others of hundreds of pipeline companies and allow this one Canadian companyand I love Canada. my soninlaw is a Canadian. This is about doing what is right. This amendment would simply include this company being required to participate in the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. It is a lot of dollars. It is about $24 million a year. That is a pretty good tax break. Who among us would not like to have that tax break? I guess we are all going to stand up because we want to have it. The rest of the story is this: we have spent an enormous amount of time on this issue when. in fact. as has been said here many times by proponents and opponents. we ought to get on to real infrastructure.

Consider the time that we must spend figuring out how to pay for repairing our bridges. building our highways. our ports. our airports. Consider that time. Ten times. this bill has been here. Ten times. this House has ignored a tax break that is not warranted. It will allow to move forward to the Senate a bill that. in its very substance. provides an unwarranted. unnecessary. and grossly unequal tax break to one company among all the other pipeline companies. This amendment simply comes to the point of making sure that this pipeline company. like every other petroleum pipeline company in America. pays its fair share of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. which is essential. I see some of my friends from Michigan here. You know how important this is. The Kalamazoo River was a big deal-$60 million thus far and more to come. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was there to provide the early money for the cleanup. It is important. folks. My colleagues. this is important. Lets do it right. This is our 10th time.

And what I mean by \"what form.\" the committee bill. obviously. will be supported almost unanimously on both sidescertainly on this side of the aisle unanimouslyif. in fact. it is the funding levels that resulted from the agreement between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and passed overwhelmingly. known as the RyanMurray budget numbers. The committee marked up its bill. reported it out. It was included in the omnibus. But it was included. as the gentleman knows. only until February Can the gentleman tell me whether that will come to the floor as reported out of committee? And when I say \"committee.\" I mean the House Appropriations Committee. Or when reported out. will it be considered under a rule? And if considered under a rule. will that rule allow amendments? And I yield to my friend.",

Clearly this was in France. but we know that we are all vulnerable in all of the free world.

I know his side of the aisle is very concerned and believesand he has assertedthat the actions taken by the President were unconstitutional. We do not share that view. as the gentleman knows. that they were unconstitutional. We believe the executive was within his authority and prosecutorial discretion on the executive side of the government. But we also know that that issue is going to be an issue of substantial debate. discussion. and I am sure other legislative actions. Mr. Speaker. I would urge the majority leader toI think it is in the best interest making sure the Homeland Security bill is passed so there is no doubt as to the resources that the Homeland Security Department will have to protect all Americans. to protect our homeland. and to coordinate extensively. Secretary Johnson has made statements this week that the failure to have full funding for the Department of Homeland Security has already impeded his ability and the Departments ability to act fully on behalf of the security of this country. So. Mr. Majority Leader. I know that all 435 of us are committed to making sure that we do everything we can to keep our homeland safe and our people safe. And I would hope that we would have nothing included in the bill which would be very controversial. reflecting our differences. when the underlying bill. I think. is not controversial. when the underlying bill is something on which we can almost unanimously. I think. agree and is something that ought to be passed and ought to be signed by the President and ought to give the Department of Homeland Security the full resources it needs to keep America safe.

The despicable and tragic murder in Paris on Tuesday of journalists and those who protected them ought to be a reminder that we cannot and must not take for granted the freedoms we enjoy living in a democracy. The men and women who were targeted in Paris on Wednesday were cartoonists whose job was to use humor to make people question their leaders and their most cherished principles. Freedom of speech. protected in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. which was read today on this floor. means nothing if that speech can be intimidated and shuttered by violence. The principles that we speak of were part of a long tradition in France and in this country of bringing the loftiest of people and ideas down to Earth through the power of satire. Freedom of the press and free expression of ideas are a necessary check against tyranny and oppression. They are as much a part of democracy as the right to vote and due process in court. Mr. Speaker. in attacking these journalists. the terrorists made their target clear. and that is freedom itselffreedom in America. freedom in France. freedom throughout the world. freedom of conscience. freedom of speech. and freedom of dissent.

It is sponsored today by the National Sheriffs Association. the International Association of Chiefs of Police. the FOP. and other law enforcement organizationsnational. State. and local organizations. As Mr. JOLLY said. I served 33 years in the sheriffs office in Seattle. starting in a patrol car and eventually ending my career as the sheriff. I know from my own personal experience in serving those years that a cops mission is to protect their community. I know this from working with law enforcement not only in the sheriffs office in Seattle. but with the Seattle Police Department. all the police departments and sheriffs offices in the State of Washington and even across this country. I have had the opportunity to work with a number of law enforcement organizationslocal. State. and Federal. Mr. Speaker. they come each day with the heart of a servant. They come each day knowing that. when they put on that badge and that uniform. that they may not go home. They know that. but they do it anyway. Why do they do that? Why do they take that risk? Why did I take that risk for 33 years? Let me tell you. Mr. Speaker. I did come close several times in my career to losing my life to protect the community I served. Let me also say that I lost some dear friends over those 33 years. One was my best friend. Sam Hicks. who was shot and killed in June of 1982. Another good friend in 1984 was stabbed to death. It is a dangerous job. but it is a job they choose to do because they choose to serve the community. They choose to put their life on the line to protect and serve all of us. protect our families. our children. our businesses. and our property each and every day. But no one is perfect. we know that. There are good police officers and there are bad police officers. There are good mechanics and there are bad mechanics. There are good lawyers and there are bad lawyers. We all come from the human race. There is good and bad in all of us. So no police department is perfect. and no police officer is perfect. and sometimes things go wrong. They are required to make split decisions. lifeanddeath decisions. In a moments notice. you can have a gun pointed at you. and you have to make that decision: Do I shoot or not? Can I talk that person out of that gun? I have been in that position. too. Fortunately. I was able to talk that person out of his gun and took him to jail. But sometimes things go wrong. and when it does. police. rightly so. must be under the microscope. There must be public scrutiny. Cops know that. Police chiefs know that. Sheriffs know it. and we accept that. too. But when things go wrong and we watch these incidents and these events unfold over the media. let us all remember that police officers have constitutional rights. too. They are allowed due process. too. They are American citizens. too. They have constitutional rights and protections also. The Constitution. as was mentioned earlier. was read today. reminding us that we all have those constitutional rights. You are innocent until proven guilty. So when something happens that we think is wrong. lets pay attention to the facts. Lets let the process go forward. and then based on the factsbased on the factslets work with the community. with the police department and the mayor and city council and change the policy. change the procedures. and make sure that it doesnt happen again. But today. let us also remember the service of the men and women. the brave and dedicated men and women who put that uniform on every day. I am going to name a few police officers from Washington State who. 5 years agoand this is the 5year anniversary of the death of these police officers. gunned down. four of them gunned down while sitting in a coffee shop in Lakewood. Washingtonpaid that ultimate sacrifice. that ultimate price that we often hear talked about: Sergeant Mark Renninger. Officer Ronald Owens. Officer Tina Griswold. Officer Greg Richards. as well as Seattle Police Officer Timothy Brenton and Pierce County Deputy Kent Mundell. all from Washington State. all not with us today. all of their families missing them. During these difficult times. Mr. Speaker. we need to come together as a community. as a country. as a nation. and recognize the service of these police officers across the country. I will end with the simple act that comes so easily for us with people who serve in the military. just a simple \"thank you.\" If you see a police officer today as you go about your duties. your days duties. please walk up and say \"thank you.\" Please tell them you appreciate their service.

Jesus said there is no greater love than this. than someone who would lay down his life for his brother. And law enforcement officers do that every day.

I was proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 3. the Keystone XL Pipeline Act. I am grateful to be pushing this bill across the finish line because the Keystone runs through the Fourth Congressional District that I am privileged to represent. It is a long overdue. commonsense piece of legislation which will create goodpaying jobs. will grow our economy. and will support more manufacturing and trade in this country. During its construction. it is estimated that 42.000 jobs will be created by the Keystone. and it will put more than $2 billion in the pockets of American workers. To put this impact in perspective. those 42.000 jobs are 12.000 more than the unemployed population in the Fourth Congressional District of Texas. Unfortunately. President Obama has indicated that he will veto the Keystone if it passes both Houses. I hope that this is just an idle political threat because. if it is not. then the President is intentionally harming the middle class Americans that this great job creation bill is going to help. I hope and pray that our President wont play politics with legislation that will provide opportunities to create jobs for tens of thousands of Americans to support their families. This week. I was also proud to be able to support H.R. 30. which changes the definition of a fulltime employee from 30 hours a week to 40 hours a week under the perversely named Affordable Care Act. ObamaCares 30hour rule places an impossible burden on individuals and small businesses in my district and across this country. and I am glad to be able to help pass a bill which repeals a terrible provision from a terrible law. But I say we havent gone far enough. I know the people that I represent in east and north Texas wont be satisfied until we repeal every provision of the Affordable Care Act. I was sent here to Washington to deliver results for the hardworking people of north and east Texas. and these bills show that I am doing that. and it is what I intend to keep doing because. while these are great bills and I am proud that we passed them this week. it is just a start. We need more good bills to combat the Presidents executive overreach. to restore fiscal sanity. to secure our borders. to repeal all of ObamaCare. and. most importantly. to defend our great Constitution.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday the Senate passed a bipartisan terrorism risk insurance bill and sent it to the President for signature. We worked with our colleagues in the House and on the other side of the aisle to quickly process that bill in a timely manner. and I thank the Speaker and all Members of the Senate for granting unanimous consent to set up those votes yesterday. This morning we will continue to debate the motion to proceed to the Keystone bill. Chairman MURKOWSKI and several members of the energy committee will be here to talk about this bipartisan infrastructure bill. No votes are scheduled for today. but we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed on Monday night. It is my hope that Chairman MURKOWSKI and Senator CANTWELL can begin the amendment process under the regular order. Unfortunately. some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to block our effort to even get on the bill. and therefore the cloture vote on Monday is required. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am here this morning to once again talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline. the legislation we will be voting on next week. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed to the legislation. Then. hopefully. we will be debating that bill and offering amendments. which is exactly what we are supposed to be doing in this Chamber. On Thursday. yesterday. we had a hearing on the bill. In that hearing we brought the bill forward. It is a bill I have authored. JOE MANCHIN is the lead Democratic cosponsor. We have 60 cosponsors on the bill. So we have strong bipartisan support. It is the Keystone approval bill. Essentially. what it does is under the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. which authorizes Congress to oversee trade with foreign countries. we approve the Keystone XL Pipeline crossing the border from Canada into the United States. A lot of people do not realize the pipeline carries domestic oil from places such as North Dakota and Montanathe Bakken region of our countryto refineries. and it carries both Canadian and domestic crude. But part of the approval requires approval for crossing the border from Canada into the United States. Typically. that is done by a national interest determination by the President of the United States. But the President has been unwilling to do that now for more than 6 years. The company that is trying to build this pipeline. TransCanada. applied for approval to build this project pursuant to other pipelines it had already built. The original Keystone had already been built. This is the Keystone XL sister pipeline. But in September 2008 they applied for approval to build the Keystone XL Pipeline and to get a crossborder permit determination by the President that. in fact. this vital energy infrastructure is in the national interest. Well. more than 6 years have elapsed. obviously. since September 2008. The President has still not rendered a final decision. arguing that somehow the process has not been completed after more than 6 years. Of course. America was able to fight and win World War II in less than 6 years. But our President feels that somehow that process still has not been completed after more than 6 years on this project. So. of course. the purpose of the bill is. in essence. to say: All right. Mr. President. if you will not approve this project. Congress willunder the commerce clause of the Constitutionwhich we have the authority to do. Earlier we passed legislation. As a matter of fact. I had written a bill in 2011. which we passed in 2012. We attached it to the payroll tax holiday. a bill that got 73 votes. as I recall. which required the President to make a decision. At that time the decision he made was no. on the basis of the route in Nebraska. So what happened then in 2012 is that the good citizens of Nebraska went to work on a new route in Nebraska. The legislature. the Governor dealt with that new route. came up with a new route. and approved it overwhelmingly. It was then subsequently challenged by opponents of the project. Some of the extreme environmentalists have continued to oppose the project. and so that decision went to the supreme court. We learned today the supreme court has now decided in favor of TransCanada. The news came out this morning that yet another obstacle. after more than 6 years of obstacles. today has been taken care of. The problem is solved. The Nebraska State Legislature ruled in favor of the GovernorGovernor Dave Heineman. whom I know very well. the former Governor of Nebraskaand the legislature. and it said the way they sited this pipeline is. in fact. proper and upheld their decision. I will talk about that decision in a few minutes. But the other thing I wish to talk about in terms of the Keystone Pipeline is the discussion we had yesterday in the energy committee because it was an opportunity to begin the debate we are going to have on the floor next week. The proponents had an opportunity to state their positions and why. and the opponents had their opportunity to state their positions and why. So for several hours we began that debate. We then voted on the legislation and moved it out. without amendment. on a 13to9 vote. It was a bipartisan vote. 13 to 9. and we will have that bill for a vote on the floor Monday. I wish to address some of the arguments the opponents put forward in opposition to this project. I will start with the Nebraska court decision because that was one of the issues brought up at our energy hearing yesterday. Some of the opponents of the project said: Well. you know what. The process hasnt been concludedeven though it has been going on for more than 6 years. I will put a diagram up here that shows the route of the pipeline. As I mentioned. the original Keystone pipeline has already been built. That is the red. That has already been built. It was permitted. It took 2 years to permit and 2 years to build. I was actually Governor of North Dakota at that time. We can see it goes right through our State. It seems to me that application was submitted by TransCanada in 2006. It was during the Bush administration. obviously. It was approved within 2 years. and the project was constructed within 2 years. So from start to conclusion. 4 years to build this pipeline. which I think carries about 640.000 barrels of oil a day. It brings it down to Cushing so that oil can go into our oil refineries in the gulf. It also goes over here to Patoka. IL. so it can go to our refineries in the East. Based on that project. there are 640.000 barrels a day. TransCanada wanted to build a second pipeline. This one is 830.000 barrels a day. I think it is about a $7.9 billion project in all. Not only does this project carry crude from Canada. our closest friend and ally. but it also brings oil out of this Bakken region in North Dakota and Montana. We put oil on it as well. So both Canadian and domestic crude are going to our refineries. Again. it is just basic infrastructure that we need to move energy from where we produce it to where we refine it and consume it. We cant build an energy plan for this country without the necessary infrastructure. We have to have pipelines. roads. rail. and electric transmission lines to move electricity. We cannot build what we want. which is eithersome people refer to it as energy independence. I call it energy security. But. net. we produce more energy than we consume. When we produce more energy than we consume. we get jobs. we get economic growth. we get national security because we dont have to depend on places such as the Middle East or Venezuela or Russiaas does so much of Europe. Western Europe and Eastern Europe is dependent on Russia for their oil and gas. What a terrible situation for them. The people of this country dont want to depend on OPEC for their oil. So we produce it here. We are doing that. You know what else. We are working with our closest friend and ally Canada. and already that is happening. We are already moving toward a situationwe already produce more natural gas. but soon. if we keep it up. we will produce more oil. Working together with Canada. we will get a little bit from Mexico. and we will produce more oil and gas than we consume. Some call it energy independencenot really. because it is a global market for energy. But it is certainly energy security. We dont have to depend on anyone else for our energy because we have it right here. Not only does that create jobs directly. but energy is a foundational industry for all of the other industry sectors. Think about it. If you are in manufacturing. hightechjust name itor if you are in farming. agriculture. you depend on energy. If you have lower costs and abundant. available energy. you are more competitive in the global economy. arent you? So it is a foundational industry as well. and that is why we have to have this vital infrastructure as part of the energy building plan for our country. It is working. Dont take my word for it. Drive to the gas station. Go on over there. Fill up your car. Look at the bill when you are done. It is a lot lower than it was a few years ago. right? Check it out. Every consumer is benefiting at the pump. Small businesses are benefiting across the board. All the industry sectors benefit from lower oil and gas prices. Why did that happen? OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present. is that what it is? I dont think so. Russia decided: Oh. gee. to our friends in America. we better send them some oil to reduce the price at the pump. I dont think so. It is because we are producing so much more oil and gasnot only in the Bakken and in the Eagle Ford formation in Texas. which are shale. clays for oil. but also natural gas in the Marcellus. other areas of our countryin the eastern partand by working with our closest friend and ally. Canada. We are getting millions of barrels of oil from Canada. So the oil we produce at home and the oil we get from Canada we dont have to get from Venezuela. we dont have to get from OPEC. we dont have to get from Russia. and we dont have to get from countries in Africa. When we send those dollars over to other countries. how are they using those dollars? Look at what is going on in Paris today. How many of those petro dollars fund terrorist activities? Isnt it better. if we are not going to produce that energy at home. that we get it from Canada? And isnt it better that we produce that energy at home? How are we going to produce that energy at home if we dont have the infrastructure to move it from where it is produced to where it is consumed? Gee. then somebody will say: Well. yeah. that is just common sense. of course. right? I mean. that is just basic common sense. Why arent we doing it? Yet here we are in a process for more than 6 years still waiting to produce it because the extreme environmental interests have decided: Well. we just dont want to produce more oil. We dont want more oil produced in this country. and we dont want more oil produced in Canada. Of course. you say: Well. then what? We keep buying it from Russia or we keep buying it from OPEC? Oh. no. no. no. we will just keep developing all these alternatives. I am all for developing all kinds of energy. I would say go ahead. Lets do it. We worked hard in our State. We have not only oil and gaswe are now the second largest oilproducing State. second only to Texas. but we also produce natural gas. We have coal fired. we have solar. we have wind. we have biofuels. We have all of them. I am for all of them. What I dont understand is how developing our oil and gas resources. building the vital infrastructurehow does that prevent us from developing any other type of energy? How does it prevent that? It doesnt. It just makes sure that as we work on anything else. we dont have to continue to be dependent on OPEC or somebody else for our oil and gas. That is all we are doing. So lets not sit here and pick winners and losers and do that kind of thing. Lets create the best business climate we can. Lets develop the vital infrastructure we need to move energy around our country. and lets truly become energy secure. That is what this project represents. Make no mistake. At the end of the day. that is what this project is about. It has been held up for more than 6 years with hurdle after hurdle. Somebody says: Oh. well. gee. that is TransCanada. That is one company. Who cares about that? Think about it. If you are going to build a pipeline or move energy around this country. if you are going to try to develop oil and gaswhether it is for Canada or anyone elseand you see a company that wants to build a simple pipelinesomething that has been done. I think. 19 times beforeand they have to spend billions of dollars and take years and years and years. and they still dont have it. are you still going to rush out and do that? Are you going to rush out and build a lot more infrastructure? Probably not. So isnt this really about trying to shut her down? Isnt this the opponent saying: No. we are going to shut down developing the energy resources in this country. We are not going to work with Canada to do it. And then what do we end up doing? We say: Well. we will have all these other things. Maybe we will. maybe we wont or maybe we will go right back to what has been happeninghistory tends to repeats itselfand we will go back to remaining dependent on OPEC oil. back to remaining dependent on OPEC. It has to be music to these guys ears. I wish to take a couple of minutesI know the chairman of our energy committee will be coming to the floor and speaking on this issue as welland work to rebut some of the other arguments that have been brought up on this issue. and some of these were brought up yesterday at our energy committee. The first one. as I say. was: Well. look. the process isnt done because the decision in Nebraska hasnt been made. Well. in fact. the decision in Nebraska has been made several times. Now the Nebraska Supreme Court put out a ruling today saying that it is fine. All the work the legislature in Nebraska did. all the work the Governor in Nebraska didthe rerouting in Nebraska is upheld. That is done. That excuse is gone. As the House works to pass this bill today. and as we work to pass it next week. that argument is off the table. That has been taken care of. The biggest argument is the environmental argument. The opponents say: Oh. well. it will produce greenhouse gas emissions. They are opposed to oil development because it produces greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the environmental impact statementI should say the multiple environmental impact statements done by the State Departmentthis is what they say. Understand there have been five different reportsthree draft reports and two final reportsover a 6year timeframe. The State Department has done this not once. not twice. but three times in draft form and two times in final form. They have gone in. and they have analyzed the environmental impact of this project. When you read the report. do you know what it says? \"No significant environmental impact\" is what it says. That is the Obama administrations State Department environmental impact statement. after 6 years of studynot once. not twice. but five times between three draft statements and two final statements-\"No significant environmental impact.\" That is what it says. It just stands to reason because if we dont build the pipeline. they pointed out. then what happens? Well. if you dont have this pipeline. the environmental impact statement pointed out that it will take 1.400 railcars a day to move that oil. So instead of moving that oil from Canada. not even countingI mean. we have to move our oil too. If we dont have the pipeline to move that oil in the safest. most costeffective and efficient way. then it has to be moved by rail. If you dont have a pipeline. you have to move it by rail. Now you have 1.400 railcars a day creating congestion on the rail. That creates more greenhouse gas. that creates more congestion. more difficulty in moving our ag products and other products. We are already seeing that. We already have congestion on our rail that is backing up the shipment of other goods. We had a tremendous problem moving our ag goods this year. So are we going to have another 1.400 railcars on a railroad system that is already overloaded? It doesnt make much sense. You know what. It creates more greenhouse gas. So by not having the pipeline. you increase the greenhouse gas emissions. I suppose Canada could sayalthough it is unlikely because they are already moving it by rail. In my home State of North Dakota we are already moving 700.000 barrels a day by railcar because we cant get enough pipeline. and we are producing more oil. We are up to 1.2 million barrels a day. moving 700.000 barrels by railcars because we cant move it by pipeline. benefiting the rest of our countrylight. sweet Bakken crude. The other thing with Canada is they say: If we cant bring the pipeline down and work with our closest friend and ally. the United States. if they would rather work withI dont knowOPEC than Canadawe cant figure that one out. I am sure Prime Minister Harper is saying: Oh. boy. that is unbelievable. But OK. then I guess what we will have to do is we will build these pipelinesand they are already in the process of doing soto the west coast of Canada. We will load that oil on tankers. and we will send it all to China because China wants it. They are not only willing to buy the oil. but they are trying to buy the source of the oil. So then it gets on the pipeline. and then it goes on tankers over to China. Well. those tankers produce greenhouse gas emissions as they haul that oil to China. In China the refineries have much higher greenhouse gas emissions. They are much less efficient. They are much less environmentally sound than our refineries in this country. So what do we end up with? We end up with much higher greenhouse gas emissions because we didnt have the pipeline. Oh. and by the way. instead of us then refining it. tankers have to bring that petroleum to us from OPEC. from Russia. heavy crude from Venezuela. creating some more greenhouse gas. So the net effect is we have increased the environmental impacts by not allowing the pipeline. It increases it. It doesnt reduce it. it increases it. Furthermore. Canadas laws. in terms of environmental stewardship. are tougher than ours. but they are continuing to move to what is called in situ development in the oil sands. What is in situ development? In situ development is drilling and then the use of steam to bring up the oil rather than excavating. which is the traditional way they produce oil up here. So the greenhouse gas footprint is very similar to drilling in the United States. In fact. it has a lower footprint than the heavy crude that comes out of Californiaa very environmentally conscious State. Again. when we talk about the environmental impact. lets talk about the facts. Lets talk about reality. and those are the facts. That is what it is truly about. Safety is another thing they brought up. Something could happen with the pipeline. That is true. and we always have to work on safety. It is very important we always address safety in whatever we do. The best way to have a safe infrastructure system to move energy around this country is to have the right mix of pipelines and roads and railthe right mix along with transmission linesso we move all types of energy as safely and as effectively as possible. This graph reflects the pipeline system in our country. Oil and gas are moving through millions and millions of miles of pipelines in our country. This pipeline is going to be the newest. with the latest and the best technology. Oh. by the way. if we dont have the pipeline. as I mentioned just a minute ago. we are adding 1.400 railcars a day. Everyone can do their own calculation. but do we think we are safer and more likely to have less accidents with another pipelinewith the latest. greatest technologies and safeguardsor would we rather have 1.400 railcars a day going through our communities loaded with oil? Common sense again. and the statistics support it. There is more. They brought up more concerns. but I am nearing the end of my time. in terms of floor time right now. and I know our chairman is coming down. so I will have to wrap this up. I went a little longer on some of these issues they brought up. and they brought up others. but here is the good news. We are going to vote on a cloture motion to proceed to the bill on Monday. I am hopeful. with our 60 sponsors on this legislationwe will have 60. maybe 63 votes based on what people have indicated to me as to how they will vote right nowthat after the vote on Monday we will be on the bill. Unlike the past several years in the Senate. once we are on the bill. we will be open for business. and we are welcoming amendments. We are saying to Republicans and Democrats alike: Bring them on. Bring on your amendments. If you have a good idea. come on down. If you have a good idea. come on down and lets talk about your amendment. Lets debate your amendment. and you know what. You are going to get a vote. and if you get 60 votes in support of your amendment. then we will make it part of this legislation. We are hopeful that in allowing amendments. we can improve the legislation. we can make it more bipartisan. and we can get more supporters. so if in fact the President does decide to veto it. we will have 67 votes instead of 60 or 63 votes. That is how the process is supposed to work. We are supposed to be able to have that debate. offer those amendments. and produce the best product we can. That is what we are hoping to do with this legislation. We are also hoping that will not only generate more bipartisan support on this issue. on this legislation. but on other energy legislation and other legislation of all types so we can get the important work of the American people done in this body. That is what it is all about: finding a way to get things doneget the job done for the American people. With that. I yield the floor. and I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday morning those of us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee had an opportunity for good discussion about our Nations energy future. More specific to the agenda of yesterdays business meeting was a bill that would allow for a muchdelayed projectthe Keystone XL Pipelineto advance. It moved through the committee favorably. It moved through the committee with bipartisan support. As I noted to several colleagues yesterday. the discussion we had in the committee about the significance of this pipelinethe significance of its contribution to our Nations economy from a jobs perspective and from a resource perspective is considerable. Obviously there was debate on both sidesI think good. healthy debateand it is debate I hope we will see reflected on this floor in the next week and perhaps the week following as we have an opportunity to debate. But first we have to get onto that bill. We have that process in place. We will have a vote on the motion to proceed the first of next week. I am anxious. as the new chair of the energy committee. to move the debate here in the Senate on issues that are so important to us in this Nation. When we think about our Nations securitynational security and energy securityand when we think about our Nations economy and prosperity. so much of it comes back to energy. access to energy that is abundant. affordable. clean. diverse. and secure. These are principles I have laid out about my views of energy. I am hopeful that the discussion we will have on this floor will help advance us as a Senate. as a Congress. and really as a country in moving forward on those policies that will only make us stronger and more secure. I felt the debate yesterday in committee was kind of a precursor of some of the agenda items we will see on this floor that will be brought forward by way of amendments. I would encourage colleagues. as they think about next week and as they think about the debate we will have on energy. lets stick to energy. We havent had a good. robust debate on energy in a long while. We have a lot of other concerns. We have colleagues who want to bring up the Presidents initiatives as they relate to immigration or perhaps health care. We will have plenty of opportunity here in the Senate under Leader MCCONNELLS management to hear and debate issues that are of great substance and weight. But we have waited far too long for our energy issues to be fully debated on the floor. so I am welcoming that discussion. We heard a lot of good reasons within the committee and we have heard a lot of good reasons here on the floor why the Keystone XL Pipeline is significant. is important to this country. This morning I wish to take a few moments to discuss some of the arguments that have been made against it and perhaps provide some context. some rebuttal. because I think it is fair to acknowledge that the Keystone XL Pipeline evokes some strong feelings. but not all of what we have heard is perhaps as factual as we would like it to be. As we note often around here. people are entitled to their own opinions. but they are not entitled to their own facts. So I would like to address some of the responses. One of the issues we heard yesterday was that this bill is almost too much. Well. if those on the committee and on the floor would look directly to the language of the bill. it is pretty simple. The text of the full bill takes up fewer than two pages. It is roughly 400 words long. It doesnt take long to read or understand. It is pretty simple. It is a pretty simple measure. It approves this longdelayed crossborder permit that is needed to construct the Keystone XL Pipeline. That is all it does. It approves a permit. It doesnt give some grand sweetheart deal to a foreign company. It doesnt feather the nest of oil companies. It allows for a permit to cross the border between the United States and Canada to allow for a construction project. and it does this while protecting private property rights. It allows Nebraska to find the best possible route for the pipeline. and it requires all State and local obligations to be fully met. This bill does not deal with routing through the States. It was suggested that somehow or other we here in the Senate and the House are kind of like a zoning committee. That is not what is happening. It doesnt deal with the routing. As we know. that discussion took place at the State leveland appropriately so. So what this measure does is it just allows for that crossboundary permit. Some of the other points raised were that somehow or other this bill provides subsidiessubsidieswhether to TransCanada or to others. It does not authorize a single taxpayer dollar for any purpose. It doesnt create any new tax credits. It doesnt reduce current tax rates. The bill is simply about approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is that simple. I would encourage you to read it. Again. it is pretty brief. Another question raised yesterday in committee: Why the urgency? Why the push right now? We are just in the first week of the 114th Congress. Why are we pushing so quickly to advance this? Well. for new Members. such as the Presiding Officer. here today. this is the first opportunity you will have had to weigh in on the Senate floor on this very important legislation. but many of us who were here in the 113th Congress recall that it was just about 6 or 7 weeks ago that this same measurein fact. the same language of this bill is what we had on this floor just before we departed at the end of the 113th Congress. We fell one vote short of cloture. We had 59 supporters in the Senate. We obviously had very significant Democratic support. Coming up with 59 votes was substantive. I think folks would remember that. In effect. this is a little bit about unfinished business. We were working on it less than 2 months agoa month and a half ago. We are now back in the 114th Congress. So what has changed? Well. what has changed is that the Presiding Officer is now a Member of the Republican Party. and our leader. Senator MCCONNELL. is leading the Senate. We are now in a new Congress with new leadership. and the bill that has been introduced by my friend and colleague from North Dakota has 60 cosponsors60 cosponsorsnot people who have said: Yes. I think I am going to vote for this bill. These are 60 who have committed and signed their names. and we now have enough votes to pass it in this Chamber. So I think that is a good sign. I think it is not a bad sign that what we are starting with is a bill that is unfinished business but also a bill that has strong bipartisan support. with 60 cosponsors. It is not very often in this body that we have legislation that has that level of support. So why not start this new Congress off with something that enjoys bipartisan support? I dont think it was the intention of our leader to start off saying: By gosh. it is going to be Republican ideas only. We are trying to find those ideas and those issues that will advance our country. I believe that moving forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline is something that will advance the best interests of our country. So when we talk about timing. I think it is important to note that this is not only a good time. it is the best time to bring up Keystone XL. Our colleagues on the other side of the building are taking up the Keystone XL Pipeline today. We had. of course. good news coming out of Nebraska this morning with the announcement that that litigation has been resolved. if you will. with the courts effectively upholding the pipeline route. There have been some on the other side of the aisle who have suggested that we shouldnt cut off a process. that we shouldnt move until things have been resolved in Nebraska. And there are some who would say: Well. OK. that is something we do need to consider. It has been suggested that until that has been resolved. action on the Keystone XL Pipeline is somehow or other premature or untimely. I want to speak to the aspect of timeliness and whether we are moving too quickly. The Presidential approval process is actually another reason we are starting on this bill in this Congress. A final \"yes\" or \"no\" decision has now been delayed by more than 2.300 days. I think the exact number is 2.303. and we are counting. That is more than 6 yearsnot to build a pipeline. we are not talking about it taking 6 years to build the pipeline. we are talking about 6 years to approve a permit to cross from the Canadian side to the U.S. side. The energy committee is on its fourth chairman since the initial crossborder application was filed. We have seen a lot of process. We have seen a lot of talk here in this body. Literally everything that has happened during the Obama administrationthe legislation that has moved. regulations. all of the extracurricular stuff that goes on outsidethat has all happened while the Keystone XL permit has been pending. One has to look at this and say: 2.300 days and counting. over 6 yearsit is pretty clear to me that the President really doesnt want to make this decision. and so if the Congress can step in and make it happen. the Congress should step in and make it happen. I mentioned the decision coming out of Nebraska this morning and the fact that it allowsthe pipeline route was effectively upheld. So that aspect of the process that individuals have been waiting for I think we can fairly say has been resolved. In the Statement of Administration Policyeffectively the veto threat the President has issued on Keystone XL that I would note he issued the day we gavelled into the 114th Congress. before we started any of our business. In his veto message. the President said the legislation would cut short consideration of important issues relevant to the national interests. Again. I would just ask anyone. really? Some 2.303 days and we think we are somehow or other cutting short a process? In his veto SAP. he states further that \"the bill would also authorize the project despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in Nebraska.\" Well. it looks as though that part of it has been resolved. so that cant be used as the excuse. It is not just in that Statement of Administration Policy. Back in April the Press Secretary for the President. Mr. Carney. stated. \"Absent a definite route from Nebraska. the decision. as I understand. by State is that that cant continue until the situation in Nebraska is resolved.\" OK. We are letting you know now that the situation in Nebraska has been resolved. Further. there was a statement that came out of the State Department on April 18 in which they note that a core reason for the delay is \"the potential impact of the Nebraska Supreme Court case which could ultimately affect the pipeline route.\" All right. The State Department also has word now that we are no longer waiting for that. So when one talks about timeliness. when one talks about why it is imperative that we allow this permit to proceed. it is because it has been 6 years. It is because the decks have been cleared. It is an infrastructure that will benefit our Nation as well as our friends to the northern border. I would like to talk about the issue of job creation. We have talked a lot about the jobs that are created with a potential Keystone XL project. We heard in the committee discussion yesterday that. hey. this is not as advertised. There are only going to be about 55 permanent jobs and only 4.000 construction jobs that will be created. We have been saying it is closer to 42.000 jobs. There is a lot of water in between 4.000 and 42.000. Who is correct? I think it is important to note that the numbers we are talking about are drawn from the State Departments final supplemental EIS. It is one of those situations where if you are opposed to it you are going to grab some low numbers. and if you are supportive of it you might grab the high numbers. But I think you need to read the whole thing in context. my friends. The final supplemental EIS goes on to say: Construction contracts. materials. and support purchased in the United States would total approximately $3.1 billion. with another $233 million spent on construction camps. During construction. this spending would support a combined total of approximately 42.100 average annual jobs and approximately $2 billion in earnings throughout the United States. It goes on further to say: Approximately 16.100 would be direct jobs at firms that are awarded contracts for goods and services. including construction directly by Keystone. The other approximately 26.000 jobs would result from indirect and induced spending. this would consist of goods and services purchased by the construction contractors and spending by employees working for either the construction contractor or for any supplier of goods and services required in the construction process. So. again. these arent LISA MURKOWSKIs numbers that are drawn from the air or Senator HOEVEN. the sponsor of this bill. conjuring up these numbers. These are the numbers that come from the State Departments final supplemental EIS. This is what they are saying42.100 average annual jobs. $2 billion in earnings. 16.000 direct jobs. 26.000 jobs from indirect and induced spending. The State Department estimates construction workers on a seasonal basis4 to 8 months per period. On an annual basis that is 1.950 jobs per year for 2 years. and that is where they get the 4.000 construction jobs. But think about it. The nature of the construction business is not that these are jobs in perpetuity. That means you build things. and once they are built you move on to build something else. Of course they are not permanent jobs because we are not in a permanent state of construction. The key here is to approve projects in a timely manner so that these good. skilled. qualified workers can go from one job to the next and have permanent. stable employmentnot necessarily on the same project for their entire lifetime but to be able. as a welder. as a skilled technician. to move from one project to another. I would support this project even if it were just 4.000 temporary jobs. but it is not. What we are talking about is supporting over 42.000 workers over a 2year period. That is significant. It is significant given the unemployment levels we are atwe are at 5.6 percent now. Isnt this what we are wanting to do. to bring on new jobs? In my State right now we are trying to figure out how we can move Alaskas natural gas to market. not only to benefit our State with revenues but to benefit jobs. We dont have a deal yet that allows us to build that pipeline. although our Governor today and our previous Governor and Governors before them have been working diligently to make that happen. and one of these days we are going to see it. But in the meantime. do you think Alaskans are saying: Well. we are not so sure we want this because these are only going to be temporary construction jobs. Absolutely not. We are building training facilities. We are getting our workforce kind of teed up for that day so that when it comes. we are ready because we want those construction jobs. We recognize it will be a construction project. and by its very definition it is not permanent. Dont you think that bolsters my States economy? Dont you think we are hoping every day that we are going to get moving on this project? Absolutely. Is it going to benefit my State? Yes. Is it going to benefit this country? Yes. Lets get moving on it. and lets get moving on Keystone XL. I get a little frustrated when we talk about the jobs. and we have those who say we should dismiss the fact that if we cant get to a certain number of jobs. the project is not worthwhile. What we are doing is approving a nonsubsidized. nonfederally funded project. This is not costing us anything. This will be a benefit to us. It is not an entire industry. nor is it a multipleyear funding authorization for transportation projects around the country. I think those kinds of comparisons are inaccurate and to a certain extent unfair. I suggest to those who criticize Keystone XLs jobcreating potential to be careful. We dont want to put ourselves in a position where we are going to wind up opposing nearly all individual projects for any purpose all across the country just because they dont create enough jobs. Take the Department of Energys Loan Guarantee Program. It has funded some good programs. in my view. over the years. We have seen some renewable energy projects in recent years that I think have been beneficial to our region. By our count. more than one dozen of these projects would create less than 50 permanent jobs. We are not creating hundreds or even thousands of jobs. It will create less than 50 permanent jobs. One solar project created 7 permanent jobs. a wind project created 10. a geothermal project created 14. and we had a transmission line that created 15 permanent jobs. I think the question that has to be asked is: Should we have opposed these projects based on the number of permanent jobs that are associated with them? Is there a minimum number of jobs we are going to use as a benchmark for approval or denial or should we just be glad and encouraged when any new job is created because it means Americans have found steady work? This is what I thought we were working toward. Keep in mind Keystone XL is one project. It is one project. It is one pipeline. There is one connector between Canada and the United States that connects up to a pipeline that has already been built in the South and will feed into our existing system. This is not brandnew frontier. We are allowing for a connector between Canada and the systems we have in the United States. Keystone XL is one project. It is one small part of the employment that energy production and infrastructure development can provide for our Nation. We already have 19 crossborder oil pipelines. This is coming down from Canada in the North and coming up from Mexico in the South. We are already building up our LNG export capability and so much more. Again. keep in mind this is not the first time there has been a request for a crossborder pipeline. We have 19 that are already in place. What makes this one so special? I will have more to say on that issue in the future. I know our leaders are expected to come down to the floor shortly. I look forward to a good. honest debate about our energy resources. our energy opportunities. and our energy challenges. I think the American public is ready for this discussion. I dont know what happens around the dinner table in the hometowns of Georgia. but I can tell you in Alaska we talk a lot about energy. and we dont talk about it because we are an energyproducing State. We talk about it because it costs us a lot of money to keep warm in a cold place. It costs us a lot of money because we are not part of anybody elses energy infrastructure. We dont have transmission lines that connect us from one place to the other. We have what we have. and we are thankful to have it. We are ready to share it with others around the country and around the globe. but we in Alaska talk a lot about the affordability of our energy resources. We talk a lot about how we can access our abundant resources. We talk a lot about how to use our ingenuity and technology to advance us so we can have cleaner energy sources and move to a world of renewable energy. and that is so exciting for us. We have a lot of fossil fuel in Alaskaand we have a lot of everything elseand we are excited to be developing our geothermal. our marine hydrokinetic. our biomass. our wind potential. and our solar potential. It is a little dark there now. but our solar potential in the summer is second to none. We are excited as to what we might be able to do in understanding how we can tap into ocean energy resources. It is exciting. We need to do more as a nation when it comes to efficiency and conservation. We should be leading in that way. and that is why I am pleased we will have an opportunity to again revisit the merits of the legislation my friends Senator PORTMAN and Senator SHAHEEN have been working on so long as it relates to energy efficiency and taking that up as an opportunity for amendment. We have such good issues to talk aboutissues that the American public is talking about because it impacts them. and it impacts their family budget. It impacts their opportunities for jobs. and it impacts our Nations security. I have not talked today about the security aspects of it. but it doesnt take a foreign policy analyst to understand that gaining the benefit from an energy resource from our friends in Canada is better than asking for that same resource from the OPEC nations or Venezuela or from any nation that might not like us. That is a debate that again is so core to what we are talking about with Keystone XL. We have a healthy relationship with Canada. It is important because when someone drives to my State. which is a heck of a long drive. they have to go through more of Canada than anyplace else. I want to have a good relationship with Canada. but I can tell you our friends on the Canadian border are wondering what is happening in the United States. It has been 2.303 days. and we cant make a decision on whether we should benefit from a jobs perspective. an economic perspective. and a national security perspective. I look forward to the discussion next week. and I look forward to a robust and full debate on good energy amendments that will be coming before this body. With that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I come to the floor this morning to talk about the Keystone XL Pipeline. I see my colleague from Alaska is here this morning. and I think she and I were thinking we would be continuing this debate next Monday as the Senate moves forward on the motion to proceed to rule XIV of the bill that relates to this issue. Obviously we had committee action yesterday. but we are both here this morning. I wish to say to my colleague before she leaves the floor that I do look forward to the opportunity where she and I can sit down and talk about an energy strategy and other issues that will help move our country forward so we can produce jobs. I had a chance to work with Senator MURKOWSKIS father and other Republicans on the energy committee. We produced some very good energy legislation in both 2005 and 2007 that did result in moving our country forward. It was bipartisan legislation and definitely not unanimous. I mean. there was a great deal of debate about them. but we got them done nonetheless. I am looking forward to working with the Senator from Alaska on these issues. It is probably safe to say the Senator from Alaska and I had plans this morning other than coming to the Senate floor. nonetheless. I am more than happy to talk about the recent decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court and how Congress will continue to discuss the issue of Keystone XL approval. Many of my colleagues probably know that the House will take up this action sometime today. The President has consistently said he is interested in having the process play out in Nebraska before he makes a decision about whether this pipeline is in the national interest. The President of the United States and the State Department have the authority and responsibility to look at this issue as it relates to what is in the national interest of the United States of America. This decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court today is a very interesting decision. It is a very interesting decision because a majority of the Nebraska Supreme Court. four out of the seven justices on the court. said this law was unconstitutionalthis attempt to circumvent the public interest process by which the citizens of Nebraska can raise concerns about a pipeline going through their community. The majority of the supreme court said. yes. that decision to short circuit the public process in Nebraska was unconstitutional. Unfortunately for those citizens in Nebraska and those citizens in the United States of America who want to make sure the environmental security issues and economic issues are fully discussed. they are getting shut down by a supermajority of the Nebraska Supreme Court. They failed to get five out of the seven supreme court justices to side with them. Nonetheless. I think there is a lot in this decision for all of us to think about. that is. just how much this process has been circumvented. To me it is very unusual that the Senate would be asked to vote on a bill that would expedite the siting of a pipeline through the United States of America simply because a Canadian company wants us to do so. It is perplexing to me because I hear a lot of people talk about our neighbors. and I definitely value the relationship that the United States and Canada have. We are in the process of a major discussion with them on issues that impact the Pacific Northwest. and we have to work with our neighbors. I am struck that my state has a great relationship with British Columbia. which is Washingtons neighbor to the north. Sixtyeight percent of British Columbian residents oppose a tar sands pipeline across their province. That is right. a Canadian province definitely does not want a tar sands pipeline going through their neighborhood. We have First Nations all across Canada who dont want tar sands development and pipelines across Canada. In addition. there are a lot of concerns about environmental practices for tar sands production that are in place in Alberta. People should know that the oil and gas producing province of Alberta. not the federal government of Canada. regulates tar sands development. Alberta does not require what we in the U.S. would consider \"best practices\" for development of some of the dirtiest oil production in the world. In the U.S.. we actually have federal laws that make oil production cleaner than in Alberta. There is a lot of concern about these not only tar sands production. but also about byproducts. such as pet coke. As my colleague from Michigan stated in our business meeting yesterday. uncovered pet coke mounds. which could just blow around in the wind. caused serious environmental concerns in Michigan and Illinois. In addition. I am sure my colleague from California has been down here talking about benzene. which is a byproduct that is left behind and can adversely affect individuals. To say that just because this Nebraska court decision became final today. that all those environmental issues and public safety issues have gone away. is surely a misstatement. Congress is being pressured to make a sweetheart deal for a business interest. I believe tar sands producers should pay into the oil spill liability trust fund. just as companies that produce other oil products have to do. This is a very important issue for me because oilspills are a situation that we in the Pacific Northwest have cared about for a long period of time. In fact. the Commandant of the Coast Guard appeared before the Senate commerce committee last year. and I had a chance to ask the commandant whether the Coast Guard had a way to respond to a tar sands oilspill. and he basically told me that. no. they didnt. So. to me. there are a lot of environmental issues. a lot of process issues. and issues of paying a fair share for helping to clean up oilspillsand these issues all add up to serious concerns with legislatively approving a construction project. My colleagues on the other side want to turn Congress into a siting commission. to give a special interest the certainty to move forward on a project that needs to go through the proper process and channels. In the State of Nebraska. the public said we have concerns about a tar sands pipeline running through our state. straight through the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Aquifer. which provides drinking water to six states. Instead of dealing with those environmental issues. the company and its advocates came to the Congress and tried to get that route approved. This is why the President had to reject the proposal in 2012because TransCanada did not want to do right be the citizens of Nebraska or the environment. The long and short of it is. if TransCanada had been successful in getting the original route approved. that pipeline would go across the Ogallala Aquifer. There is now a broad consensus that this would have been the wrong route. endangering the water supply in Americas agricultural heartland. So. thank God. Congress. which tried to act and give a sweetheart deal to TransCanada. was thwarted by the President. The President said. I cannot approve this project now. And guess what happened. The company said. yes. that is right. we have to figure out a better route for the pipeline. And TransCanada had to start the process all over with a new application for a better route through Nebraska. In my State. a utility and transportation commissionin the State of Nebraska I think it is called a public service commissionoversees the siting process for these kinds of infrastructure projects. That commission has a public process and answers all of the questions the public raises. debates the issues that are before the public and makes sure those issues are taken into accountI know many of my colleagues probably can relate to this more from the perspective of siting transmission lines or a grid system. I am sure people have seen a neighborhood complaining about a transmission line going through their neighborhood. This is a pipeline. and for us pipelines are very important in the Pacific Northwest. We had a natural gas pipeline that blew up. killing some young children in the Bellingham area. So. for me. pipeline siting. and the process that goes into assuring the safety and security of the siting. should be decided in the broad daylight of public discussion through the proper channels. In this case. people circumvented that public commission process in Nebraska. circumvented what would have been a utilities and transportation commission process. and let the Governor decide the route. Then the decision was sent to the Nebraska Supreme Court to determine whether in fact the Governor had the authority to do that. Four of those seven justices said it was unconstitutionalnot the supermajority for sure. but four of them said it was unconstitutional. But nothing in that decision corrected the original problem of them circumventing the environmental and economic and security issues that a public commission is supposed to go through in this process. I ask my colleagues. why are we in such a big hurry to make this decision on behalf of a utility commission and on behalf of the President of the United States when there are real issues of safety and security that need to be discussed? Next week my colleagues are going to have a lot of discussion on a lot of different amendments. but I still advocate that Congress has no business deciding for a special interest where a pipeline should go without the due process of citizens who are affected by pipeline having input to the decision. I hope my colleagues will continue to let the process play out. I hope my colleagues will care more about public process and public interest than special interest. There is a great article. which I will submit for the RECORD. in Business Week citing welding issues with the current Keystone Pipeline. That existing pipeline has had safety problems. We in the Pacific Northwest celebrate that we are a gateway to Asia. and we celebrate the fact that a lot of people will want to use that gateway. But we are very concerned about due process for infrastructure projects. We see other countries wanting to move energy and other products through our gateway when safety. security. environmental. and public issues are not being fully addressed. I hope my colleagues will continue to make sure due process is given and that we will continue to make sure all of these public interest and environmental issues are addressed. I thank the Presiding Officer. and I yield the floor. I see the leader on the floor. so I will not suggest the absence of a quorum.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the life and accomplishments of a truly remarkable man and to mourn the passing of a dear friend. Rock Scully. Rock passed away just before Christmas following a long battle with cancer. The world knew Rock as the man who managed the Grateful Dead from their inception in San Francisco through their rise to prominence to become music legends. I knew Rock as the new kid in the 6th grade who became my lifelong friend. Rock taught the Dead about business. He taught me how to ski. We grew up together. spent time together exploring the wonders of CarmelbytheSea. and later traveling together to serve in interfaith peace camps in Germany and Austria in 1958. Some of my fondest memories were created with Rock. As a Member of this House. I rise to honor Rocks contribution to American culture. But as SAM FARR. I rise today to shed tears for the loss of a friend who I had known for 61 years. Rock was born in Seattle in 1941. I first met him when he moved to Carmel in 1952. We became friends in grammar school and went to Carmel High School together before he moved to Switzerland to finish his senior year. Rock attended Earlham College in Indiana before moving back to California for graduate school in San Francisco. Rock began his public career in the early 1960s. while studying at San Francisco State College. He helped organize civil rights demonstrations to fight discrimination in San Francisco including the now famous sitins at the Sheraton Palace Hotel and at automobile dealerships on Van Ness Avenue in 1964. The sitins were successful in improving hiring practices and creating agreements of nondiscrimination. They also caused Rock and others to spend 30 days in the San Bruno county jail for disturbing the peace. At the same time. Rock found his calling in San Franciscos fledgling rock music scene. He became the manager of The Charlatans. one of the originators of what became known as the San Francisco Sound in the 1960s. He also helped support the fledgling rock scene as part of a collective known as the Family Dog. Just before I left to join the Peace Corps. Rock called to tell me he was going to quit graduate school to manage a new band full time. \"Youre crazy!\" I said. Rock told me they were amazing and definitely going places. \"Besides.\" he said. \"they have the coolest name: the Grateful Dead.\" Rock may have been crazy but he was right. The Dead was a local Bay Area act when he started managing them in 1965. The band became an American icon in the two decades he was with them. Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead put it beautifully in a message he posted upon learning of Rocks death. \"Rock helped explain the Dead to the world.\" Rock chronicled his twenty years with the band in his book \"Living with the Dead.\" He became a voice for the narrative history of musicians and artists that changed the cultural landscape of California. In many ways he was part of the broad and varied movement that helped shape Californias openness to innovation. creativity. and diversity. That movement can be traced at the University of California. Santa Cruz. whose library houses the complete archives of the Grateful Dead. Rock played such a huge part in so many lives. but especially to his family and friends. I want to extend my condolences to his daughter. Sage Scully and stepdaughter. Acacia Scully. half sisters. Norah Scully and Kate Scully. step sisters. Julie Mayer Vognar and Amanda Mayer Stinchecum. and his brother. Dicken Scully. who travelled with us in Europe in 1958. Mr. Speaker. I know I speak for the whole House in celebrating Rock Scullys amazing spirit and in offering our best wishes to his family and friends. To quote the band that Rock managed for two decades. \"A box of rain will ease the pain and love will you see you through.\"",

In light of recent events. it is important to express our gratitude and offer a simple \"thank you\" to the countless law enforcement officers who serve with valor and distinction. I had the honor of doing just this last weekend in West Chester. and again will have the honor of doing so this weekend in Berks County. Let us all be solemnly reminded that the Thin Blue Line is willing to risk their own safety so that our loved ones. our homes and our businesses are protected. So ahead of this upcoming weekend. I want to personally thank the efforts of retired Reading Police Lieutenant Michael Kurtz. Tricia Wertza widow of fallen Reading Police Officer Scott Wertzand many. many others as the Berks County community will unite to show respect and in the spirit of building stronger. safer communities where all lives matter.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. everyday men and women of the police force put on their uniform and head out into the unknown. They encounter callous criminals and outlaws who have no regard for the law or their fellow man. But yet every day. these police officers still get up and put on the uniform. They bravely face what could very well be some of the most dangerous situations and potentially their last moments on this Earth as they work to protect us: our families. our friends. our children. Because thats what they do. they work to restore and maintain peace in our communities and neighborhoods. When New York Police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu woke up on the morning of December 20th to put on their uniform. they had no idea it would be their last day. The two patrol officers were sitting in their squad car. working overtime. when a hateful and spiteful criminal struck. The ruthless murderer shot and killed the two officers in cold blood. Officer Ramos and Officer Lius lives were robbed from them. Officer Liu was married only two months before. and now his wife is left as a widow. Officer Ramos was a devoted husband and father. active in his church with plans to join the ministry. These two men of solid character. were targeted and attacked. So much hate has been hurled at police officers. Recently. two more New York Police Officers were shot while investigating a robbery call in the Bronx when they were shot and wounded by criminals. The disrespect of our law enforcement must stop. The soulless thugs who hunt down police officers and kill them have to be punished to the highest degree. Underneath these uniforms are moms. dads. sisters. brothers. cousins and friends. Protecting us is their job. It is their duty to bring safety to our communities. to separate anarchy from order. and to bring justice to crime victims. No police officer should have to be any more fearful than they already are for their life while on patrol. As Americans. we must let them know that we support them and are grateful for all they do for our communities. A nationwide campaign called Project Blue Light was launched to show support for the special men and women in our police force. A single blue light in a window or front porch shows support for our peace officers. Neighborhoods. communities and towns should beam the glow of blue in support of these community warriors. Take the time to thank a police officer. To many. the unknown is terrifying. but to police officers. its just another day. Today. on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. we lift up all those who put their lives on the line every single day for us. They deserve the utmost respect and support not just today but every day of the year. During my other life. I was a prosecutor and criminal court judge in Houston. Texas. I have known and still know individuals who wear the badge or the star over their heart. Some of those peace officers I knew gave their lives for the safety of others. Peace officers put their lives between us and criminals. They stand between the law and the lawless. I have had the opportunity to know peace officers from all over the U.S.including New York and especially New York city. Years ago. I taught at the New York State Police Academy. After those folks from New York and I got through the language barrier. I found them to be some of New Yorks finest of peoplesome of the best peace officers in the country. Peace officers are necessary in our society because some in our country refuse to follow the law. Ironically. we hire these men and women to do societys dirty work then society criticizes them for their actions. Peace officers are the last strand of wire in the fence between the fox and the chickens. They have earned and deserve our respect. America should mourn the ambush and assassination of all those in law enforcement who have given their lives for order in Americaespecially the men in blue of New York. And thats just the way it is.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in opposition to H.R. 30. the socalled \"Save American Workers Act of 2015.\" Republicans claim this bill is a fix to the Affordable Care Act and vital to protecting American jobs. But thats simply not true. According the nonpartisan CBO. raising the threshold for employers to provide coverage from 30 hours per week to 40 could lead them to shift more employees to parttime work. end employersponsored coverage for one million people. and leave up to half a million completely uninsured. Even conservative analyst Tuval Levin agreed. writing recently in the National Review. \"Putting the cutoff for the employer mandate at 40 hours would put far. far more people at risk of having their hours cut than leaving it at 30 hours.\" On top of the assaults on workers hours and benefits. CBO estimates the bill would increase the federal deficit by $53 billion over the next decade.\" Republicans have brought this irresponsible bill to the floor on the heels of more news that the Affordable Care is working. Yesterday. Gallup released data showing the percentage of uninsured Americans is declining steeply and HHS announced that nearly 6.6 million Americans selected plans or were reenrolled in the federal exchange since open enrollment began. As I have said before. I am more than willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make genuine. reasonable improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Along these lines. I want to commend Congressman JOE COURTNEY for bringing an alternative proposal to the Rules Committee yesterday. Unfortunately. todays bill does not meet the definition of a genuine. reasonable improvement. Finally Mr. Speaker. if Republicans were really serious about helping employees they would support the CEO/Employee Paycheck Fairness Act. The bill is simple. It says if corporations want to be able to deduct the bonuses and compensation for their CEOs and other executives over $1 million. they better be giving their employees a fair shake. I urge my colleagues to reject the 40hour bill and join me in a real effort to support American workers.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on January 7. 2015 I inadvertently voted yes on Roll Call number 9. on H.R. 37the socalled \"Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act\". I intended to vote no on this bill and I wish to make my position clear for the record. I oppose this bill because it undermines the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform Act. This important law was passed in response to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and it was designed to ensure that Wall Street will never again be able to destroy our economy. The crisis was made worse by the widespread trading of complex financial derivatives. many of which were not understood by those engaged in their trade. and many of which were not used by \"end users\" engaged in traditional hedging of risk. DoddFrank protects our economic security by requiring overthecounter derivatives to be regulated by both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This bill would undermine those protections by forbidding regulators from imposing requirements that margin or collateral be provided for derivatives transactions involving commercial companies. The legislation is also harmful in that it entirely eliminates statutory authority for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate margin and collateral at nonbank derivatives dealers serving commercial end users. Even though regulators have not proposed to require any margin of commercial end users at this time. it is inappropriate to completely eliminate the ability of central derivatives market regulators to take action in this important area. This is a clear attempt by Republicans to delay and weaken implementation of core parts of the DoddFrank Act at the expense of main street. and our future economic security. Unfortunately. this misguided bill was brought to the floor with complete disregard for proper legislative process. Legislation such as this should be considered by committees and members should have the opportunity to offer amendments. This did not occur in this instance and instead was brought directly to the floor on a suspension of the normal House rules that apply. Although I inadvertently voted \"yes\" on this bill. I am encouraged that H.R. 37 did not pass the house and I stand in solidarity with my colleagues who voted no.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize and commend Paula C. Sampson on the occasion of her retirement after a long and distinguished career in public service to the residents of Fairfax County. Virginia. For the past 15 years. Paula has been the director of the Department of Housing and Community Development. She has spent her career focused on putting home ownership within reach of more people and finding more affordable options for those not yet able to purchase their own home. After graduating from the University of Michigan with degrees in political science and history. Paula landed a job as a local urban planner. She then relocated to the National Capital Region and accepted a position with the National Association of Counties in its Legislative Affairs Office. Fairfax County recruited her to become the Housing Departments Director of Real Estate Finance in 1986. In 1994. Paula left Fairfax to become CEO of the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund. a statewide. nonprofit organization focused on affordable housing. Thankfully Paula realized her true home was here in Fairfax. returning in 1999. I served on the Board of Supervisors at the time and knew she would be a real champion for housing. which is no small feat. On the administrative side. youre managing public dollars. gauging the local housing market. and building community partnerships with banks and nonprofits. But there is also a human side. in which youre working to assist residents across the spectrum. from those seeking help buying a first home to those wanting assistance managing their money so they can one day afford a home to those who are homeless and simply need a warm place to rest their heads. Paula truly gets it and proved adept and skillful in juggling those different aspects of her duties. In describing herself. she says. \"While the complexities of real estate finance. the challenges of dealmaking and the excitement of the ribboncutting are all fun. the real motivator for me is helping an individual have a place to call home. My own modest beginning showed me that growing up in a stable home is the stepping stone to future success.\" I had the pleasure of working closely with Paula during my tenure as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors on a successful affordable housing preservation initiative. We had identified the growing shortage of affordable housing as a primary challenge for the County. Job growth was significantly outpacing construction of new housing units. and those that had once been affordable were quickly being converted or redeveloped into condominium units to capitalize on the hot real estate market at the time. We convened a summit of business. faith. nonprofit. and community leaders. and from that exercise we appointed a task force. which recommended the Board of Supervisors establish a goal of preserving 1.000 affordable housing units over a four year period. which at the time we viewed as a stretch goal. As Chairman. I was pleased to champion that goal and set that course for our community. but it was Paula who seized the mission and kept the Departments staff focused on advancing this cause at every turn and through every hurdle. Thanks to her efforts. and those of our many partners. we not only surpassed our goal. we nearly tripled it with 2.700 homes preserved. We were so successful that at one point. the Board dedicated the value of one penny on the local real estate tax to the preservation effort. Based on the success of that initiative. we launched a campaign to prevent and end homelessness in 10 years. again hosting a summit and appointing a task force to build community support. It is because of that effort that Fairfax was able to break the mold and actually reduce its homeless population during the Great Recession while other communities struggled. Through it all. Fairfax has been blessed to have the strong support of the faith. nonprofit. and business communities. including Catholics for Housing. Homestretch. Cornerstones. Pathway Homes. United Community Ministries. Sekas Homes. Deloitte. the Fairfax County Chamber. and so many other community partners. We also worked together in advancing the concept of Magnet Housing in the E41 County to provide workforce housing for nurses. police officers. firefighters and other young professionals serving the community. More recently. I was pleased to collaborate with Paula in support of the Countys application to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for acceptance as a Move to Work agency. That designation provides invaluable flexibility with federal dollars to allow Fairfax to better leverage its housing and human service funds with assistance from community partners to provide homeless residents with housing and job training so they can \"move to work\" and selfsufficiency. In addition to her regular duties. Paula also has served on multiple regional. state. and national boards. including the National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies. the National Community Development Association. and the Freddie Mac Affordable Housing Advisory Committee. Without question. she has helped make our community stronger. and helped provide other communities with the tools to model our success in Fairfax. Thanks to Paulas leadership Fairfax is moving ever close to goal of providing safe. affordable housing for all those who wish to call our community home. Mr. Speaker. Paula Sampsons commitment to public service has set an example that will benefit our community for generations to come. Her accomplishments are truly outstanding and deserving of our sincere appreciation. When I was Chairman of the County Board. we often joked when retirement announcements like this came before the Board that we should pass a resolution to not allow such talented and dedicated staff to leave public service. and I certainly wish that was the case here. I wish Paula the best of luck in her retirement. and I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in expressing our appreciation for her long and fruitful service to the residents of Fairfax County.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my growing concern about the economic issues of fracking. The once booming oil fracking market could be headed for a bust. If a bust in the oil fracking sector does happen. it could create massive losses on Wall Street and for investors on Main Street in two ways. First. fracking oil drillers issued massive amounts of debt to construct the necessary wells. With the price of gas falling. many oil fracking drillers now face cash shortfalls. As a result. it is becoming more and more difficult for frackers to meet their debt servicing obligations. If the debt servicing obligations are not met. investors on Main Street and Wall Street could be left holding billions of dollars of worthless bonds. Second. many companies took out derivatives contracts against market fluctuation. insuring stable cash flow. Losses are mounting on these contracts as oil prices fall. Wall Street banks that own many of these contracts will have to absorb massive losses. The unexpected shock of falling oil prices may destabilize the balance sheet of these big banks. creating the conditions for another financial crisis.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the saga with North Korea and its band of tyrants has gone on far too long. On November 24th. Sony Pictures Entertainment was attacked. No its headquarters were not bombed. nor did anyone storm the buildings. This was a cyber attack. It is believed to be the worst of its type on a company on U.S. soil. Hackers released E43 personal data of Sony employees. disabled Sonys IT systems. and destroyed data. Shortly after. anonymous emails threatened moviegoers hoping to see the Sony film. \"The Interview\". These threats warned about \"9/11style\" terrorist attacks. A little over a month later. on December 29. the FBI said North Korea was responsible for the cyber attack. Contrary to what the President has called \"cyber vandalism\". this cyber terrorism deserves a bold. immediate response. The worlds dictators and terrorists must know without a doubt that an attackcyber or physicalon the U.S. will result in a devastating response. This starts with the little dictator of Pyongyang. Kim JongUn. It needs to immediately put North Korea back on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Representative RosLEHTINEN has a bill that puts tough sanctions on North Korea and urges the Administration to put North Korea back on the list. I am an original cosponsor of the bill. There is no doubt that North Korea belongs on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. In July 2009. UAE officials discovered a North Korean ship full of weapons heading to Iran. Iran has been on the state sponsor of terrorism list since 1984 because it provides hundreds of millions of dollars and tons of weapons to terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. So when one hears about North Korea sending weapons to Iran. it is not a typical transfer of weapons. This is about giving a recognized state sponsor of terrorism more guns to put in the hands of known and designated terrorist groups. Five months after the UAE seizure. Thai authorities found 35 tons of North Korean weapons on a plane. also traveling to Iran and ultimately bound for delivery to foreign terrorist organizations Hezbollah and Hamas. In April 2010. South Korean officials apprehended two North Korean militarytrained agents who had orders to assassinate a defector from North Korea. On March 26. 2010. North Korea sunk a South Korean naval vessel. killing 46 sailors. On November 23. 2010 North Korea repeatedly bombed a small South Korean island. killing two civilians and two marines. So far. as punishment for the cyber attack on Sony. the President sanctioned ten individuals and three organizations tied to North Koreas intelligence. arms supply. and defense research. These sanctions are not enough. Other people or organizations not sanctioned by the U.S. can easily take over the same work. Reinstating North Korea on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list would deepen existing sanctions and could deliver a crippling blow to the little dictator of Pyonyang. This Administration cannot allow the United States to be bullied again and again. The West allowed Putin into Ukraine. We have watched ISIS behead our journalists. We have seen Americans die in Israel at the hands of Hamas. Now. we have let North Korea silence us. To have a country on the other side of the world not just threaten but actually take away one of Americas most fundamental rights is outrageous. It is time to stop appeasing our enemies. And thats just the way it is.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as he retires from the Foreign Service next week. I rise today to recognize the outstanding work of the U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan Mozena. He led a distinguished career of public service to the United States. capped by his impressive efforts over the past several years to promote workers safety and advance fundamental labor rights in Bangladesh. Following a string of tragedies in the Bangladesh garment industry. including the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory that took the lives of 1.138 workers in 2013 and the factory fire at Tazreen Fashions that took the lives of 112 workers in 2012. Ambassador Mozena has advocated for workers safety and their right to freedom of association. He has urged Bangladesh to transform its garment sector from a model based on a racetothebottom in labor standards. to one where a \"Made in Bangladesh\" becomes a label valued for the countrys commitment to workers rights and high standards for safety. Following the U.S. Governments decision to suspend trade preferences and issue an Action Plan focused on labor rights and factory safety. Ambassador Mozena convened the embassies of other garment importing countries (Netherlands. Canada. the United Kingdom. and the European Union) with the responsible Bangladesh Government Secretariats on a monthly basis to track progress. This model for joint advocacy is one that merits recognition and replication as our Embassies work to elevate labor rights in developing economies. Ambassador Mozena worked with the U.S. Department of Labor to bring the first Labor Attach6 to Bangladesh. and he leaves an institutional framework to help advance labor rights in this young and developing country. Under Mozenas leadership the U.S. Embassy became a place where workers could turn to for help when they faced coercion. repression. and antiunion violence. Of course. there is a tremendous amount of work that still needs to be accomplished in Bangladesh to ensure that workers are safe and that their fundamental rights are respected in the workplace. Ambassador Mozena has fought to ensure that momentum is going in the right direction in Bangladeshwe must continue this work moving forward. Ambassador Mozenas accomplishments extend beyond labor rights. Since presenting his Letters of Credence to the President of Bangladesh on November 24. 2011. Ambassador Mozena has strengthened relations between the United States and Bangladesh by promoting a Bangladesh that is peaceful. secure. prosperous. healthy. and democratic. He emphasized understanding the diversity of Bangladesh. making visits to each of the countrys 64 districts. In the United States. he has visited BangladeshiAmericans across the country. During his time as Ambassador. Mozena oversaw the largest aid budget in Asia outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan. bolstering Bangladeshi food security and nutrition. improving health. and increasing capacity to E44 cope with climate change. natural disasters. and security challenges. Beyond Ambassador Mozenas current posting in Dhaka. he had an impressive career advancing U.S. interests in South Asia and Africa. He previously served in Bangladesh as Political/Economic Counselor from 19982001 and as a Deputy Political Counselor in India and Pakistan. A member of Senior Foreign Service. Mozena was U.S. Ambassador to Angola from 20072010 and previously worked in the Office of Southern African Affairs from 1993 to 1995. during South Africas transition from apartheid to democracy. Previous postings include Lusaka and Kinshasa and a year as a professor at the National War College. Ambassador Mozenas family has stood by his side as he has pursued his career overseas. His wife of 40 years. Grace. is a retired elementary school teacher who served with him as a Peace Corps volunteer in thenZaire. Their two children. Anne and Mark. followed their father throughout the world. I understand that Mozena also looks forward to spending time with the newest addition to his family. a granddaughter named Mira. as well as his mother Edna. As Ambassador Mozena returns to his family in the United States. we recognize his work in Bangladesh and throughout his career as a Foreign Service Officer.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this week 226 years ago. the first presidential election in United States history was held across the 13 original colonies. Nowadays things change in the blink of an eye. so one can imagine how much our country has changed in 226 years. Texas was still a part of the Spanish Empire in 1789 and the United States had just recently gained its independence from the British Empire. Back then. voting eligible citizens would walk or ride their horses down cobblestone roads to the nearest poll. Oddly enough. the first voters voted by voice. rather than the secret ballot that were all used to now. Voters wouldnt even vote for who they wanted as President. but would actually vote for their states electors. The chosen electors would then cast their vote for President. Though we still have electors. citizens now vote for who they believe should be President rather than their states electors. Electors are instead chosen by state governments and then each one is expected to vote with the will of the people of their state. The Electoral College voting system has been one of the lone constants in an everchanging political and voting landscape. It was used in the first Presidential election and has been used in every election since. While the Electoral College has remained in place since 1789. voting rights have changed significantly over the years. For the first Presidential election. an eligible voter was defined as any white. landowning male. However. our country has progressed a great deal since then and now defines an eligible voter as any citizen over the age of 18. regardless of race. gender. or societal status. We should be proud to live in a country whose government recognizes everyone as equal and allows each individual to vote. regardless of race or gender. From 13 colonies to 50 states and from voting by voice to voting on touchscreen computers. our elections have come a long way since 1789. and I expect the next 226 years to be just as great.

He served honorably in the United States Air Force during World War II and in the California State legislature for over 20 years. Born in Phoenix. Arizona. Mr. Chacon was raised in a home of modest means with three older sisters and three younger brothers. As a teenager. he would shine shoes and park cars in downtown Phoenix to help support his family. His father. Petronilo Chacon. served as a commander in Mexico to Pancho Villas revolutionary Army and taught Mr. Chacon to fight for what he believed in with passion and determination. while defending the rights of those who could not do the same. In 1943. at the age of 18 and in the midst of World War II. Mr. Chacon enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He served honorably for two years of wartime service as a Ball Turret Gunner on a B17 Flying Fortress. During his service. he flew 35 successful missions over Germany. On one such mission. his plane was shot down and forced to crash land on a small island off the Italian coast where he and the rest of the crew were later rescued. After the war. Mr. Chacon returned home as a hero and enrolled in San Diego City College and later San Diego State University where he received a bachelors degree in education and a masters degree in school administration. He began a career as a teacher. where he discovered injustices facing Spanish speaking children in schools. In 1968. with the help of two friends. Mr. Chacon founded the Chicano Federation in an effort to unite the Latino voice in the San Diego community. One of the first accomplishments of the Chicano Federation was the creation of the historic Chicano Park in the Barrio Logan community. Chicano Park has come to be an important symbol of the Chicano Movement. In 1969. Mr. Chacon decided to run for the California State Assembly in an effort the change the education system from within. Mr. Chacon was elected in 1970 to represent Californias 79th assembly district. where he served for 22 years. He is best known for authoring legislation to create the California Housing Finance Agency. the Rural Housing Development Program. and the landmark Bilingual/Bicultural Education Program for the more than 230.000 limited English speaking students in the state. Mr. Chacon was an inspirational leader in the San Diego community and his contributions will not be forgotten. He is survived by his four sons. Chris. Paul. Ralph and Jeff.",

ROBERT C. \"BOBBY\" SCOTT. the former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime. Terrorism. Homeland Security. and Investigations. in celebrating the life and recognizing the accomplishments of Karen Wilkinson. who sadly passed away on Karen was a dedicated public servant. highly valued counsel to the Committee. and beloved colleague. We were fortunate to get to know Karen through her work for the Committee in 2008 and 2009. During that time. Karen. an Assistant Federal Public Defender. was a detailee from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Her detail was the first of a Federal Public Defender to Congress. After her work with the Committee. she returned to Phoenix.

H.R. 1149. the Child Protection Reauthorization Act of 2009 and H.R. 1422. the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Reauthorization Act of 2009. Karen also developed proposals subsequently introduced as the Literacy Education and Rehabilitation Act. a bill to require a criminal defense representative to be appointed to the E45 United States Sentencing Commission. the Firearm Recidivist Sentencing Act. and legislation to correct the computation of good time credit in the federal prison system. Her work in developing H.R. 3327. the RamosCompean Justice Act of 2009. has led to subsequent bipartisan. bicameral introduction of that bill. now known as the Justice Safety Valve Act. This bill has become one of the critical proposals under consideration as a growing consensus in the country is recognizing the need to reform our sentencing laws in order to achieve greater fairness. save unnecessary costs in the criminal justice system. and reduce recidivism. These bills to reform the criminal justice system. developed through her efforts. are a lasting legacy of her dedication to achieving fairness and justice for all. Karens dedication to these issues during her time working for the Committee was representative of the professionalism and commitment she showed as an Assistant Federal Public Defender in representing her clients and vindicating their rights to equal and fair treatment under the law. Today. we remember and appreciate Karen Wilkinsons dedication to public service. her commitment to fairness. her wise counsel. and the friendships she developed with us and her Judiciary Committee colleagues. We will honor her by pledging to advance the causes that were her lifes calling.",

I rise to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the Fairfax County Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and to congratulate the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation on the longawaited dedication of the Tinner Hill Historic Site. On January 8. 1915. at the home of Joseph Tinner in Falls Church. nine community leaders formed the Colored Citizens Protective League (CCPL) in order to fight an ordinance in the then Town of Falls Church that would have legalized forced segregation in the town. This pioneering group evolved to become the Fairfax County Branch of the NAACP. which has played an instrumental role in the struggle for civil rights in Fairfax County and the nation for the past 100 years and will continue to do so in its next century. The Tinner Hill Foundation is a 501c(3) nonprofit founded by Edwin B. Henderson II. a descendant of E.B. Henderson. the CCPLs first Secretary. to preserve this important piece of our communitys history. The Foundation helps prepare tomorrows leaders by ensuring they understand our communitys past through cultural enrichment. arts. career and entrepreneurial education. mentoring. and counseling opportunities and by sponsoring clubs. groups. and organizations. The Foundation also has been engaged in the creation of The Tinner Hill Historic Site. The African American Heritage Walking Tour. The \"Dear Editor\" Contest. and The Tinner Hill Blues Festival. I am proud to have partnered with the Foundation since I was the Providence District Supervisor on the Fairfax County Board. It was at a Foundation event like this where we first discussed the idea of preserving this property. and the very next day I worked with my colleagues on the Fairfax Board to direct the County Executive to collaborate with the City of Falls Church to purchase this site. which is so significant to the cultural history of our community. And earlier this year. I was pleased to help capture moving and inspirational stories from some of the Foundations members as part of the Northern Virginia Civil Rights Archive. which my office assembled in collaboration with the Library of Congress and local library branches. Mr. Speaker. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation on this momentous occasion and commending its members for their steadfast efforts to preserve and promote the legacy of the brave African Americans who established the Fairfax County Branch of the NAACP and for their commitment to advance educational opportunities for students in the community. I also congratulate the Fairfax County Branch of the NAACP on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today. I rise to remember one of eastern Connecticuts most generous. caring. and devoted citizens. Stanley Israelite. Stanley passed away this past December at age 89 and leaves behind an enduring powerful legacy in his native Norwich and throughout Connecticut. I ask the U.S. House to join me in expressing condolences to his wife. Linda Hershman. and his four children. Michael Israelite. Abby Dolliver. Mindy Wilkie. and Jon Israelite. After his passing. a memorial service was held at Beth Jacob Synagogue. which was the scene of an overflow crowd of people from all walks of life. His longtime boss. former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd. Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman. State legislators. mayors and former mayors. small business owners. labor union leaders. and his neighbors and friends from the city he loved. Norwich. Connecticut. were all in attendance. Senator Dodd delivered a stirring eulogy filled with humor and passion. describing Stanleys amazing life of service. As Senator Dodd related. Stanley dedicated his life to helping others. After starting his career in his familyowned jewelry store. he uncovered his true passion. assisting members of his community with any problem. anytime. after intervening with a family in crisis. He left the business. and after holding a variety of human service and business advocacy positions in Norwichand earning citizen of the year and citizen of the decade awards in the 1960swent on to work for Chris Dodd. Stanley ran his constituent service programs. beginning in 1974 with Dodds election as Second District Congressman. the seat that I now have the honor to hold. and later as State director to Senator Dodd after Chris election to the Senate in 1980. Stanley remained a fixture in Connecticut politics. known for his consummate dedication to helping constituents get the help they needed. He spent decades ensuring that Connecticut citizens received help from the VA. Medicare. and Social Security. solved thorny immigration problems. helped small business owners get their feet under them. and then doggedly pushed forward projects to improve local communities. Today. one of the projects he spearheaded. an industrial park in Norwich that never would have been realized without Stanleys efforts. now bears his name. the Stanley Israelite Norwich Business Park. renamed in his honor in 2005. In 1995. Stanley was recognized as U.S. News and World Reports 12 Indispensable Americans. For all the awards and honors that his community rightly bestowed on him throughout his career. Stanley. himself. valued the thank you notes that he received from grateful constituents above everything. In 1995. he explained to a reporter from The New London Day that the highest honor in the Dodd office was to post a constituent thank you letter on the office refrigerator. \"That is our glory.\" he said. \"If you are on the refrigerator. then you have done a good job.\" Stanleys personal mantrawhich he instilled in his colleagues. friends. and familywas always. \"Dont forget the people.\" After a lifetime of service to his community. the people he helped and everyone who had the privilege to know him will certainly never forget him.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. just last month. we made a promise to the American people. We promised our constituents that we would fight the Obama administrations decision to give executive amnesty to many of those in this country illegally. I am pleased to announce that this week the House will fulfill that promise and act to defund the illegal executive action. All last year. we strongly urged the President not to act alone. and the American people spoke clearly in last Novembers election. but the President forged ahead anyway. Now. in order to preserve our Nations longstanding system of checks and balances to preserve the very order of our Constitution. the House will act to rein in President Obamas plans for executive amnesty. We will vote on legislation. which I was proud to cosponsor. written by my Alabama colleague. Congressman ROBERT ADERHOLT. which would prevent the President from carrying out his plans for executive amnesty. Let me be clear: this is tough legislation which completely eliminates all funds for implementation of the Presidents illegal actions. The bill has the support of many leading voices in the immigration debate including my home State Senator. JEFF SESSIONS. Just as important. the legislation makes clear that no Federal benefits can be granted to any alien as a result of the policies defunded and also eliminates funds to consider new. renewal. or previouslydenied applications for executive amnesty. The legislation doesnt just defund the Presidents executive action. The legislation paves the way for stronger border security by increasing funds for border agents. detention beds. and enforcement activities. In order to halt illegal immigration in this country. we must stop encouraging illegal immigration by offering amnesty and instead put more attention on actually securing our borders. I wish this legislation wasnt necessary. I wish President Obama had listened to the American people and enforced our current laws instead of continuing his mywayorthehighway style of governing. instead. he moved ahead with action that clearly violates our Constitution and has poisoned the well for serious conversation on immigration reform. Madam Speaker. I must ask a simple question that has very serious consequences: When will it stop? When will President Obama stop issuing shortsighted executive action and instead work together with this Congress to find longterm solutions to the real issues plaguing our country? I fear that the answer to that question is not promising. given that while we were on this floor taking our oath of office. the White House was busy issuing veto threats. I understand that the legislative process may not be convenient for the President. but the process exists for a reason. The Congress makes the laws. and the President should enforce them. This President just doesnt get that. This week. the House will act to rein in the President once again. We will attempt to right the scales of power and restore our constitutional system of checks and balances. We cannot and we will not sit back idly and allow the President to act alone. We promised the American people we would respond. and this week. we will hold true to our word.",

We have. of course. already had many a celebration in San Antonio. but it is good to see this celebration now reaching 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Congratulations to the San Antonio Spurs on this fifth amazing championship ring. Serving here in Congress as a representative for much of San Antonio. including the very place in the Alamo City where the Spurs have scored so many of these victories. I know that nothing defines the Spurs or San Antonio like the teamwork. the determination. and the positive attitude they displayed on this trail to the 2014 championship victory. These values are shown through the Spurs \"Silver and Black Give Back\". a community and outreach program which has benefited over 250.000 children and coaches in the past couple of decades. all this in a city that is overflowing with Spurs enthusiasm and Spurs fans. I would have to say that all of San Antonio knows that the Spurs are certainly no Mavericks at basketball. they are wellseasoned. team players. They were able to rain down Thunder on all of their 2014 opponents with a regular season record of 62 wins out of 82 games. And that is not all that set the Spurs apart. they are true Trailblazers. hiring the first female assistant coach in the NBA. Becky Hammon. Overall. when it came down to that fifth ring. the Spurs. a team that lives in our Texas temperatures. were able to beat the Heat with a cool 41 series blowout. Like San Antonio itself. the Spurs have attracted the best and brightest from all over the world. There never has been. and there never will be. a team quite like the San Antonio Spurs in a city that is like no other. Congratulations to a dynasty. Like so many of my constituents.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. around 11 a.m. on January 7. on a cold winter day in Paris. France. two men armed with AK47s forced a woman entering the offices of a French newspaper to let them in. After murdering the security guard in the lobby. they ran up to the second floor and shouted. \"Where is Charb? Where is Charb?\" Charb is the nickname for the newspapers editor. Mr. Charbonnier. Over the next 5 minutes. the two men would seek out and execute Mr. Charbonnier and 10 other people in the newspaper. They left the building. shouting the Islamic phrase. \"Allah Akbar\" or \"God is the greatest.\" They then murdered a policeman. ran back to their car. shouting. \"We have revenged the Prophet Muhammad.\" You see. Madam Speaker. these killers murdered because the paper exercised the human right of free speech and a free press. The assassin brothers were on the run for 2 days. but on January 9. the police cornered them at a standoff near the Paris airport. The police rescued a hostage. and the brothers were killed. going out just like they wanted to. in a massive firefight as martyrs. On the same day. another gunman. but an accomplice of the two brothers. took hostages at a kosher grocery store on the east side of Paris. Police stormed the grocery store and killed the terrorist. but not before he had murdered Jewish hostages. You see. Madam Speaker. these three killed because people disagreed with them. They killed the Jews because they were Jews. They killed the people at the newspaper because they had the audacity to print things that these folksthese terroristsdid not approve of. The French authorities did a superb job hunting down and killing these terrorists. The two brothers responsible for the initial attack have a history of terrorist activities. One brother said he even dreamed of killing Jews in France. Hours before one of them met his Maker. they called a French TV station. saying. \"We are telling you that we are defenders of the Prophetpeace and blessings be upon himand that I was sent by al Qaeda in Yemen and that I went there. and it is the imam alAwlaki that financed me.\" Yes. Madam Speaker. we have heard this before. young people traveling overseas where they meet radical Islamic jihadists who preach hate and murder in the name of religion. They are indoctrinated and infected with the cancer of radical Islam and sent back to their home country to inflict terror and kill men. women. and children. They kill in the name of their radical religious beliefs. We are even seeing this in the United States. Groups like ISIS are encouraging Americans to join their reign of terror. Americans who travel overseas to fight with ISIS are not coming back home to America to open coffee shops. They are coming back to do mischief and kill us. That is why I have introduced and reintroduced the FTO Passport Revocation Act that would authorize the revocation or denial of passports to individuals affiliated with foreign terrorist organizations. The Benedict Arnold traitors who turn against America and join the ranks of foreign radical terrorist organizations should lose their rights. This bill will help law enforcement locate these individuals by preventing them from traveling internationally so they can be captured and brought to justice. Most importantly. this legislation will prevent traitor Americans from entering the United States undetected. Madam Speaker. the French people held a solidarity rally in honor of the murdered. It was also a statement of freedom. Some estimated over 2 million attended the rally in Paris. Marching arm in arm with French President Hollande were 40 world leaders. including German Chancellor Merkel. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. and Palestinian President Abbas. Unfortunately. the United States President. the Vice President. and the Secretary of State did not choose to show up and support this solidarity meeting. That is unfortunate. The French are a close ally and our oldest ally. We have a portrait of the great Frenchman Lafayette in this very Chamber across the way from George Washington. Freedom is under attack by these terrorists. They are a threat to civilization. order. and liberty. The United States should be more outspoken in our support for the French people and our opposition to terror. We should support our allies like the French and mourn when they mourn and be resolved to track terrorists down anywhere in the world where they are. They are at war with us. Madam Speaker. The French Prime Minister said it best: We are fighting a war. not a war against religion. not a war of civilizations. but to defend our values. which are universal. It is a war against terrorism and radical Islam. against everything that aims to shatter solidarity. liberty. and brotherhood. And that is just the way it is.",

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. today I once again will speak about Californias highspeed rail system. Now. just this last week. they had a symbolic groundbreaking for this system in the context of getting started. California has been. since 2008. anticipating the start of highspeed rail. What do we have instead? Empty promises. a lot of waste. and a lot of money going down the tubes. What we see is that when the plan was first put in place. the voters of California approved a $33 billion link from Los Angeles to San Francisco. What they are now being given is something that has tripled in price. What they have now been given at this groundbreaking. which is symbolic. what you saw was a mound of dirt with about an 8foot section of ties and rails on that. That is very symbolic for those doing the groundbreaking. but also for those of us that will be paying for it. What this highspeed rail system will turn into is several links of rail between north and south California that arent linked up. that have no way to power them. and no trains will be running on them for several years. So instead of the $33 billion plan that they saw on the ballot in 2008which. by the way. it was on the 2006 ballot and. before that. on the 2004 ballot. but those involved knew that they would have. politically. a hard time selling that to people in Californiait has ballooned to a $100billion plan until they revise it again downwards by taking away part of the highspeed system in San Francisco and L.A.. where they will instead be using local transit to link to the center section that runs through central California. That is not even legal under Prop IA. What Prop 1A spells out is that it has to be a highspeed system that will make it from San Francisco to L.A. or reverse in 21/2 hours at speeds of 220 miles per hour. This promise will not be upheld. Now. why is this important to a national audience. to Members of Congress. and to people in other States? It is because. after the stimulus package was passed in 20092010. some of that Federal money is going to go for the highspeed rail system in California. Indeed. several other States were recipients of those initial grants. After they looked at their own ideas for highspeed rail and saw the costs involved and the infeasibility. they turned that money back into that pot of money. California. of course. stepped forward and said: Hey. give us all of that money. So they have received. at this point. about $3.5 billion that they can spend. dollar for dollar. for the bond money they spend themselves. the State money. So what that means for Americans is that we know Californians will be back at the Federal well once again trying to get more money for their highspeed plan. What we see is that their downsized plan will still cost $68 billion. They only have identified $13 billion for the whole system. No private sector moneywhich is what we were told when the ballot measure passedhas stepped forward to be part of this. The plan is $55 billion short. The Federal Government. so far. has offered about 31/. Did they think they would get the other 52 from the Federal Government since no private sector money wants to come forward for this? Will they get it out of the California taxpayers? Nobody knows. Indeed. the Governor. at the groundbreaking the other day. said: Dont worry about the money. we will get it. Well. part of their measure has been to impose a capandtrade program on the people of California which so far has generated about $250 million per year. At that rate. it will be how many centuries before they can catch up and get enough money just to pay for highspeed rail which capandtrade wasnt even intended for anyway? Folks. we have a giant problem here. Highspeed rail in California should not be the Federal taxpayers burden. It shouldnt even be the people of Californias burden. They barely passed it by 5248 percent on that 2008 ballot after two previous ballot delays. Delay. delay. delay is what you see with this system. So what really needs to happen is the people of California need to step forward. put this back on the ballot. and have a vote once again on this. And the Federal Government doesnt need to be giving signals that they are going to send even more money for this boondoggle which has been failed. flawed. and deceptive since day one. Madam Speaker. it is a massively flawed project that leaves taxpayers at all levels on the hook for many. many years to come for something that may not even run in our lifetime. So we. as Federal legislators. need to put a stop to any ideaas my colleagues have been doingfor more money to go forward for highspeed rail. And we need the people of California to wake up to that idea and demand that it be placed back on the ballot. this money go instead for other projects that could be helpful for their transportation corridors. for their highway system. and for the normal mode of rail which can be made to be enhanced to drive 125 miles per hour. which would be beneficial. Madam Speaker. we need to get on the ball and get back to reality on what highspeed rail will really cost Californians and the American taxpayer and urge that it be placed back on the ballot and give the people that choice once again.",

Last week. in a bipartisan vote. the House passed a bill to approve the Keystone pipeline. I hope the President will support the priorities of the American people rather than cater to a generous campaign donor. In conclusion. God bless our troops. and the President. by his actions. must never forget September the llth in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to Americas first ally. France. over the terrorist attacks last week. Our solidarity with France is clear with the portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette gratefully placed in the House Chamber as one of only two portraits in this room.",

We need more of this tradition in Washington. and I hope to bring Nebraska common sense to this body. We need to find more ways to come together and solve our Nations problems.

This bill was introduced by my good friend and a very important member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Congressman TIM WALZ from Minnesota. I am honored to join him and Congresswoman TAMMY DUCKWORTH from Illinois as an original cosponsor of this legislation. I am also grateful for the support of several of our military veterans service organizations. including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. the Veterans of Foreign Wars. the American Legion. the Disabled American Veterans. the Military Officers Association of America. and the Wounded Warrior Project. H.R. 203 is named after a true American hero. Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine Corps veteran who served honorably in both Afghanistan and Iraq. where he was wounded in battle. Clay returned home grappling with posttraumatic stress disorder but refused to let his personal struggles prevent him from devoting his time to humanitarian work and advocacy on behalf of his fellow veterans. However. in March of 2011. at just 28 years of age. Clay took his own life. With an average of 22 veterans committing suicide each day. Clay was far from alone in his pain. and his family and friends are far from alone in their heartbreak over his loss. The last several years have seen significant increases in the Department of Veterans Affairs mental health and suicide prevention budget. staff. and programs. however. we have not seen a corresponding decrease in the number of our Nations heroes who take their own lives. What is more. for some groups of veterans. including female veterans and veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. suicide rates are actually getting worse. Mr. Speaker. we have got to do more to help these veterans access the supportive services and mental health care that they need to save their lives. With the passage of H.R. 203. we will. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of VA programs and increase awareness of available services. H.R. 203 would require an annual thirdparty evaluation of VAs mental health care and suicide prevention programs and require that VA publish an interactive Web site to serve as a central source of information regarding VA mental health services. To increase VAs capacity to meet the mental health care needs of our veterans. it would establish a pilot program that would repay education loans for individuals who have received a degree in psychiatric medicine and who agree to work at the VA for at least 2 years. To create a seamless transition from Active Duty to veteran status and increased community support for those in need. it would establish another pilot program to assist veterans during transition and require VA to collaborate with nonprofit mental health organizations in the community. Importantly. H.R. 203 would extend an additional 1 year of eligibility for VA health care services for certain combat veterans who have not yet enrolled and whose 5year combat eligibility period recently expired. Before I yield. I want to take a moment to once again express my condolences to Clays family and friends as well as the families and friends of our honored veterans who have lost their lives to suicide. I want to offer them my personal commitment to continue the aggressive pursuit to end veteran suicide. The passage of this bill today is just the first in what will be a continuing series of legislative and oversight efforts that our committee is going to undertake throughout the 114th Congress to improve access to mental health care for veterans in need. increase the efficiency and effectiveness of VAs mental health and suicide prevention programs. and increase meaningful partnerships with community providers who are often the first line of defense for their struggling veterans and the families of those veterans. This bill. which passed the House last Congress. will not singlehandedly halt the scourge of veteran suicide. but it is an important step. and it is a step that we owe Clay and those like him who desperately need and certainly deserve our help. With that. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 203. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 203. the Clay Hunt SAV Act. This legislation passed the House last month in the closing days of the 113th Congress. I am pleased that we were able to act on this measure as one of the first items of business in the 114th Congress. Providing the mental health care that veterans need and effectively dealing with the crisis of veteran suicides have been longstanding concerns of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. War is indeed terrible. and the effects of combat and service on our veterans lasts a lifetime. For far too long. societyand the military culture itselfhas acted as if the need for mental health care treatment is a weakness and has discouraged adequate treatment. This attitude is changing. but it cannot change fast enough. In the area of mental health for our veterans and returning servicemembers. there is no easy answer or quick fix. I appreciate the work of my friend from Minnesota. TIM WALZ. Chairman MILLER. and all of my colleagues on the committee in fashioning a bill that I believe will make a difference in the lives of our veterans. H.R. 203 takes a number of important steps. including improving the safety net for atrisk veterans. while also introducing some accountability into the VA mental health care and suicide prevention program. using a thirdparty evaluation. It will provide veterans with a Web site that will serve as a centralized source of information on mental health services. H.R. 203 initiates a program to help address some of the glaring mental health personnel shortages at the VA. While the incentives in this bill are limited to the psychiatry field. I would like to see this effort expanded in the future to all the mental health professional shortfalls. [- 1715 H.R. 203 would expand peer support networks. which we have heard are quite effectively used. And I believe the reporting requirement in this bill will confirm that additional resources should be permanently dedicated to fully utilizing peer support. H.R. 203 would also provide an additional window of eligibility for combat veterans who may have missed the window of opportunity to sign up for VA health care. This extra time will help to ensure that veterans receive the health care. including mental health care. that they need. I thank the chairman for working to bring this bill up quickly so that the House can act and send this important measure to the Senate. I look forward to working with Chairman MILLER. and with Florida being the State with the secondlargest population of veterans and the most senior population. I know that the committee will do a good job having two of the leadership team from Florida. But let me be clear: there are 435 Members of Congress. and each of them have veterans in their district. and we will work to make sure that all veterans get the care that they have earned and deserve.

Today. we honor Clay and his family with the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Clays story was one of bravery and dedication. He relied on the VA for care and received a 30 percent disability rating for PTSD brought on during his service. He appealed the rating and encountered a bureaucratic nightmare. Clay had to wait months to see a psychiatrist at a VA Medical Center. Two weeks later. Clay took his own life. Five weeks after his death and 18 months after filing an appeal with the VA for his PTSD rating. his appeal was approved. Clays story details the urgency that our Nations heroes deserve. The Clay Hunt SAV Act will increase access to mental health care and improve the quality of care troops and veterans receive. Together. we can change this system so that no other veteran ever has to endure what thousands of veterans have already gone through. including Clay.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the ranking member for your support of this important piece of legislation. As you heard. we are here once again. We had a piece of legislation that attempted to. as I think the chairman spoke about. address an issue that cuts to the heart and the soul of this Nation: When our warriors come home. how can we reintegrate them? And I think it is important. and I want to thank the chairman. one. for working so diligently on many numerous issues. but on this piece of legislation. and for bringing it back up again. but I think also for setting an example. The Nation expects us to do what is right by our warriors. They expect us to work together to find solutions. Something that we do in the committee is looking and seeing where we can improve and pointing out where there are faults. But that is not good enough. Pointing out the faults is one thing. and it is important. Finding solutions is what really matters. and this piece of legislation. I think. starts to do that. To my colleagues who are here. I would say this. We can certainly disagree and disagree strongly and passionately. But I think if the public knew and they could feel it and. I think. in this piece of legislation see it. there are many more things that bind us together. and our care and our commitment for our warriors is one of those. This is a piece of legislation that wasnt just written here in the Halls of Congress. It was written by the families. Susan and Richard Selke. Clays parents. by the Houghtalings in Minnesota. and the Kellys in New Ulm. Minnesota. and each of these Members that you hear speak about it. Since we passed this legislation. and it failed in the Senate. over 750 veterans have taken their lives. Many times down here. we feel like everything we do is the most important thing that needs to happen now. Rarely is that true. In this case. it is. We cant wait another day. We cant pass this problem forward because it is not only ripping at families. it is ripping at our Nation. These are our best and brightest. You heard about Clay. Clays a Marine who went to Iraq. He got shot by a sniper and. as a Marine. that irritated him. It didnt hurt him. He came back. He had his Purple Heart. and he could have come back and taken our thank yous. He didnt. He went to Afghanistan to continue on. He knew the extremism that was threatening Iraq and Afghanistan would some day threaten this Nation. so he was forward. He did his time. After he came back. that wasnt enough. He went to Haiti to help. After that. that wasnt enough. He sat in our offices on numerous occasions working on everything from access to the VA to the things you heard the gentlelady talk about in Indiana that were causing frustration amongst our veterans. And I think for me the thing is. like for so many of us. Clay appeared to have everything. He appeared that he knew and was competent and had it there. but we all know that they have demons. and Clay had demons. So what this piece of legislation doesyou heard the specifics. and it does do specific things. and no one is claiming that this is going to be the fix. But I would make the case that what the Clay Hunt bill has done and what it has done amongst our partners in the veterans service organizations is made it absolutely clear we will not leave anyone behind. We will not turn a blind eye to this. and we will not rest until we at least make the attempt to get that number down to zero. We may never get there. but this piece of legislation starts to address it. So I think it is important. and I want to thank the ranking member for being on this bill and putting it forward. and the chairman. who was an original author of this and has been instrumental in making it happen. What we are doing here is not just passing legislation. What we are doing here is changing the attitudes. focusing the Nations attention on this. because I dont care if it is Elkhart. Indiana. if it is Pensacola. Florida. or if it is Mankato. Minnesota. When we go to talk to our constituents. regardless of their political leanings. they tell us. take care of our warriors. do what is right. Fix the system. This piece of legislation does that. It does it in a costeffective. smart manner. and we have got the opportunity to start moving forward. I would say and encourage my colleagues. lets pass this thing. but lets not see it as an end result of a process we have been working on. Lets see it as the first of many things to try and make changes to be smarter about how we use taxpayer dollars. but also to demand effectiveness. because Clays parents deserve that. Thousands of others across this Nation deserve that. The more than 1 million veterans that will return over the next few years are counting on us to put everything in place to provide that help. So I encourage my colleagues. support this legislation. I encourage my colleagues. take this as an example. I want to thank Speaker BOEHNER and Majority Leader MCCARTHY for making it a priority. I think it speaks volumes. This piece of legislation is on the floor in the first week. That says something. that there is a commitment to getting it right. there is a commitment to working together. and there is a commitment to showing effectiveness for the American people. So. we have got that opportunity. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. get engaged with what is happening with our veterans. and lets prove that their service was not in vain. that this democracy is strong. that our commitment to them is unwavering and that. at the end of the day. that is what really matters. Mr. Speaker. I am very grateful for the opportunity to again tell you about a very important piece of legislation that will help in our fight to improve mental health care for our returning warriors: H.R. 203. the Clay Hunt SAV Act. Id like to thank the Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Mr. MILLER. and Rep. DUCKWORTH for continuing to be my partners in this effort. Id also like to thank Speaker BOEHNER for bringing this to the floor swiftly. And. a big thank you to Senators MCCAIN. BURR. BLUMENTHAL. and ISAKSON for all their work on the SAV Act. Most importantly. Id like to thank Clays parents. Susan and Richard Selke. They are holding Congress feet to the fire to make sure we get this done and to prevent another family from going through what they continue to go through each and every day. We cannot let them down. H.R. 203. the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. is an example of how we can work together on Capitol Hill. The legislation is named in honor of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veteran and suicide prevention advocate. Clay Hunt. Clay epitomized what it meant to live a life of service. both in and out of uniform. He helped countless veterans overcome their demons but tragically took his own life in March of 2011. The legacy he left behind. however. will live on for generations to come. The bill you see before you was the result of strong partnerships with our veteran service organizations. strong bipartisan efforts here in Congress. and the resolve of Clays parents pushing and pushing and pushing to get this thing done. This bill is what you get when you have folks sifting around the table. trusting one another. and working together to get it right for our nations veterans. Our premise for this bill was simple: suicide occurs because many vets return to their community and then disconnect from it. So. we wanted to create a bill that would get the communities involved and coordinated. We also knew it would be important to increase both oversight of the VA and their capacity to deal with over a million veterans returning from war. Specifically. the bill: 1. Establishes a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning servicemembers with accessing VA mental health care services. 2. Requires the VA to create a onestop. interactive website to serve as a centralized source of information regarding all mental health services for veterans. 3. Addresses the shortage of mental health care professionals by authorizing the VA to conduct a student loan repayment pilot program aimed at recruiting and retaining psychiatrists. 4. Requires yearly evaluationswith interim reports due in the first two years and a final report due the third year and every year afterconducted by a third party. of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the VA to find out what is working and whats not working and to make recommendations to improve care. Authorizes a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the transition of care for PTSD and TBI between the DoD and the VA. One veteran lost to suicide is one too many. With many of our warriors returning from war. all too often our heroes return only to face a war of their own at home. While there is no bill that will completely end veteran suicide. this bipartisan measure is a step in the right direction. In short. its a start towards fixing a problem. but we must not lose focus on this problem after passing this bill. We must continue working to improve care for our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can send it over to the Senate and onto the President swiftly.",

In the coming months. I look forward to working in a bipartisan. commonsense manner with dedicated Members and veterans like my colleague from Minnesota to find solutions to help our Nations veterans transition to civilian life. One of the most critical areas that we as a committee and Congress must work to establish is comprehensive. timely. responsive. and effective mental health care services for our post9111 veterans. many of whom have served our country for multiple deployments in conditions not witnessed or experienced by any other generation of soldier. This bill first prioritizes bringing accountability to the VA. By bringing in a third party to conduct an annual evaluation within the Department of Veterans Affairs. we can better provide agency accountability by doing just this. Second. we must provide better access to mental health services for our veterans and their families. This bill does just that. Finally. it helps facilitate and increase awareness for peer and community support providers for our veterans and their families. This commonsense legislation works towards those priorities of providing an accountable and supportive VA for our veterans. in furtherance of helping veterans get the best treatment possible. So.

To the author of this bill. Mr. WALZ. as I chatted with him on the floor. I indicated to him that just this weekend I met for hours with two wounded warriors. both of them having experience with PTSD. both of them being challenged about the transition into civilian life. both of them knowing of this legislation. feeling left out and deprived that it did not. despite the valiant effort of this House. pass in the last Congress. So let me congratulate all of you for recognizing that this is a crucial. lifesaving element of the men and women that we stand and admire and love. Every day. 22 veterans take their lives. but it is 8.000 a year. And if I might say. Texas walks alongside of Florida and other States in having the highest number of returning vets. Two million served in Iraq and Afghanistan across the Nation. Now. onethird. 600.000. have experienced traumatic brain injury and PTSD. From the early years of working with thenChairman and Ranking Member Murtha. I was privileged to bring $1 million to my district for PTSD. but that is not the heart of it. The bleeding and the sorrow of these men and women is not befitting of the service and the uniform that they put on. Not one moment should they wait at a veterans hospital for treatment for PTSD that should keep them grounded. Not one moment should they be alone contemplating suicide. without treatment and friends and family having assistance. This bill makes that statement. H.R. 203. the Clay Hunt SAV Act. It says that you are not alone and that we have put our actions where our words are. We have walked the walk. So I want to say to those wounded warriors who shared their heart with me. proudly come back and say: This bill is moving. and as it moves to the United States Senate. this bill is moving. And as we look to the Presidents desk. a signature will allow this bill to be in place. To those who missed the deadline. this law will allow you to still be able to receive that treatment because it allows an extended time for those who have missed the deadline. I know as I go back home to Texas and meet families that they are looking for action when it comes to our beloved veterans and those who have put on the uniform to serve this Nation as they watched their comrades die.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am here bringing forward Mr. BARLETTAS bill. and it is really simple. One of the cornerstones of our civil societyone of the great pieces of the American storyis volunteerism but. in particular. volunteerism among our first responders. So many of us represent congressional districts that thrive on and exist on and preserve their safety on volunteer firefighters and first responders. Unfortunately. in the Affordable Care Act. there is a huge glitch. Under ObamaCare. volunteer firefighters and first responders are counted in many ways as if they were fulltime equivalent employees. and therefore. volunteer fire departments are getting hit with enormous fines. mandates. and taxes. It shouldnt be that way. It is causing a huge paperwork burden. not to mention a fiscal drain on the budgets of these small fire departments and emergency responding agencies in our communities and in rural areas all across America. This legislation fixes this. I want to thank Congressman BARLETTA for introducing this because he clearly understands as a former mayor and as someone who represents Pennsylvania. which I know has a lot of volunteer firefighters just like we do in rural Wisconsin. that these are the lifeblood of our communities. The last thing that they need to do when they are so concerned about preserving public safety and health is to worry about all of these ObamaCare mandates. Mr. BARLETTAs bill preserves the freedom to operate for our 780.000 public service volunteer firefighters. It removes this mandate and exempts them from this onerous mandate. so they can continue providing the public service that they have been right now. Mr. Speaker. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania . the author of this legislation.",

    "speech": "Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of my bill. H.R. 33. the Protecting Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act. This is a good. truly bipartisan bill that protects our first responders. our volunteer firefighters. and emergency services personnel. It protects them by ensuring that they are not considered employees under the employer mandate provision of ObamaCare. If they were. some fire companies would be forced to pay for the volunteers health insurance or pay a fine. driving many fire departments out of business. As a former mayor. I know how important volunteer fire companies are to the health and safety of a community. Simply put. this is a public safety issue. I first learned about this issue from a volunteer firefighter. Bob Timko. back home. and I began a crusade to clear this up for volunteer firefighters and localities and the residents of Pennsylvania and every other State. As you know. the employer mandate of ObamaCare kicks in for employers with 50 or more employees. Now. some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think. \"Well. we only have 25 volunteers. so we are safe. We dont have 50.\" That may not necessarily be the case. Some fire companies are considered part of their local government. If you take the number of firefighters. paid and unpaid. and add them to the number of other public employees. such as highway workers. police. code enforcement officers. health officers. and clerical workers. you can easily reach 50. even in a small town. This would be a very big deal in my home State of Pennsylvania. where 97 percent of our fire companies are either completely or mostly volunteers. Nationally. almost 92 percent of fire companies use at least some volunteers. and over 86 percent depend on all or mostly volunteers. Those numbers come from the 2012 National Fire Department Census conducted by the United States Fire Administration. If your district is like mine. then volunteer firefighters are ingrained in your community. We won an initial battle on this issue. After I raised it with the IRS and brought pressure to bear through this legislation. they finally relented and changed their rules regarding the Federal tax status of volunteer firefighters. However. this is too important of a public safety issue to be left to the changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats at the IRS. Their arbitrary regulatory guidance could easily be changed back. Our people back home deserve better. We owe our emergency service volunteers. who risk their lives every day. rocksolid certainty. This legislation says. once and for all. that volunteer firefighters are just thatvolunteersand should not be subjected to the employer mandate. It takes away the power of the IRS to change the rules. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their continued support. Last year. this bill passed the Ways and Means Committee by a strong bipartisan vote of 370. and it passed the House by a very rare unanimous vote of 4100. Not one single Member. Republican or Democrat. opposed it. I want to thank Speaker BOEHNER. Majority Leader MCCARTHY. Majority Whip SCALISE. the Ways and Means Committee. and their staffs. We all recognize that my bill is a simple. bipartisan solution to an unforeseen consequence of the Presidents health care law. This bill has the strong support of the National Volunteer Fire Council. the International Association of Fire Chiefs. and the Congressional Fire Services Institute. I want to thank my partners. as well as the men and women they represent. for their help. To be clear. forcing volunteer fire companies to comply with ObamaCare will not extend health insurance to the uninsured. rather. it will close firehouses. placing people at risk. I strongly urge the passage of this bill.",

I rise in very strong support of H.R. 33. and I want to thank Speaker BOEHNER and Majority Leader MCCARTHY for allowing this legislation to come forward so early in this Congress. I agree with the gentleman from Connecticut . People always say: I wish you guys could get along. just get something done. This is something that we overwhelmingly believe in and we are going to get done. I think that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has explained very clearly that it has to become statute. It cant be left to be some nebulous fact that is rolling around out there. Now. these people who do this workand in Pennsylvania. 97 percent. almost eight out of every 10 firefighters come from the volunteer aspect of it. they are not paid. Yet because of some type of allowance they are given. they fall under the Affordable Care Act. and this would destroy volunteer fire departments as we know them. So what Mr. BARLETTA has very thoughtfully done is he has put forth a piece of legislation that would guarantee that these folks dont have to worry about that. Now. I have got to tell you. in the little town that I grew up in and live in. Butler. Pennsylvania. so many people volunteer their time to do the volunteer fire fighting. They are also the EMS. They are the first responders. Last spring. one of our volunteer firemen by the name of Ryan Sekerski. on his way home from work. he heard over his scanner that a fuel truck had overturned. The driver was trapped inside that truck. He then went to the scene of the accident. got his equipment that was in the trunk of his car. got out. and saved that drivers life. These are the people that we are talking about. When you come to the peoples House. Americas House. Americas Congress. we look at the things that we can do together. things that just make sense. While we may disagree on some other aspects of what it is that we try to get done. on this. we are solid. This just makes sense for America. This makes sense for all those that lay their life on the line anytime there is an emergency or a fire. They do it voluntarily. Hundreds and thousands of hours in training go into this. They spend time away from their families. They take time away from personal time. where they could be doing other things. to get trained so that they can help other Americans who may need their help. It is absolutely incredible. It is so American. It is something we look at with a great sense of pride. And we went to the IRS and said: Listen. what we really need now is a statute that guarantees that these volunteer fire departments will not be put under pressure. where they would have to go out of business. This is not a health care issue. not as far as it is supplying health care or paying a fine for those that volunteer. but this is a health care issue for every single American for whom these people supply necessary services on a voluntary basis to save their lives and their property. So I think the gentleman from Pennsylvania is a champion on this issue. He was in the last Congress and the fact that it has come forward againit is so overwhelmingly supported by both sides of our House that it truly is Americas Congress. It truly is Americas issue. It truly is an issue that makes sense for all of us. It is maybe our small way of thanking all those folks that do that every day without any pay. just because of the greatness in their hearts.",

And for a lot of communities that rely on volunteers. the issue of recruitment and retention and just trying to make the environment conducive for people to make that act of volunteering is a challenge that I think all of us hear about from our volunteer fire departments and first responders all across the Nation.

I have come to appreciate the volunteer firefighters more than I could ever imagine. Many times. I have watched them stand out in the middle of a road with a boot. trying to raise money so that they could buy gear or equipment or get more training. The volunteers ask very little of their community compared to what they are willing to give. and that is the ultimate sacrifice. They are willing to give their lives for people that they dont even know. They are willing to walk into a burning fire. I can remember one night. our local fire department in Hazleton. Pennsylvania. they ran in. and they came out with a little baby whose life they saved. And I also remember a day when they couldnt save a life and how it affected every one of those men and women as if it were their own child.

As a result of this invidious infliction. there are some in the House GOP who are prepared to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. even though America continues to be a top target for terrorists all across the world. This is shameful. This is reckless. This is irresponsible. The American people need to rise up to stop it from happening.",

In the streets of Havana. they said there were two basic things they liked about America: one was American movies. and the second was everything else. When I got to come back home through Miami. at the airport. people with Cuban backgroundsAmericanswere so excited about the opportunity for America to rejoin the family of nations and to recognize the contributions that Cuba can make. We thought that. today. we would be hearing a rejoicing for those people who should have never been in jail in Cuba who were released. Obviously. there are some people who have a different opinion. I am here today to say that. with all due respect to those Americans and to those Cubans who suffer under the dictatorship in Cuba. we feel their pain. but now.

So many people have come to this country from faraway places. and somehow. when they succeed. some change their names. some change their attitudes. and some just absolutely forget how they got here and how they were perceived. but Mario Cuomo was different. Mario was so proud of the fact that his parents were immigrants. He was proud of the fact that they came here with nothing but a hope and a dream that their son would succeed. He succeeded in everything that he touched. from neighborhood arbitration. to secretary of state. to Lieutenant Governor. and. of course. the Nation remembers him as Governor and as one who articulated the principles not of the Democratic Party. but of the entire country at a Democratic Convention. Of course. he leaves behind a son who. for those of us who attended his funeral would have to say not only did he talk about his father in terms that made us all feel proud. but in that voice that he had. if you closed your eyes for one moment. you would see that Mario Cuomo did not die. He left his son to continue in describing the great opportunity that we have in this great country. I am so glad that so many New Yorkers are here. Because we are here for such a short period of timewe are in committees and reorganizingthe delegation has asked me to reduce my remarks to 2 minutes. and I share that concern with the rest of our great delegation. It is my great pleasure to yield back the balance of my time so that the gentleman from New York. JOSEPH CROWLEY. may control the remainder of my time.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank the distinguished member and longestserving memberI dont want to say \"senior member\"-in the New York delegation for getting us off to a start to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo. It is my honor to join the New York delegation. I feel honored to do so. Four of our children were born in New York. so that gives me some standing on the subject. Mr. Speaker. I come to the floor to join the New York delegation in paying tribute to the memory of Governor Mario Cuomo. I am reminded of Ecclesiasticus. We all know this. but just think of how appropriate it is for Mario Cuomo. In Ecclesiasticus. it says: Now let us praise great men. the heroes of our Nation. They led the people by their counsel and their knowledge of the laws. From their font of wisdom. they gave instruction. These are godly men whose righteous deeds have not been forgotten. Their wealth is their descendants. and their inheritance is their childrens children. Their bodies are buried in peace. and their names will live forever. The people will tell of their wisdom. and the congregation will continue to sing their praise. Does that remind you of Mario Cuomo? Is that perfectly appropriate for him? Surely. those words apply to the life and legacy of our great departed friend. Mario. As a fellow Italian American. I have always taken great pride in his leadership. As a San Franciscan who hosted the Democratic Convention. we in California had some kind of claim on Mario Cuomo because of the great speech that he made at that convention which Mr. RANGEL referenced. but my observing of his greatness goes farther back than that. It was during a trip to Italy that we were invited by President Carter in 1980 to bring the sympathy and support of the American people to Italy at the time of the earthquake. when they lost 2.700 lives and which left 265.000 people homeless. I mention that because we went by helicopter from village to village to village. Villages were devastated. Mario Cuomo. here was this person who had such a large spirit and a good soul. who could sympathize with these people in English and Italian. For example. in a village where a First Communion class was rehearsing for First Communion. all of the 7yearolds in that village were in that church when the earthquake hit. The roof came down. and every 7yearold in the village was lost. Imagine the grief of those individual families and of that community to lose those children. but as you would expect. he was up to the task. knowing that words were completely inadequate and that no sympathy could meet the pain that they were feeling. nonetheless. there was this beautiful. sympathetic man identifying with these people from a region from which his family had come in southern Italy. Mario Cuomo was a pillar of strength through his community. his State. and our Nation. His values. his vision. and his effectiveness for the people of New York were an inspiration around the world. He was a man of principle and eloquencethat was goodand all the world saw. again. that manifested in the \"shining city on a hill\" speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention. With those soaring words. Governor Cuomo summoned the best of America and called us to empower the working people and middle class families who are the backbone of our Nation. He asked us to remember how futures are built. We know Mario Cuomos language and leadership will echo through the ages just as vital. just as urgent. just as energizing as his words were that day. In word and deed. Governor Cuomo challenged us to make real the American Dream. He had it for his family. He wanted it for everyone else. for all who strived to realize it. and opened the doors of opportunity for every American family. Family meant everything to him. He was a proud Governor of New York for three terms. but his proudest achievement was his beautiful family. No one could miss the pride and inspiration he found in his immigrant parents and how he talked about them so beautifully or in his boundless dedication to Matilda and his children. Our country has lost a great leader. but his family has lost a devoted husband to his wife of over 60 years. to Matilda. He was a loving father to five childrenMargaret. Andrew. Maria. Madeline. and Christopherand was a doting grandfather to some really lovely grandchildren. My husband. Paul. and I and our entire family are heartbroken. We are really heartbroken by his passing. and we continue to extend our deepest sympathy and love to Matilda and their family. I hope it is a comfort to them that so many people in their own State. in the country. and. really. throughout the world mourn their loss and continue to pray for them and continue to be inspired by this great man. As Ecclesiasticus says: People will tell of his wisdom. and the congregation will continue to sing his praise. I thank Mr. CROWLEY for yielding. I thank him for bringing us together to sing the praises of Mario Cuomo.",

    "speech": "I thank Mr. CROWLEY for yielding to me. There is so much on my mind as to what I could say about him. I knew him longer than the rest of the New Yorkers. I met him in 1973. I was a member of the Democratic State committee in Rochester. New York. and I was asked by the district attorney to come over to his house and meet a man from New York City who was thinking about running for Governor. so I joined my friends and sat in the living room for about an hour. awaiting the guest from New York to get off the telephone in the kitchen and come out and talk to us. He came out. He was perfectly charming. but he didnt know upstate New York. He started by telling us: \"A lot of people are talking to me about running for Governor. and I thought it would be a good idea if I came up here to see what all of you thought.\" I left the house that night. and I said to my friend that I was driving with: \"He is really a nice guy. and he is very smart. but. boy. he needs a lot of help.\" I was really pretty lucky. I think. that I got to do that. As it turns out. Governor Carey ran for Governor at that time. and Mr. Cuomo was appointed secretary of state. He had some great ideas for upstate New York. One of them was they were going to have an upstate coordinator. which is kind of an amorphous title. but I was very blessed that he let me try that job. I had been out of the workforce. I was home. My youngest child was about 12 years old. It was back in the day when one income could bring up a family and educate them. And so trying to get back into work and to get back into all of that was pretty difficult for me. And I am not sure anybody else would have put up with me. other than Mario Cuomo. giving me every opportunity in the world to try to learn what it is we were trying to do. But. boy. did I ever teach him a few things. We had an old State car. a rattletrap. I drove him all over upstate New York. and the conversations we had would absolutely astound you. We stopped one day in one of our beautiful rural villages in upstate named Pavilion to get a cup of coffee. And a 16yearold girl came out to wait on us. And here he was: a new person to speak to. Now. those of you who knew him know how exciting that would be. And he started in by asking her. What was the main business in Pavilion? What was the gross domestic product there? He was asking her all these questions. And all she wanted to do was get him a cup of coffee. And I felt a little sorry for her. so I said. \"He is the secretary of state.\" Unfortunately. I forgot the part to say secretary of state of New York. She went back into the kitchen. knowing this man was not Henry Kissinger. and never came back out. And as we rode around in this old red car. he would ask me about the cornfields. And I will tell you. if my agriculture people knew what a botch I made of trying to explain to him the life of the cornstalk. it was really awful. And he would say things like. How do they heat that house over there? What do you think they do? Where do they all go to school? Everything in the world interested him. He was the most extraordinary teacher that I have ever had. I just had those 2 years of showing him upstate New York. And then when he got elected lieutenant governorI ran that upstate campaignthe State Police took over. But we still carried on all these great conversations we had. And I remember one of the policemen said once that no matter how upset Mario was. when he got off the plane and would go 10 miles or 10 rounds with Louise. they were off on a whole other subject. I learned so much from him. And I know that everybody thinks of him as a onespeech maker sort of abut let me tell you. that was not it. The speech that he made at Notre Dame was so incredibly wonderful and so important and so instructive that everybody should read that as well. But one of my very favorites was when he made his speech about my hometown of Rochester on Lake Ontario. He described Rochester as a necklace of neighborhoods clustered around the lake. Now that is talking. And he also talked about life. that our life needed to be more than to just hope always to land on the safe squares. And we thought that was such an incredible thing to think about. that your life had to have more meaning than that. The people that we worked with at the secretary of states office who were holdovers from the previous administration had said to me many. many times how wonderful it was for them to be able to work for such a firstrate lawyer. And believe me. he really was. He loved the country. as NANCY PELOSI pointed out. His love of his family was absolutely legendary. He was a man of deep conviction. of religious faith. who loved his family more than anything. But he also loved the great opportunity that this country had given to him. He talked so admiringly of his father and the strength that his father and mother had. coming here with literally nothing. And it was the manual labor that his father did to lift himself up and. consequently. his family to a better life. and the country. He loved New York. He loved its people. He loved its history more than anything. He loved the institution of governing. So I speak of him as somebody that maybe other people didnt get to know the way I did. but I admired him always. And I am pretty sure I would not be in elected office at all had I not had the opportunity to learn from him. the wonderful opportunity to represent our neighbors and to come down and to try to make law and to make some changes. So I thank you very much for the time. Mr. CROWLEY. We will not see his like again.",

    "speech": "I thank my colleague. Mr. CROWLEY. This week in 1975. I became a member of the New York State Assembly. This week in 1975. Mario Cuomo became secretary of state. I left to come to Congress in 1990. so I am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. And in 1983. when I became chairman of the Education Committee. I really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. Above all. this man never forgot. and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. So he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. Yes. he was eloquent. Yes. he had to be a great human beingafter all. he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates. I believe. to play ball. that alone makes him a great guy. But he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store. having to work to get through law school. to be able to understand. So when I stood in front of him as one who had been born an American citizenbut a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different wayhe understood. There was that simpatico that he had with him. where he understood where we came from and what we needed. And I am just so honored to have served all those years with Mario Cuomo and to have considered him a friend. When I went to his funeral. Matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. And I wrote about a certain gentleman in the Bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. And she remembered that. And I. once again. offer my condolences to the Cuomo family. But we should not feel sorry that he is gone. We have been blessed with the fact that he lived among us. And for me. 16 of those 20 years. I learned so much from him. and hopefully I was able to help him along the way at times too.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I too came to the legislature and served for 16 years there. And for most of that time. Mario Cuomo was Governor. We all know that he was an eloquent philosopher in politics. someone who could express the goals and the principles of public office and of government more eloquently than almost anyone else. Mario Cuomo graduated first in his class from St. Johns Law School in 1946. And despite sending out over 70 resumes. he couldnt get a response or an interview from a top law firm because he was Italian. And that was the state of prejudice in this countryor at least on Wall Street in 1946. He went on from there to become a major lawyer. to become the Governor of a State. to become a leader of a philosophy in American politics. But in doing so. he never forgot where he came from. He didnt forget his experiences. and he knew that other people were having similar experiences. He was a man of great principle. He vetoed the death penaltythough he knew that the death penalty was very popular in New York12 times in a row. and he sustained those vetoes. Having not forgotten where he came from. he always wanted to use government to help defenseless people who needed the help of government. and he did. We all know many of the things he did. I am not going to repeat them here. But I want to just mention a couple of things that didnt get great publicity but that I saw as a member of the legislature. When he became Governor. he set up a commission. I forget the exact titleCommission on Child Support. Commission on Day Care. whatever it was. But every year for years. that commission came up with legislation which he supported and pushed. and some of us in the legislature worked on that. And he passedwe passed pioneering legislation. pioneering in this country on child support enforcement. which was considered a radical idea in the early 1980s. We passed the Child Support Standards Act so that judges couldnt leave women and their children without adequate support. He passed day care resource and referral legislation and family day care. all of which came from the initiatives of Governor Cuomo. none of which got a lot of publicity. which was focused on socalled bigger items. But these helped people. These were vital for people living their lives without a lot of money. without a lot of resources. But government became a helper and a friend because of Governor Cuomo.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. I rise to honor a leader who inspired not only New Yorkers but who also captured the imagination of progressives across the Nation. At a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves. Governor Cuomo outlined a different vision. Through his policies as Governor and his evocative speaking abilities. he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all Americans. not only the affluent and powerful. All of us remember his famous words from the Democratic convention in San Francisco. Questioning conservatives rosecolored view of the Nation. he noted we were becoming too much a \"tale of two cities.\" rather than a \"shining city on a hill.\" That speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe Americans can do more to help one another and those who think our Nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. However. just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally. Mario Cuomo remained dedicated to improving New Yorkers lives. A son of Queens. in many ways. he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that boroughs residents. Today. Queens is where families of all backgroundsLatinos. Asian. Italian. and Greek immigrantsconverge to secure a decent. affordable place to live. In todays political landscape. we could all benefit from remembering those words. In todays cynical environment. many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice. creating opportunity. and caring for neighbors in need. Governor Cuomo made many contributions. but that may be among his most important. He provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do. that our Nation can be better. and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow New Yorkers and Americans behind. For ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation. all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service. I send my thoughts and my prayers to his family. including his son. Governor Andrew Cuomo. I hope they can take comfort in knowing that all of us join in mourning with them.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership in so many ways. and I thank the leader of the Democratic Party for leading us in this tribute to our great Governor. We appreciate very much your presence and support of Mario Cuomo on the floor. It seems only fitting and proper for us to pay tribute to the late Mario Cuomo here in this historic Chamber. here where some of the most powerful and eloquent speakers in our Nations history have changed the course of human events. not with swords but with words and ideas. Mario Cuomo. the former Governor of New York. the liberal lion of the Empire State. the conscience of the Democratic Party. and a cherished friend. had few peers when it came to making the power of ideas and ideals irresistible forces for good. His faith. his passion. his values. and his unique gifts produced in him an unrivaled ability to articulate the plight. defend the rights. and engage the hopes of ordinary citizens. I had the great fortune to be a delegate when he gave one of the most storied speeches at the National Democratic Convention in 1984. I will never forget it. When Mario Cuomo spoke. it electrified the whole convention. We were transfixed by the power of his appeal right to the deepest reaches of our common humanity. He made all of us feel like we needed to do more. work harder. and help others because that is what really came through when Mario Cuomo spoke: his deep. unwavering commitment to fundamental decency. justice. and humanity. He spoke to a sitting President on behalf of the forgotten and the dispossessed. He spoke to the powerful on behalf of the powerless. \"There is despair.\" he said. \"in the faces you dont see and the places you dont visit.\" Mario Cuomo was right. He spent his life working and looking out for the hardworking people who build our shining cities. who supply our food. who teach our children. who staff our hospitals. people who are too often overworked. overlooked. and underserved. His own family had owned a store in Jamaica. Queens. and he knew full well the value of hard work and of education. He lived the American Dream and spent his life trying to build the American Dream for others. Mario Cuomo worked his way into St. Johns University. He attended St. Johns University School of Law in New York and graduated first in his class. He first rose to public attention when he came roaring out of Queens back in the 1970s to challenge city halls condemnation of a working class neighborhood in Corona. People quickly began to appreciate that Mario Cuomo had the transformative power to inspire others to demand for themselves a more just and humane society and a better government. He insisted that representative government should be just that: a government for all the people. Whenever he was on the ballotand I remember as an active Democrat thenDemocrat registration went up because everybody wanted to vote for and help elect Mario Cuomo. They knew he would do everything in his power to give them a fair shake. He once told meand I always had these terrible elections. He would always tell me that he was my fairy godfather. and he would grant me three wishes to win the election. but only on one condition. that I would go out and grant three wishes to someone else and help them do a better job in what they wanted to do. He was a wonderful friend and a mentor. a husband. a wonderful father. As a parent. there is no question he did a remarkable job. One son is a Governor. another is a news anchor. one daughter is a physician. another active in continuing the family work in housing the homeless. and another is an attorney. If that was all that he ever did. that would be plenty for one lifetime. Mario Cuomo did much more. He was secretary of state of the great State of New York. then Lieutenant Governor. and finally Governor for three terms. He led New York to provide health care for children. He began the Decade of the Child. an effort that used multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of our most vulnerable. He passed the child support enforcement bill. Under his leadership. the most intense public health plan in the Nation was put in place to take on the AIDS epidemic. Under Mario Cuomo. New York State became the first State in the Nation to enact a seatbelt law. He was a great man. and I am proud beyond all telling to be able to say that he was a friend. a mentor. and a supporter. I grieve his passing. and I send my most heartfelt condolences to his family and his friends. I shall miss the singular and remarkable man until the end of time. To know him was to love him.",

When I think of Governor Mario Cuomo. many talk about his great oratory. many talk about some of the fantastic speeches that he made. but when I think about Mario Cuomo. he didnt just talk the talk. he walked the walk. His speeches were not made just because it was a political gathering or forum. His speeches were made because that is what he truly believed. It came from his heart. It is how he lived his life. and you could see that in how he dealt with his family because that was his foundation. From that foundation. he was able to buildand starting with that little place in Jamaica. Queens. that I am now proud to represent. he looked at Queens and then. by extension. the city of New York and then. by extension. the State of New York as the foundation of which he could make a difference. learning from his growing up with his parents. As a result. you found individuals falling in love with Mario Cuomo. and you could see that by the people that were around him who became completely loyal to him because he had a real great leadership. Once you became infected with the spirit of Mario Cuomo. you continued to stay around him. and you would see in the visuals who were with Mario Cuomo until the day that he died folks loyal to him. In this business in this day and age. sometimes. if you dont have that kind of character. people come. and people go. Lastly. because I know that we have got so many members of the New York delegation that are here that want to speak. let me just say that he was competitive. I can think about those days whenI thank him first because he talked about getting into politics. he allowed me to cut my teeth by appointing me first to the New York State Workers Compensation Board as a judge. then later appointed me to become the supervising judge in the State. having me going all over the State. and then encouraging me to run for the State assembly and. once I got elected to the State assembly. working very closely with him. Once I got into the assembly. I thought he was a nice guy until you got on the basketball court. How competitive was he on that basketball court? ElbowsI look at some of the players now when they are complaining. et cetera. well. you need to go play old school basketball with Governor Mario Cuomo. I close by saying that I thank Godbecause he was a very religious man. Mario Cuomo. too. but God could have sent him to California. he didnt. He could have had him in Illinois or in Texas or in Florida. no. We were fortunate because God had him. through his parents. who emigrated from Italy to come to a place where the Statue of Liberty was. who believed \"Give me your tired. give me your weary.\" who believed in family. and we had him in the great State of New York. Thank you. Governor Mario Cuomo.",
