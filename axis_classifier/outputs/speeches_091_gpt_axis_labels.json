At a Habeas Corpus hearing the prosecution must show probable cause to hold the suspect at the time of the hearing. This fact indicates that there may have been a legal basis to find such cause against the suspects who revealed particles of nitrate from the paraffin test. Three issues are raised by Judge Crocketts ruling as to these men: 1) does the existence of nitrate on the hands of a suspect combined with the presence at the Church provide probable cause that he was involved in the shooting?. 2) may the results of the nitrate tests be used to show probable cause if they were taken after an arrest made with less than probable cause?. 3) may the results of the nitrate tests be used if such tests were taken while the suspect was being held incommunicado and not advised of his right to counsel?

The bill under consideration today is similar in most respects to one that I introduced some time ago. The two main purposes of this legislation is to protect those under 17 years of age from mailings harmful to minors and to protect the privacy of those citizens who do not want to receive sexually oriented material. This material is unsolicited and undesired and parents throughout the Nation are gravely concerned over these mailings falling into the hands of teenage children. This disgusting. unwanted obscenity and pornography has been foistered upon decent citizens and their children for far too long. Whether through the mails or at the corner newsstand. it is impossible to calculate the devastating damage done by exposing impressionable young people to salacious literature. This legislation will impose restraints on individuals and upon persons who flood the mails with offensive advertisements intended to produce a profitable market for the smut that they disseminate by stimulating the prurient interest of the recipient. Under this legislation a first violation would be punishable with a prison term up to 5 years or a fine of $5.000 or both. Second or subsequent offenses call for a fine of $10.000 or imprisonment up to 10 years or both. The problem of pornography and the mailing of smut has been monumental and everyone recognizes that there is no single solution. However. adoption of this legislation is certainly a step in the right direction and will go far to eliminate this offensive material that has flooded each of our districts. The need for strong. emphatic and enforceable obscenity control legislation at both the State and the Federal level is clear. In order to stamp out the poison of pornography in our Nation we must act decisively. This compelling problem requires our immediate attention and action. It is time to stand up for decency in America. I. therefore. urge the immediate passage of the legislation before us today.",

What is worse. many of them aim their material at those 16 years of age and younger. The smut mailers are persistent because they know that with repeated mailings they may be able to get past alert parents. The mailbox has to be shut to unwanted and uninvited material directed at the curiosity of youngsters and as an attack on the privacy of adults. H.R. 15693 does this in two ways: It forbids the mailing of material harmful to minors which is defined in terms of obscenity directed at minors. and which has been called variable obscenity by commentators.

In title I of the bill. which is in accord with a Presidential request. a registry is set up which will allow American adults to list their names and the names and addresses of their children with the Postmaster General so that after 30 days. smut mailers are on notice not to forward sexually oriented advertising to the named persons. This title has two sanctions. judicial civil sanctions or court orders and criminal penalties. The cost of maintaining the list would be borne by the mailer. I believe that the American people should be able to demand from the Congress. the only body that can control the postal system. reasoned action. I strongly urge the approval of this legislation.",

The Postal Departments only weapon is to have the addressee fill out a form authorizing the Post Office to send a prohibitory order to the mailer ordering him to remove their names from his mailing list. This situation led me to introduce legislation in the first session of the 91st Congress to help cure this situation. But. now we are considering a bill that goes well beyond my legislation. and I rise to support it. Mr. Chairman. it is contrary to the public policy of the United States for its Post Office Department to be used as an instrument for the distribution of such sordid materials to persons who do not want their privacy to be so invaded or who wish to protect their minor children from exposure to such material. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and hope that it will halt the practice of using the mail system to peddle filth. a practice which. as I said. has increased so alarmingly in recent months.",

I do. however. feel that is only a small step in the long road that we must take to totally and completely obliterate this type of material from the mails. A citizens revolt is growing against the torrent of obscene materials pouring into every home in our country. Pornography has become a multimilliondollar racket. invading homes of many. unasked and unwanted. The community standards of our people are affronted by an aggressive campaign of commercial exploitation. conducted from a few wellidentified production centers. A particularly vicious aspect of this racket is that it preys upon inexperienced young people at the very time of their character formation. By invading the home. it attacks the family bond. subverting the principles of morality that decent parents are trying to instill in their children. Pornography threatens to leave impressionable youngsters scarred with a distorted sense of values. In the large part. the onrush of pornography has been released by a long series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have overturned determinations of obscenity. By turning these people loose. the Supreme Court has given them license to impose their degradation upon the rest of the community. I believe the bill we are considering today is a step in the proper direction toward the regulation of obscenity and the violation of the privacy of the American home. and I am pleased to enthusiastically support it.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of H.R. 15693. a bill to protect minors from hardcore pornography and to safeguard the privacy of families who do not desire to receive sexually oriented mail. The legislation before us today. which is similar to my bill H.R. 4591 introduced on January 27. 1969. has been carefully drafted to safeguard the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and expression. As such. it conforms with the most recent Supreme Court decisions in this area. is directed to the protection of children. and sets forth clearly the materials which may be prohibited from the U.S. mail. Specifically. the bill will prohibit the mail order sale of obscene materials to children under 17. In addition. families with minors will be permitted to request that no sexually oriented advertisements be mailed to their homes. Fines of up to $5.000 and prison terms of no more than 5 years are provided for first time violators. H.R. 15693 is a clear improvement over earlier antipornography legislation. For example. the AntiPandering Act. enacted into law during the last Congress. provides only parital protection from obscene mailings. Under that statute. the burden of enforcement is placed primarily upon the innocent recipient of pornography who may take action only after the objectionable mailing has been received in his household. Thus. the act does not serve as a deterrent to a firsttime unsolicited mailing and its sole penalty for the smut merchant is loss of a name from his mailing list. Mr. Chairman. this problem is national in scope. During 1968 the Post Office Department received over 165.000 formal complaints from recipients of obscene materials. Most came from shocked and concerned parents of school age children. Throughout my tenure in the Congress. I have received numerous communications from harassed constituents regarding the use of the U.S. mail to bring filth and obscenity into their homes. In recent years I have noted with consternation that these legitimate complaints are increasing as the flood of pornography through our Nations mail reaches unparalled proportions. H.R. 15693 will enable parents to protect their youngsters from hardcore pornography without endangering our precious freedoms. I urge its favorable consideration by the House.",

Yet today millions of Americans are prevented from establishing this protection for themselves and their children from the vicious assault of pornographers. both domestic and foreign. upon their spiritual and intellectual freedom. These assaults. especially those upon innocent children. are deeply affecting the peace and tranquillity of our homes. This situation is a profound commentary upon the viability of democratic government. when we have not already moved to provide adequate protection to both parents and children. I believe we must act now to prevent this intellectual violence. With this in mind I introduced H.R. 11722. the purposes of which have been incorporated in H.R. 15693. introduced by Chairman DULSKI and others. to exclude from the mails certain material offered for sale to minors and to protect the public from the offensive intrusion into their homes of sexually oriented mail matter.

I have often maintained that the major airports should be used primarily for the great volume of commercial aviation traffic. In conversation with air controllers and FAA officials on my tour of the traffic control facilities at Kennedy International Airport in New York 3 weeks ago. and in subsequent communications with Administrator Schaffer. I indicated that I would introduce legislation. should the FAA fail to deal with the issue. to require all aircraft to equip themselves with devices that would allow the air traffic controllers to monitor all aircraft within a designated radius of the airport. and to limit access to the high density airports predominantly to commercial aviation. I am most pleased that Secretary Volpe has proposed rules that would not only effectuate these goals but also would attempt to establish \"terminal control areas\" to further reduce the possibilities of midair collision. The problems of safety and congestion have long confronted our airports. and often create chaos for the traveler. I believe that regulations such as those suggested by Secretary Volpe can be an effective measure to reduce congestion and improve safety at our airports. and so that the rules may be as sound and equitable as possible. I would urge all interested parties to take an active role in the hearings that will precede their promulgation. If these rules turn out to be ineffective.

It is obvious to all of us that the safety and working conditions of the underground coal miner must be improved. Too frequently we are dramatically reminded of this fact when we suffer a major mine catastrophe. Less dramatically. but surely just as damaging and devastating. are the human and economic losses which occur to the miner by virtue of diseases he encounters as a direct result of working conditions within the underground mine. These conditions and the industrial diseases which flow from them have resulted in untold suffering and losses throughout the years. It Is time that something be done in this regard. and I am confident that something constructive and effective will be done under the terms and requirements of S. Fortunately the bill goes beyond simply improving conditions and environment in underground mining operations. although these features are an important part of the bill. It also provides a program of research into the causes and. hopefully. treatment of the industrial diseases related to underground mining. This is an area that has been recognized to a small degree in the past. but it has not received sufficient priority. particularly with reference to its funding. The bill now before us. as amended by the Randolph amendment. authorizes a program of realistic proportions to be financed by a direct appropriation. I do hope that this authorization will be followed by adequate appropriations so that this badly needed program of research may go forward. In this bill we are placing great emphasis on the human element involved in the coal mining industry. This will result in a healthier coal mining industry and will most certainly result in healthier coal miners. Not only will it prevent human suffering and loss but it will prevent. or at least substantially reduce. the resultant economic loss which inevitably results when an individual contracts industrial disease. For these reasons. Mr. President. I support this legislation. I do hope that it will be approved by the Senate without delay and that soon it will be enacted.",

I would hope. however. that the wearing of black. which is a traditional expression of grief of most religious faiths. will serve as a reminder that none of us can ignore the continuing loss of life and that we do share the personal tragedy that so many American families are required to bear. The American people have been asked to be patient over Vietnam for too many years. Now our policy no longer seeks a futile military victory but the gradual withdrawal of American troops over several more years pending a negotiated settlement. Should we pursue this policy of gradual withdrawal we only accept more unnecessary deaths. In fact. any arbitrary timetable is intolerable. We are dealing with the lives of our best young men and there is no excuse for this unjustifiable delay. Therefore I think this ribbon can also be worn as a sign of commitment to do all one can to change our Governments tragic policy and thus end the unnecessary killing.

I do think the facts and figures suggest a different story. Presently the staff is small. I think it consists of nine members. The chairmans salary and his staff today cost $200.120 of the $250.000 appropriation that it was suggested they have lived with for 2 years. but was established in 1964 out of a 196162 Conference level. So we are not dealing with a current increase. This is an increase literally for an 8year period. during which the estimates for their salaries have risen from $121.000plus to $200.000. It leaves less than $50.000 for equipment supplies. furniture. travel. printing. reproduction. and particularly. per diem employment. While they would like to operate on the $100.000 level. perhaps they cannot do so and are not able to do so presently. The Bureau of the Budget has allowed them every dollar they have got coming. because the Bureau of the Budget knows the difficulty they are in under this particular administration and the past administration. It is their intention. if authorized. to seek a supplemental appropriation if there is an increase in authorization. I cannot speak as to the success of that application. That is up to the Congress. and whether it is effective in fiscal 1970 or otherwise. but I do know they feel very definitely that the limitation imposed on them many years ago is today a limiting factor.

As a lawyer and as a member of the House Judiciary Committee. I have been impressed with the achievements of the neighborhood legal services programs conceived and funded by OEO. Such action should not be allowed to stand. We must do all we can to be sure that the poor continue to get the expert legal representation which OEO has been providing. Admittedly. there is some temporary discomfort in having legal services lawyers challenge existing institutions which have traditionally shortchanged the poor. But yielding to that irritation by putting shackles on the legal services efforts would. I am convinced. result in a longterm calamity for this Nation. The Senate amendment removes from the Director of OEO his power to override a Governors veto when he feels such action is in the best interest of poor clients.

The State Department has assured Seattle interests that it will consider Seattles position in 1970 negotiations with the Japanese. and accordingly. I have. this day. sent a letter to the State Department strongly urging that they give such consideration to Seattle as a gateway to the Orient and that I be kept informed of any moves they make in this regard. Mr. Speaker. airroute decisions can overlook geography just so long. With the advent of 747s and. In a few years. supersonic transports. passengers will want the shortest possible nonstop routes. The first step in improving Seattles status should be taken through a regional agreement to seek flight rights through Seattle for Japan Air Lines and a U.S. airline. Presently there is just one SeattleTokyo combination carrier. The main thrust of transpacific air travel now is by way of the islandhopping central Pacific. about 1.200 miles longer. Threecarrier competition through the Seattle gateway. coupled with a badly needed reduction in Pacific fares. and fares based on mileage. could place Seattle in its rightful role as the Nations leading transpacific gateway.

Botswana is confronting not only the problems of economic development common to so many emerging nations. but the unique political pressures of its geographical situation. surrounded by powerful states dominated by whiteminority regimes based on fundamental political principles totally divergent from its own. President Khamas remarks are therefore particularly significant. for his discussion of the role of the United Nations in economic development and the significance of U.N. membership to the emerging nations. but even more so. for his courageous and realistic statement on racialism in southern Africa.

The suit charged the industry with collusion to delay the development and manufacture of air pollution control devices for automobiles. going back as far as 1953.

Whether we involve ourselves militarily is a matter of policy. not research. and that policy can be most wisely shaped if careful preliminary research is done. The reports submitted by the Senator from Arkansas yesterday. in my opinion. are hardly the whole story. Out of such policy studies have come many of the fundamental concepts and programs on which national security rests. Concepts and rationale of stable deterrents. the first strike. second strike distinction. the rationale for security through arms control rather than arms competition. the most informed critics of MIRV and ABM. have all been influenced importantly by work done on these research efforts. Economies are also realized. Overseas bomber bases were reduced at savings of billions of dollars a year after studies In the midfifties revealed their vulnerability to missile attack. These and other savings grew out of such analysis as the Senator from Arkansas attacks so categorically. analysis costing only a pittance of the savings from the basic studies alone. If there is waste. payoffs from such research are sometimes so great as to compensate many times over. especially in view of the relatively small fraction of the budget in these categories. It is also utterly misleading for the Senator from Arkansas to assert that no one knows the cost of studies he cites. As the letter of July 24. 1969. from the Department of Defense. printed in the RECORD at the request of the Senator from Arkansas at page 23291. indicates. the cost of individual reports are not easily determined. but the costs of projects. from which many reports may emerge. are known.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I yield myself two and a half minutes. Mr. President. I should like to sum up the situation with which we are confronted in connection with the Fulbright amendment. The first thing I wish to make clear to the Senate is that the Armed Services Committee already has cut research. development. test. and evaluation by over a billion dollars. The cut suggested by Senator Fulbright amounts to close to $46 million. in an area in which we already have cut $50 million. of which $40 million will be falling on the same programs about which the Senator from Arkansas is complaining so strongly. The committee has had the best of staff work. excellent staff work. This year. the chairman set up the R. & D. Subcommittee. and a hard and close scrutiny was conducted into these areas of the budget. Sometimes when we approach a problem and try to cut in and reduce the expenditures. we suddenly become aware that if we cut too deeply. go a little too far. we may be doing more harm than good and may nullify any good that has been done. In 1970. we have been able to reduce this budget. We feel very strongly that when Senator FULBRIGHT suggests that some of these small programs be cut by 58 percent. by 36 percent. by 33 percent. he is in effect reducing these programs more than he should. So when we consider our own cuts. which have measured anywhere from 10 to 12 percent on these programs. it seems that it is piling on too much and that. in the Interest of good budgeting and forwardlooking work for the research and development and in the area of militay research. the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas should be defeated. and defeated soundly.",

That subcommittee recommended a 12percent reduction in these items. That reduction was adopted and brought here before the Senate. It is about $40 million. The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas would reduce the amount around $45 million more in those same categories. A great deal of what the Senator is talking about here is in the 1968 budget. or at least a part of it. A great deal of his criticism is that these items should be in some other departments of Government. We state in our report that some of them should be transferred to the Department of State. I suggested yesterday that the Senator pick out some of them and give them to the committee. We thought it was too late in fiscal year 1970 to dump them out in the waste basket without anyone having jurisdiction over them. Therefore. we dealt with the situation as best we could. In this group I am fully satisfied that the subcommittee intelligently and diligently made an effort to get a firm recommendation for. the Senate. I hope the Senate takes the recommendation seriously and approves the work of the subcommittee with this understanding.

A matter of parenthetical interest to the junior Senator from Tennessee is that this is an item that I have long favored. and in fact espoused 4 years ago when I ran for the Senate. I put this question to the distinguished chairman: It has been said that the automatic benefit increase provided for in the social security bill could be financed without increasing the contribution rates. provided the benefit and contribution base is increased as wages rise. Why then does the Senate bill provide for increasing both the base and the contribution rate so that each increase would meet onehalf of the cost?",

I would point out. if I may. that the social security tax is progressive in a sense. in that as the rate goes up. there is a tendency to shift the burden to higher income taxpayers. while. in the alternative. if we left the rate at the lower level. it would tend to fix the burden on another group of taxpayers. So it would appear to me that the combination approach that the committee adopted. and which the chairman has now explained. has all of the attributes of a tax of a progressive nature. rather than a regressive one.

The Senate again was tied up in its own feet and its own procedure and could not move a step beyond that.

The Nixon administration has done more than the previous two administrationswho inadvertently involved us in this open end commitment in Vietnamto reach lasting peace in Southeast Asia. It has combined longrange goals of regional peace with the immediate and pressing task of stopping the war. This administration has demonstrated its willingness quite patently. and I would like to enumerate the commendable efforts of both this Government and the South Vietnamese Government to bring the war to an end: First. prior to January 20. we halted the bombing of North Vietnam and agreed to sit down at the conference table with the NFL. as well as the governments of Hanoi and Saigon. Second. we remained at the table and refrained from resumption of the bombing despite Hanois shelling of South Vietnamese major cities. its violation of the demilitarized zone. and its refusal to deal with the Saigon government. Third. on March 25. Thieu offered to meet with the NFL for private talks without preconditions on a political settlement. Fourth. on May 14. with Thieus support. the President put forward an eightpoint plan for peace. It included the renouncement of reliance on a military solution. the offer of withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces within 12 months under international guarantees. and emphasis on our desire only to secure the right of the people of Scuth Vietnam tc determine their own future without outside interference. Fifth. on June 8. the President announced the withdrawal of 25.000 U.S. combat troops. Sixth. at Midway. both Thieu and the President declared their readiness to accept any political outcome arrived at through free elections. Seventh. Thieu has now offered a concrete program by which free elections can be held and the will of the South Vietnamese people can be determined. I also want to commend the South Vietnamese Government for their cooperation and realism in adopting a workable and flexible policy in negotiating peace. Now the burden of proof rests with the Communists. They have not demonstrated both in the immediate and far past any desire to conclude the war.

Gradually the Iron Curtain. raised by the Soviet Union between the East and the West. became stabilized and the isolation of 100 million souls from the free West was completed. Many have hoped that the passage of time would gradually erode this barrier but the cruel crushing of the Hungarian revolution in 1956 and last summers invasion of Czechoslovakia clearly show the Soviet Unions consistent dedication to the domination and oppression of the captive nations.

I am. and have been. most disturbed by the decline in immigration from Ireland. and I have. therefore. introduced H.R. 10618 to resolve the situation. I am pleased to say that my distinguished colleague from New Jersey . who is also ranking Republican member of the Judiciary Committees Immigration Subcommittee.

Our bill meets the need as it exists todaya need to keep the avenues of immigration to the United States open and thus bridge the gap until intending Irish immigrants will be able to meet the criteria for all immigrants. no matter from where they come. H.R. 10618 proposes that unused visa numbers from fiscal year 1968 be returned to those countries which were unable to make use of them because of the new strict requirements in the law. Applicants for such visas will not be subject to the restrictive labor certification and system of preferences. Mr. Speaker.

When it got to a question of shoes and other products. there are many who feel that we cannot have a blanket quota which would cover all the industries. that we should take each one separately and discuss it and investigate it and make a determination as to what each industry needs. A quota may not be the best thing. perhaps subsidies may be the answer to some industries. But I think what he was saying was that he had an open mind. and that he would do the work and make the investigations before he made a final determination. I think Carl Gilbert is the kind of man we need In this position. The Senator from New Hampshire has said that the man has eminent qualifications for the job by virtue of the long service he has had. And his integrity is not in question. When we have qualifications such as his. and the unquestioned integrity of a man who has always been honest with us. when he has been before the committee twice. and the committee being satisfied with what he said.

That is true because of the purchasing power Americans have. I say it makes little sense at all to destroy the purchasing power of our peon ple by depriving them of jobs. which Is. precisely what we are doing when we permit different facets of American industry to go under because of competition from foreign countries where the wages paid do not even approximate what we pay workers in the United States. For that reason. I must express my. concern for the jobs not only of the people in my State of Wyoming but people throughout America. and for the kind of purchasing power that those jobs produce. in order that there may be a ready and a good market for the products we raise in Wyoming and throughout the rest of the country. The oil business today is an important contributor to Wyomings economy. If we were to lower all of the barriers that limit the importation of oil into the United States at this time. there is no doubt in my mind at all that the oil Industry as we know it in the State of Wyoming would dry up and become practically nonexistent. Likewise. if we permit the unlimited importation of beef. lamb. and wool these industries would suffer irreparable damage. Such a course of action might have an initial appeal to consumers anticipating lower prices. But I respectfully point out. Mr. President. that in the long run such actions would weaken the United States. It would wreak havoc to our schools In many districts of Wyoming. and elsewhere. because of the loss of taxes the cowman. the woolgrower. the oilman presently pay. It would hurt our economy. The money these businesses generate would go to foreign producersnot our next door neighbors. It would mean unemployment. No longer would the services of many now employed in the United States be needed. The welfare and relief burden would be increased upon our remaining taxpayers and employers. For these reasons. Mr. President. I shall vote \"nay\" on the matter of the confirmation of Mr. Gilbert in order that there can be no doubt about my position regarding the further lowering of our trade barriers to unlimited imports.",

So again. we can strengthen the hand of the Attorney General to assure voting rights and voting equality. but do it on a national basis. And as the Senator has just said. it is time that we bring the South back into the Union and make voting a national policy and not a regional or Southern policy.

I urge passage of the bill H.R. 4249. entitled \"The Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1969.\" The 15th amendment guarantees that every citizen shall have the right to vote without regard to his race or color. The Congress sought to implement this guarantee by passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Under this act. administrative procedures were established to assure nondiscrimination in the electoral process. These procedures were applied in six southern States and in about 40 other counties. I supported the 1965 act in the House of Representatives with the hope we would make it possible for a greater percent of our citizens to vote. That has been acomplished. More than 800.000 nonwhite voters have been registered in the States and counties covered by the act. More than 50 percent of the eligible nonwhite voters are now registered in every Southern State. In my State of Kansas. we do not require a literacy test and. therefore. have not been affected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. But. I am deeply concerned that a greater percent of our citizens do not participate in the most meaningful aspect of selfgovernment. that of exercising their right to vote. Our form of government cannot function without the participation of all our citizens. Many who complain about our laws and those who govern are the same individuals who dont think it important that they cast their ballot on election day. In the 1968 presidential election. 63.6 percent of qualified voters in Kansas actually voted. This was higher than the national average of 61 percent. but is still a sad commentary on both the motivation of our citizens and the effectiveness of our electoral system. We must not only motivate people but make it possible for them to exercise their right to vote. H.R. 4249 can help us achieve these goals.",

Representative POFF is recognized nationally as one of the most able lawyers in Congress and one of the most effective and fairminded Members of Congress. He points out. as stated earlier. that we are not concerned with a simple extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. There are 19 sections in the Voting Rights Act as passed in. 1965. Seventeen of the 19 are permanent law. What we are discussing. if we are frank and candid about it. are two sections. 4 and 5. which would expire in August unlessbecome inoperative in Augustunless extended. It seems that in discussing extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. it is at least a misnomer. We are in fact concerned with two sections plus additional new provisions which nearly everyone is in accord with. As I said earlier. coming from a State which has no literacy test requirement. which has rather liberal voting requirements. the State of Kansas. I see no harm in sections 4 and 5 becoming applicable to all States. Why should it not be nationwide? Why should only one region. whether it be the South. North. East. or West. be singled out? The Senator has expressed his views. I agree with the statement made by Representative POFF and others in this body that. if these provisions have been effective. if the Attorney General can send observers and investigators into certain areas to discover voting frauds or slowdowns at the polling places. or whatever. then we should have this same opportunity in all the States. not just one geographic region.",

Also fault can be foundand it is a serious fault and error. in my judgment. that sections 4 and 5 are extended so that it does not take into account what was done in 1968 and the progress that was made by the States which were singled out for special attention by the executive branch and by the courts with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. If we are going to be fair. let us also be realistic.

If 17 of the 19 sections are good enough for the entire country then sections 4 and 5 should also apply to the entire country. I do not say this as one who opposes voting rights. I voted for the 1965 act and supported it on the House floor. But it seems that if we are concerned about equality and the right to vote. as pointed out before. that means that people must have the right and must be motivated first to vote. In my State. for instance. about 64 percent of the people voted for President in 1968. The national average was about 61 percent. That is not high enough. in my opinion. but if we are really serious about voting rights for all. rich and poor. black and white. why should the law not apply to all the citizens. in all States. in America?

It permits the Attorney General to go to court and obtain a temporary injunction. That can be done quickly and an injunction secured by an affidavit. There is nothing burdensome about this. It must be done quickly in order to protect the voters right to vote. I would say that every citizen in America. because of communication. of television. no longer must be able to read in order to vote intelligently. If he is a citizen and competent and has not been convicted of a felony. he should have that right. As the Senator from Wyoming has stated so well. the law should be applied on an evenhanded basis. It should be applied the same throughout the country. I would say to some who talk about a southern strategy. that it appears that the only southern strategy here is to punish the South. despite great gains made in the Southern States since 1965.

It is time that the South is brought back into the Union on a de facto as well as a de jure basis but. above all. there can be no harm In applying this law to all States. There have been almost 1 million new nonwhite registrants in the covered States. I assume that in almost every State of the Union there is discrimination. It may vary by degree. but it is there. It may happen in my State of Kansas. It may happen in the State of Wyoming or in any other State. We should recognize this and accept the full import of the law.

I happen to be one of a number of people who believe that unless a person is able to read and understands what he sees in print before him. he cannot make the reasoned judgments that are required fully to discharge the responsibilities and obligations of good citizenship. I say that because I know. as every other Senator knows. that from time to time in addition to the responsibilities of selecting from the candidates those whom we choose to have represent us. there is the added burden and responsibility of voting on constitutional amendments. And how anyone could assume that a person who is unable to read could make an intelligent decision upon a constitutional amendment in a proposal before him is beyond me. Nevertheless. I know that the courts have struck this provision down. They have said. in effect. that the right to vote shall not be denied because of the inability to read the English language. I am willing to go along. as all good citizens should. with what the court says. I recognize that we do have a better informed electorate because of additional sources of news now available to the people of this country than we had when newspapers alone were the only way by which we could garner ideas and different points of view.

I can easily understand that a lot of people. though they may be neither able to read nor write. can have some comprehension of what a particular candidate stands for and what he would try to push for were he elected to the job to which he aspires. I can understand that. I hope the time is not too far distant when such a provision as Wyoming has on its books now will have no further relevance.

In this case. however. the deletion will have little practical effect because lands outside the reservation can be acquired in trust for the Hopi Tribe under the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act.

We have lost some revenue in connection with the Outer Shelf oil leases. We have had other expenditures. including the farm subsidy. Since February 2 of this year I would like you to know that the interest has increased by $400 million between February 2 and June 30. 1970. That is about $80 million a month. So now as we act. this ceiling will go up to about $197.9 billion. Actually. the amount will probably be $199.1 billion for the fiscal year 1970. which ends on June 30. It would set the ceiling for the next year at $203.8 billion. and permits certain cushions which could raise the maximum to $208 billion. I mention that because once again it will depend on how much Congress increases spending over the budget. We may have to have another supplemental bill.

It seems evident that we will be lucky if Federal budget spending during the current fiscal year is held below $200 billion. We are knocking at the door of a $200 billion expenditure for the current fiscal year. There is no hope that for the forthcoming fiscal year budget spending will be held below $200 billion. As Members know. we are currently borrowing about $8 billion a year from the Social Security. Highway. and other trust funds. We are borrowing those funds. paying Interest on them. and utilizing them for the regular operations of the Government. Members know that those funds will eventually have to be replaced and except for the fact that we are borrowing those trust funds. the Federal funds portion of the pending budget would be in the red in the sum of at least $8 billion.",

I believe we have amply demonstrated here many. many times our position on the SST. In the closing days of this session to constantly bring it up to delay adjournment of this Congress and to make this Congress look more foolish in the public eye I believe is quite ridiculous. There is more involved in this resolution than the SST. On May 27 of this year H.R. 17755 passed the House. That bill provided appropriations for the Department of Transportation and related agencies. On December 3 of this year the Senate passed the bill in amended form and the committee on conference met. The report of the committee on conference was agreed to by the House on December 15. Two days ago. on December 29. the Senate tabled the conference report. Since July 1 of this year. the beginning of the fiscal year. the Department of Transportation has been operating at the 1970 funding level rate. or the rate level provided in the bill as passed by the House. whichever was lower. This continuing resolution is. in effect. an amendment to a similar continuing resolution passed on June 29 of this year. It does two things: First. it provides continuing funding for all Government departments and agencies not yet funded by appropriations bill until March 30. 1971. Second. with respect to related agencies and the Department of Transportation covered by H.R. 17755. such activities will be funded at the level of appropriations agreed to by the House on December 15 when it accepted the conference report on the bill. This means that a number of Department of Transportation programs presently funded at 1970 fiscal year levels will be substantially increased.",

So. I shall vote for the previous question so we can get this continuing resolution passed or the Senate will have to send over and request to take the papers from the Speakers desk and ask that they be returned to the Senate and let them take from the table the conference report that was tabled in the Senate. Mr. Speaker. as the gentleman from Massachusetts has said. there are a number of employees who will be affected by the action which might be taken or which could come about as a result of our failure to take some action on this resolution. There are over 100.000 employees in the Department of Transportation. 45.000 of them in the Federal Aviation Administration. 40.000 in the Coast Guard. and innumerable other thousands spread throughout the entire department. Our concern is that government ought to function. and it cannot function with the kind of opposition that is now going on in other places in this building. The conferees of the House backtracked a considerable way. In almost every conference there is give and take. and we have given. but they do not want to give at all. some of them over there.

I have discussed at some length with Dr. Wodicka. of the FDAs Bureau of Foods. the press stories reporting the recall of canned tuna. and am happy to quote Dr. Wodickas flat statement: No tuna has been found where a concentration of more than one part per million of mercury exists. Although this is a safe level. the industry and the FDA are taking steps to make sure that in the future no tuna with a concentration of more than onehalf part per million reaches the market. It is perfectly safe to eat tuna presently stocked. however. because even if it reached the one part per million level. which it does not. no one could eat enough to suffer 1l effects from the present supplies. I was interested to learn that the FDA has no reason to suppose that present conditions kre any different from what they have been for 50 years. Modern scientific methods have enabled us to learn more facts. but nothing indicates that there is any more mercury in tuna now than there was 10 or 50 years ago. We simply know now how to detect such substances. In short. recent announcements merely indicate the continuing concern of the industry and of the FDA that every conceivable safeguard will be taken. So that the facts may catch up with the fright. I submit for the RECORD the full text of remarks on this matter by Dr. Charles C. Edwards. M.D.. the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 4 days ago:",

Consumers are alarmed. fishermen are alarmed. the tuna processors are alarmed. and environmentalists are alarmed. \ufffd Yet. there is such a dearth of information on this topic that we do not really know how to react. First. we do not know how long mercury has been in the food we eat. Due to recent technical advances. we have been aware of the mercury content in our food for only a short period of time. Secondly. we do not know at what level the content of mercury is judged unsafe. We simply do not know the effect of mercury on the human body. Thirdly. we have not developed enough data to establish a mercury pollution control prograni. Mr. Speaker. tuna is one of our great sources of protein. and we know that it is available at an extremely reasonable price. In order to keep tuna in an abundant supply. and in order to put an end to the fears of consumers. I recommend five steps. First. I call upon the Food and Drug Administration to conduct more extensive tests on the mercury content of tuna and other deepsea fish. Second. I call upon the Public Health Service to establish the effects of mercury consumption on the human body. Third. I call upon the Environmental Protection Agency to recommend procedures for the future abatement of dumping mercury into our waters. Fourth. I call upon the tuna industry. itself. to establish tighter scrutiny of their product. Last. I call upon the Congress to enact measures such as H.R. 19278 which would prohibit the discharge of mercury into our waters. and to enact H.R. 18274. introduced by Congressman ASHLEY and cosponsored by myself.

I would like to record the nature of my objection to the program which resulted in my negative vote. I strongly support welfare reform. I feel that the present system not only visits many indignities upon the poor. but also fails to make available to them the incentives which make the rest of our system function effectively. *The food stamp program is an unnecessary part of our welfare system. It creates not only jurisdictional difficulties. but: also administrative problems of d duplicative nature which are unnecessary and tie up the poor in red tape. I prefer the concept of cash welfare and am convinced that the food stamps themselves will become the source of scandal and embarrassment to welfare administrators. Worse than this. the existence of the food stamp program works against achievement of welfare reform. The double phaseout necessary if both the family assistance plan and food stamp program are implemented means a higher marginal tax on welfare recipients who are being urged to work. and this reduces their incentive to work. The money we are spending on the food stamp program should. therefore. be added to the money we are willing to spend. on the family assistance plan. or such revisions of it as the Congress is willing to adopt. and the entire resulting figure should be dispensed efficiently in ordinary money. subject to such safeguards as may be necessary in dealing with the irresponsible elements among the poor. The entire program should be within the jurisdiction of one committee and one agency. \ufffd I believe many of my colleagues agree with me about the administrative nightmares we are creating here and I urge them to assume the burden of explaining a vote which may otherwise be politically interpreted as lacking in compassion.",

This news was very distressing to me and I am sure equally disturbing to all of us sitting in this Congress. It is appalling that we find the military spying on the countrys own citizens. We all have heard rumors that the telephones in our congressional offices may be tapped by the FBI. I do not know if this is true. but I -would not be surprised if it were the case. It is time that the Congress look into these matters. In fact. perhaps the House should consider having its own intelligence force to defend ourselves against those in the executive branch who would violate our privacy through phone taps and the preparation of dossiers. Last year I introduced a Federal privacy bill. H.R. 7214. that would instruct all Government agencies to notify persons of all records maintained on them. Furthermore. persons would be permitted. except in instances of national security. to inspect these records and add explanatory statements where they desire to do so. With the proliferation of interacting data banks and the masses of information being collected by Government agencies. it is imperative that we concurrently establish safeguards to protect the individuals right of privacy. The rdvelations of Senator SAM ERVIN underscore the need for a Federal privacy law. and so I have asked the distinguished chairman of the Government Operations Committee to hold -a hearing on my Federal privacy bill. I will be reintroducing this bill on the first day of the 92d Congress and I hope my colleagues will join in cosponsoring it with me.

I am personally convinced that the rationale behind the impact aid program is still a sound one and that the Federal Government has an obligation to assist those school districts which educate the children of Federal employees impacting those districts. Today I only want to point out the unique situation which exists in my congressional district. in which WrightPatterson Air Force Base is located. My congressional district has the most schools receiving impact aid in the State of Ohio and receives the most impact aid. That aid is for 13.000 \"B\" students and 162 \"A\" students. because WrightPatterson is not a \"residence\" base. The proposal of the Appropriations Committee would virtually annihilate the school districts surrounding WrightPatterson. The school districts in the Seventh Ohio District would lose nearly $2.5 million in aid. Although 162 students would be aided. 13.000 would be cut off. As a friend of the impact aid program. I am constantly reminded of the wealthy suburban Washington school districts and the irony of their Federal subsidies. It is unfortunate that the views of so many must be prejudiced by the location of these districts. The wealthy suburbs around Washington are not typical. Instead I would ask my colleagues to study the figures accompanying this statement which indicate the more typical Impacted schoola district with a higher than State average tax rate. a lower than State average tax valuation per pupil. and a lower than State average expenditure per pupil. While WrightPatterson is atypical among military installations in having little base housing. I feel that this economic picture of the average impacted school is more typical than the economic examples of impacted districts surrounding Washington. The schools in my district are already taxing themselves more heavily to accommodate the nearby military installation. a national burden. I do not think it fair to substantially increase the local burden for a national benefit. I am shocked by the degree and abruptness of the cutback which the impact request would force. Due to the virtual absence of \"A\" pupils. the Federal contribution to these schools would drop from 88 percent of entitlement last year to absolutely nothing. Two school districts receive more than 10 percent of their budget from impact aid. several more receive nearly 10 percent from the",

I know. rightly and patriotically concerned about our urgent legislative obligation to insure the most prudent Government spending of the taxpayers money and each Member must meet that obligation In accord with his own wisdom and conscience. For my own part I intend to support the proposal to increase funding appropriations for the educational programs and objectives outlined above. I intend to do so because I conscientiously believe such an investment in our American youth and in the future of this country is a profoundly wise and prudent investment that eminently merits inclusion among the very highest spending priorities to maintain. improve and expand our national integrity. progress. and leadership for world peace. I earnestly hope that every Member of the House will thoroughly and scrupulously examine the vital urgency and importance of the educational programs that will be presented to us very soon in H.R. 13111 and I further most earnestly hope the great majority will. in their wisdom. see fit to approve increased funding authoritatively held to be essential for their true effectiveness in the national interest.",

I have repeatedly said that it is patently ridiculous to attack inflation by taxing the private sector of our economy to remove dollars from circulation only to pump those same dollars back into the economy by continued deficit financing and wild Government spending in the public sector. I recently outlined the principal features of legislation which I proposed to introduce to correct this situation. It is quite simple. It sets aside the dollars removed from the private sector by surtax withholding. It prevents those dollars from being spent by the Government in the public sector. It encourages taxpayers savings by returning them to the very individuals from whom they were taken. at the same rate of interest paid by the Treasury for other shortterm loans. as soon as it is appropriate to terminate the emergency surtax. I have today introduced this measure. At the time I outlined my purpose. I predicted that we would have the surtax collection extension before us again. Today. it was. In view of the imbroglio in the other body it is my confident prediction that another short extension will not be our final action on surtax collection.

The acre increase would be from 8.000 to 12.000 acres and would be available only to privately owned farms which agree to plant their entire allotment in Durum wheat. Previous Congresses have recognized the special circumstances of the area and passed legislation to provide such wheat allotments on a temporary basis. This will make the allotments permanent and set the acreage at 12.000 acres. The committee report points out that this type of wheat is needed on the west coast and that the farms in the area are small and that most of the farm owners have a total income of less than $4.000 per year. The report also notes that the Department of Agriculture will save $16.300 in fiscal 1971. if the legislation passes. The Department of Agriculture opposes the bill because it gives favored treatment to a few producers. It points out that national production of Durum wheat is sufficient to meet both domestic and export requirements. My only regret about this bill.

There is much more yet to be done and I would hope that my bill to increase social security benefits by 50 percent would receive consideration by the Congress this year. Nevertheless. there are other actions we can take to ease the financial plight of our elderly who live on fixed incomes. while at the same time providing means by which these skilled and talented people can perform a vital service to the communities in which they live. I have today introduced a bill. the Senior Citizens Skill and Talent Utilization Act. which I believe will go a long way toward making better use of our senior citizens in communities all over our Nation. My bill would provide Federal grants to local community groups to employ senior citizens to perform community improvement projects. Those of us who have been actively working on behalf of senior citizens in the past have been amazed at the wealth of talent available. We have been equally amazed at how underutilized it is in so many communities. If by utilizing the talents of people whose skills have been sharpened. over decades of experience. we can at the same time lift these citizens above the poverty level. I see no reason why Congress should not act immediately. \"My bill proposes that Congress appropriate $50 million in fiscal 1971 to begin this program. and within 2 years. increase the level of funding to $125 million. I would hope by then that the benefits of this program. to the communities as well as to the senior citizen participants. would be so well documented that we could fund the program at a much higher rate. Mr. Speaker. we in Congress too many times have had to consider programs against something. My program is perhaps unique in that it is for something. It is an enrichment program for the young and for local communities. And at the same time it allows our older citizens to perform needed valuable services within their communities.

The unrealistic and impractical application of the standards. from the growers point of view. has resulted in an organization intent on obtaining Federal aid in the construction of migrant housing. Their position is that if the Government requires housing for migrants beyond the financial ability of the grower to provide. the Government should bear a part of the burden. Illustrative of the manner in which the standards are being applied is the reported case of a grower who just completed a new house for his family. but found that if the house had been built for migrants it would not pass inspectionthe windows were not properly spaced. In other cases. shower facilities which passed the requirements of distance from the dwellings at the time of construction now are declared too far away. There is a growing opinion that the Government seeks to discourage the use of migrant labor in the area. though such labor is presently essential to the harvesting of crops. A principal complaint of the growers is that they need to obtain Individually and annually the housing permit required before they can utilize the services of the U.S. Employment Service in obtaining essential farm labor. A year ago I was asked to come to their assistance and I arranged to have a Labor Department official. armed with authority. go into the area and there act upon individual applications.

N.C.. must -be recognized as a move toward reinstating responsibility in our judicial system. The decision will relieve the city of Charlotte from complying with a ridiculous court order until the judicial process has been completed. The city of Charlotte is faced with an order that. if enforced. will almost assuredly destroy its school system. The school board in that city has been ordered by a Federal judge to carry out a plan that would require the busing of more than 15.000 students daily in order to meet certain standards. The cost of compliance would be astronomical. The city of Charlotte simply cannot afford such a financial burden. The Charlotte situation is not unique. however. The same type of irresponsible decisions are facing many major cities across the Nation. The best known case is in Los Angeles. Calif.. where the courts have required the busing of more than 150.000 students per day and at a phenomenal cost. Under these orders. the neighborhood school concept is totally destroyed. and those who should benefit the most from our educational system suffer the most. those being the students. the young people who have to face the brunt of our problems. Yesterdays decision by the High Court is an indication that a more rational approach is being taken toward our school problems by our courts.

It is now time for the Congress to take action that will assure that no more of these ridiculous. irresponsible decisions are imposed by our lower courts.

House Resolution 862 provides an open rule with 1 hour of general debate for consideration of S. 2910 to amend Public Law 89260 to authorize additional funds for the Library of Congress James Madison Memorial Building. The law was enacted in 1965 authorizing the construction of the third Library of Congress Building on the federally owned property adjacent to the Cannon House Office Building. which would contain a suitable memorial hall honoring the fourth President of the United States for his many and brilliant achievements. The appropriation of $75 million was authorized for construction. including the preparation of necessary designs. plans. and specifications. In the legislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1970. the House and Senate approved an appropriation of $2.8 million for final plans and specifications contingent upon enactment of legislation adjusting the limit of cost of the project to reflect an accurate cost estimate plus any projected escalated construction costs required to complete the project. Thus. the purpose of this bill is to increase the authorization from $75 to $90 million. It should be noted that: the exact estimate of costs and the escalation in the estimate for the facility is due to the continuing rise in construction costs. the facility is to be a library building and is not intended for other use. the Library of Congress is presently paying close to $2 million annually for rental space scattered over the city and this cost would be eliminated when the Madison Memorial Library is completed.

So if we increase the authorization from $75 million to $90 million you can be assured that it will cost $90 million. or if we were to increase it to $100 million you can be sure that it would cost $100 million.

My constituents who work at the Library as well as employees from the District of Columbia and Virginia have a serious parking problem. It is very difficult to find a parking space. In addition inadequate parking contributes to the crime problem in that employees. both men and women. are often forced to walk a number of blocks between their cars and the Library often during hours of darkness. I. personally believe it imperative that plans for this extension of the library provide ample safe parking for the employees in order that they have the security and peace of mind which they deserve. I take the same position in voting for this rule on this as I did on the rule on the timber bill. Although I opposed the timber bill itself.

This is an increase of $15 million over the original figure which the Congress authorized in the first session of the 89th Congress. When the original legislation authorizing the Madison Memorial was passed. the crying need for additional space for the operation and use of the Library of Congress and its facilities was made quite obvious to the Committee on Public Works. This need has increased in the interval between the passage of that legislation and the bill now pending before this body today. S. 2910 would provide the additional funding that is needed to assure complete construction of the buling so that the Library of Congress can continue its great work in proper surroundings. Our Library of Congress is one of the great libraries of the world. It cannot be allowed to continue to operate in the manner it now does with its personnel and offices scattered throughout the Metropolitan Washington area. There is a definite need for this third Library of Congress building.

We need to understand that had the budget now before the Congress been submitted under the same budget guidelines that obtained under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. and under the first 3 years of the Johnson administration. the new budget. submitted last week. would show an estimated deficit for fiscal year 1971 of $7.3 billion. That blunt statement of fact will seem strange and perhaps incredible to people who have read the big headlines and who have not studied and understood the fine print. Let me follow my blunt statement of fact with a few other statements of fact. We talk about a balanced budget. but under the budget as submitted we will have to raise the debt ceiling by around $8 billion this year. We talk about a balanced budget. but we are being requested to provide new spending authority above what was provided last year by way of appropriations and other spending authority. in the net sum of $9 billion. The gross increase is several billions higher. but there are certain nonrecurring offsets. This is what the socalled unified budget shows. But even under the unified budget. which takes into account the various trust funds. during the 3year period ending with fiscal 1971. we are expecting to borrow from the trust funds. dedicated to social security and otherwise. about $19 billion in order to meet the regular expenditures of the Government. My plea is that we take account of this situation. We should also take account of this: The trend is in the wrong direction. Under the unified budget. which can be misleading. the budget surplus is going down. In fiscal 1970 it is now down from 1969. In fiscal 1971 it is down from 1970. All I am trying to do is to contribute to a better understanding of the precarious fiscal situation confronting the country.

The 87th Congress authorized the purchase of 64.546 acres of land for the park. and authorized $14.000.000 for this acquisition. At that time it was not expected that it would be necessary to acquire lands located within a \"pastoral zone\" as long as it was used for ranching and dairying purposes. Land values quickly increased and lands within the pastoral zones were threatened with subdivision. The 89th Congress responded with an additional authorization of $5.135.000 for land acquisition. Thus far some $17.037.073 has been expended on the purchase of some 28.776 acres and $2.097.927 is committed to the settlement of condemnation cases involving almost 400 acres. Land costs have continued to rise and the presently owned Federal lands are not contiguous. A substantial investment has been made at Point Reyes and the value of a completed park has increased with population expansion and other uses of available land in the general area. The bill authorizes the appropriation of an additional $38.365.000. bringing the total authorizations to $57.500.000 for the park. This figure is $5.000.000 above current National Park Service estimates. All funds will be made available from moneys credited to the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the Treasury. This use of the funds will not prejudice any presently planned land acquisition programs for other parks or recreation areas in fiscal 1970.

The News points out that Mr. Block accuses the United States of widening the Indochina war on the one hand and of faltering in the Mideast through its attempt to halt the arms race there. Neither Mr. Block nor anyone else can have it both ways. The Detroit News editorial follows: HERBLOCK LAYS Two CRACKED EoGS The Washington Posts popular but biting syndicated cartoonist. Herb Block. whose work appears in The News from time to time. really has laid a couple of cracked eggs In the cartoon accompanying this editorial. Herblock. as he signs his cartoons. long has been representative of liberal opinion which has been critical of President Nixon (and President Johnson) for U.S. efforts in Vietnam and Indochina. But in this cartoon Herblock not only equates the United States action in going into Cambodia with the Soviet action in sending pilots Into Egypt. which is bad enough. but he then contends the Soviet move stemmed from \"U.S. faltering in Middle East.\" It is curious that liberals such as Herblock cannot see that the same forces which endanger the independence of a small independent nation. Israel. in the Middle East are also endangering the Independence of small independent nations.-Vietnam. Laos and Cambodiain Indochina. Yet in the one case the U.S. action in widening the Indochina war Is criticized as \"U.S. overinvolvement\" while In the other the U.S. action n trying to maintain a balance in the Middle East is regarded as evidence of \"U.S. faltering.\" Herblock. in other words. joins the New Left in holding the United States responsible for most of the troubles in these two parts of the world and conveniently ignores the common Communist threat to the independence of small nations in Southeast Asia and in the Middle East.",

After viewing acres of defoliated forests and visiting many ruined rubber plantations. these scientists are very concerned about the severe ecological damage that has resulted from the extensive use of chemicals in Vietnam. In addition. they point out that chemical defoliants are -not the only source of environmental 0iamage. Huge craters. the results of thousands of bombing missions. scar the landscape. making farming difficult and providing breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Shrapnel from artillery fire embedded in trees is bringing the countrys lumber industry to a grinding halt.

I find this suggestion most enlightening. Today. I addressed a letter to the President. urging that. along with this administrations recent and very constructive step of restricting the use of 2.4.5T. he establish a Vietnam Ecology Commission consisting of prominent American and Vietnamese scientists.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Polish Constitution of May 3. 1791. is a very important document. Its adoption and promulgation marked a turning point in Polands Central Government. and the date has become a Polish holiday. The Polish people had the misfortune of losing a good part of their country late in the 1770s to their greedy neighbors. Certain Polish leaders felt that if they had a strong central government. capable of uniting all elements in the country and strengthening its fighting capacity. future calamities could be avoided. They were thoroughly dissatisfied with their absolutist. monarchical form of government. The King had too much power. and was incapable of using it effectively because of certain crippling defects in the old Dietlegislative assembly. The discontent was widespread among liberal leaders and also among the mass of the people. These liberal. democratic and patriotic leaders took upon themselves the task of drawing up a constitution which would improve. if not revolutionize. the Government of Poland. The result was the Constitution of May 3. 1791. This Constitution drastically reduced the arbitrary powers of the King. and made Poland a constitutional monarchy. Heretofore the King could exercise his authority only through a council. The powers of the upper chamber were curtailed and those of the popularly elected lower chamber were strengthened. The peasantry was freed from its bondage and placed under the protection of the law. Religious toleration was assured to all citizens. and freedom of speech was guaranteed. These features made the Constitution a democratic instrument. and represented a great forward advance in popularizing the Government. It was hailed as such throughout the country. and even many liberal leaders abroad praised the Polish leaders. On the 178th anniversary celebration of the Polish Constitution Day one can hardly overlook the 29th anniversary of the Katyn Forest massacre of many thousand Polish officers by their heartless captors early in the last war. Lastly. I would also like to stress the fact that over 1.000 years ago. in the year 966. Poles adopted Christianity as their faith and founded the most powerful Christian power in Eastern Europe. In taking note of all these occasions. I gladly join all friends of Poland and of freedom.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am proud to join my colleagues in commemorating the 178th anniversary of Polish Constitution Day. to be celebrated on Saturday. May 3. It was on May 3. 1791. that the Polish people. who had been so anxious to put into effect the ideological concepts which had taken root in their minds. illuminated all Warsaw to celebrate the bloodless revolution and usher in the birth of their Constitution. That day should have marked their first step toward constitutional democracy. but history was not to be so kind. This Constitution. born without murder or violence. this ideal for the future. would not forestall the tragic partition by the Russians. Prussians. and Austrians. These invaders robbed Poland of her hope to raise herself to an independent and secure condition but they could not diminish the historical importance of that great Constitution. May 3 still continues to be acclaimed as a day of celebratibn. joy. and remembrance for Poles around the world. The quest for liberty which sparked the Constitution has endured down through the ages and we in America will not forget their fortitude. For their gallantry and stubborn belief in the dignity of man. we pause here today to pay tribute to these courageous people of Poland. Though dominated by Communist rule. the Polish people have never lost that spirit which founded their Constitution of 1791. Let us then serve as a reminder that the American people have not forgotten the plight of the people behind the Iron Curtain. All Americans join in the hope that the people of Poland will yet realize the attainment of the ideals and spirit of their May 3 Constitution.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the proudest days of the year for citizens of democratic nations is the anniversary of their countrys constitution. In the United States we observe July 4 as Independence Day. commemorating the declaration which gave us our freedom. Similarly. one of the brightest events in Polish history was the adoption of the May 3 Constitution of 1791. While their historic homeland is now under ruthless suppression by Communist tyranny. free Poles throughout the world still recognize May 3 as a time for remembering and honoring this proud event. To some 10 million Americans of Polish ancestry. the day is a reminder of the cultural links between this Nation and the free Poland that existed prior to the outbreak of World War II. Since then. Polands valiant struggle against NaziCommunist totalitarianism has become an inspiration for mankind. and May 3 is observed in both Houses of our Congress in commemoration of the struggles of these people for their liberty. This years observance coincides with other significant dates of Polish historythe 30th anniversary of the GermanSoviet attack on Poland. and the 25th anniversaries of the Battle of Monte Cassino. of the Warsaw uprising. and of the founding of the Polish American Congress. I take pride in saluting all Americans of Polish ancestry. and their countrymen who still believe in the cause of freedom. The world must never forget the horror of barbarism which caused a free Poland to be eliminated from existence. except in the memories and ideals of those loyal citizens who have steadfastly refused to accept totalitarianism. On this occasion I pay homage to the Polish Americans whose country has suffered so much through history. and express the hope that ultimately the cause of justice will be restored to their homeland.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced legislation to provide tax relief to apartment dwellers. I believe that this legislation will bring equity to a group that has long been at an unfair tax disadvantage. In these days of apartment shortages and soaring rents. it is vital that we turn our efforts to finding means to help the rent payer. I know of no more justified and simple way of giving at least some assistance than this tax relief measure. My bill would permit the tenant a deduction on his income tax for the percentage of his rent which the landlord uses to pay taxes and mortgage interest charges on the building. The owners of apartment dwellings are permitted to deduct property taxes on the building as well as mortgage interest payments while the tenant must pay the full amount of his rent including the portion the landlord deducts. This arbitrary discrimination clearly puts the apartment dweller at a disadvantage. Since the apartment dweller contributes toward the owners property taxes and mortgage interests as a hidden cost included in the rent charge. he should. in all fairness. be allowed a reasonable deduction for that payment. I. therefore. urge. Mr. Speaker. that this legislation be given prompt consideration by this House.",

These grants have been used to recruit and organize the discontented Negroes of Washington to enforce the impossible demands of the Black Student Union. This \"New Thing Art\" headed by Colin \"Topper\" Carew was given a lameduck grant of $25.000 by the Roger Stevens National Council on the Arts on January 10 of this year. Despite Carews emotional pretense of advancing minority art. at a recent student rally he bragged that as head of the art group he had organized the mob to enforce with destruction demands of the Black Student Union. Carew is already seeking more taxpayers funds to continue his revolutionary buildup. In his latest appeal he was accompanied by Charles Cassell. an architect on the Federal payroll. who also happens to head up the Black United Front.

The bill has as its objective the advancement of scientific research and information services by giving statutory authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to accept gifts for the National Agriculture Library. This Library has over 1 million volumes. and comprises the worlds largest collection of printed material on the agricultural sciences. In its new building in Beltsville. Md.. the Library provides scholars with opportunities for study. and has also attracted the attention of potential donors of valuable collections of primary. as well as secondary. source material. For example. the Library has been offered the worlds largest and most complete collection of historical literature and related material on American poultry. The National Agricultural Library does not enjoy statutory authority to accept gifts. as does the Library of Congress. the National Library of Medicine. and some other Federal libraries. The Office of the General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that such statutory authority is needed in view of decisions of the Comptroller General concerning the need for specific statutory authority in order to accept gifts and to assure clear title. free of any possible future litigation. for gifts that the Library might accept. At present. the Library is forced to consider with uncertainty. not only gifts that are being offered. but a program of soliciting gifts that would add immeasurably to the stature of the Library and its services. My longstanding interest in and support for libraries is well known to most of my colleagues.

There is far too much senseless violence of all kinds in this country. but bombings of police and fire stations and the killing of police officers is especially dangerous to the safety of the republicfor the same reason that violations committed by those entrusted with enforcing the law presents special dangers. When those charged with protecting the public against violence become either its victims or its perpetrators. momentum is added to the terrible spiral that threatens the freedom and security of all of us. individually and as a Nation. It is now clear that in some communities police have become the special targets of violence directed against them in the performance of their duties as police. and so we must take whatever steps are necessary to protect them in the performance of those duties. As I have remarked here before. a free society owes a special debt to those of its citizens who risk themselves to fight fire and crime. They are often underpaid. and their daily heroism often goes unrecognized. Americans have been particularly fortunate in the overall quality of our police and firemen. who have earned our gratitude across the continent and across the centuries. It is therefore very wrong in principle. as well as very dangerous for the Nation. when those who undertake to protect everyone else have less than the best possible protection in carrying out their public duties.

I fear there are some in Congress who may take Mr. Fiebigs suggestion seriously. If you think the public is outraged over the \"AntiAssassination Act of 1968.\" wait until the \"ban the tube bill of 1969\" is introduced.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Gun Control Act of 1968. which was passed only after lengthy hearings and careful consideration by the respective committees in both Houses of Congress. and after full and deliberate debate on the floor of each House. is now in serious danger of having one of its most important provisions eroded by capricious action of the Senate Finance Committee. On September 24. the Senate reported out the Housepassed Interest Equalization Tax Extension Act of 1969. with a nongermane amendment that would dismantle the ammunition control provisions of the gun control law. It is undeniable that the Gun Control Act was sorely needed as an effective law enforcement tool which would go a long way in assisting local law enforcement authorities in coping with crime problems in their own localities. Crime conditions in the country today have certainly not lessened the need for this law. Just 2 months ago. an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. in testimony before the Juvenile Delinquency Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. stated that in the Treasury Departments view: The Gun Control Act of 1968 is working reasonably well and is providing the needed support for state and local controls for which it was designed. He further suggested to the subcommittee thatthe controls be given a full opportunity to prove their worth. Yet. not a single day of public hearings was held in the Senate committee on the unrelated amendment to the bill. It would seem that in a matter of such seriousnessone that would deny the enforcement of the band on ammunition sales to minors. convicted criminals. dope addicts. alcoholics. the mentally ill and other such categoriesthe committee would have at least opened the amendment to hearings. In a recent editorial. the Los Angeles Times frankly appraises the Senate committee action. I share the Times viewpoint. and ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed at this point in the RECORD. I commend it to the attention of my colleagues.",

As I stood on the reviewing stand watching the parade. my eyes gazed across the street to historic Independence Hall and my mind wandered to thoughts of the great contributions which Polish citizens have made to our American heritage. This year marks the 190th anniversary of the death of Brig. Gen. Casimir Pulaski---one of the great heroes of our fight for independence. General Pulaski died of wounds received at the Battle of Savannah and his devotion to the principles of freedom has served as a rallying point and source of pride for all Americans not only those 10 million citizens of Polish descent but freedomloving people everywhere. On Pulaski Day we honor the heroes of the Warsaw uprising and the successful soldiers who fought at Monte Casino 25 years ago. Perhaps the most important thought which I had as I watched the parade. and one which I am sure was shared by all in attendance and Americans throughout the city and the Nation. was one of support and good will for the people of Poland who remain oppressed but have never lost the dream of freedom. Judging from the turnout at the parade and the spirit of the participants. I am confident that the people of Poland will know that they are not alone in their desire for a free Poland and I hope that their determination will be reinforced through our expressions of sympathy and support.",

The reason is simplethe girl. Linda Marlene Jones. is black.

The Southern Maryland Dental Society pointed out that there are no laws on the books regarding the right of dentists to choose their patients for whatever reason.

Passage of H.R. 14030. transfer of peanut acreage allotments. is therefore of vital concern to the peanut growers of North Carolina and especialy in my congessional district. This bill is simply a 1year extension of an act which passed 2 years ago by a vote of 256 to 57. In the past 2 years the act has proved highly beneficial in allowing the consolidation of small allotments into larger and more economical groupings. Under the act producers have been able to acquire enough peanut acreage to grow this important crop on a sounder economic basis. It has benefited both the lessee and lessor of peanut allotments. Most peanut growers are very small producers. Some grow nothing else of any consequence. Peanuts are their only source of livelihood. The act has enabled those peanut growers who wanted to go out of peanut production to do so. yet to retain some benefit. Thus. all sides have been able to have opportunity for profit. however small. The act has put peanut production into the hands of those who want to grow peanuts. yet at the same time has prevented allotments from leaving the county of origin.

H.R. 14195 would preclude similar contests. I am concerned about the failure of this bill to protect one who is a candidate but who is unable to obtain a position on the ballot because of discriminatory action of State officials. In the 1965 Mississippi contested election case. I believe that three of the contestants had attempted to become independent candidates on the ballot in the State of Mississippi. They obtained the required number of signatures. but were denied a place on the ballot through discriminatory rulings. They were Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer. Mrs. Annie Devine. and Mrs. Victoria Gray. The bill before us makes it very clear that the term \"candidate\" means an individual whose name is printed on the official ballot or one whose name is not printed on the official ballot but who is a writein candidate in a State where writein voting is permitted.

The case in which that rule was announced is before the Supreme Court. If that \"rule of reasonableness\" is adopted. it could be the answer to this problem. We find the Justices on vacation until October. and schools opening all over the country. Some schools are opening in Alabama today. and others are opening next week. some already having opened. The Supreme Court has it within its power to announce rules of law that would help clear up and clean up the mess and confusion that have been caused in the public schools of the South by their own decisions and their failure to clarify those decisions. Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life. I might say parenthetically that I believe the district court judges ought to be elected. The courts of appeals judges ought to be appointed for stated terms. The Justices receive compensation of $60.000 per year. They are able to retire at $60.000 per year after not having paid 1 cent into any retirement fund. Yet. they take each year a 3month vacation.

An editorial in the highly respected Mobile Register makes the point better than I can. The editorial expresses the judgment that: HEWs \"plan\" for the public school system of Mobile County is in reality a formula for the destruction of the system of public education In this county. It is a brutal bureaucratic atrocity of which no responsible agency of government would be guilty. For the first time in American history. an Instrumentality of government in Washington. D.C.. has gone so stark wild that it openly calls for violation of federal law to destroy a public school system. Its ruthless. reckless. destructive. lawdefying scheme would virtually reduce the system of public education in this county to a daily clutter of pupilhauling buses operated as one segment of the bankruptcyproducing expenditures to which the school system would be subjected as an inevitable necessity to compliance. What travesty. what mockery. what hypocrisy. what outrage perpetrated against the public intelligence ... (by the action of) HEW.

In an article entitled \"The Sheer Hell of the Internal Revenue Code.\" published in the August 1970 issue of the American Bar Association Journal. Mr. Allen D. Choka examines in some detail his view of the code. He points out that for a retired person to take advantage of a $228.60-$457.20 for a coupletax credit. the taxpayer must fill inor consider46 entries on schedule R of form 1040. Mr. Choka notes that some sentences in the code run as high as 506 words. Sentences of 150 to 200 words are commonplace. The language of the code is couched in painful legalese. Definitions refer to other definitions rather than substantive explanation. Mr. Choka concludes his article with a suggestion for rewriting one section of the code to make it understandable. Mr. President. it adds insult to injury to require American taxpayers to be bookkeepers and then provide them with a set of rules too complex to follow. If experts shudder at the code. how must the average taxpayer feel? I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Chokas excellent article be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Canadian Record for August 13. 1970. contains a well written and timely editorial which challenged the Postal Services claim that the elimination of canceling mail in small cities and towns will insure more efficiency in mail service. As the editor. Mr. Ben Ezzell. so correctly points out: Channeling increasing loads of mall into the sectional centers has been the biggest boondoggle ever devised by a government bureau which has been known for some whoppers. When the sectional centers are unable to handle. efficiently and speedily. the volume of mail which is already being unnecessarily channeled through them. increasing the volume obviously Isnt going to improve the situation. Mr. President. throughout my State. small cities and towns are losing their identity through elimination of their August 2.6. 1970 postmarks. and the citizens of these communities are being subjected to outrageous and ridiculous delays in service. For example. in Tulia. Tex.. a town of over 6.000 people. a letter intended for intown delivery. was mailed at the local post office. taken on a 150mile journey. and finally placed in the post office box of the person to whom the letter was addressed in the same post office 3 days after it was mailed. On first consideration. situations such as this might seem humorous if not so widespread. however. on closer examination. this type of inefficiency shows a callous indifference to the needs of those citizens of our country who reside in the rural areas. This administration. by allowing such practices as this to continue. is expressing its disinterest in the problems and interests of these Americans and its intention to treat them as secondclass citizens. Mr. President. I do not believe that the people of America will tolerate this inefficiency much longer. Therefore. I submit that it is the duty of every Member of Congress to make every effort possible to insure that rural America receives prompt and efficient postal service. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial. entitled \"Less Efficiency. Please.\" be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today is the 50th anniversary of the 19th amendment to the Constitution granting equal suffrage to women. We in Wyoming are particularly proud to recognize this accomplishment because Wyoming led the Nation. and indeed the world. when it granted equal suffrage to women in 1869. at the time the Wyoming Territory was organized. In 1890. Wyoming became the first State to give women equal voting rights. The women of Wyoming enjoyed equal voting rights a full 51 years before these rights were included in the Constitution of the United States. In 1924. Nellie Tayloe Ross was elected Governor of Wyoming and became the first woman Governor in the country. She then served three Presidents as Director of the U.S. Mint. and to this day is vitally interested in the affairs of her State and Nation. Since 1890. women have served in every elected State office and as Speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives. In this day. when many of us advocate lowering the voting age below 21. there is a tendency by some to believe that Federal legislation should set a standard of 18. implying that at the Federal level there exists some great power which makes the Federal Government all knowing in determining the proper voting age. I believe it is appropriate to note at this time that if the women of Wyoming had to wait for Congress and the Nation to wake up and act on womens suffrage. they would not have enjoyed the onehalf century of equal rights granted to them by Wyoming. There is much to be said for the system that has permitted the States the flexibility to take progressive steps to expand the voting franchise. and the benefits we have received from that flexibility are the strongest argument for refusing to preempt State responsibility by Federal statute and applying any change nationally by means of an amendment to the Federal Constitution. As Governor of Wyoming. I called for the adoption of an amendment authorizing voting by 18yearolds. This year the State of Wyoming is again in the front ranks and is voting on an amendment to the State Constitution to lower the voting age in Wyoming to 19. I am confident that such action by the State of Wyoming will be as rewarding as that of granting equal suffrage to women.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today is the 50th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th amendment to the Constitution. It is the amendment which gave women the right to vote. It is a good time to pause and actually reflect on how much equality women have today. Women comprise more than half of the countrys population but are still treated as secondclass citizens in many important ways. This morning the Washington Post published an article entitled \"A HalfCentury of Suffrage for Women\" which pointed up many of the inequalities which still exist. The Post story points out for example that: On the average. a woman with a college degree earns little more than a man with an eighthgrade education. Women constitute only 9% of all professions. 7% of the doctors. 3% of lawyers. and 1% of the engineers. Average starting salaries are lower for women in these fields than for males. Almost all the elementary school teachers are womenbut almost all the elementary school principals are male. The vote for women did not bring equality. Today is not a time to look back. but to look ahead toward eliminating inequalities which still exist. While women do have the vote. it is revealing that. according to Gallup. only 66 women have been elected or appointed to the House and 10 to the Senate. The current Congress has 11 female Members. 10 in the House and one in the Senate. Full political rights for women include equal opportunity to seek elective office. One of the most important steps which the Senate can take to guarantee women of all nations equal political rights is to ratify the convention on political rights for women. Action on this treaty is long overdue. If we are really sincere in our desire to guarantee women equal rights. then the time has come to take action on this treaty. Words will not satisfy the women demanding their rights. They want to see concrete action. Ratification of the Political Rights for Women Convention is one important way in which the Senate could demonstrate to American women that it is really interested in their cause.",

Even with a use of $100 million for needy schoolchildren. there will still be enough section 32 funds available with which to acquire surplus commodities of all kinds from American farmers. Mr. Speaker. one of the problems of the past has been that there have not been sufficient programs to utilize surplus foods after they have been acquired.

So. Mr. Speaker. if anyone is concerned that there might not be enough section 32 funds to purchase commodities such as the citrus fruit. turkey. pork. or any other commodities. you can rest assured that the $500 million authorization which is law would permit a supplemental appropriation later on if needed. This bill will make certain that there will be an availability of an additional $100 million for the use of needy children in the school lunch program.

Section 32 of the act of August 24. 19357 U.S.C. 612Crevenues are derived from imports of foreign agricultural products and are returned annually to the Treasury. Since 1959. approximately $1 billion has reverted to the Treasury from section 32 funds. The House of Representatives recognized the opportunity to utilize these funds in a meaningful fashion when we approved last year a measure quite similar to that which we are considering here today. Although no further action was taken on that measure by the Senate. enough support was engendered for the bills provisions that $45 million was appropriated by Congress to meet the nutritional requirements of disadvantaged children. The Committee on Education and Labor held extensive hearings on food service programs in an effort to cover thoroughly all aspects of food distribution. particularly the roles played by all levels of government in the administration of assistance programs for needy persons. During these hearings some startling facts were revealed with respect to the continuing lack of coverage by our food assistance programs. The committee report discloses the following facts: First. More than 41/2 million needy children. ages 5 through 17. are not receiving free or reduced price lunches. Second. More than 6.600 schools in economically needy areas are without food services. Third. Almost 3.000.000 economically deprived children. ages 5 through 17. in need of a school breakfast do not have access to such a program. . Fourth. As many as threequarters of a million children coming from large families whose incomes are in excess of $3.000 per annum are estimated to need subsidized school food services. Considerable attention has been given in recent months to the problems of malnutrition and some valuable recommendations have been proposed for effectively feeding the hungry. This discussion is most helpful toward establishing a meaningful nutritional assistance program for the economically deprived. However. it must be remembered that passage of H.R. 11651 by Congress will not obviate the need for a comprehensive and workable program for feeding the poor. The legislation we are considering today is desperately needed. It demands our unqualified support.",

At the time of our conference. the subcommittees conference. I think It was the chairmans proposal. to satisfy those who felt that the proper study for restoration had not been made. that there was a middle way. a center ground. and that was to proceed with. as it turned out. $1.750.000 for plans and specifications for the extension. pursuant to the authorization. but then to set aside $250.000 for a study and plans for the restoration. At that time I raised some objection. It seemed to me that the tworoad course was not the most feasible thing to do. To have $1.750.000 expended during the next fiscal year for plans and specifications in one direction and to go with $250.000 in another direction seemed to cause great doubt and disturbance on my part. The subcommittee reported an authorization for extension and sent it to the full committee. Even greater responsibilities on my part at that time prevented me from remaining in the full committee that morning. and I found. by the report and by my conversations with the chairman. that the dualroad concept had been accepted. I still find it extremely difficult to acceptto go both ways at the same time. If the $250.000 study turns out to be correct. the $1.750.000 is wasted. If the original authorization of $1.750.000 turns out to be the correct way to go. wve have wasted $250.G00. Frankly. I think there is still doubt in the subcommittee and in the Appropriations Committee to accept the dualroad concept and that we had better halt here and find some way to find the single road to joy and to find a route of more rationality.

Mr. Dole makes the point: Minerals shortages could well become a social problem of the future. Secretary Dole also points up the need for a national minerals policy in his speech. Mr. President. the distinguished chairman of the Minerals. Materials and Fuels Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (Mr. Moss) has scheduled hearings on my bill.

I am hopeful that these upcoming hearings will help to delineate some of the serious problems facing the minerals industry in this country. and I believe that the enactment of S. 719 will provide us with a mechanism with which we can deal with these problems in a realistic and intelligent manner.

The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act created a highly desirable hospital and medical insurance protection program. However. during the creation of this program the Congress made a miscalculation. It is now time to correct that miscalculation. Today I have introduced legislation intended to modernize the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. The bill. when enacted. will ease the burden now hanging heavily on the civil servant. and it will rectify the miscalculation of 1959. When the program was originally being developed. an important consideration was the belief that many Federal employees could not afford an expensive health plan. Hence. the act provided that two levels of benefits should be offered by the Civil Service Commission. The two levels have become known as the high option and the low option. By paying the difference between the cost of low option and high option an employee could secure the increased protection of the more expensive plan. The assumption made in 1959 was that the majority of employees would choose the low option plan. This assumption has proved false. and today 90 percent of the employees have chosen to purchase the extra protection of the high option plan. Consequently. the presumption that the Government would pay 50 percent of the cost of insurancethe intent of the 1959 act--has also proved incorrect. Statistics provided by the Civil Service Commission indicate that in the leading Governmentsupported plansBlue CrossBlue Shield and Aetna plansemployees have in the last 2 years contributed 70.6 percent of the cost. while the Government has contributed only 29.3 percent.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I have introduced a bill to amend the Packers and Stockyards Act. The revisions that I have suggested are not all inclusive and they deal primarily with the problem of assuring the producer payment for his livestock that he sells through packers. In order to provide this payment assurance. it is necessary that the definition of packers be expanded in order to update the present method of handling or purveying meat. The basic act of 1921 needs to be amended in this respect. Formerly. most of our livestock went through public stockyards channels and eventually were sold to packers through selling agents that were licensed to operate in the public yards. Certain qualifications must be met by these commission firms in order to engage in this highly professional duty of exposing the livestock for sale. and getting the most dollars for the producer. Today. much of our livestock goes directly Into packers hands. thus bypassing the safety standards that are provided by practice and law at the public stockyards. Estimates are that up to 50 percent of the livestock used by packers is now purchased direct from feedlots or from farmers. While the instances or purchases by insolvent meatpackers are not common. still they are frequent enough that certain precautions should be provided to livestock producers of receiving their money for the sale of the livestock. The bill of necessity makes other minor changes in the 1921 act in order to bring in a more complete assortment of resources to producers. I urge your study and comment on this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the Remote Area Medical Facilities Act of 1969. This legislation takes two steps toward making more effective and more economical use of scarce medical resources and personnel. First. it will authorize the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to make remote Indian medical facilities available to nonIndians under certain conditions. Second. it will allow private physicians to treat nonIndians in remote area hospitals. Part 1 of this plan has already been adopted in my home State of Alaska pursuant to 48 U.S.C. 49. and has proven successful. There. the State has designated certain areas as \"remote\" with respect to health services. and in these areas the Public Health Service hospitals provide services to nonbeneficiaries on a reimbursable basis. This act will extend the Alaska program to remote areas in other parts of the country. Part 2. which allows private physicians to treat nonIndians in Indian hospitals is not in effect in Alaska. but is a measure which the Public Health Service has been requesting for years. Both the needs of the Indian peoples and the need to make the most efficient and economical use of scarce medical resources are taken Into account under the procedure in both parts of the proposal. The consent of the major tribes served by the facility must be obtained. and first priority will be given to the needs of the Indian peoples. Control of the hospitals will remain in the hands of the Division of Indian Health. In short. the measure insures that the primary mission of the hospitals will remain. the quality medical care of the Indian community. In addition. however. the act will provide for full use of facilities by allowing nonIndians to utilize hospitals on a \"space available\" basis. Consequently. pockets of deprivationlike that near Owyhee. Nev.. Indian hospital where nonIndians must travel 90 miles to the nearest hospital that will admit themwill be eliminated. The HEW Secretary will establish rates to be charged nonIndians which will reflect the reasonable cost of their CXV1194--Part 14",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. for more than 9 years now I have been deeply concerned over the outflow of U.S. dollars and the reaction by an economically conscious Nation to this. I have been particularly concerned with what some of my colleagues refer to as the fortress America concept. Nothing could be more dangerous to our economic wellbeing than for us to limit our business opportunities to the continental United States. We must do everything possible to facilitate the free flow of goods if we are ever to overcome the balanceofpayments deficit. Because of my concern in this area. I was particularly pleased to learn of the agreement between Pan American World Airways and Avions Marcel Dassault of France further expanding Pan Ams fan jet Falcon program to include construction of a smaller. four- to sevenpassenger business jet to be delivered in 1972. Some 175 Falcons are in service today in North and South America and in a number of countries In the Middle and Far East. Many of these fan jets are being used by American businessmen abroad to develop export markets for American goods. In fact during 1968 more fan Jet Falcons were delivered to corporate owners than any other business jet aircraft. This latest in a series of expansions dating back to 1965 is an outstanding example of industrial cooperation between major French and American companies. It is significant that this effort continued despite periods of extreme friction between our two countries. What is even more significant from my vantage point as a member of the Banking and Currency Committee is that total sales of the fan Jet Falcon in 1968 amounted to $41.967.000. The contemplated acquisition of 40 of these new jets. with options for 120. comes on the heels of record sales of the current fan jet Falcon plus increasing demands of the business aircraft market. This latest expansion of the fan jet Falcon program is expected to make even greater contributions to the commercial and technical success of this international effort but above all it makes a healthy contribution to keeping our foreign trade efforts strong. I have every confidence that we will continue to make economic progress. keeping our dollar strong throughout the world. and congratulate Pan American and Avions Marcel Dassault of Paris in their bold undertaking.",

With dedication to every assignment. CHUCK JOELSON has climbed the ladder rung by rung that leads ever upward to greater service to his fellow man. A product of Paterson public schools and Montclair Academy. the gentleman from the Eighth District reflected great credit upon his schools and his teachers by winning election at Cornell University to Phi Beta Kappa. the national scholastic honorary society. in his junior year and graduating with a B.A. degree. followed by an LL.B. from Cornell Law School. Enlisting in the U.S. Navy in January 1943. and serving as an ensign in the Far Eastern branch of the Office of Naval Intelligence. our colleague displayed an uncommon linguistic ability. He mastered the Japanese language. and was assigned to Japanese language duties in Pearl Harbor. Hawaii. Appointed city counsel of Paterson in charge of all legal affairs of that municipality. CHUCK JOELSON in 1949 was the youngest city counsel in the citys history. In 1955. he was named deputy attorney general by the Governor of New Jersey. and in this capacity served 2 and a half years in charge of the Passaic County prosecutors office. In 1957 he was promoted to chief of the criminal investigation section for the entire State of New Jersey. With such an outstanding background in public service. it is not surprising that our colleague was elected for five successive terms to the House. As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor. he was assigned to a special subcommittee which recommended the Manpower Training and Development Act. which was signed into law by President John F.

N.J.. who will be leaving us soon to take his seat upon the superior court bench of New Jersey. Knowing CHUCK as I do. I know that he will bring that same singleminded power of concentration. that same incisive intelligence to his new position that he brought to his duties in the House for the the past 8 years. I have come to admire that intelligence. idealism. and persistence. and I know that I shall miss them after he goes. This new honorfor a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court is indeed an honorcomes as no surprise to those of us who know CHUCKS abilities. He has distinguished himself as a committed member of the House Appropriations Committee. and most recently as 1 he author of the now famous Joelson amendment. by means of which we were able to remedy severe cutbacks demanded by the administration in the LaborHEW appropriations. Perhaps a few words about that amendment. since it is fresh in our memories. will serve to illustrate the ability and determination of the man. All during the time of the consideration of the administration LaborHEW budget request. all of us were besieged with letters urging our action to increase the requested appropriation so that vital domestic programs in manpower. library services. health services. vocational and higher education. could continue. But the House Appropriations Committee was subject to double pressures. since they were well aware of the administrations interest in holding down domestic spending. Congressman JOELSON. with the support of his Democratic colleagues on that committee and in the House. introduced substantial amendments to the appropriations bill. and worked energetically to assure passage of those amendments. In all honesty. we can attribute the continued viability of many of our domestic programs to his energy. his determination. his farsightedness. and his commitment to a better America. So I congratulate the State of New Jersey in having appointed a superior court judge who has amply demonstrated his commitment to what he sees as right and necessary. and his energy and intelligence in arriving at those ideals.

To protect Americas wilderness areas. we need a new kind of commitment to conquest. We need to conquer our insatiable American appetite to bend. fold. and mutilate every conceivable natural resource for the transitory satiation of a physical or material desire. Who would put a price tag on the stillness of a forest? What is the economic demand for the feel of a forest breeze? Who will give us a cost analysis of the sun streaming through the trees at dawn? Who dares to quantify the sights. smells. and sounds of the wilderness? Poets and artists have perhaps captured the essence of this natural American heritage but it is up to the Congress to make sure that that which has been glorified in art and literature is not physically lost or destroyed. One may say that the person who challenges nature on its own terms is merely acting but one more characteristic chapter in the American psychological and physical struggle to best the elements. but my own view is that he is seeking something more profound. and that is. an appreciation of the wonders of the land beheld without benefit of contrivance or convenience. Perhaps it is a seeking for a spiritual renewal. certainly. there is a need for such renewal. Consider for yourself the difference between seeing a doe dart away from a busy highway in our national parks and walking upon a doe drinking from a stream in the depths of a forest where the only sound is that made by the rustle of underbrush against your legs.

When Congress passed the Older Americans Act in 1965. its intention was to establish a Federal agency that would concern itself. not just with the problems of the elderly. but also with their opportunities to live productive and satisfying lives. The Administration on Aging has. during its first 31/2 years. attempted to fulfill the congressional mandate. but of course it first had to build a foundation from which to work. Naturally. there had to be experimentation. Naturally. there had to be some false starts andin some casesno starts at all because of limited funds or other difficulties. But. despite difficulties and the need for more adequate funding. the Administration on Aging has pioneered. it has shown what can be done and it has provided us with a wealth of experience and concrete results from individual programs and research projects. For all these reasons. the Older Americans Act must be extended and it must be improved. The bill before the Senate today would do both. and it would also add an important program to enlist the elderly in service programs as volunteers. This innovative addition. together with the technical changes in administrative procedures. make this worthwhile and muchneeded legislation.

I realize that this amendment may be hailed in the press and elsewhere. as an amendment which would do away with seniority. Of course. it would not. even if it were adopted because seniority is observed in many ways other than in the selection of the chairman of a committee. For instance. where Senators sit in this Chamber has been determined on the basis of seniority. The location of our offices in the office building has been determined on the basis of seniority. There are other matters which are resolved now on a seniority basis. If we should conclude that it would be desirable to do away with seniority as the basis for selecting the chairman of a committee. I am not at all sure that the method selected by the Senator from Oregon is the best one. There is a good case to be made that. in order to reinforce party strength and discipline. it would be well to have the majority leader designate the chairman of each committee and the minority to designate the ranking member of each committee. Another method which I would favor over the proposal set forth in this amendment would be to have committee chairmen elected by all the members of the majority party. while ranking committee members are elected by all the minority members. I would call the attention of the Senate to the fact that on the other side of the Capitol. House Republicans have a task force charged with the responsibility of recommending appropriate changes in the seniority system. I understand it is more than just another study committee. it is actually making headway toward sensible and reasonable reforms in the seniority system. I believe it would be appropriate now for the Senate to move in that way.",

The hypothetical situation he outlined has come to pass. The Soviet Union is proceeding with the deployment of the SS9. No one takes any pleasure from this grim fact.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in recent weeks there has emerged out of the seemingly endless technical dispute over Safeguard. an argument that the New York Times has referred to as \"the principal technical argument of the ABM opposition.\" The argument I have in mind is one that many Senators will recognize immediately. so great is the prominence it has been given by the opponents to Safeguard in the case they have been trying to make both on and off the floor of the Senate. Reduced to its simplest expression. this is the argument that Safeguard. even if it functions perfectly. offers \"negligible protection\" to the Minuteman force. or could be \"easily overwhelmed.\" or at most offers protection to Minuteman over a \"very narrow band of threats.\" This argument has been most persistently advanced by Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky. A recent statement issued by the Federation of American Scientists. along with a supporting chart. embraced the \"negligible protection\" view and was joined .n or agreed to not only by Dr. Panofsky but also by Jerome Wiesner. Marvin Goldberger. Herbert York. and Herbert Scoville. Jr. Dr. George Kistiakowsky has associated himself.with the Panofsky argument. The remarkable fact is that so many of the Senators opposing Safeguard have accepted at face value one form or another of the argument made by this group of scientists. Now. this argument. in its most important aspect. is a strategic argument. not a narrowly technical one. and should be evaluated in those terms. I received yesterday from a very distinguished group of men with long professional experience in the national security area a statement which definitively refutes the Panofsky analysis and which I am confident will be of great interest to all Members of the Senate. The signers of this statement are well known to many Senators. they are: Dr. Albert Wohlstetter. university professor. University of Chicago. Dr. Charles M. Herzfeld. physicist. former director. Advanced Research Projects Agency. Dr. Willard Libby.

We. as one of the leading legislative bodies of the free peoples of the world. must continue to pursue every effort for the release of almost 3.000 Iraqi Jewstrapped in this hostile Arab land and facing the specter of mass murder on trumpedup espionage charges. Therefore. on February 7. 1969. I submitted a resolution in the sense of the Congress that the United States do everything in its power to encourage and assist Jews living in Arab countries to take asylum in the United States. or in any U.S. Embassy in any foreign country. Under the leave to extend my remarks In the RECORD. I include the following: H. REs. 241 Whereas the atmosphere in the Middle East is one of extreme tension. Whereas Jews living In Arab countries have suffered constant harassment and abuse. Whereas this tense atmosphere has led to the public execution of Jews In Iraq. and the threat of even more executions. and Whereas this tense atmosphere is such that it could result in mass genocide of Jews in Arab countries: Now. therefore. be it Resolved.. That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States do everything in its power to encourage and assist Jews living in Arab countries. and threatened by virtue of their presence in such countries. to take asylum In the United States. or in any United States embassy in any foreign country. If these shocking trials and executions are permitted to continue without the adamant censure of not only the United States but all the sane nations in the brotherhood of man. it could lead to total genocide of Jews in volatile Arab countries. The lives of 3.000 Iraqi Jews are at stake. The life of every Jew in the Arab world is at stake. The uncertain peace of the Middle East is at stake. We cannot turn our backs on flagrant persecution and threatened decimation. We must. instead. exert ourselves to open the doors to freedom for the victims oE terror.",

DEAR SIR: The Public is aghast at the treacherous aggression of the Russian Communist Empire against sovereign and Independent Czechoslovakia. This Russian aggression is a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter. the terms of the Warsaw Treaty and all accepted standards of international behavior. By this act. Russia stands guilty before the world of a brutal crime not only against the Czech and Slovak people but against all of humanity. The tragic events in Czechoslovakia have proved once again that we can never trust the Russians. Russian historical imperialistic interests and not social improvement of the human lot are the primary goals of the communist dicators in the Kremlin. Russia never abandoned her centuriesold imperialistic conquest of other countries and the idea to rule the world. One should be aware that the members of the U.S.S.R. except for Russia are all subjugated nations. Those subjugated nations are waging a relentless heroic struggle to free themselves from Russian Communist oppression. Most of the American newsmedla. including The Evening Star responded properly to the act of aggression. We fully agree with the position that this Russian imperialistic aggression should be condemned in the United Nations forum and in every other conceivable forum. World public opinion has already voiced its condemnation of this aggression. Although condemnation of this act of Russian aggression carries with it great moral weight. it alone provides no solution. The U.S. and all the nations of the Free World should pursue a policy of liberation of Czechoslovakia. Hungary. Ukraine and other captive nations in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world. The World halffree and halfslave cannot survive. Until the last vestige of tyranny is erased from Eastern Europe and wherever else it may exist there can be no peace. Sincerely.",

At the time. the problem of child abuse was brought into focus by the New York Daily News. During one of its many public service campaigns. the Daily News took the brutal death of a 3yearold girl to show that child abuse had become a very serious problem. With William Federici researching and writing many of the articles. the Daily News did such a superb job that I felt compelled to introduce remedial legislation. Since then. there have been vivid signs that the problem has become even more severe in cities across the Nation. I ask. therefore. that we reexamine my bill and consider it in the light of what is happening to some of the children in our society.

November 24. It read: A secret grand jury investigation in Baltimore may blow the lid off a shocking Ameriican tragedythe abuse of helpless children in institutions. The American Humane Assn. estimates that 10.000 children are beaten. burned. boiled and deliberately starved in the U.S. each year by parents. relatives and guardians. Strangely none of the national agencies that specialize in child welfare keeps a check on abuse in childrens Institutions. Joseph H. Reid. executive director of the Child Welfare League. acknowledged that child care centers sometimes attract personnel of the wrong kind. \"They are apt to attract people who are themselves looking for a shelter. including homosexuals.\" he said. Vincent DeFrancis. childrens director of the Humane Association agreed: \"It is commonly known in the field that staff people and inmates are frequently involved in homosexual acts.\" But both acknowledged that no one knows how serious the problem isbecause. explained DeFrancis. \"Institutions dont report child abuse. in order to protect themselves.\" The Baltimore probe may focus the spotlight on a national scandal that has been kept in the shadows.

But the Elmwood Cemetery said no. only white people could be buried there. So. because he was black. Bill Terry was buried in another cemetery outside of Birmingham. where only blacks were interred. And he was buried in an unmarked grave. Just as it is a source of pride to relatives of others who lie with him that he is there. so it is a source of shame to our country that he was forced to lie there. What was he to America. even in death? What was his family to America? And now. what is America to them? In recent days we have heard much of patriotism and our country. Many speeches have been delivered. With all those flags flapping in the breeze. I wonder whether all those speakers included Bill Terry in their thoughts. Did they count him in? Did they care? Maybe Bill Terry even heard them. there in that place where he rests.",

We shall miss him. Ed Banks was a striking man. A tall. handsome black man. with iron gray hair and a Yorkshire accent. he attracted attention in almost every crowd. His ready wit. sense of humor. and lively interest in every phase of American life made him a delightful person and a worthwhile citizen. Ed Banks had a distinguished record during World War II as an employee of the International Red Cross. It was after this that he migrated from his native England to the United States and married Eloise. They came to Arizona In the early 1950s and bought the Arizona Tribune. a paper which had the black population of the Phoenix area as its constituency. The paper improved both in quality and in influence under the expertise and hard work of Ed and Eloise Banks. It is today a steady articulate voice of the people it serves. Ed Banks was a community leader in every sense of the word. He was loyal to his race. but also loyal to his community. Racial relations in Phoenix have been good because of the work of Ed Banks and other likethinking people of both races. Very few men have ever had a tribute equal to the one Eloise Banks paid Ed in an editorial in the Arizona Tribune of October 30. 1969. The editorial follows:",

I strongly support the vast majority of provisions which upgrade health and safety standards of this Nations coal mines. However. one provision of this bill. namely section 301(1). may cause extremely difficult administrative problems. will be extremely expensive and. more important. will not result in any Increase in safety in the coal mines. This section requires the Secretary of the Interior to permanently station a Federal inspector in those coal mines which liberate excessive quantities of gases which in the opinion of the Secretary are likely to present explosion danger. The Department of Interior has recently written a letter to me setting forth their objection to inclusion of this provision in any legislation which might be enacted into law. The Department feels that this provision will actually weaken the safety protection afforded the miner. The Department feels that in those mines which will liberate excessive quantities of gases. the permanent presence of a Federal inspector will cause the mine operator to defer to the Federal inspector the responsibility for protecting the miners safety. Also in those mines which do not liberate excessive quantities of gases. the operator and the miner will have a tendency to relax the maintenance of safety standards. Mr. President.

This amendment would deny small operators an opportunity for judicialreview of the Secretarys mandatory standards in enforcement proceedings by permitting only one test of those standards when initially promulgated. Another point: It would permit the Board. without a full hearing. to reopen a mine which has been closed because of an imminent danger. The committee bill does not permit this to be done. not even by the Supreme Court. One mine. reopened by a court in these circumstances. exploded and killed five miners before the courts action could be rescinded. I would address this observation particularly to the Senator from Kentucky. who has come through with such feeling and concern with respect to the danger and the security of the men . who work in the mines.

I am going to leave the floor of the Senate and go out and raise the $100.000 someplace. I am certain that some industry would contribute. perhaps a foundation would do it. But I think it is a tragic thing if the Senate could not find $100.000 to do a job. I feel absolutely certain that some foundation or private industry would be willing to give the money so we could carry on this work. Looking at the committee hearings and the views expressed there. each of us is interested in finding the answers to these tragic problems we face in this country. We need to double the number of doctors graduating from medical schools. We do not have enough doctors to give prenatal attention to mothers. We know that one out of five mothers is from a poor family. and in poor families the incidences of premature births are twice as common as in affluent families. The undernourished mother is not able to give adequate nourishment to her child before it is born. Then we find that in a poor family where an infant is underfed he does not develop in body or in mind. In other words. for lack of food or nourishment millions of young children are not mentally equipped to cope with the problems they are going to face in a technical and industrially oriented society.",

My own concern goes back to 1962 when I became aware that the school lunch program was widely available to welltodo children but was not adequately reaching the needy and hungry. The appeals which a few Members of Congress and I made that larger sums of money were imperative for the socalled needy schools. were not persuasive. We made some small progress over the years. but all too little. Our programs of food for the disadvantaged were woefully inadequate. With the shocking facts supplied last year by five responsible national womens organizations in their publication. \"Their Daily Bread\" and by the CBS documentary. \"Hunger in America.\" the country was finally awakened.

As between simply extending the 10percent surcharge and the particular suggestion the Senator is making to suspend the investment credit. I think his approach would be better. It would do more to restrict inflation and I think. on balance. would do greater tax equity and justice to the taxpayers. I believe that. so far as the rank and file of Americans are concerned. they would applaud that approach rather than the other. Now I may have some additional suggestions to make myself. following the same general line of departure. but I do think that the investment tax credit is doing more than any single thing to overheat the economy in times of inflation. In other words. it is really pouring gasoline on the fire. That expression. by the way. is not original with me. At the time that President Johnson suggested the investment credit be suspended. I believe he used that expression in discussing the matter with some Members of the Senateif not publicly. at least that was the expression he used about the investment credit under this kind of condition. I believe that it is. undoubtedly. doing more to drive credit into the hands of those able to get it and making it available only at tremendously high interest charges to those who need it badly to build homes and provide for their essential personal needs.",

Here people are. being required to borrow at such a high interest rate that they will pay almost twice as much for interest as they pay for the house by the time they get through paying it with a longterm mortgage. Under these conditions when we look at the tax credit. we find that it is heating up the economy at a time when the economy can not stand the heat. Every argument that can be made that we should stimulate the economy. to stimulate employment. and the building of new plants. and new investments. falls right on its face when we look at the inflationary pressures which exist in the economy of this country today. I agree with the Senator that this would be a better answer to the problem to suspend the investment tax credit than it would be to continue the 10percent surtax.",

    "speech": "I certainly concur. Mr. President. the third step I recommend is to initiate a new savings bond program paying at least 6 percent to the small investors. The present trend toward increasing wages in all segments of the labor force means additional consumer spending. As a step toward siphoning off some of this consumer buying power. the Government should initiate a new bond sales program for the small investor allowing him to benefit from todays highinterest rates. With todays 4/4percent ceiling. he Is just not buying series E bonds. These new savings bonds should bear interest at an annual rate of not less than 6 percent and should be fully guaranteed as to principal should the holder need to redeem them prior to maturity. To limit this attractive feature to the small investor these bonds could be nontransferable and could be limited to $1.200 or $2.400 per year. This higher rate on savings bonds is only fair. Our Government is already paying more than 6 percent on its borrowings today. and why should not the workingman be paid a comparable rate of interest? In addition. as an instrument toward siphoning off excess purchasing power. it would have a definite impact on inflation. At the same time. some adjustment must be made on the outstanding series E bonds.",

Now. specifically on the problem of the kindergartens and the reduction of $2.3 million. that was basically a House reduction. That reduction was requested by the House. It was done so. as the report indicates. and as has been said before. for the reason it was essentially. if not entirely. a new program. This deals only with additional assistance to nonFederal schools. The committee did recommend in its bill $4 million for 59 kindergarten classrooms in the Indian schools. An appeal was made from the $2.3 million disallowed by the House. In my judgment it was a very weak appeal. We did not have furnished to us the figures telling us where these kindergartens would go in the public schools. The Senator must bear in mind the amount appropriated to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. which total something like $260 million. and. in addition. and part of the reason for our action is that there comes from other sources and other agencies and other departments something in the range of $235 million for these allied services. In other words. the public schools. through the elementary school funds made available. do secure funds for their public schools. These are substantial amounts of money. Indian students are entitled to adequate kindergartens the same as other students. It was for those reasons. based primarily on a poor justification. that this item was not allowed.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Consumer Price Index posted its 41st consecutive advance this May. This is the longest inflationary stretch in the 57 years the index has been compiled. Presidential statements that the administrations \"game plan\" is working obviously lack value. In the July issue of Duns. Mr. Max Shapiro argues that the policies pursued at present are doomed to failure and. what is worse. there is not the slightest sign that the administration is contemplating a policy change. The only thing that has been changed is that the target date for ending inflation has been moved to 1973. The administration still pins its hopes for braking the soaring cost of living on a minirecession. Though it is inconceivable to me how the administration could be willing to tolerate an unemployment rate of 6 percent. Mr. Shapiro gives clear evidence to demonstrate that even a 6percent rate of unemployment will be insufficient to halt inflation. Nevertheless. inflation must be arrested. To do nothing is to stand by while the inflationary whirlwind increases in fury. In 1967. the cost of living rose 3.5 percent. in 1968. 4.7 percent. and in 1969 there was a 6percent increase with no letup in sight. Clearly what is needed is a new approach to the inflation problem. but first we must discard the inadequate thinking of the past. Mr. Shapiros article goes a long way toward dispelling the shibboleths that seem to haunt administration policymakers. Mr. President.

In voting to amend the national security clause of the Trade Expansion Act upon which the mandatory oil import program is based. the committee wisely froze the program into a quota system. President Nixon had also wisely refused to implement a tariff plan recommended by a task force he had appointed to study the problem of mounting imports and applications for further exemptions and exceptions to the program. But the advocates of more and more cheap foreign oil kept up the drum beat. Within the last few weeks. and after additional import allocations were made for heating oil for New England. my good friends and colleagues from that area contended that the 40.000 barrels per day increase was merely a \"drop in the bucket\" and they needed much more. But now I detect a sudden silence. The drums are stilled. Why? Well. almost overnight that cheap foreign oil became more expensive than our own. Mr. President. for the past several months several of us have been attempting to warn the Senate of the dangers inherent in becoming overly dependent upon imported oil. In answer to those who demanded more cheap foreign oil. we have warned that this oil would remain cheap only as long as we were not dependent on it. The chickens have now come home to roost. and that cheap oil delivered to our east and west coasts is now priced higher than the delivered price of our own domestic crude. We have repeatedly pointed to the explosive situation in the Middle East and North Africa and the dangers of dependence on oil from that area. Western Europe and Japan are almost entirely dependent on oil from those sources and are now suffering the consequences.

    "speech": "Mr. President. during the last 2 days I have quoted certain statements made by Senator JAVITS in reply to arguments made against the ratification of the Genocide Convention. Today. I would like to examine the major constitutional objection to ratification of the convention. This argument says that whether or not the provisions of the convention are selfexecuting. they would immediately supersede all State laws and practices inconsistent with them and thereby deprive the States of the power to prosecute and punish in their courts acts condemned by articles II and III of the convention. In other words. the States would be deprived of jurisdiction over certain offenses of the convention. Senator JAVITS answer is very convincing: The Convention is clearly nonselfexeouting in view of -the requirement of article V to enact the necessary implementing legislation. The administration intends to await enactment of such legislation by the Congress before depositing our ratification and thus becoming a party of the Convention. If there is supersession of any inconsistent State laws. it will be by the Federal legislation. not by the Convention. It is difficult to imagine in what way any existing state law or practice could be inconsistent with the Convention. The enactment of the implementing legislation for the Genocide Convention by the Congress need not automatically preclude the States from prosecuting the acts proscribed by the Convention. Whether or not a congressional act preempts an area of law depends on the intent of Congress. If. as could be reasonably argued. Congress did not intend completely to fill this area of law. States would be free to continue to act in this area. To ensure that States would still have such freedom the Congress could provide in its implementing legislation tha nothing in that legislation should be con strued as indicating an intent on the par of Congress to occupy. to the exclusion o State or local laws on the same subjec matter. the field in which the provisions o: the legislation operate. Mr. President. I think this is an ex. cellent rebuttal to the major constitutional argument against ratification . Clearly. Congress has the power to make sure that no infringements are made or State jurisdiction. The time for further delay on ratification of the Genocide Convention i. over.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. August 21 will mark the second anniversary of the Sovietled occupation of Czechoslovakia. This outrageous violation of human rights and internrtional law by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites abruptly halted the slow steps being made in Czechoslovakia to develop a certain measure of political liberty. At the time of this invasion the basic democratic and freedomloving nature of the Czech people was gradually winning over the repressive and totalitarian aspects of Russianstyle communism that had been imposed on that small nation. The courageous Czechoslovaks were discovering a new sense of personal freedom. freedom of political expression that we Americans take for granted. Such basic rights as the right freely to travelalso taken for granted under our Constitutionwere to the Czechs a source of new found joy. Even the professional Communist leadership was slowly moving toward a form of twoparty state. All of this encouraging movement toward freedom was of course too much for the Soviet imperialists to swallow. For the Soviets. aptly called the \"new czars\" by their former Red Chinese allies. cannot tolerate the slightest manifestation of political freedom within their satellite empire. The captive nations of Eastern Europe. together with the many captive nationality groups that make up the modernday Soviet Union. comprise an empire held together by force. fear. and isolation. The Communistmilitarists now in control in Moscow fear that a taste for freedom among their captive nations might well spread into the Soviet Union itself. they fear that once their young people tasted the freedoms of expression and movement that there would be no turning back to the modified Stalinism of the current regime. So it was. Mr. Speaker. that the Soviet imperialists and their satellite lackeys struck out in fear to run roughshod over Czechoslovakia. The recent period of slow but sure Stalinization in Czechoslovakia has by now led to the total expulsion from the Communist Party of the",

As I stated in the House of Representatives earlier this week. we must take positive action now if we are to prevent our waters from becoming the garbage dump of the world. It is not idle philosophy to observe that although we tend to ignore or misuse the sea resources- as a nation and as a peoplewe will eventually live or die by the sea. Such a postulate takes into consideration our future utilization of the sea as a source of food. minerals. fresh watervia desalinationas well as its use as a storage facility. Yet. in spite of such potentials. very little moneys are being spent on useful. relevant projects to enhance our understanding of this invaluable resource. For example. we know very little about the coral reefs portions of the seaa vitally important ecological area. Thus. in the absence of this knowledge. we are engaged in an ironic and senseless sort of war todayman against his environment. Unfortunately. man seems to be winning and the eventual outcome could mean his destruction. Obviously something must be doneand soonto make compatible partners of the current combatants.

Charles Schlow. of State College. has been a lay chaplain to the inmates of the State Correctional Institute at Rockview. Pa.. for over 50 years. He has not only conducted religious services for inmates. but has arranged for family visits. helped inmates to secure Jobs upon their release from prison. and done many other acts of kindness for the inmates. At a time when much criticism is being made about our penal system. and about the lack of rehabilitation being done in our prisons. this example of 50 years of unselfish service by Charles Schlow helps us to keep in proper focus just what our prisons should be doing. I think the mcst important thing he has done during these 50 years has been to let the inmates know that they are not forgotten. that someone cares. and thus to serve as an inspiration for the inmates to better themselves when they leave prison.

Time and again his speeches and sermons rang with a moral challenge to America. Time and again he sought to remind us of our responsibility to lift the burden of injustice borne by generations of black Americans. as he said: The time is past when Negro protest was a momentary emotional phenomenon and could be dismissed to peter out whether or not it was satisfied. Because it has hardened into a social force at the roots of American Society and now possess dynamic Strength. it will move on inexorably until its demands are fulfilled.

The report is a recitation of physical and mental torture administered to teenage children. It is significant that the report was prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs officials. It is not a report by an outside organization or by a group of militants. rather. it is a report by responsible agency officials on an institution operated by their own agency. There are accounts here of children with wrists scarred for life by handcuffs. There are indications of beatings administered to children for alcoholism. a treatment for this disease that has been notoriously unsuccessful because it merely reinforces the selfpunitive attitudes that are a major cause of alcoholism. There are accounts here of the \"failure expectancy syndrome\" in teachers and administrators. the attitude that Indian children are hopeless and that punitive custody is thus the only possible expedient for dealing with them. In short. this is a recitation of one of the most terrible failures of our society in dealing with human problems. specifically. the failure creatively and compassionately to bring our Indian people into the mainstream of American culture.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4296. which has been introduced by the distinguished gentleman from New York. my good friend and colleague. the Honorable ALEXANDER PIRNIE. In short. this bill would authorize professional pay and a continuation bonus for judge advocates in the uniformed services. The object of the bill is to provide retention incentives for service legal officers similar to those now being received by doctors. dentists. and veterinarians in the Armed Forces. The need for such legislation is reflected in the distressingly high dropout rate of legal officers in our armed services coupled with the growing need for qualified lawyers. The burden on legal officers has increased even more with the passage of the Military Justice Act of 1968 which extends to military personnel the righttocounsel privilege currently enjoyed by criminal defendants in civilian courts. The figures indicate that the retention rate of legal officers in all four services is dangerously low as it is. but it is estimated that they will need an additional 700 military lawyers to meet the needs created by the Military Justice Act. H.R. 4296 is aimed at increasing the retention rate of legal officers by making it more lucrative for qualified lawyers to remain with the Armed Forces. In addition to providing attractive monthly pay scales. the bill provides for a continuation bonus payable at the rate of 2 months basic pay for each year for which a judge advocate agrees to remain in active service beyond any then outstanding active duty service obligation or service commitment. This bill is not without precedent since similar privileges are already enjoyed by doctors. dentists and veterinarians in the armed services. The bill is receiving the active and vigorous support of the American Bar Association and the Judge Advocates Association. I wish to add my full support for H.R. 4296 because I am convinced the retention incentives it provides will go a long way in overcoming the crisis situation which now exists.",

My experience as a staff assistant on Capitol Hill was invaluable to me after my election. and I know this has also proved true for the 19 other Congressmen who are former congressional aides. Hyde Murray is not only highly knowledgeable about agricultural problems after 11 years as counsel to the Republican Members of Congress on the House Agriculture Committee. he Is also regarded as an expert on the legislative process. Because of his depth of knowledge. he has for several years conducted seminars for new Representatives on the rules and procedures governing both the House and its committees. His colleagues on congressional staffs have a high respect for his abilities. and 2 years ago elected him president of their Congressional Secretaries Club. a bipartisan organization of some 3.000 legislative employees on Capitol Hill. Wisconsin voters in the Seventh District have the opportunity to send a man to Congress who knows well what it is all about.",

Without mentioning his current political aspirations. I know I join with many others Members of the House in looking forward to his return. In my experience in the House. few if any. professional staff members have distinguished themselves more than did Hyde Murray during his 11 years with the Agriculture Committee. Indicative of this is the long list of Members of the House as well as staff members who have gathered in support of Hyde in connection with the new challenge he now faces. Although Members of the House. for the most part. were only aware of Hydes contributions in connection with his position with the committee. he was deeply involved in many other worthwhile activities. He was without a doubt one of the most popular presidents of the Congressional Secretaries Club. He was also a very active participant in an informal association of minority committee staffers who meet from time to time in an effort to sharpen their skills. Furthermore. most recently elected Members of the House will recall Hydes valuable contributions to the freshman orientation sessions. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "In response to the Senator from Arkansas. at the present time. under the wording of the amendment. it would be implemented on the first calendar month following enactment as far as the pay increase is concerned. I would like to emphasize again. as the Senator from Arizona emphasized this morning. the amendment in no way commits the Senate to action on the draft. which is due to expire June 30. 1971. It in no way commits the Senate to that question. It commits the Senate only to an implementation of a pay increase. which would be comparable pay to civilian employment. or an approximately 60 percent increase for the enlisted rates and an approximately 25 percent increase for junior officers. Therefore. we do not really confront the question of the expiration or of action on the draft. Second. let me point out that it Is the very intention of those of us who have been cosponsoring this proposal that it is a step toward an allvolunteer military. The Senator from Kansas. who holds the Purple Heart and many other awards for distinguished military service. realizes that every program for recruitment cannot be cranked up 1 day after the expiration of an existing system on the previous day. Therefore. there must be some sort of transition period. We feel that from this Point until June 1971. almost a year from now. we would have ample time to make a judgmfent and an evaluation of whether or not recruitments and enlistments were increasing sufficiently to meet bur needs. whatever those needs may be at that time. Therefore. we avoid the kind of problem -that would occur if we tried to throw out one system one day and start another system the next day. That is why we feel it so important to implement this new effort. to get that period of testing and experience. to see how people respond to it. That is why I think it is important to do it now.",

Otherwise. if it is not implemented at this point. we are going to be faced with the probability of having to extend the draft. come next June. for at least another year. and maybe two. Whatever the length of time. we will be faced with that reality. That Is why I feel the sooner we can implement this proposal. the sooner we can get perhaps a more accurate base on which to determine whether this Nation is ready at this moment for an allvolunteer armed force. based on whether we can get the needed manpower. We will have that amount of time and have that experience in order to make that kind of Judgment in June. We will have alternatives.

If we implement this at this time under this pay increase. the cost question has been raised. that the cost is such today that if we cranked the whole thing down to zero inductions. we would .be saving about $3 billion. according to the best figures we can get from Gates Commission. This Commission has indicated about a $3.2 billion cost under the Various. components and the pay program. and rather than an addedon figure. I think it could be shown that. after a .transition period. we would be trading one figure for another: that is. the $3 billion it would. cost.us for the draft as oi~pged to $3 billion for an allvolunteer system.. But in addition. we would be .getting far more for our money. because we dre going to have less turnover than with our inductees today. and the military services are going to require fewer men for training programs and training stations. who can then be reassigned .to other functions.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I will vote against the Hatfield amendment to create an allvolunteer Army. The effects of this amendment would be so far reaching that I feel it is unwise to just tack it onto another bill withbut full and extensive Senate committee hearings. I have several serious questions about a volunteer Army which should be answered in such hearings. First. what will it cost? According to the Department of Defense. it would cost $4.3 billion. but some observers estimate it could cost far more. When the budget deficit for this fiscal year is currently estimated at over $10 billionwhen there are desperate needs in such areas as education. health. housing. and the environmentI believe Congress must seriously study both the total cost of this proposal and its priority as it *relates to other national needs. Second. would a volunteer Army increase the already substantial power and influence of the military on American life? Third. what effect would this amendment have on the war in Vietnam? Although I oppose the war in Vietnam. and am a cosponsor of the McGovernHatfield amendment to end the war. the effects of precipitately instituting an all-. volunteer Army in the midst of a war need further and serious study. Fourth. what are the alternatives? Although the Gates Commission which studied the volunteer Army concept released a report of over 200 pages. only four were devoted to \"Alternatives to an AllVolunteer Force.\" I think possible alternatives deserve more consideration. Fifth. is the push for an allvolunteer Army a reaction to the tragic involvement in Vietnam rather than a needed and practicable reform? After all. in peacetime we virtually have an allvolunteer Army and in times of war some type of draft will probably be necessary anyway. What is really gained? I believe questions such as these should be explored in depth in legislative hearings and that it is not sufficient to adopt such a farreaching program by the simple expedient of an amendment to a bill on the floor of the Senate.",

The Senator. who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee. has a right to take pride in his continuous appraisal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Military Establishment. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and practically every military man in this country who has had the responsibility has recognized the problem of Americas basic interest in the Mediterranean area. NATO. the Indian Ocean. and the Persian Gulf. The Defense Department has usually been sympathetic to the problem of Israel in relation to the U.S. interests. The same cannot be said of the State Department. Historically. the State Department has always been proArab. and against Israel. If it had been for the State Department. there would not have been an Israel. and Israel would not have survived. Every President of the United States has had a distinct understanding of this problem. It is only because Presidents of the United States have repudiated our own State Department time and time again. that Americas interests have been retained in the Middle East. and Israel has survived. That is why it is so important today that President Nixon follow his predecessors in office. whether it be President Roosevelt. President Truman. President Eisenhower. President Kennedy. or President Johnson. in this realization. because the President of the United States understands the world picture and understands the interests of the United States. That is why there is so much dismay in the hearts of the Israelis. and those who understand the situation. because they know that the Arabists in the State Department. whose training has been basically in Arab countries. whose sympathies are with Arab countries. are continually trying to sell the interests of Israel down the river to the different Arab dictatorships.",

In my opinion. that is doubletalk. I think the State Departments conversationsand different members of the press have reported thisthat the State Department is angry that the Israelis had the consummate gall to call attention to these violations of the ceasefire. and to do it publicly. I think the Israelis would have had to be absolutely insane if they kept quiet when this was going on in violation of the understanding and agreement. The Israel Government was close to breaking up over the question. The coalition government split up because there was a big body of opinion in the Israel Government and among the population that believed there should not have been only a limited ceasefire.

I do not know whether the Senator had a visit from a number of medical students who came to visit me and talked about the plight they were facing with respect to continuing their medical education. Of course. as the Senator from Washington knows. the opportunity for medical education is already extremely restricted because of the economics involved. Actually. only a very small percentage of students who attend medical schools in this country come from outside families who are in the top quarter of incomes received. Fortyfive percent come from families in the top 10 percent income bracket. As a result. many students who are gifted and committed and concerned about the health needs of this country are dependent on student loans. . On the one hand. the President. as the Senator from Washington has reminded us. told us on other occasions that one of the best ways of providing opportunity for young students was not to provide grants. but loans. If we went back to the old figures. several thousand medical students would lose their opportunity to continue in medical schools. at a time when there is a great need for them.",

The shortage of dentists is even higher. As I said in December. if anyone does not believe that. I suggest that he try to get an appointment with a good dentist. There is an even greater need of technicians and a need to deliver the manpower to treat people. The amount provided in the conference report is a split between the Senate and House versions. It would allow for less than 1.800 new medical students coming into such schools in all the United States. This is far short of our need. The figure may be less than 1.500. The experts were not sure. Someone from a middle income or low middle income family cannot afford to attend medical school. I think the costs are about $8.000 to $10.000 a year. We do not have other necessary facilities. Clinics are important. It is important to teach people to get involved with actual patients. The rise in hospital costs is directly related to the shortage of personnel.

But when the administration changed the budget. the recommendations for cuts were in the field of training. scholarships. and fellowships. in some cases 35 to 42 percent. We thought that. with respect to this field. the priorities were just reversed. that we should supply the necessary funds for manpower development. The Senator from Massachusetts knows I have been concerned for many years with medical research. When I first came to Congress in 1937 I was privileged to introduce a bill to establish the Cancer Institute. Sometimes these efforts are disappointing.

The Presidents own policy recently. in the Middle East and in the SALT talks. if I interpret it properly. is an effort to bring about detente. to bring about a lessening of tension and better relations with the Russians. I can think of nothing that would be more impressive as a contribution to that overall effort of bringing about better relations with the Russians than a cut in military expenditures. It would be a signal to the Russians that we are not determined to press the arms race on and on and on. with the only logical explanation being that we expect to have a confrontation sooner or later. and we are getting prepared for it.

There is nothing in this language that would. in my opinion. require the Defese Department to award contracts to either incompetent or high cost bidders. It simply authorizes the Secretary of Defense. to the maximum extent possible. to make use of facilities that are being closed and people who are being put out of work because of the closing of the installations. It was not ever the intent of the Senator from Oklahoma that those contracts be awarded to companies that could not perform or that were asking unusually high prices. In my judgment. relocating the workers is not the complete answer. because it leaves the communities in a totally impoverished state and causes a huge waste of investment of Federal funds in plants that could be turned into useful and enduring enterprises. Also. the policy followed by the Defense Department simply means relocation of thousands and thousands of workers from areas where there is plenty of room. clean air. and clean water. into our already crowded cities. where there are already problems of congestion. pollution. and crime. I believe the original language is in many ways superior. but I believe the language suggested by the Senator from South Carolina will go a long way toward accomplishing the objective I had in mind when the amendment was offered.

I suppose that applies to all of us who are a bit concerned. Having sat through hearings. I am well aware of the fact that there was not just one country club corporation. But whether there was one. two. three. or four. the facts of the matter which really go to the heart of this situation. as far as I am concerned. are that the judge was informed of his signature on these corporation papers the night before. and in the interrogation we all heard discussed back and forth. he denied it. Why he did that I do not know but I think it is a matter of some concern. The other point. in addition to whether he signed the articles of incorporation or not. was the whole purpose of the existence of this new corporation or corporations. Every Senator can form his own judgment. but the record will show. for anyone who cares to read it. that the time of this new corporation was immediately following the Supreme Court decision which said public facilities could not be segregated. That public facility. I think undeniably. was segregated except for a very early period when members from a black college golf team could use it. So one has to be concerned whether the whole pupose of this new corporation was just to build a new swimming pool or club house. or more basic. to subvert the prohibition against segregation of public facilities that had recently been promulgated by the Supreme Court.",

Today. we are faced with the fact that approximately 73 percent of this Nations total population. live on less than 2 percent of the land. In my own home State of California. more than half of our citizens live within a 10to15mile radius of the city of Los Angeles and this represents about 5 percent of Californias available land.

This. in my judgment. is the direction in which we should be moving to provide the kind of environment for future living that we all seek. Toward this goal. I have introduced legislation in the Public Works Committee. Recently. I have been extremely pleased and gratified by certain reactions to the concept I am advancing. Certainly. the Presidents appointment last year of a Rural Affairs Council was a very meaningful step in the right direction. since one of the tasks assigned to this council will be a study of population migration and distribution.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in his message on education reform. the President noted that he was creating by Executive order a Commission on School Finance to advise him on the revenue needs of this Nations schools. I should like to say that I welcome this initiative on the Presidents part. During the past two decades we increased the number of pupils in our schools by 80 percent. During this same period many local school boards anxiously wondered where the funds were going to come from to provide the necessary education for these children. The Congress recognized this problem when. in 1965. it passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Our situation today. however. is changing. If we look at a graph of the expected growth in our schools during the coming decade. we find that the line begins to flatten out. This is merely a reflection of the fact that the birth rate in this country has been declining for the past 10 years. We must not think. however. that we can cut back on our efforts to educate our children to the best of our ability. rather. we should view this respite from the \"numbers game\" as a golden opportunity to look at what we have done. to keep the best. and to replace the rest with more promising alternatives. I think the President stated the problem well in his message when he said: We must stop congratulating ourselves for spending nearly as much money on education as does the entire rest of the world ... when we are not getting as much as we should out of the dollars we spend. I have joined in sponsoring a bill which would set up a means of evaluating quality of education. I also believe the Presidents revenue sharing measure could be the real answer.",

This bill. if enacted into law. will provide mortgage life insurance for certain seriously disabled service connected vet-. erans who have received grants for specially adapted housing. Under existing law. Mr. Speaker. the Administrator of Veterans Affairs is authorized to provide a $12.500 grant for specially adapted housing to veterans whose permanent and total service connected disabilities affect balance and propulsion and preclude their locomotion without a wheelchair. . Unfortunately. this magnanimous grant will not purchase the home. In most cases. the veteran purchaser must assume a $20.000 to $25.000 mortgage. Because of their serious disabilities. few. if any. of these veterans can obtain mortgage protection life insurance from commercial sources. This bill. Mr. Speaker. therefore proposes to provide mortgage life insurance to this small group of seriously disabled veterans at a premium cost not in excess of the premium cost paid by the average citizen for similar protection. The insurance would in most respects be similar to the life insurance coverage provided for servicemen. It would be underwritten by a commercial carrier. The veteran would pay a premium covering the cost of insuring standard lives. The Federal Government would bear the administrative costs of the insurance and the cost of the excess mortality attributable to the veterans disability. The Veterans Administration has estimated that a maximum of 10.000 veterans would be eligible for this Insurance at the present time and that about 500 new grants might be made each year in the future.

I hope that with the passage of this bill today the other body will act promptly and that this bill will become law before we adjourn the second session of the 91st Congress. I want to emphasize. Mr. Speaker. that this bill applies solely to serviceconnected disabled veterans and of this serviceconnected group it is restricted to one of the most severely disabled of the serviceconnected classification. namely. quadriplegics and paraplegics. There are approximately 10.000 of this group involved and all have been eligible for a grant from the Government for a home up to $12.500 under current law. In addition they have been eligible for a guaranteed home loan by the Veterans Administration and several thousand have taken advantage of this provision while others have gotten commercial loans for the construction of a specially adapted house to meet the needs of their serviceconnected disability. The insurance issued would not be payable to the veteran but would only be payable to the holder of the mortgage in case of the death of the veteran. and this is an item which has.quite an effect on the morale of the individual so disabled because naturally he wishes to provide for his wife and children after his death. The mortgage redemption insurance. which will be provided by private carrier under a contract between the carrier and the Veterans Administration. could not exceed $30.000 in any individual case and the insurance would not cover any veteran who is over 70 years of age. The premiums charged eligible veterans would only cover the cost of insuring standard lives with the Government bearing the administrative costs and the cost of excess mortality attributable to the veterans disabilities. The bill was reportedunanimously by the Subcommittee on Insurance and is estimated that the death claims would amount to about $1.440.000 a year and that the first year administrative costs would be $200.000 and thereafter be reduced to approximately $38.000.

This bill will pump new life into the veterans housing program by reopening for World War II and Korean conflict veterans their right to purchase homes under the GI bill. It will also permit the Veterans Administration to guarantee loans to purchase mobile homes under the GI home loan program and finally. it will authorize the Veterans Administration to make direct loans to paraplegic veterans and other seriously disabled veterans who require specially adapted housing. The continually spiraling cost of housing. Mr. Speaker. has to a great extent forced the low- and middleincome veteran out of the permanent housing market. By authorizing the guaranty of mobile homes under the GI bill. we are providing a means for these veterans to obtain temporary housing until such time as their income will qualify them to purchase more permanent housing. Mobile home financing is already available under the Federal Housing Administrations program. It appears to be a logical move to make such housing available under the GI bill. Since there have been lengthy periods when mortgage financing for GI home loans was in short supply or unavailable. it would appear to be a reasonable and logical move to reopen the program for veterans of World War II and the Korean conflict. Certainly. Mr. Speaker. there can be no question about the merit contained in the proposal to extend direct loans to paraplegic veterans who require specially adapted housing. These seriously disabled veterans should not be required to go through the sometimes futile search for mortgage financing to buy a home.

The King Range area is a rough. rugged mountainous area in Northern Mendocino and Southern Humboldt Counties in California. This remote and roadless area facing the Pacific is known as Californias \"unknown coast\" and is most difficult of access. Most of the existing roads in the area are suitable only for fourwheel drive vehicles. The lands in this area are highly valuable for a wide variety of uses. The King Range offers opportunities for scenic and recreation values with spectacular stretches of seashore. beautiful remote beaches and coves. magnificent forested areas. and many species of wildlife. In addition. the King Range area is adjoined by a number of private sheep ranches and grazing is an important use of the area. Mining and timber resources are also actively pursued in the area. Because of the lack of access and the land ownership patterns. proper management of the public lands in the area is complicated. There are separate parcels of public land checkerboarded and otherwise intermingled among private holdings. and small parcels of private lands isolated within public holdings. This intermingled and complicated land ownership pattern obviously does not permit efficient management of either the private or public lands. H.R. 12870 will assist in the effective administration of these lands under multiple use principles by directing the Secretary of the Interior to establish the King Range National Conservation Area.

I have great personal pride in the Everglades National Park and I intend to do everything I possibly can to preserve it. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation which is important not only to the State of Florida but also to the Nation. The Florida Everglades is unique. a national treasure. and a national trust. Congress originally contemplated that all lands for the park were to be obtained by the United States by public or private donation. And. subsequent to the authorization of the park. the State of Florida donated 866.493 acres of land within the park boundaries to the United States and also provided $2 million for the acquisition of additional parklands. In 1958. Congress approved legislation redefining the parks boundaries to include 1.400.533 acres and authorizing $2 million for the acquisition of privately owned lands therein. Our consciousness and concern for the ecology of our environment today has confirmed that lands used for intensive agricultural purposes can prove to be disastrous to the ecology of an area because of the use of Insecticides and fertilizers. We must protect the Everglades from this threat. The additional $20.000.000 authorized by this legislation for acquisition of privately owned lands in the Everglades is a small price to pay to preserve and protect this treasure. the only great subtropical wilderness in North America. It contains perhaps the most fragile and unique plant and animal communities in the national park system. Wateroriented. the park is famous for its rare reptiles and the abundance of exotic flora and fauna. which has attracted tourists from all parts of the world. In 1969. 1.187.000 visitor days were recordedmore than a twelvefold increase in two decades.

    "speech": "Berlin. Roisman & Kessler. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. ROISMAN: This is in response to your letter of June 5 concerning the Potomac Edison Companys 500 KV transmission line crossing the property of Mr. and Mrs. Harold L. Sangster. The information you have offered concerning the degree of negotiation carried on between the company and the Sangsters is of general interest. This Department. however. is not In a position to negotiate the location of this line on behalf of any individual private land owner. You have made mention of the general line routing agreement of March 14. 1968 of former Secretary Udall and Mr. Lyon. president of the Potomac Edison Company. On January 3. 1969 this Department accepted the companys proposals for meeting the conditions of the March 14 agreement. Therefore. as of January 3 this Department has stood in confirmed agreement with the company on matters pertaining to the routing and construction of the line. In April of this year a number of inquiries were received by this Department from members of Congress concerning the location of the line on the Sangster property. Those inquiries requested that issuance of the rightofway document for the line to cross the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Monument be withheld while the Department reviewed the location of this line with regard to the Sangster property. As indicated above. this Department cannot now act to repudiate its agreement with the company which was negotiated in good faith. However. in light of Congressional requests this Department did review the line routing as it appeared to be located on the Sangster property. In addition. because it would appear not to conflict with the proposed Potomac National River (Park) If the line were located farther south. this Department did ask the Potomac Edison Company to consider moving the line at least to the south edge of the Sangster property. This action on our part is all that we can do within the scope of the standing agreement. Since this matter has been reviewed as requested. the rightofway easement for crossing the C&O Canal will be issued in the very near future. We hope you will understand the position of this Department. Sincerely yours.",

Omitted was data on the many achievements of the Bureau in organized crime. the increasing utility of the National Crime Information Center. the FBI contributions in the field of police training. and the staggering volume of work handled by the FBI Identification Division. which. for instance. this year received more than 7 million sets of fingerprints for processing. While the more newsworthy achievements of the Bureau are brought to public attention. its function as a moneymaker are generally unknown. During the past fiscal year. fines. savings. and recoveries in FBI investigations reached a record figure totaling $345.832.583. which amounts to a return of $1.57 for every dollar appropriated for FBI operations. In addition. in the last fiscal year the Bureau had 13.166 convictions. resulting in actual. suspended. and probationary sentences totaling over 47.000 years. Also. during this period 29.220 stolen cars were recovered due to the efforts of the Bureaus agents.

After I took part in the consideration and ultimate passage of H.R. 13111. there were a number of things that came to my mind that I feel are important enough to submit to my colleagues at this time. There is no question that hindsight is better than foresight. but recording observations after the fact can more than not prove beneficial to future activities and considerations. There is no question in my mind that many sections of H.R. 13111 will benefit each and every American citizen. The health and education benefits are farreaching and necessary. I feel. however. that we have to determine once and for all just how much we can afford to do. Runaway. irresponsible spending has caused this Nation to continuously operate at a deficit. This is one of the major contributions to the inflationary spiral which is plaguing the people of this country. The President has time and time again called on Congress to take a more responsible attitude toward spending programs and has clearly pointed out the need to do so. Now. with the cooperation of Congress. this Nation will operate at a surplus. This is a necessary condition if we hope to put an end to the inflationary trend. I cannot help but feel that the President has done more than his part in the great effort to get the Nations economy back on an even keel. He has even gone so far as to cut drastically the budget and to present Congress with a comprehensive and sound fiscal program for the coming year. Congress. however. continues to vote for increased spending in appropriation bills at a time when it is necessary to continue the surtax to try and meet our present obligations. To continue to vote for increases in spending at this time. I believe. is an irresponsible approach to sound fiscal policy. If a citizen would apply the same philosophy to the handling of his household budget and continue to spend more than he is taking in. bankruptcy is inevitable.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there is an oldfashioned expression \"as free as the air\" and for many generations this has implied that everyone had equal access to this native element without cost or hindrance. While the development of radio and television communication has necessitated certain regulations on the use of broadcasting wavelengths. the air has still. in the broadest and best sense. remained free. Whoever could afford a radio or television receiver could hear or see the best available programs without further investment. I now find that through subtle and confusing arguments efforts axe being made to \"sell the air\" so that certain television channels will be visible only to those paying a fixed monthly fee for this privilege. I cannot for the life of me see how this can be a legitimate move in the best interest of the public. I have. therefore. introduced legislation to amend the appropriate sections of the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the granting of authority to broadcast pay television programs. I have taken my stand on this matter for three very specific reasons: First. I do not believe that any regulatory body of the Government. which is exactly what the Federal Communications Commission is. has the right to bargain away the airwaves of this country for the exclusive use of broadcasters who can then hang price tags on their programs. I believe that the air belongs to the people and is not for sale. Second. I believe that over a period of time the best and most worthwhile programs. those having the major educational. cultural and recreational value. will move over to the pay TV channels. At a time when the television industry is being urged by its critics to upgrade itself. I cannot see how we can on the one hand ask for better quality programs and on the other hand make it financially difficult for the regularor freechannels to provide such programing. Third. I foresee that instituting pay television will ultimately disenfranchise a very sizable segment of our national population from seeing the programs best suited to inform. entertain and educate them. People on modest incomes. the aged. the retired. the newly married homemakersthese are the ones least able to pay for television programs. and yet they are the very ones for whom free television provides a window on the world.

I think that in this particular situation. notwithstanding that the committees of both Houses of Congress have done a magnificent job of sifting and analyzing the perplexities with which we are confronted. the accomplishments of the House of Representatives in its passage of H.R. 17070 are very real indeed. and that the Senate would do well to consider the acceptance of this substitute proposal by the Senator from Oklahoma with this bill as now presented and passed by the House. so that postal reform can become a reality instead of just a theoretical abstraction. as it has been so often in the past. There are many aspects of the House bill that are especially attractive to the junior Senator from Tennessee. not the least of which Is the manner in which the House managed that section which deals with the rights of a postal employee to join or to refrain from joining a union. as he sees fit.

The recent purge of 10 respected scientists from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro is another indication of the path chosen by the Brazilian military government. It is distressing to friends of the Brazilian people that Brazils traditional spirit of accommodation and political civility has been discarded by its current leaders. Reports of official terrorism and torture are mixed with incidents of violence committed by opponents of the regime who are denied access to legitimate political channels. The attached articles highlight the ugliest aspects of a regime that we continue to support both militarily and economically. a regime that mocks the democratic principles proclaimed in the Alliance for Progress. Mr. President. the United States must reexamine our support of this regime and ask whether our actions. including our maintenance in Brazil of our largest Latin American military mission. can produce anything other than a deepening dismay here at home at the gap between our policies and our ideals. We now face a deep crisis in the spirit of the American people because of our support of an unpopular government in an unjust cause in Vietnam. Our unquestioning endorsement of a government that accepts torture of political prisoners can only exacerbate this crisis.

I introduce a bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937 to permit the inclusion of imported strawberries under any marketing order regulating strawberry grade. size. quality. and maturity. Strawberries grown in California now are subject to a marketing order under a California State law. This order proscribes certain standards for size and quality and. naturally. compliance with these standards increases the farmers cost of production. Under the State statute. these standards cannot be imposed upon imported strawberries. As a result. lower quality imports selling at a lesser price are depressing the market in California. For example. the 1970 season opening price for domestic strawberries was $4.50 per 12pint crate while lower quality imported strawberries were selling for $2.50 per 12pint crate. In 1969. imports were 1.779 carload equivalents. This year. imports to date were in excess of 2.000 carload equivalents and heavier importation is anticipated for 1971. As a result. I am introducing this amendment that will not prohibit importation of strawberries. but only require that those imported are of equal grade. size. quality. and maturity as those marketed under marketing orders adopted pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937.

If he waits a whole year. it is 6 percent. This 6 percent is not deductible from the income tax as interest. So in the case of a 50percent taxpayer. he is out of pocket about 9 percent. He gets 3 percent on the first 6 percent as a deduction. but he pays the remaining total 6 percent. which must come out of his income after tax.

A bank might have bought a municipal bond. let us say. in 1961. which might have had a 20year maturity. We made this change effective in July of 1969. Certainly there were 8 or 9 years of appreciation in value in the past to which we were denying the 25 percent rate. and saying. \"You have to be now taxed at the ordinary income rate.\" What we have done is to pick the day July 11 as the point of departure. Any assets that were owned byone of these institutions on that date would have the appreciation attributable to the time prior to July 12 continue to result in capital gain no matter when realized. The portion of the gain attributable to the period after July 12 will be treated as ordinary income. The portions of the gains attributable to these two periods will be determined on a pri rata basisthe portions of the period the bond is held which is before and after July 11. The reason why we make this change. I think the gentleman realizes. is we presently allow banksand only banks. no individual or other corporationthe privilege of deducting against their ordinary income the losses that they incur with respect to bonds they held. whether they are State. local. Federal. or corporate bonds. So if they have the privilege of writing off losses as ordinary losses. is it not fair that any gain they have be treated as ordinary income?

The Secretary of the Treasury joins with me in urging passage of the proposed legislation as promptly as possible. In its preparation. these departments have consulted with and given careful consideration to the views and comments of members of the United States Customs Court and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and of representatives of the Federal Judicial Center. various importer groups. the Association of the Customs Bar. the Customs Committee of the Section on Administrative Law of the American Bar Association. and a considerable number of individuals concerned with customs procedures in the courts and in the Bureau of Customs. The bill has also been coordinated with and cleared by all executive branch agencies concerned. Notable contributions to the proposed legislation have come from Mr. Justice Tom C. Clark. the Director of the Federal Judicial Center. and the Honorable Paul P. Rao. Chief Judge. United States Customs Court. They worked diligently to promote the widespread discussions which eventually led to acceptance by all parties of a set of general principles of procedural reforms in the customs courts and Bureau of Customs. These principles were developed by the Justice and Treasury Departments into a working draft which formed the basis of this proposal. The attached draft legislation is a final refinement of all these efforts. It is designed to remove the statutory obstacles to effective judicial and administrative procedures in customs matters and thereby to improve the judicial machinery in the customs courts. The sectionbysection analysis of the draft bill. also attached. explains in detail the proposed changes. The early introduction and consideration of this Important legislation is requested. The Bureau of the Budget has advised that there is no objection to the submission of this legislation from the standpoint of the Administrations program. Sincerely.",

While it is true that violence often followed this man of peace. he would have been horrified and dismayed by the rioting and looting that broke out upon the news of his assassination. He would have been the first to point out that such violence hurts rather than helps the cause to which he was so devoted. Dr. King taught us all. white and black. the precept of nonviolence in achieving social progress. We should not tolerate nor condone the criminal lawlessness which is scarring our Nation. It is vicious. destructive. and totally alien to the great traditions of this country and to the teaching of the man in whose name it is being done. There may be reasons for the looting and riotingbut there can be no excuse or justification for them. On the other hand. Mr. Speaker. there should be no further delay in the passage of legislation designed to achieve social progress through the lawful processes of government. Martin Luther King believed in America and its promise. He knew and taught the power of peaceful change. Prompt passage of this civil rights legislation is another step in realizing Dr. Kings \"dream\" that no one be judged by the color of his skin.",

Much of this illconsidered criticism goes beyond expressions of concern about the size of the military budget or doubts about our involvement in Vietnam. Many of these verbal assaults are against our Military Establishment itself and directed at those segments of our industry that fulfill military requirements. It goes without saying that every rightthinking person hopes for the time when we can safely afford to reduce military expenditures and divert more of such outlays for other usesor give it back to the people in reduced taxes.

Although the principles of group practice have been well evolved and tested in many parts of the country during the past three decades.

The primary reason for this new interest is the realization that our current health crisis is growing more serious. and that we simply must develop better methods for the organization and delivery of health care if we are to solve our problems. The principal advantages of the group practice of medicine are that it offers substantial economies in the provision of health care to our population. and helps us to move away from our excessive orientation toward acute hospital care. and toward the implementation of urgently needed concepts of preventive medicine.

Designating one day to acclaim the many deeds of Aaron Henry is a fitting tribute to his works and his ordeals. He is just another of the many black people who are convinced that because America is home. America must yield up her bounty to every citizen. And Aaron Henry intends to continue the struggle to make the American dream of equality a reality for all. I am honored to know Aaron Henry for I know that he will continue working until the last remnant of poverty. the last barrier to prosperity. the last obstacle to equal opportunity are gone from American life.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the April issue of the Progressive magazine is entirely devoted to a series of provocative articles dealing with the threats to human survival posed by the deterioration of our environment and the population explosion. Two of the articles dealing with the issue of world overpopulation are particularly Interesting. The first. entitled \"A Better World for Fewer Children.\" written by Nobel laureate George Wald. makes the important distinction between possible definitions of \"survival.\" As Professor Wald points out. demographers have estimated that as many as 40 billion people might be kept alive on this earth with \"proper management.\" But what would life be like in such a \"standing room only\" planet? The answer is obvious: It would be oppressive with little opportunity for creativity and experiencing the sheer joy of living. Our desire to preserve and improve the quality of life in this country and around the globe is the most pressing reason why the population bomb on which we sit must be defused. As Professor Wald put it: None of the things that now most need to be done for our country and for the world have much chance of working unless coupled with the control of population. The second article. entitled \"Looking Backward From 2000 A.D..\" written by biologist and population expert Paul Erlich. is a futuristic piece describing the human gains that could be realized by cutting back the population size of the United States dramatically. This imaginative look into the possibility of a better tomorrow ought to be read by all who share the belief that something must be done immediately to curb our excessive birth rates. Mr. President. these are important contributions to the debate over the need for a national population policy. I ask unanimous consent that these excellent articles be printed in the RECORD.",

It is an anniversary of special significancenot only to Provincetown. where the Pilgrims first landed. and to Plymouth. where they finally settled. but to the whole Nation. The Pilgrim story has always been an inspiration to Americans. for it is a microcosm of the American Nations experience. How they came to an unknown land. how they challenged and conquered a hostile wilderness. how they came to realize the need for unity and cooperation and the rule of law. and how they achieved thesethis is the story that has inspired generations of Americans. Such inspiration is sorely needed in the troubled times we face today. In the face of todays apparent adversities. the Pilgrim story reminds us that our ancestors faced far greater challenges. and overcame them. In the face of todays apparent lack of direction. the Pilgrim story serves to remind us of where we have been. and can help guide us in deciding where we are going. The roots of Americareligious freedom. individual liberty. government by consent of the governed. and the free enterprise systemall began. in part. with the Pilgrims. The Mayflower Compact was the first constitution set up by free men in America to govern themselves. Plymouth Plantation marked the place where free enterprise first flourished. There is much in Americas past which we seem to have forgotten and which we ought to remember.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise to support the passage of H.R. 15770. legislation designed to conserve surface waters and to preserve and improve habitat for migratory waterfowl. This bill commonly referred to as the \"Water Bank Act\" was sponsored by our distinguished colleagues from North Dakota. Mr. ANDREWS and Mr. KLEPPE. and has received the unanimous and bipartisan support of your Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. The pothole regions of the Dakotas and Minnesota are vital to the survival of migratory waterfowl in the United States. The continued draining of these areas and their conversion for agricultural and commercial uses threatens to seriously diminish breeding grounds to the point where many species will soon be unable to find sufficient wetlands to sustain their numbers. The 19th century witnessed the extinction of many species of American wild fowl due to unregulated hunting. often for commercial purposes. Almost too late. we imposed seasonal restrictions and bag limits to insure adequate propagation of our migratory waterfowl. We are now confronted with a similar. but much more difficult problem of insuring that the unique wetlands environment of our waterfowl is maintained in balance. Land in its natural state is fast becoming a precious commodity in the United States. As the committee report clearly indicates. our existing acquisition and easement programs have been underfunded and are lagging behind their anticipated goals. Mr. Speaker. the Water Bank Act offers an Intelligent and compatible alternative to the existing wetlands programs of the Interior Department. While the official reports of the Interior and Agriculture Departments express opposition to this legislation. the representatives of these departments who testified before your committee expressed their concern over the rapid destruction of waterfowl habitat in most eloquent terms. I am certain that these departments will welcome this legislation and will work closely together to implement it in a forceful manner. I do not believe. therefore. that the official objections raised to this legislation should stand as a bar to its enactment. The distinguished chairman of the Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Minnesota is known as the land of 10.000 lakes. In my youth. it was also the land of 100.000 ponds. potholes. and swamps. Waterfowl and furbearers abounded in these natural reservoirs. When there was a heavy rain. or abnormal spring runoff. these ponds were natural reservoirs. holding the water on the land where it fell and allowing it to slowly work its way to the streambeds or to recharge the underground water supply. Over the years. as the necessity for more tillable lands increased. when more land was taken for highway and building purposes. these swamps and potholes were drained. filled. or deprived of their feeder streams. they dried up. In many areas. without the surface waters to recharge the underground aquifers. wells had to be sunk deeper or dried up entirely. Surface water was unavailable for irrigation or to water livestock. Unless action is taken soon. the loss of our surface reservoirs will result in irreversible damage to our land. This water bank legislation would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into longterm agreements with landowners to preserve their wetland acres. One of the wisest moves we could make would be to compensate the landowners for preserving their wetlands. There is no end to the dividends that would accrue from the passage of this bill. We would help to recharge our underground water supply. we would preserve our surface reservoirs. thereby providing insurance against recurring floods. we would maintain habitat for wildlife. and we would perpetuate the ecological balance built into our land by an allwise Creator.

Increased urbanization and industrial development results in a relentless encroachment upon our remaining land. Our wetlands. which comprise some of our most valuable and irreplaceable natural resources. are rapidly disappearing. In addition to being things of great natural beauty. these precious wetlandsthe marshes. swamps. and estuarine areasprovide the natural habitat for much of our fish and wildlife. including valuable waterfowl. These valuable nesting and breeding areas are being systematically and ruthlessly destroyed. They are being drained. burned. and filled in. they are paved and often pollutedall in the name of progress. No one can dispute the need for the industrial sites. the housing developments. the roads and airports that our evergrowing civilization demands. But it is equally important to try to maintain a harmonious balance between the demands for economic expansion and the need to conserve our precious natural resources. Mr. Speaker. the water bank bill. H.R. 15770 .is designed to help maintain that balance by persuading owners of these valuable wetlands to retain them in their natural conditions instead of converting them for industrial. agricultural or other uses. This would be accomplished by 10year agreements with the owners and operators of these lands. who would be financially compensated for preserving the wetlands. Since Congressman JOHN DINGELL. my friend and colleague. and chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation. has already explained this legislation in detail.

He first joined the Veterans Administration after the Second World War. and with the exception of his military service during the Korean war has served in the Veterans Administration continually since he started his career there. in positions of increasing responsibility. He served as Chief Benefits Director and as Deputy Administrator before President Johnson submitted his nomination as Administrator in January 1965. It has been my personal pleasure to have worked closely with Mr. Driver for many years. To cite but one Instance. I recall the many times I struggled to reopen the National Service Life Insurance program to veterans. Time after time I obtained the Senates agreement. but I was never able to convince the House Veterans Affairs Committee how worthwhile my proposal was. Mr. Driver was instrumental in arranging for the very limited reopening that we were finally able to get the House to accept. All of us in the Congress who worked with him are well aware of Mr. Drivers competence and thorough knowledge of all aspects of the Veterans programs. His was a talent that will be sorely missed. The veterans of the United States have lost the service of one of their greatest friends and most effective spokesmen.

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday the Senate took up consideration of S. 4358. the National Air Quality Standards Act of 1970. All of the members of the Public Works Committee deserve credit for their tireless efforts in marking up and reporting out what may very well be one of the most significant pieces of legislation of the 91st Congress. Of course. much attention has been focused on certain sections of the bill. such as section 202 which requires that 1975 model automobiles achieve at least a 90percent reduction from the 1970 emission standards. Because of this very close examination of these sections by many of my distinguished colleagues. I shall confine my remarks to section 306. \"Federal procurement.\" It is with great interest that I take up this section. because on March 20 I introduced S. 3614. the Federal Procurement and Environmental Enhancement Act of 1970. In essence. it would prohibit all departments. independent agencies. and other instrumentalities of the United States using federally appropriated funds. from purchasing goods. materials and services from any person operating in violation of Federal air or water pollution control laws. On May 6 I testified before the Air and Water Pollution Subcommittee on behalf of this measurewhich. incidentally. was cosponsored by 10 of my colleagues. including the distinguished senior Senator from Montana. Also. the distinguished chairman of the Air and Water Pollution Subcommittee introduced two major air and water quality bills containing similar. but less comprehensive provisions. With three exceptions. I shall not explain in detail the provisions of S. 3614. However. I ask unanimous consent that my testimony be printed in the RECORD at this point.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. section 306 of the committee bill. while similar in principle. departs considerably from S. 3614 and the existing law upon which it was modeled. First. the procurement prohibition takes effect only upon a \"knowing\" violation of standards defined in the act. I see no reason for the insertion of an additional factor which can only work to the detriment of the purpose of the section. The word \"knowing\" creates a presumption not found in similar and existing laws. Other Federal procurement laws are not encumbered by such language. The Buy American Act41 U.S.C. 10. 10(b)bars a contractor from Government work for a period of 3 years upon \"a failure to comply with such provisions\" of that act. The WalshHealy Act41 U.S.C. 35relating to minimum wages. maximum working hours. child labor laws. and health and safety conditions. subjects a violator to its penalty provision upon \"any breach or violation of any of the stipulations\" in the contract. Also. the Service Contract Act41 U.S.C. 351which extends to employees of Government service contracts the Federal minimum wage law. subjects a violator to the procurement penalty upon \"any violation\" or \"when a violation is found.\" Mr. President. I contend that pollution violators deserve no greater protection than other lawbreakers. Another major difference between the two measures is that section 306 of the committee bill only applies prospectively. Therefore. a polluter presently in violation of air quality standards is allowed to continue any existing contract. and to continue profiting from the U.S. Government at the expense of the community. However. S. 3614 applies not only prospectively. but also provides for the cancellation during the life of the contract should a pollution violation occur after both parties enter into the agreement. Again. I can only cite the WalshHealy Act which permits the Federal Government to cancel a contract and \"to make open market purchases or enter into other contracts for the completion of the original contract. charging any additional cost to the original contractor.\" The Service Contract Act also provides for \"cancellation\" and the charging of additional cost.",

    "speech": "The last major difference between the two measures is that S. 4358 would apply the procurement ban only to \"any facilities subject to such action by the court which are owned. leased. or supervised by such person.\" In explaining this language. the committee report states that procurement sanctions are limited \"to contracts affecting only the facility not in compliance. rather than an entire corporate entity or operative division.\" It further states that a company with a \"contract unrelated to the violation\" is eligible for business with the Federal Government. I must differ with the committee on this point. It is possible. even with the strong sanctions contained in this act. that a large and diversified corporation may continue its multimillion dollar contractual arrangements with the Government even though one- of its plants or factories is guilty of a socalled \"unrelated violation.\" I can see no reason for such distinction. A company is either in compliance with the law. or it is not in comuliance. The Government will either do business with pollution lawbreakers. or it will not do business with pollution lawbreakers. If a total procurement ban is in effect for the entire company it will certainly encourage compliance with the law. That I believe should be the purpose of section 306. That is the purpose of S. 3614. Mr. President. I feel very strongly about the points I have discussed. However. I am fully aware of the pressures that the Public Works Committee operated under in drafting this farreaching legislation. I commend the committee for reporting out the most stringent pollution control legislation in history. Therefore. in order that the Senate conferees may press for complete acceptance of the bill in conference with the House. I decline to offer my suggestions as amendments.

As a member of the Committee on the Judiciary. it is disturbing to me that this farreaching provision was included in the bill without any testimony from the Judicial Conference. the Department of Justice. or the Office of Budget and Management concerning the possible impact this might have on the Federal judiciary. No hearings were held. Obviously. it is related to other legislation providing for class actionslegislation being considered now by the Commerce and Judiciary Committees. It would seem to me. even if such actions were to be authorized. that it would have been more appropriate to allow them to be instituted at some later date. after a period of time had elapsed. after Congress had an opportunity by 1975 or 1976 to see whether these standards could be met. But to write such a provision into this bill now. without any idea of what it meansespecially in terms of our judicial systemseems very unfortunate. The Senator from Nebraska . the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. wanted that concern expressed. I certainly share it. I yield now to the Senator from Kentucky.",

I suggested at a much earlier date that we conceivably in the respective committees could get together and make a pattern for class actions. I want the Senate to understand that we are now taking up in the Judiciary Committee a suit in the District of Columbia that. it is contended. could possibly include as many as 117 million plaintiffs. There is presently a suit in New York with 3.750.000 plaintiffs. There was a settlement made in a case. not too long ago. which was a class action. which was settled for a sum of approximately $135 million. and the judge in writing his opinion suggested acceptance. of this for some 70.000 or 80.000 plaintiffs. stating that they should accept this settlement because the chances of their recovery on a trial were 5050. if not less. I would only say to the Senator that I am glad he brought this up. I am very much concerned about this discussion of a plaintiff being able to bring an action which he himselfand members like himseeks. but he knows not whether anyone else has been damaged .in any way. shape. or form. Yet. we set ourselves up here in a position to make it more convenient to settle a case than to try it on its own merits because of the overall estimated cost of a trial. I repeat. I am glad the Senator brought up that point. because we have been struggling between the Commerce and Judiciary Committees for many weeks in an effort to bring up a motion for a class action suit. I am sorry that we did not have an opportunity to sit down with the Public Works Committee and come up with basic standards for all class action suits that would be. at least. legally sanctioned by Congress. Suffice it to say that I am glad the Senator brought it up and that these remarks are in the RECOa.",

In March of 1909. we were celebrating the inauguration of one of our boys from Ohio as President of the United States. I had two motives for being here. One. to do honor to President Taft. the other to keep an eye on our railroad and track systems here that are expected to carry a great many passengers. not only be patriotic. but maybe earn an honest dollar. through carrying the great numbers of visitors to this great city. There were no automobiles then. If you look up the weather reports. you will find that Washington had the greatest snowstorm in its historyfive or six feet of snow. that fell two days before the inauguration. So that for four days there wasnt a wheel turned in any of the railroad cars. When I saw the snow last night. I said it will be my bad luck again. However. Im highly honored to have this large group of distinguished journalists here. Since that time. 1909. I have had occasion very frequently to visit Washington. both on business and to meet the statesmen in the White House. cabinets. Senate and the House. During the same time. my business financial interests have given me contacts with all five continents. Last month. Mrs. Eaton and I spent eight fairly crowded days in Hanoi.

That group in between. a good many dont know if they are in between communism and capitalism and dont care. They are not dedicated one way or the other. That very large group would just like to be left alone to carry on their own work. whatever it is. That is a very important crowd in South Vietnam and they have to be considered.

I was considered sympathetic with the original amendment he offered had we been able to modify it some and had we been able to make it germane. we could have stricken out the overtime provisions. which frankly I do not think will work in connection with farms. The reason why I rise to ask the gentleman a couple of questions and engage in some colloquy with him at the present time has to do with part 2 of section 102 as he proposes it where he says the Secretary of Labor certifies in writing that the recipient is in compliance with the requirements of paragraph 1 of this section. If I can just briefly explain what I would like to have the gentleman comment on. of course. the amendment would preclude any farmer from receiving any kind of payment or even being considered to be in compliance with any kind of a provision of the present act until the Secretary so certifies. Now. the burden. then. is upon the Secretary of Labor. not the Secretary of Agriculture. and then the Secretary of Labor has to certify. I want to ask the gentleman what he feels the Secretary of Labor is going to have to know before he certifies compliance. because there are. as the gentleman knows. several million farms in this country. I do not have any idea as to how many people are going to be needed under this. but I am sure there would be an army of people going out checking on this before the Secretary certifies themor is he going to certify them merely by guess and by gosh?",

But I must confess that one of the strongest and persuasive arguments against it was the one made by the chairman of the committee the gentleman from Texas. where he suggested that the burden of proof is essentially what is involved here. Were the gentlemans amendment limited solely to violation of Federal law or regulations there would be some sense to tie a Federal program of subsidy to compliance with Federal laws and regulations. But it just seems to me to make far less sense to tie into compliance conformity to local or State laws without requiring a conviction. and satisfy objections as to the burden of proof. I voted against a similar proposal that has been before this House involving student loans where we suggested that we not subsidize students who are convictedin that instance of wrongdoing during student demonstrations. We had a similar program where we required certification by the universities of compliance with certain rules and regulations before we would subvent to them Federal assistance. I voted against those also because I felt it was an unwarranted intrusion of the Federal Government into what are essentially local matters. I would vote for this amendment were it tied solely and exclusively to failure to comply with Federal regulation or law but when it is extended to certification that a farmer is not violating a local ordinance or a State law it just seems to me that the chairman of the Committee on Agricultures argument that burden of proof is an essential ingredient that requires demonstration of -fair play and equity to be consistent with the position I took in voting against the restriction upon students and upon universities. upon which their Federal grants were dependent. that it requires equal consistency in this instance.",

I am reminded of something else: There is no doubt in my mind but that a large number of cotton farmers in the West. and some in the Delta. are able to sell much of their cotton in advance of planting. They are large enough to produce a certain length of staple that the trade wants. and they can sell their cotton in advance at probably 24 to 28 cents a pound. and make a profit. particularly when the Government protects them on a good deal of the acreage which they will receive from the 11.5 acre national allocation.

I have already made clear my opposition to this conference report. If the conference report were to be adopted and to become law.

Those figures reflected that the farmers almost alone were absorbing direct price drops and the burden of trying to equalize and temper American inflation. According to statistics released by the Department of Agriculture just a few days before the election. the result was that farm price parity ratios dropped to the lowest level since 1933. 1 wonder what would happen if parity ratios for bankers dropped similarly? Or what would we hear from the automobile manufacturers if their prices dropped similarly to rates of 1933? But that is what happened to the American farmer. and in those same States three Governors were elected. five CXVI- 2400Part 28 new Congressmen were elected. and three strong voices for American agriculture returned to the Senate.

This seems to be the Achilles heel of the bill: That we are giving to the Secretary of Agriculture discretion he should never want or have. For example. I am reading from the Library of Congress Legislative Reference Service report which refers to a listing of the important grants of discretionary power to the Secretary of Agriculture in the proposed Agriculture Act of 1970. It states that one of those important grants of discretionary power is: Title VFeedgrainsSec. 105(b) (3): . . the Secretary may permit producers of feedgrains to have an acreage devoted to soybeans or to wheat considered as devoted to the production of such feedgrains to such extent and subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines will not impair the effective operation of the feedgrain or soybean program.\" Reading section 105 (c) (1): The Secretary shall provide for a setaside of cropland if he determines that the total supply of feedgrains or other commodities will in the absence of such a setaside. likely be excessive . . . the producers on a farm must set aside and devote to approved conservation uses an acreage of cropland equal to (i) such percentage of the feedgrain base for the farm as may be specified by the Secretary... There is no maximum limit on the required setaside and the Secretary has discretionary authority to require a setaside of any percentage. not even limited to 100 percent. of the feed grain base. which he finds will effectuate the purposes of the act.

If Nevada is unduly penalized in this allocation procedure. we expect the Secretary of Agriculture. under broad authority conferred on him by the statute. to make such adjustments as may be necessary in order to avoid the kind of situation described in the remarks of the Senator from Nevada. Mr. President. I might add to that. the conferees understood clearly we were allowing for the taking care of distress cases in such a way as not unduly to hurt any grower or community of a State.

Indeed. the U.S. Senate thought so highly of the late minority leader that his colleagues bestowed upon him the rare honor of lying in state in the Capitol rotunda. only the fourth time such a privilege has been extended to a Member of Congress. But such was the respect felt for this distinguished man by his congressional colleagues. When one thinks of Senator DIRKSEN. it is his unique and colorful personality that first comes to mind. Who can ever forget that deep. melodious voice as it rang through the Senate Chamber. begging attention to its every word? A thespian who could hold audiences spellbound with his forensic style. he shunned prepared texts. relying instead on his knowledge and his taste for literary embellishment. A patriot. he was an eloquent defender of American traditions. principles and institutions. A man of rare wit. he was a master of the anecdote. And while his great flair for political satire could be biting at times. he seldom used it as a vindictive weapon. more often than not making himself the target of his humor. And who can ever forget his love for the marigold and his perennial struggle to make it the national flower?. While all these fond memories of Senator DIRKSEN will always hold a place for him in our hearts. it was his great legislative skillsso often hidden by his flamboyant personalitythat will assure him of a place in history. His talent for compromise and reconciliation. combined with an ability to rise above partisan politics in moments of critical importance to the United States. earned him that place. He will probably best be remembered for his key roles in passage of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In both instances. he chose to ignore partisanship. delivering instead the necessary Republican votes to assure the success of these historic measures. These were truly his greatest moments. While time has somewhat softened the shock of Senator DIRKSENs death. I still deeply feel his loss and miss the zest and color his refreshing individuality brought not only to the Halls of Congress but to the entire Nation.

In each of these instances. the Senators support and leadership made the difference between success and failure for this landmark lFgislation. In each instance. Senator DIRKEN was initially skeptical and under partisan pressure to oppose. But in each case the Senator ultimately stood above party. took an historical perspective. and moved our Naton forward.

This Chamber will always remain a little empty without him. Senator DIRKSENS untimely passing has deprived the Senate and the Nation of one of its most vibrant personalities. He had come to be almost everyones image of what the U.S. Senate was and still is. It was not just the commanding presence. resonant voice. or patented Dirksen style that made him so vital. It was rather his forthright love of America and her noblest traditions. and his devotion to his service here on behalf of the people of Illinois. He was unquestionably fired by a deep and very real patriotism. which fortuitously was recorded for posterity in the record albums he cut. Although some cynical commentators derided Senator DIRKSENS unabashed Americanism. those of us who knew him well can testify to its efficacy in motivating this great statesman to help make possible the landmark legislation associated with his name. For all his flamboyance and drive. it was Senator DIRKSENS great genius for necessary political compromise both within his own party and between the two political parties that resulted in so much significant legislation. On a personal basis. it was an honor to be among those who came into the Senate with EVERETT DIRKSEN in 1951. to have served with him on the Senate Finance Committee. and to have lived in the same apartment building with him and Mrs. Dirksen for many years.

They are justifiably alarmed over the possibility that present mandatory import controls will be replaced by a variable tariff system. The implementation of a tariff system could result in unretrievable damage to the domestic oil and gas industry. and thereby endanger our national security. This Nation should not be placed in the position of relying upon foreign sources for its domestic supplies. and this is what could happen under a tariff system. The tariff system would result in increased oil imports. and thereby reduce the incentives needed for domestic exploration for new sources of supply. Such a condition could set in motion forces that would cause the destruction of the domestic oilproducing industry. and compel the United States to depend on foreign nations for oil. This would be a great blow to our Nation. and to oilproducing States such as Kansas. Thousands of jobs are at stake. Tax revenues in 32 States which produce oil and gas would be sharply reduced. with a substantial adjustment in State tax structures and loss of school tax revenues. In recent months. I have communicated and visited with the Secretary of Labor who is Chairman of the Presidents Cabinet task force regarding the impact of the tariff system on our national security and the independent producers.

I am today reintroducing this supplemental appropriations bill with three more cosponsors: Mrs. CHISHOLM. Mr. HARRINGTON. and Mrs. MINK. The pressing need for these additional funds is clear. This need is pointed out in an article by Leonard Downie. Jr.. which appeared in the February 8 edition of the Washington Post. Mr. Downie perceptively analyzes the problems of housing in America. particularly so far as low- and middleincome families are concerned. As he states: The little housing that has been built has not been available to most of those families statistics show need It most ... One of the reasons for the failure to meet the commitment enunciated as long ago as 1949 by the National Housing Act for a \"decent home for every American\" is the lack of funding. Particularly relevant to H.R. 15729 is Mr. Downies report thatAlthough Congress has passed bold legislation for housing the poor. it has failed to appropriate the money that the Department of Housing and Urban Development says it needs to carry the laws out. In detailing the innovative approaches created by the housing laws of the 1960ssuch as the rent supplement program and the sections 235 and 236 programsMr. Downie reports. as I stated in my statement on February 5 upon introduction of H.R. 15729: All of these opportunities. however. have been encumbered by a meager supply of money from Congress . . . (S)o little money has been appropriated for the programs so far that HUD funds are usually used up within months of becoming available. Disappointed investors are being turned away.

That it is the sense of the Congress that(1) the United States Government should withdraw the specific proposals made and reaffirm the previous policy of Insisting on negotiations between the parties as the only longterm solution. (2) the United States should henceforth refrain from attempting to impose a settlement in the Middle East or to bring pressure on the parties to accept any particular set of proposals. and (3) the United States Government should make available to Israel such military assistance as Israel requires to assure her defense. to offset at least in part the vast amounts of weapons. aircraft and other aid being furnished to the Arab States by the Soviet Union and other powers. I am delighted that the following Members have joined me in sponsoring this resolution: Messrs. BOLAND. BROWN of California. Mrs. CHISHOLM. Messrs. CONYERS. DULSKI. EDWARDS of California.",

I think it is about time we mounted a crusade to reply to the propaganda. A certain member of the administration has demanded truth in reporting and presentation on Government activities. Let us give it to him and a concerned public. Every Member of this body knows that there has been no abatement of inflation since the present administration took office. In fact. inflation has grown progressively worse. Prices of everything go up and up. Interest rates go up and up. The Nation is headed for dire trouble if inflation is not at the very least braked. It appears to me that the administration has no effective antiinflation program. It is floundering badly and I believe it Is about time that the administration started listening to some experts not having membership in the closed corporation setup running the financial and economic affairs of our Nation. One outside expert that should be listened to is the Honorable Arthur J. Goldberg. As we all know Mr. Goldberg has had vast experience in many phases. of American life.

I discussed one key aspect of the budget submitted by the President last week. and secured permission to extend my remarks on the budget more fully and to include pertinent tabulations. Mr. Speaker. all Members and all citizens. and this certainly includes the press. need to understand the precarious fiscal situation confronting the country. We need to understand that had the fiscal 1971 budget now before Congress been submitted under the same budget guidelines that obtained under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. and under the first 3 years of the Johnson administration. the new budget. submitted last week. would show a deficit for fiscal year 1971 of $7.3 billion. not the $1.3 billion surplus in the headlines. That blunt statement of fact will seem strange and perhaps incredible to people who have read the big headlines and who have not studied and understood the fine print. I am not charging bad faith. I know of none. I am charging that there is a lack of information as to the facts. Let me follow my blunt statement of fact with a few other statements of fact: First.

    "speech": "Mr. President. knowledge in the 20th century is pyramiding by geometric progression: it is doubling about every 15 years. As a higher proportion of our population gains levels of education once reserved for the scholar. value systems are certain to change. In the past 2 years. there have been more than 150 university and college uprisings in the United States. Some have been marked by extreme violence. guns and bombs have been used. One of the solutions to this awful waste of academia is. I believe. a change of emphasis in the total environment of our higher educational system. Young men and women. deprived of even the basic fundamentals of learning. are thrown into a giant multiuniversity atmosphere. taught by recorders and guided by computersand asked to compete with other students who arrived from advanced school systems. Small wonder that they feel alienated. and their disenchantment is only compounded when concessions on curriculums are made on their behalf. How this educational dilemma can be met is detailed in an article entitled \"PeaSize Colleges Answer the Campus Rebellion.\" written by Miller A. F. Ritchie. president of Pacific University. In the February issue of the magazine The Lion. President Ritchie tells how small private colleges and public community colleges enroll about twothirds of the 54 million undergraduates on U.S. campuses today. They are. I agree. a wholesome force in the educational system. As I stated in a Founders Day speech at West Virginia Wesleyan College last October. the manyfaceted universities are very much in the forefront of attention today. both for the splendid educational job they are doing and by reason of the fact that. unfortunately. they also manifest much that is wrong with America today. I added: Colleges in the smaller classification. such as West Virginia Wesleyan. have been spared the problems attendant with extreme bigness. It is small. private colleges that were the foundation of Americas higher education system that today gives our nation the worlds highest educational levels. I might add. parenthetically. that West Virginia has. in its 21 Statesupported colleges and universities. one of the highest number of educational institutions per capita in the Nation.

Quoting the vice president of one of the largest coal corporations in the Nation. Consolidation Coal Co.. the editorial stresses the fact that tough antipollution legislation will be of no avail unless we have the technology to meet the causes of pollution and overcome them. As Mr. Ewart points out. it will be little help to the country to pass antipollution legislation without developing a technology to accomplish the goals of this legislation. We must move simultaneously to curb pollution where our present technology permits. And we must mount a cooperative drive between government and industry to develop that technology where it does not exist. It is my hope. and apparently the hope of industry leaders such as Mr. Ewart. that government and industry can combine their resources in a joint industrybyindustry effort to rid our country of pollution. This is as it should be. for the responsibility for polluting and for cleaning up pollution does not rest with one corporation or industry any more than it rests with the Government.

As I propose to show here. their salaries are less than the salary that the clerks of the committee would be receiving under this proposal. I just think that is wrong. We have made tremendous efforts to bring the salary structure into line across the board. and that means considerably more expenditures. We would create a lot of dissatisfaction. It strikes me that if the House were to run wild and pay its employees larger sums. we should let them do so. I do not think we should play \"follow the leader\" on this issue. We have the responsibility of setting an example on the side of commonsense. Mr. President. the act speaks only to. staff levels of standing committees. That was what I was speaking of a moment ago. That is what the Senator from Montana is directing his arguments toonly the staff members of the standing committees. If only that should come to pass. the additional cost per year would be $354.960. without allowing for future increases for all others. The current amount authorized for each standing committee is $187.920. If the proposal of the Senator from Montana is adopted. the amount authorized will increase to $207.408. The annual cost of the proposal per committee would be $19.488. The new cost total for the 16 committees would be $311.808. Turning to the Appropriations Committee. the people working on that committee are now receiving $573.504. If this proposal were agreed to. they would receive $616.656. or an increase for the Appropriations Committee alone of $43.. Mr. President.

It was appropriate that the States first official function in connection with this conference began by allowing older people themselves to speak out on their actual daytoday needs and concerns. And it is this philosophy which will direct all of the subsequent activities in New York State. namely. that older people will be vitally involved in every phase of these preparations. for it is they who best know their own needs. At this first series of meetings. each older person had the opportunity to complete the national needs questionnaire. I know that the results of these questionnaires will provide us with a tremendous starting point in our work to bring more and better services to the aging. New York State has a population of more than 3 million persons who are 60 years of age and over2.1 million of whom are 65 or over. In New York City. alone. the more than 1 million senior citizens constitute a population larger than that of most of the Nations larger cities. The older New Yorker has more programs and servicesat the public. private. and voluntary levelthan any senior citizen in the country. Nonetheless. it has never been New York States policy to rest on past accomplishments.

There will be many recommendations coming to the national White House Conference on Aging in November of 1971. but I think New Yorks Governor Rockefeller has outlined. very succinctly. the most grevious areas of concern to our older people in the address which he delivered at the September 23 forums.

I think. for the record. in view of this colloquy. it would be useful to put in one or two excerpts from the committee report on the national commitments resolution. Much has been said about Korea by the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Missouri. On page 18 of the committee report there appears the following passage: Senator Watkins of Utah questioned the * authority of the President to commit the country to war without consulting Congress. even in compliance with a recommendation of the United Nations Security Council. and said that. if he were President. he \"* * * * would have sent a message to the Congress * of the United States setting forth the situation and asking for authority to go ahead and do whatever was necessary to protect the situation.\" In January 1951 Senator Taft said that President Truman had no authority whatever to commit American troops to Korea without consulting Congress and without congressional approval. \"The President.\" he said. \"simply usurped authority. in violation of the laws and the Constitution. when he sent troops to Korea to carry out the resolution of the United Nations in an undeclared war.\" I submit that Senator Taft was no mean authority on matters legal and constitutional. My own view is that he stated it correctly. Of course. in many cases. the Korean action has been cited as a precedent. In my view. it was an unconstitutional precedent. and I have never been reconciled to the principle that. because some President. or anyone else. has done an unconstitutional or illegal act. that is a good precedent for now saying it is constitutional or legal. But. I think. in many cases that has happened. and I believe the Korean case to be a very good example of it. There is further discussion on that particular aspect of it.",

People may be Presidents. but in many cases they are just former Senators. His predecessor was a former Senator. We cannot operate a constitutional system on any such basis as that which allows the President a kind of immunity from questions and scrutiny and still preserve a democracy. The Senate debate of August 6 and 7. 1964. shows clearly that. in adopting the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. the Senate thought that it was acting to prevent a largescale war. not to authorize one. Though obviously and profoundly related to the war in Indochina. repeal of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution goes beyond the present war and differing attitudes toward it. It goes to the question of whether the Executive is to be permitted to take over a power which the Constitution clearly vests in the Congress and which Congress itself has no constitutional authority to give away. It goes to the question of our regard for our own institutions. of the firmness of our determination to maintain. even in this nuclear age. that separation of governmental powers whose major purpose. as Justice Brandeis pointed out. was \"not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power.\" \":",

    "speech": "Mr. President. the banking industry has had its share of abuse. because highinterest rates have been such an obvious symptom of our economic difficulties. On the other hand. rising interest rates on bank loans may have been a response to market forces of inflation rather than a conscious attempt by banks to lend money at unnaturally high rates. Therefore. I believe that a recent speech by Louis Harris. of the public opinion survey firm. should be given careful attention. Mr. Harris makes the point that in a national crosssection of 3.000 households. only 6 percent of those interviewed singled out banks as a major cause of inflation. Sixty percent of those interviewed believed that banks cannot be held responsible for highinterest rates. 55 percent said that banks are doing all they can to control inflation and highinterest rates. Mr. Harris had some other things to say about banks as well. Fortynine percent of the households interviewed viewed the banks as making a lot of profits. this coming at a time when individuals and corporations are facing cash squeezes does not sit very well in the public eye. Harris also pointed out that public opinion no longer expects bankers merely to do well at the business of banking but also to perform new roles to solve some of our social problems. In this regard. the banks have apparently not done especially well in communicating to the public the banking contribution to solving social issues. The same communications gap exists. according to Mr. Harris. with regard to the onebank holding company issue. Mr. President. there has been a good deal of emotion about the various issues covered by Mr. Harris. and it is. therefor. instructive to read a dispassionate examination of the publics opinion on them.

This is $703.643.350 greater than the comparable appropriations for 1970. taking into consideration the 2percent reduction of the total amount of last years education appropriation. This bill is $638.453.000 less than the amended budget estimates for 1971. but in all fairness.

Most of this increase is for impacted aidto which I will allude in a momentbut I think the Senate basically understands this program. Mr. President. perhaps a $4.5 billion Federal contribution sounds like a lot of money to meet the needs of the American educational system. It is. I remind the Senate. however. that the programs considered by the committee in making this recommendation have authorization levels in excess of $11.5 billion already signed into public law. I would further remind the Senate that the Congress recently passed. and the President recently signed. an authorization billPublic Law 91230that extends existing programs and provides new programs in education at an authorization level of $24 billion over the next 3 years. When these factors are taken into account. it is obvious that the appropriation provided in this bill is reasonable and hardly excessive. We are still nowhere near what is called full funding. The total Federal contribution is still in the neighborhood of 61/2 percent to 7 percent of the total expenditures for education in the country.

I believe that Congress must continue to demand that highway funds. collected for the highways. be used for the highways. I especially refer to the Highway Trust Fund established by law in 1956. Congress had refused to raise the Federal gasoline tax for any purpose except for the highways. In a sense. a trust fund was created to receive this gas tax money. and Congress by legislation. provided limitations on the spending of that trust fund. The past two administrations have attempted to use that trust fundfor other purposes. refusing to spend it for the purpose for which Congress intended. This is a serious matter and must be stopped. The executive department does not have the right to determine that this Highway Trust Fund be used for other purposes. That decision has already been made by law. It must not be tampered with by any branch of Government. The misuse of trust funds is a serious matter. The American people have the right to expect their Government to respect the proper and legal spending of this trust fund. I have spoken about this matter several times. I do want to give notice to the administration that I will fight the misuse of the Highway Trust Fund as I have during past administrations.",

The first contract I signed was a PWA grant of 45 percent for a milliondollar sewer facility in our community. Ten years ago the Economic Council of the Federal Government recommended that we proceed in this way. We are telling the municipalities to stop building cesspools. stop using well water. for sanitary reasons. We cannot now proceed the way we did in the past. when men would go out and. with their own muscles. build their own homes. Today we have to have architects. Today we have to meet all kinds of regulations. We have higher standards. In my district there are people who want to build homes but who are not allowed to do so under existing laws because the municipalities do not have sewers and public water connections. This is the number 1 problem. Inflation was mentioned. In my district there are many young couples getting married who cannot find a place to live under $190 a month. and there are old people who are having their houses sold out from them and they have no place -to go.

Many retired citizens have pointed out to me that the social security increases authorized by the Congress are offset by State action which reduces old age assistance payments in proportion to the social security increase. In other words. the retired citizen may receive no benefit at all as the social security increase is taken away by a reduction in State assistance. My amendment attempts to resolve this inequity by requiring the States to disregard social security benefit increases authorized by the Congress when determining their income need figure for public assistance.

This crisis is the result of an inadequate national policy and an obstinate industry which for many years refused to acknowledge the imminent crisis and which still refuses to take adequate steps to protect the public. Two days ago. while the lights in the Chamber were dimmed. the House of Representatives refused to appropriate additional planning funds for a viable and necessary public power project. When the authorization for the DickeyLincoln School hydroelectric facility was passed in 1965. consumer rates for electricity in New England were the highest in the Nation because New England had no \"yardstick.\" This situation has not changed. At that time. New England and the east coast faced a shortage of fuel and electricity. This situation has not changed. And at that time. it was clear to many people that the shortages of electric power in the East were becoming so serious that a crisis was imminent. Since then. we have had a major blackout and a growing crisis of unreliable and inadequate electric power. Blind opposition to this project threatens the health and welfare of all the people in the Eastern United States. It is the kind of attitude which weakens faith and confidence in both public and private institutions. As we run out the string on available sources of pollutionfree electric power. the pressure to continue with the construction of the Dickey Dam will increase.

It is still not possible to say that the inflation has definitely and finally been stopped. However. accumulating volumes of evidence suggest that the policies of the Nixon administration are proving to be effective. This is good news for the American consumer and for the economy in general. This latest report of the decline in the cost of living increase follows the announcement 2 days ago that the major banks were lowering their prime interest rate. There are also increasingly favorable reports about the rate of business activity. Thus we are beginning to see the possibility of the inflation being controlled and the economy beginning to move forward at full steam. The Nixon administration had made the attainment of full prosperity without inflation one of its principal goals. This goal has not yet been fully realized. but we are well on the way to achieving it and this is indeed an historic accomplishment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I have been speaking before the Senate for almost 4 years urging our ratification of the Genocide Convention. It is pertinent to review the major features of this human rights convention. Genocide has been defined as any act designed to destroy a national. ethnic. racial. or religious group. Member nations. who are parties to the convention. agree to punish any person committing an act of genocide. committing an act inciting genocide. or engaging in complicity in genocide. The convention also makes provision for the punishment of any person. be he public official or private citizen. who commits an act of genocide. I would like to point out that the convention intends for each member country to bring to trial individuals who have committed acts of genocide within their territory. The convention does not establish a world court. as some have maintained. It does allow. however. for an international penal tribunal whose Jurisdiction has been accepted by the involved parties to try those charged with genocide. It is important to emphasize again that the convention does not establish any world court. nor does it supersede the authorized courts of any nation. Article VII states that genocide will not be considered a political crime and extradition should be granted In accordance with the laws and treaties of the country. If there is a question or dispute between any two countries. article IX allows for the dispute to be settled in the International Court of Justice. From this brief survey of the basic points of the Genocide Convention. It is clear to me that It would be in the best interest of the United States for us to ratify this human rights document.

In her capacity as State treasurer. she also served as chairman of the Association of Western State Treasurers. Her many accomplishments are noted in Whos Who in Colorado. Whos Who in the West. Whos Who In American Women. and Whos Who in Education. She was a recipient of the Norlin Award of the University of Colorado for outstanding alumni. Her prominent efforts included being selected the first woman to serve on the revenue and estimation committee of the State of Colorado. the first woman member of the University of Colorado Alumni Association. and 4 years ago. when she was elected State treasurer. she became the first woman ever elected to an executive office in the State of Colorado. Her awards and achievements could fill many pages. However. Virginia Blue. despite all of her many prominent ventures. was down to earth and always direct in her approach.

He was in Peking and Moscow to try to influence those governments to bring influence to bear to pull the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong out of his own country. out of the sanctuary areas which President Nixon finally determined he had to destroy.

For example. these brokerdealer houses hold something like $4 billion in customer cash.

Mr. President. that would be impossible to do under present market conditions or conditions we could anticipate in the next year. I think the Senator has found the formula to move in that direction meaningfully and effectively. The Senators amendment requires the Commission to begin or that the Commission have the authority to set regulations requiring beginning the processes of setting aside a reserve to preserve customers cash.

    "speech": "Mr. President. earlier today. I made a point of order to the effect that. in my judgment. the Chair should not have announced the result of a voice vote without first having made a declaration that the yeas and nays \"seemed to prevail.\" so as to have given the senior Senator from Indiana an opportunity to request a division or to request a yea and nay vote by a rollcall if so desired. The Presiding Officer at the timefor whom I have the highest regardruled. quite correctly. Mr. President. that after the result of a voice vote has been announced. it is too late to ask for a division vote. However. I feel that attention should be called to the precedents of the Senate. I particularly call attention to page 727 of the book titled \"Senate Procedure.\" where reference is made to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 5. 1947: Objection has been made to the Presiding Officer announcing the result of a viva voce vote prior to a declaration that the ayes or the noes seemed to prevail. as the case might be. Mr. President. with all due respect. I do think it is bad procedure to announce the result of a voice vote when there is clearly a division of opinion on the question. as there was In this instance. without first indicating what the result appears to be. In such a situation. I think that the Chair should announce that the \"yeas\" appear to have it. or the \"nays\" appear to have it. so as to give a Senator time to ask for a division. if he so desires. or to ask for a rollcall vote before being precluded from doing so. Obviously. if no voices are raised on one side of a question. the Chair would not be expected to follow the procedure I have stated. But in this instance there were voices raised on both sides of the question. When the Chair summarily announces a result. then a Senator has no opportunity to request a division or a rollcall vote. His only alternative is to ask for a reconsideration of the vote. I merely raise this point at this time so that. for the RECORD. objection will again be madeas it wasin 1947to this procedure. andI hope that the acting parliamentarian will be more careful in assisting the Presidin~g Officer to avoid a recurrence hereafter.",

I think. in the interests of expediting the business of the Senate. that we do not want to have to have a rollcall vote every time. but if Senators believe or get the impression that they would not be able to ask for a rollcall vote. then they would never take the chance of having a voice vote.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. when considering highway safety. no one factor can be considered alone as the only cause of traffic accidents. As I noted in my \"Highway Safety Commentary No. 6.\" the driver. the vehicle. and the road play major and interrelated parts in fully considering traffic accident statistics. The interdependent nature of these three factors should not be overlooked. However. discussion concerning each is relevant. as we consider the roles each play in the drive Ior highway safety. Today. I wish to comment on an aspect of safety standards for vehicles. Congress passed in 1966 the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The act states that Congress \"is determined that it is necessary to establish motor vehicle safety standards for motor vehicles and equipment in interstate commerce.\" The result of this act has been the issuance of 28 motor vehicle safety performance standards by the Department of Transportation. The latest of these standards will go Into effect this year. These safety standards are a necessary and important step toward the elimination of traffic deaths caused by improper manufacturing and or design. Unfortunately. as a practical matter these standards cannot be made retroactive. The average lifetime of vehicles is such that some cars manufactured in 1967. without the features required by Federal standards. will be on the roads until 1983. Even in 1975. almost 60 percent of the pre1968 automobile population will still be in use. The Department of Transportation submitted a report to the Congress in 1968 entitled \"Safety for Motor Vehicles in Use.\" which illustrated another significant statistic. It estimated that about half of the 94 million motor vehicles in use today are deficient in one or more aspects of safety performance due to deterioration with use. improper maintenance. or inadequate initial design. These facts are significant. Methods should be found to cope with this aspect of the problem.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the message which President Nixon sent to Congress yesterday afternoon is of such consequence that I feel justified to take this time to urge every Member to read it. even reread it. with more than ordinary care. The message deals with one of our gravest national problems: the growing traffic in narcotics and dangerous drugs. There is no way of ascertaining the exact number of drug addicts. The number has been estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. And we know from the crime statistics that the use of drugs. from the experimental to the addiction stage. has alarmingly increased among our youth. Even in our high schools and our junior high schools. particularly in our cities. the availability and use of dangerous drugs has been increasing. We know that narcotics is a primary cause of crime. The addict is driven to a life of crime in a relentless search for the money to buy drugs. He finds himself enslaved. TH finds himself a slave to the needle to feed an insatiable appetite but also a slave to the gun. He becomes a menace to himself and to society. Obviously. our present laws are inadequate in dealing with this problem. For all too long our approach to it has been on a piecemeal basis. It is not simply a local. State or national problem. It is international in scope. At long last. as President Nixon proposes. we are to enter upon a broad program. dealing with every facet of this problem. In every wayby law enforcement. by education. by training. by StateFederal cooperation. by international cooperationPresident Nixon has begun an attack on what may be said to be the American plaguethe plague of drug abuse.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on July 7. 1969. H.R. 12598 was introduced by my colleague from Georgia. and nine Members including myself to provide a broad attack on the evils of hardcore underemployment. The Nation is becoming aware that the slum dweller. no matter whether he be black or white. is often caught in a vicious cycle of poverty. Because of a lack of adequate training he is frequently unable to find worthwhile employment. As a result. he and his family are economically obligated to live in a ghetto where his children are likely to go to poorly equipped schools. play on garbage strewn streets and develop the \"turnon. dropout\" philosophy that can only result in future unemployment. crime and perhaps riot. Unquestionably. we must begin to break this cycle of poverty. if only to prevent the disintegration of the American society. H.R. 12598 attacks the evils of unemployment by providing new financial in.centives to the private sector to hire and train the undereducated and the unskilled. This approach ia consistent with President Nixons pledge to send to Congress a program of tax credits. designed to provide new incentives for the enlistment of additional private resources in meeting our urgent social needs. H.R. 12598 would. under title I. provide American industry an income tax credit of 15 percent for most employee training expenses. Further. under title II. smaller employers would receive a direct refund of up to 50 percent of the wages paid to qualified trainees during the training period. Significantly. title I1 would require that the employer provide the trainee an opportunity for continued employment after completing the training period. Mr. Speaker. the American businessman has indicated over the years that he sincerely wants to contribute to solving the important social problems with which our Nation is faced. This bill. if enacted. would make such contributions profitable. Is there a motivation more likely to obtain positive results? I think not.

At least 1.500.000 persons have died of starvation and disease since the beginning of the war. and the death rate in Biafra alone reportedly continues at a well over 1.000 persons a daymainly women and children. The principal lifeline of those who survive is the airlift of food and medicine operated by Joint Church Aid--JCAfrom the nearby island of Sao Tome. JCA is a consortium of religious agencies. including Catholic Relief Services of the U.S. Catholic Conference. Church World Service of the National Council of Churches. and the American Jewish Committee. Each night. under hazardous conditions. the airlift of four planes makes repeated landings at the Uii airstrip in Biafra. The planes are supplied by our Government and so is most of the food. The tremendous cost of operating the airlift. however. is carried In large measure by the voluntary agencies. Last spring. a number of concerned citizens got together and formed Americans for Blafran ReliefABR--to encourage support for the airlift among all Americans. ABR has done a magnificent Job. Mr. President. and. more importantly. our citizens have responded with deep compassion for their fellow man in need. Given the pace of the conflict in NigeriaBiafra. there is little doubt that the airlift will be needed for some time into the future.

The task of effective law enforcement is primarily a local responsibility. but it is not only for the police. the prosecutors. the judges. the probation officers. and other public officials.

The distinguished and esteemed senior Senator from Iowa was chosen as speaker on that occasion. Although Senator MILLER has many areas of interest and activity. none of us will take exception to the idea that he is among the foremost of those who realize the high priority of law enforcement and that he does something about it. He is well aware. for example. of the great importance of public opinion and community support for law enforcement. Here is an excerpt from his very apt and well reasoned speech: Above all. those who make the laws. cannot do their job without the support of public opinion. It helps. I know. when the voices of the critics are occasionally leavened with the approving comments of the usually silent majority. We like to think that what we are doing has their approval. and it is reassuring when they let us know it.

I have always recognized him as a competent and thorough reporter. and a commentator of great integrity. I think this article is a particularly penetrating one and one deserving of wide circulation. It seems to me that very many of the critics of the American presence in South Vietnam fail to carry their arguments to their logical conclusions. How can we. in the name of selfdetermination. seek to impose \"reforms\" on the Saigon Government. with implied threat that failure to \"reform\" along the lines we suggest would bring retaliation from the U.S. Government? Their arguments are frequently contradictory: they contend on one hand that the United States has made South Vietnam into a puppet state which jumps to do our bidding. On the other hand. they also complain that South Vietnam should not be permitted to influence American policy or have an equal voice in the peace settlement. and that the Thieu government is too independent. Mr. President. they cannot have it both ways: putting the Thieu government down as too independent and too much of a puppet at the same time. For my part. I think a show of independence by the Thieu government is highly desirable. That. after all. is what the war is all aboutwe are fighting to keep South Vietnam free and independent.

Year after year. these programs have achieved outstanding success In rehabilitating large numbers of our most seriously disabled people. It is one field where we know that when we invest public funds we will get results. But we must have the special centers to do this work and to reach more disabled people. There is no other way to master the severe problems of many of our disabled. Estimates from responsible sources indicate that we have in this country. by the most conservative calculations. more than 6 million people with disabling conditions requiring help from a rehabilitation program. Among them are large numbers of people whose conditions are so severe that they can only be restored through the work of a modern rehabilitation center. Many of them do not get help. simply because we do not have enough facilities in this country to reach all those who need this specialized help. Since this rehabilitation facility program was enacted in 1965. we have appropriated only a small fraction of the funds authorized. Our expenditures in this important field have been about onehalf of 1 percent of the rehabilitation agencys budget. We certainly can afford this small step in the right direction. The pending amendment does not propose a large increase in the budget. In fact. the $3.5 million proposed in this amendment is precisely the amount that the Senate and the House approved last year. But these funds will make a tremendous difference In the Nations capacity to help its handicapped citizens. I am pleased. therefore. to join in support of the amendment.",

Illinois. and all the rest. cannot mean the crippling of administrative services. because it is really a small sum. The significance of the amendment is not the $50 million.

We further have been able to estimate that the amendment would not prevent. even in the administrative field. the addition of 2.400 State and local workers. which would bring the total up to about 159.000 employees engaged in purely administrative work.

So immediately there are going to be higher costs confronting the States. Secretary Richardson just announced an unprecedented increase in the caseload for welfare. and if we have an increase in caseload. we will obviously have an increase in administrative costs also. accompanying it. So it seems to me that there would still be a very severe problem confronting my State and many other States if the Senators amendment were adopted. Finally. I wonder if the amendment is clear as to what \"administration\" means. Because there is administration involved in child care programs. there is administration involved in homemaker programs. and there is administration involved in every program you can think of.

Now. it is my understanding that section 208. if my amendment is adopted. would only apply to those either at the State capitals or in a county headquarters or city headquarters who sit behind the desks and administer the programs and watch their costs. It could not possibly affect any person who is engaged in delivering welfare services to the people. If it does increase the burden on the States to a significant extentthe Senator has referred to the amazing and unprecedented increase in the number of recipientsif the Federal Government is standing ready to finance every single care. every single service. no matter how fast the number of recipients increases. it would seem reasonable for the States. including my own. where $5.000 may mean as much as $300.000 in some of the bigger Statesthe contribution the States would make would be rather small if this were in effect.

This employment activity will .be conducted in an office staffed by 100percent Indians. If an individual from a reservation Is desirous of acquiring certain skills and desires to improve his economic status. he will be sent to school. trade school. or a service school. When he is capable df moving into a higher job. classification. the Kansas City office will assist him in finding better employment. This unique arrangement has been worked out through a new concept approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Several Kansas City companies. including Trans World Airlines. have already been making plans. to cooperate with the Kansas City office of Indian Enterprises. Inc. One Indian girl is now in the new TWA Hostess Training Center. Others will be trained by the company in the near future. I would like to include the remarks of Marvin L.

I introduce. for appropriate reference. a bill which would authorize conveyance of all right. title. and interest of the United States reserved or retained in certain lands. in Fairbanks. Alaska. which were conveyed to the Hillcrest Home for Boys under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act of January 24. 1961. Hillcrest Home for Boys was first organized at a meeting at the Eagles Hall on September 11. 1958. Hillcrest. a home for boys without a home. is a community project and will accept all boys without regard to race. creed. or color. It is not a detention home nor a correctional institution. Rather. it is a home to live in during their 4 years of high school. Hillcrest will provide housing. school guidance. counseling. parttime opportunities for work. and the interest and care of a director who presides at Hillcrest. Surveys have made apparent the need for Hillcrest. and Hillcrest has the support of both public and private agencies and service groups. Hillcrest plans to cooperate to the fullest degree possible with others in the field including Federal. State. and private organizations. Hillcrest currently accommodates nine boys. and all available funds are needed to maintain the operation as is. Hillcrest wants to expand their facilities to accommodate up to 20 boys. a situation which is financially impossible now. II title were granted to Hillcrest for the land. a portion of the land could be sold to finance the desired expansion of theii * facilities. Currently. boys waiting to gel into Hillcrest are housed in the State jaila situation which is certainly not desirable. The entire concept of Hillcrest rests on taking disadvantaged youngsters and giving them the best possible environment and hope for the future. Hillcrest is the only private institution in the State of Alaska which handles boys of this age group. These young men represent an important resource for Alaska and the Nation. and we should do our best to see that they are properly taken care of through the high school years. . The land in question. acquired under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. can be used as income property if the bill I introduced today is favorably considered. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed at this point in the RECORD.",

We spend a great deal of time worrying about the rising costs of highway construction. forecasts of traffic increases. automobile accidents and highway safety. and automobile air pollution. This Is as it should be. But these concerns have. unfortunately. tended to eclipse another issue involved in highway construetion. and one that Is every bit as important. namely. what happens to the people whose homes are paved over with concrete? The reaction of most people to this question is-\"well. arent they compensated?\" The answer is yes. ifand this is a big ifthey happen to own their own homes. Then there is compensation for the property that is taken. and possibly other reimbursement as well. But what about those who rent dwelling space in the path of the highway onslaught? Who provides for them? Where do they go? Amazingly. no one has answers to these questions. These displaced tenants are forced to fend for themselves. to find new rental space elsewhere. And. in the housing crunch in which this country now finds itself. alternative housing is not always available. I am pleased to report that in Wisconsin at least. someone is worrying about these problems. and attempting to do something about it. That someone is Leonard S. Zubrensky. a member of the Milwaukee expressway commission. and a man with some excellent ideas about how to solve these problems. Some of his ideas include an appeals tribunal which can recommend that displacees be given up to 6 months in homes taken for freeways. a county relocation agency to enable the State to take advantage of liberalized provisions of the 1968 Highway Act. and provisions which would give displacees up to 2 months rent free in homes bought for freeway purposes. Mr. President. I think Mr. Zubrenskys efforts on behalf of displacees deserve both our commendation and our attention. His farsighted ideas which are now being tried in Milwaukee deserve to be tried on the Federal level as well. I hope they will be. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article about Mr. Zubrensky in this Sundays Milwaukee Journal be printed in the RECORD.",

These treaties were. of course. the Human Rights Conventions on Genocide. Political Rights of Women. Forced Labor and Racial Discrimination. This was disclosed in May by Mrs. Rita Hauser. who was appointed by the administration to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. She referred to the policy review in a speech bitterly assailing the United States record of refusing to approve the treaties. Her position is very pleasing to me. I have been trying to do this daily for the last 2 years in an effort to persuade the Foreign Relations Committee to report these treaties to the floor of the U.S. Senate. This is the only obstacle in the way of ratifying treaties that our Presidents have very enthusiastically recommended. The treaties seem to be overwhelmingly approved by the American people. and there Is every moral reason for us to support them. In a speech before the annual meeting of the American Jewish Committee at the WaldorfAstoria. Mrs. Hauser noted that the United States failure to ratify these treaties has prompted questions about the Governments sincerity. She protested that the word \"hypocritical\" was frequently applied. Since that time there has been no word from either the White House or the State Department on the administrations position of these treaties. Is there such a policy review? Has it been completed. or is it still underway? I would hope and request that the administration make known its position on these human rights treaties.

At a recent press conference. the President declared that we are willing to negotiate on anything except. \"the right of the South Vietnamese to choose their own leaders.\" The Saigon governments feelings about free elections. however. differ greatly from our own. As I am sure other Members of the Senate remember. one of President Thieus first official acts was to arrest the man who was the runnerup in the last Vietnamese election. Mr. Truong Dinh Dzu. who campaigned on a peace platform in the September elections of 1967. was placed under house arrest shortly after election dayat a time when he was pressing charges of fraud in an effort to invalidate the results. In July 1968. he was tried on charges of \"activities that weaken the antiCommunist spirit of the South Vietnamese armed forces and people.\" Specifically. Mr. Dzus campaign had advocated negotiations with Hanoi and talks with the National Liberation Front. leading to a coalition government. Mr. Dzu was found guilty. and is now serving a sentence of 5 years at hard labor. Mr. President. that trial went far toward revealing the absence of genuine freedom in South Vietnam. Today. when the negotiations that Mr. Dzu called for are supposedly underway. his continued imprisonment is a black blot upon the government we support. I have recently received a letter from Mr. Dzus son. David Truong. who is in this country searching for ways to obtain his fathers release.

Modern industrial organization and superpower rivalry have combined to elevate the military to positions of eminence in both the United States and the Soviet Union. But unmet civilian needs plus the immense cost and questionable utility of advanced defense technology have brought the American military budget under close scrutiny.

I feel that rule 21(6) has been disregarded and we have been deprived of the opportunity for study and careful consideration of this measure. The printed committee hearings. consisting of some 1.200 pages. were not available until yesterday. November 12. and the report became available just today. I do not believe we should be asked in this body to consider a $2 billion approPriation bill under these circumstances. I am deeply concerned. Mr. Chairman. that there are some moneys In this bill. the purpose of which has not been explained. or cannot be explained. In addition. the bill involves some $14 million in new appropriations and $97 million in total appropriations for the controversial antiballisticmissile system. to which I am opposed. Further. I have long been concerned over the growing proportions of military spending. I am a cosponsor of legislation to bring new perspective to the question of national priorities. and to reassert congressional control over the Nations military industrial establishment. I feel that the Vietnam war. which I have. of course. long opposed. has provided the opening for a military budget which is no longer related to our military needs. We cannot accept the premise that our national security depends only upon military expenditures. We need more of an understandingan explanationof what we as a nation are buying for our money. Extravagant military spending Is not going to solve our most pressing national problems. The civilian sector of our national budget is being deprived. We must turn our attention to the need to rebuild ghetto communities. to improve our schools. provide more housing. and health facilities. and to fight pollution. crime. and drug addiction. Mr. Chairman. I cannot conscionably vote for this $2 billion appropriation in haste while the pressing needs of our country remain neglected and inadequately funded.",

I do not think the facts have been stated properly on the cost in terms of American lives as well as dollars of the vague withdrawal plans of the Nixon administration. Recently Arnold Kuzmack. an analyst of the Brookings Institution in Washington. made estimates of the casualties and costs for different withdrawal plans from Vietnam. Nixon has neither set a date for withdrawal nor specified the number of men he would leave in Vietnam for technical. logistic. artillery. and air support after the main part of our force has been withdrawn. Apparently he believes a weekly casualty rate of 50. 70. or 100 Americans is acceptable to the American people. When total estimates of American deaths and dollars are made for different withdrawal rates the results should shock the American people into putting more pressure on the President and the Congress to end this war. For example. this analyst estimated that withdrawal at the current rate with a residual force of 50.000 men would cost the United Statesbetween fiscal year 1971 and fiscal year 1795-$25.7 billion. 7.400 additional American lives and 65.450 additional casualties. If the administrationas Secretary Laird has been quotedleft a residual force of 200.000 men the cost to the United States would be $46.4 billion. an additional 14.700 American lives and 130.300 additional casualties. Now the relevant question that has to be put to the American people is how many more American lives are we willing to invest in this illconceived operationhow much more of this Nations resources and how many more of our boys are we willing to bring home maimed? Is our national interest in Vietnam worth another 14.000 more American lives? I think not.",

It was in 1870. that Col. R. B. Watson shipped the first peaches out of State from his Ridge Springs orchard. His starting shipment was a small express lot. Later he planted a commercial orchard and in 1890 shipped the States first entire carload. packed in empty sugar barrels. The first carload of peaches shipped from Spartanburg County. rolled from Gramling in the heart of the upper Spartanburg belt on July 31. 1924. No -grower had enough peaches to fill the first car so orchardists pooled \"every ripe peach we could scrape together.\" according to one of the pioneers. Approaching its 100th year as a fresh peach export State. South Carolina now ranks second in the Nation in total peach production. For 3 years in a row1966. 1967. 1968the State has produced a crop valued at $20 million or more per annum. In fresh peach exports. South Carolina holds the \"Dixie peach championship\" according to the FederalState Market News Service. In 1968. South Carolina shipped 4.939 carlot equivalents. as opposed to Georgias 3.597. The South Carolina peach season runs from early June through Augustproducing approximately two dozen varieties of fresh peacheswhich are shipped and sold as far west as Minnesota and as far north as Maine and Canada. Spartanburg County. located in the Piedmont area of South Carolina and home of the South Carolina Peach Growers Association. produces 65 percent of the States fresh peach produce. As a matter of fact. Spartanburg County is now recognized as the Nations No. 1 county in the production of peaches for the fresh produce market.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography was created almost 3 years ago when Congress found \"that the traffic in obscenity and pornography is a matter of national concern.\" (Public Law 90100). Reportedly. however. as the time for the final release of the Commissions report draws near. the 18member panel is planning to recommend a repeal of all pornography laws. This. to me. seems to be a highly incredible solution to the everincreasing prevalance of hardcore pornography in our society and its evercontinuing attack on our national moral fiber. Because I have long believed in the urgent and serious need for legislation to control the smut in our mails. literature and films. I seriously question the alleged findings and recommendations of the Commission. The public opinion against the rampage of pornography convinced the Congress that it should do something about the situation. It therefore created the Commission to investigate the matter. yet the Commsision is supposedly suggesting that Congress do nothing but repeal what pornography laws they have already enacted. I am not alone in my concern over these developments. and on the basis of the dissenting views of one member of the Commission is supposedly suggesting I strongly suggest Congress take a closer look at the Commissions activities. In the first draft of his statement. Keating accuses the Commission majority of recommending that \"smut peddlers of the worldhavefreedom to purvey in the United States their scatological. depraved. deviated. sick. sex products.\" According to Commission findings which have already been privately disclosed. pornography has no relation to crime or sexual deviancy. In other words. it is not a causal factor for crime and it is not a source of corruption for minors. In view of these findings. the Commission maintains that America should adopt a liberal and lenient policy allowing hardcore pornography on the market for consenting adults. How they reached this conclusion when many experts emphatically maintain that pornography is harmful and morally debasing is extremely hard to conceive. I am most curious. as many interested and concerned citizens and legislators",

The final conclusions of this report are no secret. nor. in my judgment. are they acceptable. The final conclusion recommends that we throw out all of our current laws relating to pornography. since. in the view of the Commission. \"pornography causes no demonstrable social harm.\" Quite frankly. such a conclusion is absolutely unbelievable. This House has. on two separate occasions. by a large margin. indicated that it strongly believes that pornography can. and must. be controlled. Now. a nonrepresentative group of people. not responsible to the electorate. tells us. in fact. that we do not know what we are talking about. and that we should throw away the results of several years efforts to develop laws that will control the spread of this filth and still not violate the guarantee of free speech. America must wake up to the subtle efforts to distort the tried and true set of values among our people. particularly the younger generation. I. for one. am not prepared to accept such a judgment on the part of a permissive group of people who controlled the Commissions activities and. hence. their final determinations. This attitude. in my judgment. has been one of the prime contributors to polarization and divisiveness in the country and has literally broken up many families. For those who feel \"free speech must be protected.\" I would strongly suggest that they take time to read the remarks of veteran newsman James J. Kilpatrick. which were aired on the American Broadcasting Co. on September 23. Mr. Kilpatrick has. in my judgment. presented a very rational. unemotional statement of the problem. His conclusion. namely. the rejection of the Commissions recommendations. is completely valid and reasonable and I commend him for his efforts on behalf of those of us who wish to protect society from the disease known as pornography.

I appreciate the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations yielding to me. because I wish to join with him and the others who have spoken on behalf of the fine record of Ken Sprankle as a member of the staff of the Committee on Appropriations. I served on the Committee on Appropriations for 14 years. I can vividly recall my first experience on that committee. The then chairman was the late Clarence Cannon of the State of Missouri. Subsequently Mr. John Taber of New York was chairman of that great committee. Subsequently the distinguished gentleman from Texas became chairman. Let me say anybody who could satisfy Clarence Cannon. John Taber. the gentleman from Texas . and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Bow). ranking Republican on the committee. must be an outstanding public servant. Someone just commented that he is a miracle worker. I think the fact that he was able to serve all of the outstanding legislators mentioned above. and satisfy their many whims and satisfy the demands put upon the Committee on Appropriations in a technical way certainly indicates that he deserves commendation from every Member of this body. I always had the feeling that if you asked Ken Sprankle a question. he gave you a straight answer. He was always willing to cooperate. I am grateful for his many kindnesses to me personally. Iwish him the very best in his future years.",

I have never had the honor to serve on the great Committee on Appropriations. but I have known Ken Sprankle ever since I became a Member of the Congress. He has been a fine public servant. He is courteous. modest. and helpful. He is also able and thorough in his work. He has been a professional staff director and not a political partisan. I would like to say in this connection that I think the Committee on Appropriations in retaining Ken Sprankle and others on the committee. regardless of their political allegiance or regardless of whether they came to the Congress with Republican or Democratic Members. is in the spirit of the Reorganization Act of 1946. which intended for us to have professional staffs and not to divide our staffs between the two parties. There has been a lot of activity in the other direction in recent years. but I think that the soundness of the 1946 act has been proved in Kens work on this great committee. which in many ways is the most powerful committee in the House. I say this because I know that Ken has served every Member of the House as well as the members of the gentlemans committee. regardless of political affiliation. with skill. with judgment. and always in the most accommodating manner. Personally I want to thank Ken for the many kindnesses which he has extended to me over the years and to wish him a long and happy retirement.",

In addition to serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Ken Sprankle has a most impressive record of 40 years of Federal serviceall but 3 of which were spent on Capitol Hill. Having begun his duties in the 1920s as a page. there are few. if any. on Capitol Hill today who are more knowledgeable of the legislative process than is Ken Sprankle. I have had the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee since 1945. Ken Sprankle joined the committee staff soon afterward. and it has been my pleasure to work closely with him since that time. Under Ken Sprankles able direction. the staff has maintained its professional and bipartisan standards through the years. Few men have held the position of chief clerk and staff director since the Appropriations Committee was created in 1865. and I venture to say that Ken Sprankle has been the most outstanding staff director in the history of the committee. While we regret very much to lose the valuable services of Ken Sprankle. I am sure everyone will agree that he has more than earned his retirement. Therefore. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to him and to wish for him many happy years of retirement.",

The position he has held on the staff committee is an arduous one. requiring infinite patience. great ability backed up by extensive knowledge of the budgetary process. courtesy. loyalty. much hard work and a commanding sense of priorities.

It has been my observation that Ken Sprankle generously gave his assistance to all members of the Appropriations Committee regardless of their political affiliation.

Inc. This group was founded on July 2. 1959. largely through the efforts of Lynn Walker and a charter was granted by the national organization at the same time. These young men and women are dedicated to the improvement of their community and since their beginning have been involved in programs which have contributed substantially to bettering life in Cumberland. In March 1960 the chapter voted to adopt the national vehicle safety check program as a community service program for annual presentation In the city of Cumberland. Their first program was presented in June 1960 and received the circle of safety award. This is the national award for placing second in the quality of the program presented and the community cooperation achieved. In each successive year since 1960 the chapter has received the circle of safety award. with the exception of 1965 when they received the national grand award for teenage participation. This is the top honor given by the national board of judges. In the 1969 program the chapter has just been notified they have again been selected to receive the national grand award. The chapter has undertaken many other projects in the community including: the collection and shipment of books to our servicemen in Vietnam and veterans hospitals. playtown. a pedestrian and bicycle safety program for primary grade school pupils. and radio and newspaper publicity programs of traffic safety during holiday seasons. At present they are actively participating In the drive to secure funds for the Greater Cumberland Youth Center. The chapter has 20 active members at present representing the three high schools in the city of Cumberland. Listed below are the officers and members comprising the chapter which we are proud to salute today: Advisers: Lynn Walker. Administrator. 229 Pear Street. Cumberland. Willys Wilson. RD No. 2.

Dictatorial and oligarchic regimes have always sought to find scapegoats to blame for their own oppression. In this way. they try to circumvent opposition and criticism by calling for national unity in the face of an imaginary threat. Adolf Hitler and his cohorts in Nazi Germany succeeded in persuading many of their countrymen that the source of Germanys economic and political problems after World War I was an \"international Jewish conspiracy.\" There is no need for me to describe in detail the tragic consequences of ths deception for the 6 million Jews who were murdered. The Soviet Union has for many years blamed its shortcomings on the remnants of \"bourgeois deviation\" rather than on its continued suppression of political freedom and civil liberties. Nations. like individuals. tend to look for \"fall guys.\" Democracies. like honest individuals. ultimately face up to their problems. and accept the responsibility for error and the necessity for change.

Does Congress take 3 months off? I understand the Associate Justices get salaries of $60.000 a year. and I think the Chief Justice gets $60.500 a year. but I have read in the newspapers that many of them take long trips during the 3month recess. with work piling up. What applies to the Supreme Court applies to the appellate courts and the district courts as well. It is my belief. and it has been for many years. that these members of the judiciary. who are protected all the way through. ought to consider at least operating under a 1month recess schedule rather than a 3month recess year after year after year. decade after decade after decade. while the work piles upwhich they were appointed to attend to. just as our work piles up and which we are elected to attend to.

The backlog in the lower courts certainly contributes to the criminal minded. who believe that the longer their cases are delayed. the greater their chance of avoiding being held responsible for their acts.

I call attention to the fact that it seems. in the opinion of many. as though in recent years the Court has almost demanded nothing less than complete excellence on the part of the prosecution. If. at any step along the way. from the time a person may have been observed in the commission of an illegal act until he is arrested. arraigned. and brought to trialif there is any place along that entire series of steps that less than complete compliance with the law has characterized the efforts of the prosecution. the thrust of many of the Courts decisions seems to be that the case must be thrown out. and the accused turned loose. I speak with some first hand knowledge when I say this. In Wyoming. during the time I was Governor. I had occasion to witness the reaction that resulted from the fact that a young man who murdered a baby sitter. and admitted it. had not been accorded one of the protections called for by the Court: he did not have an attorney present when he made a confession. which he voluntarily made. There was no doubt at all about his guilt. and yet. because of that slightly less than full compliance with all of the processes which the Supreme Court says must characterize the efforts of the prosecution. he was turned loose. So I say. with all due respect. that if the members of the Court were to become more familiar with the difficulty that has been imposed upon the law enforcement officials of this country in trying to comply with some of the rather extreme positions that I think have been taken by the Court. the summer recess might not all be lost.",

As a former labor man. probably one of the few Members of this body who has ever been in a labor union. and without question one with longer experience in labor unions. certain things disturb me about these highly publicized contracts. Many of the problems I have foreseen and talked about in the past several years are coming to pass. We are given the impression that everything is settled and all is going to be peaceful and productive. I do not think this is exactly the case. One very serious possibility is the problem of a jurisdictional dispute which is now building up between the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee and the Teamsters Union. both of which have been active for many years in the areas of the agriculture business in California. Almost lost in the triumphant announcements by the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee is the fact of the signing of a contract by the Teamsters which covered approximately 5.000 fleldworkers in the Salinas Valley. Salinas Valley is only a name to the people in the Midwest and on the east coast. It has a beautiful name and is a lovely valley. Most of the lettuce that is sold across the country comes from Salinas. It seems that the Teamsters Union has gone in and signed contracts just as the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee has gone in and signed contracts with those growing table grapes. The thing that concerns me most is the fact that in both cases the desires and the rights of the farmworkers have been forgotten. seemingly. I do not know that there has been any election in which the worker had a chance to say whether or not he wanted to join a union or have a union represent him in bargaining for his working conditions.",

In other words. the individual is being treated. if at all. as a chattel. completely at the mercy of what we in labor used to call a \"sweetheart\" contract. That is a situation in which the labor organizer goes in and makes a deal with the boss. and thet right of the worker is not considered. We had that condition in Hollywood many years ago. when two gangsters from Chicago came in with a contract to represent everybody in the entertainment industry. Some of us who were employed in the entertainment industry at that time. such as the present Governor of the State of California and the present senior Senator from California. opposed this. We said. first. we did not want to be represented by gangsters. We wanted to have a union of our own choosing. This we brought about through the organization of the Screen Actors Guild. So this impending jurisdictional war concerns me. Now we are faced with the impending possibility of a long. drawnout jurisdictional dispute between two groups. where the rights of the individual. the prospective union member. are not considered. Equally important. the housewife. who has to make here budget work in the marketplace. will have to pay extra money for all the produce she goes to the market to buy. If the jurisdictional dispute becomes serious enough. she even may not be able to purchase certain produce she wants. Mr. President. while these charges and countercharges and threats of lawsuits are highly publicized. I wish -that consideration would be given to a bill on which I have worked very hard for the last 2 years. S. 2203. the Consumers Agricultural Food Protection Act of 1970. It would do away with the \"law of the jungle\" in the agricultural area and provide. I believe. a proper. equitable. fair. and practical manner in which the rights of all concerned could be considered including those of the consumer. At the same time. it would provide for proper organization where the farmworkers want to be organized and for proper collective bargaining. and for the rights and consideration of all concerned would be properly protected.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I introduce a bill that would authorize an exchange of land between the State of Hawaii and the Department of the Army. The Army land involved in this exchange is located at Fort Ruger on Oahu and consists of approximately 57 acres located near the Stateadministered Leahi Hospital. In exchange for this parcel of land. the State will transfer to the Army approximately 700 acres near the Tripler Army Hospital. Two hundred and twentyfive acres of this land can be used for housing. of which 180 will be so utilized. This transfer is important to the wellbeing of my State. and I believe that this bill merits the sympathetic consideration of the Congress. It is the hope of university officials that the Fort Ruger site will become the location of the State medical complex. which will include the University of Hawaii School of Medicine. hospital. and laboratories. Some of these facilities already exist. but an expansion of the center will require a large increase in the number of buildings. Medical officials hope that the construction of the medical complex will enable the university to expand its program. In this era of a severe shortage of medical personnel. I think this goal should be encouraged by the Congress. The land which the Army will in turn receive is located close to Tripler Army Hospital. It is actually a much larger tract and is better suited for military housing than Fort Ruger. which is several miles away across the city of Honolulu. since it is closer to the major military bases. The land to be transferred to the Army is currently owned by a Hawaiian estate. The Hawaiian Legislature has already demonstrated its commitment to this project by giving the State authority and funds to purchase the land that will be transferred. This bill will cost the Federal Government nothing. Under the terms of my bill. the exchange must be equivalent in value. However. since the State will also be required to prepare the land in a manner similar to the site which the Army is surrendering. the actual cost to the State for purchase and preparatory services will be more than the market value of the Fort Ruger site. Appraisals and negotiations are currently being undertaken now. The objective of this bill is important. I hope that the Congress will give the measure its sympathetic and rapid approval.",

It would be of interest to the Members to know what some of the committees now dabbling in military matters have done on this subject. Have they looked into our commitments? Have they a basis to challenge our national policy? Have they written the President and raised the point that military spending is high. and we should review the commitments which require such an outlay? What has been done other than taking potshots at the military. which is merely trying to provide us with the means to fulfill the obligations incurred by treaties ratified by this body? Certainly all of us would like to see less money spent on defenses. provided we still maintain our military superiority. What good are housing. jobs. and food. if they are laid to waste by an enemy force? I am ready to cut anywhere It can be shown cuts can be made without placing us in a position of military weakness. or forfeiting the promises we have made to our allies. Some feel we could reduce some of our commitments. But I am frankly at a loss to say which one it might be. Should It be in NATO. which Is on the frontlines of the EastWest confrontation? Should we abandon Japan before they can defend themselves? Should we withdraw from our obligations in South America in face of the violent activities now underway by Communist infiltrators from Cuba and elsewhere? Where should we pull back? Can someone answer that question? For the most part. all of us have supported ratification of the treaties to which this country is honor bound. Let us provide the means to meet these obligations. or let us reduce these obligations.

The majority and minority views of the Senate Judiciary Committee have been printed and we have been treated to a variety of statements. both by Senators and by those outside the Senate. as to why they oppose Judge Carswells confirmation. These arguments have seemed to me to boil down to basically two: first. that Judge Carswell. during his tenure as a judge of the Federal district and circuit courts has not been sufficiently \"procivil rights\" in his decisions. and. second. that Judge Carswell is not sufficiently \"distinguished\" to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me first address myself to this question of \"distinction\" in judicial nominees. I find it a very difficult notion either to define or to explain. I take it that no one seriously questions Judge Carswells integrity. judicial temperament. or professional competence. The American Bar Associations standing committee on the Federa. judiciary has spoken rather emphatically on that subject. in discharging its obligation to determine whether or not a man nominated to be a Justice of the Supreme Court is or is not qualified for that position. That committee unanimously found Judge Carswell to be qualified and so advised the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 26. asked by opponents of the nominee. after the conclusion of the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. to reconsider its position. the committee unanimously reaffirmed its earlier determination. The committees communication to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee points out the difference between the question of professional competence and other factors that the President or the Senate may wish to consider in evaluating a nominee.

Judge Carswell has been subjected to the closest scrutiny by the Senate and the public. And the fact remains that this is the man the President wants.

There were a number of members of the bar that did complain and complain vociferously about the kind of treatment they received in the nominees court. They used the words \"intimidated.\" \"hollering.\" and \"scolding.\" One lawyer who supervised a large number of other lawyers throughout Florida during a 4year period of the 1960s. said that he felt it necessary to train them for appearances before Judge Carswell by harassing them and interrupting them as Judge Carswell repeatedly did. And other lawyers who appeared in his court corroborated that complaint. I would certainly hope the Senator. for whatever value he might place on it. would get a chance to review those comments. as well.

Certainly any Senator who wishes to oppose a nominee for the Supreme Court simply because of disagreement with philosophy is within his rights as a Senator to do so. but I suggest that it breaks with the tradition and practice of the Senate over the years. as I understand the history of the Senate. Senators have been very tolerant with respect to differences of philosophy when nominations to the Supreme Court have been considered. I would not try to characterize or categorize the philosophy of Judge Carswell. However. like the minority leader. I am quite sure that the philosophy of the nominee would not be completely in tune with mine. I know that there are decisions which have been handed down by the nominee which would not have been my decisions if I had been sitting in his place.

I certainly did not. and I do not believe my colleagues who signed the minority views did so. either. Realistically. I believe we would expect that during this administration. there might very well be nominees whose philosophy might be different from that of some of us who sit on the Judiciary Committee. we have had such nominees for every kind of position from U.S. marshal to Chief Justice of the United States. and we have not opposed their confirmation. But the point raised in the individual views. which is extremely basic with respect to this nominee. is whether the nominees personal prejudice and predilections interferred with the decisionmaking process. in his court. and affected his judicial temperament. his objectivity. and his fairness. I think it is a legitimate area of pursuit for those of us on the Judiciary Committee. and for all Members of the Senate. because it is a basic question and must be resolved. There were suggestions. comments. and statements by witnesses that indicated strongly that this happened. We will have an opportunity to review that evidence and examine it in some detail during the course of the debate. Obviously it is a question that reaches the essence of the question of the suitability of the nominee. even apart from the overall and threshold question of whether his general qualifications are such as to merit a Supreme Court appointment. This is a better portrayal of at least one of the areas of the reservations expressed by the Senators who signed the individual views.

The Senator from Indiana referred to several lawyers who had supported the Haynsworth nomination. I daresay that if the Senator looked again at that list. he would find a number of others. in addition. who supported. to the bitter end. the Fortas nomination as well. The point that I wish to make. at this stage of the discussionand I think that the Senator from Indiana would agree with meeven though we did not agree completely on the two previous nominationsis that in those instances the Senate was primarily concerned with questions relating to ethics. Justice Fortas was a liberal Democrat. as I viewed his philosophy. and Judge Haynsworth was a conservative Republican. as I viewed his philosophy. But the junior Senator from Michigan did not oppose either of those nominations on the basis of the philosophy of the nominees. In each of those situations. I could have found differences of philosophy with either of the nominees. But my position had nothing to do with the views or philosophy of either of those nominees. Like the Senator from Indiana. with whom I agreed concerning the Haynsworth nomination. I was troubled and disturbed by what I considered were substantial questions relating to ethics. Now then. so far as the nomination of Judge Carswell is concerned. I find no significant challenge or substantial question raised in the record involving ethical considerations. I find only arguments which focus primarily on the nominees philosophy. arguments based on the way he decided particular cases.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. genocide is abhorred universally. Unfortunately. many feel genocide is limited to the killing of members of a race and do not fully understand the several methods by which genocide can be inflicted. Varied methods of genocide have been used in the Soviet Union by that regime. Soviet Russia embarked on a subtle program of genocide in efforts to achieve a solution to their troublesome minorities problem. In Russsia the primary reason for failure to have achieved their proclaimed national goal of racial equality and minorities balance was attributed to group pride of the minorities and their stubborn resistance to Socialist programs of the Communist Party in power. To overcome the problems encountered in reaching their egalitarian goal the Communists instituted such forceful programs as busing. resettlement. relocation. and population quotas--which genocidal techniques were justified by the Bolsheviks as necessary reforms for economic and social progress. Lurking behind the seductive mask of the announced goal of the \"fully integrated society\" in the United States is the inescapable threat of similar genocidal activities ultimately being employed. Any governmental policies utilizing power or implied force to impose a percentage of racial and minorities balance must necessarily destroy. in whole or in part. national. racial. ethnical. and religious minorities as it moves to level all groups to a common denominator. News accounts daily show an increase in school disturbances. union disorders. and outbreaks of violence in other areas of our society normally peaceful. Yet. the American people. who would never tolerate or condone genocide. have not recognized that many of the current disorders are but the natural and spontaneous reactions by groups of innocent people to their instinctive perception of the impending danger from genocidal acts which inevitably accompany the establishment of any planned environment or community made a reality by force. Apparently some of the more ancient and cohesive cultures of the world have a more profound comprehension that there are other ways to destroy a people than the mere physical destruction of individuals in one generation of the group. For this reason. and to protect themselves and their posterity. from devious or more subtle genociral measures they have felt constrained to enact and ratify a convention which outlaws genocide in every form. See full text of the Genocide Treaty contained in my remarks September 16. 1969. at page 25703. Mr. Speaker. several current news accounts follow:",

It is an image. I might add. not improved much by interest rates which have now reached a record high of 81/2 percent. It is refreshing. therefore. when the curtain occasionally parts to reveal bankers as human beings after all. and in some instances more actively involved with human want and social injustice than in that image we often cherish of ourselves.

Yet I can assure you that it happened. that it happened not at the point of a gun. and that something more important than mere money was given. Ten thousand dollars would have been little enough to pay for public relations and good will. and the gesture might have been suspect had it ended there.

I agree wholeheartedly with President Nixon that this Nation must not \"break faith\" with those Americans who have every right to expect the social security system to protect them and their families from the brunt of continuing inflation. This has not been the case in the past. As the cost of living has increased substantially. social security benefits have remained relatively stable. and certainly inadequate to bear the brunt of inflation. I am delighted that the President has requested immediate legislative action which would guarantee that this impact of inflation will not happen in the future. I supported the Presidents proposal for automatic cost of living benefit increases. and as the people of Pennsylvania know. I have made the same suggestion myself earlier this year. I firmly believe this is one of the highest priority measures which Congress must face this session. For my part. I will press for Senate action this year in every way I can. Whether the increase should be 10 or 15 percent or somewhere in between is a question. of course. which must be determined by Congress. I have stated before that to be adequate it may have to be 15 percent. However. there is danger when we move beyond what the cost of living increase has been. I know that I could not suggest a percentage figure for an increase that would not immediately be doubled by a whole pack of irresponsible Democrats. I would like to keep the increase within the area of fiscal responsibility. However. I can assure my constituents and my colleagues in the Senate and President Nixon that I will press for Senate action this year.",

By act of Congress in 1963. this payment was authorized to married servicemen who were unable to take their wives and other dependents with them for assignments outside of the United States. The purpose of the allowance was to help offset the increased family expenses arising from a fathers separation from his family because of his military duties. The Comptroller Generals ruling has deprived nearly 10 percent of all those entitled to this allowance from receiving any further payments since December 1. 1968. To some. $30 does not seem a great deal of money. but to many service families who are just barely making ends meet. it is the- difference between solvency and financial trouble. This is especially so since the service families have included in their budgets this amount which they had been receiving every month since 1963. The legislation which I introduce today would change this situation by authorizing the resumption of this payment. I think that my colleagues will agree with me that quick action on this matter is imperative if we are to avoid further aggravation of this distressed situation.",

Present law requires. however. that the amount of such severance pay shall be deducted from any compensation for the same disability to which the veteran may be entitled under laws administered by the Veterans Administration. As severance pay often amounts to several thousands of dollars and recovery of this amount from disability compensation generally requires an extended period of time. the present recoupment provisions often result in hardship situations. On many occasions the serviceconnected disability. which may have been ratable at 10- to 30percent disabling at the time of discharge. unexpectedly changes into a totally disabling condition with consequent termination of the veterans income. In these instances the veteran may be granted a 100 percent disability rating by the Veterans Administration. but the recoupment provisions continue to bar the payment of disability compensation until such time as the full amount of severance pay has been recouped. * In order to alleviate this type of hardship situation. I am today introducing legislation to provide that the rate at which disability severance pay may be recouped should be limited to a monthly ! amount not in excess of the compensation to which the veteran would currently be entitled for the degree of disability assigned on his initial VA rating.

This appeared to me as a condition which I never realized could exist in this country of ours. a country which has such extraordinary affluence and wealth. Upon visiting many smaller. and even moderatesized villages. we found absolutely no kind of sanitary facilities at all. Children were drinking polluted water. and from this contracting a variety of diseases which prohibited their even attending school. Eightyfive percent of the native children there had ear infections. which directly affect their whole learning process. Nearly 15 percent of native children were hospitalized by serious sicknesses last year. In our conversations with a number of schoolteachers. they pointed out that many of the native children. Eskimo and Indian children. were not learning well because they suffered from hearing deficiencies. In talking with Public Health officials. we found that the principal reason for their suffering was lack of clean and adequate water supplies. As a result of using polluted water to bathe and wash in. and even drink. they were contracting diseases peculiar to Alaska. particularly the southwestern part of that State. We could elaborate. and I know the Senator from Alaska could elaborate. on the details of the conditions we found there. but they were some of the most desperate I have seen. including those In the barrios of Latin America and the hovels of Asia. It seems to me that an important step which should be madeand could be madeis providing fundamental kinds of sanitary facilities to many of the smaller communities and villages. I think it would go a long way toward permitting these people to live in some kind of human dignity. I want to say how much I appreciated working with the Senator from Alaska",

I would like to point out that this is Federal land. These are villages which are under the supervision of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. and our Public Health Service is responsible for their health. The measure contemplates a working relationship between the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare. There are less than 500 acres of land in private ownership in this area. which is twice the size of California. The reason why the State cannot move in that area is that it does not own the land. It has no way to get security for the advancement of any funds. There is no way for the State of Alaska to deal with this problem today. The Federal Government has both the title to the land and supervision over the people. They are wards of the Government until there is action taken on the Alaska native land claims settlement bill. This is another reason for the urgency of the matter. The State is now in a position where it can move ahead and try to improve the lot of the people through better housing conditions. schools. and roads. but until the State has some legal right to do it. we must rely upon the Federal Government. I feel we must move into this area now with a bold program to try to prevent the rapid increase in the death rate. Yesterday I pointed out that onefifth of the children in this area die in the first year of their life. and those who survive have a life expectancy of 34V2 years.

Seven of the plants required a permit from the Corps of Engineers because their construction plans included structures on navigable waters. one plant had intake and outfall structures located on U.S.-owned land and required a permit.

The real reason I asked the question is that we hear various kinds of propaganda which is designed to alarm the people and cause them to believe that only atomic powerplants create thermal pollution. That. of course. is not true. According to information furnished by the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration there were 10 cases of fish kill caused by discharge from power generating plants during the years 1962 to 1968. Every one of them was from a conventional powerplant. To date. to my knowledge. there has been no case whatever of fish kill being caused by thermal discharges from a nuclear powerplant. I wanted to make that clear. Yesterday I submitted two amendments in somewhat of a hurry. and they were printed. Upon further study of the situation. I realized that probably the bill which the Senator from Maine is now sponsoring would go as far as it is possible to go legislatively at this time and therefore I will not call up these amendments. I have one other question. It is about a matter which disturbs me considerably. in that apparently the certification procedure in the bill does not cover all industrial plants. We have had experiences in my State with paper mills. tanneries. and other types of industrial plants which contribute heavily to the pollution of our lakes and rivers.

That authority is on the books. The States are required. under that legislation. to set standards. I think this RECORD might be a good place in which to urge the Secretary to use his mandate and begin tightening these standards. As the Senator from Vermont probably knows. water quality standards have been set pursuant to the Water Quality Act of 1965.

For a long time there has been a paper mill on the New York side of Lake Champlain. Vermont has. I think. pretty good water quality standard laws. New York has only recently tightened its standards. But before anything was done. probably the lower quarter of Lake Champlain had become so contaminated that the people who live on the Vermont side could not use the water for domestic purposes. Of course. for a long time the Vermont standards were much higher than they were across the lake. in New York. Now the paper company on the New York side of Lake Champlain is building a very large mill. just up the lake from the old mill. Their representatives have told me that they will use about a thousand cords of hardwood a day. That is a very sizable mill. When the paper company representatives came to see me they told me that they can control. and plan to control the waste and contamination from the mill which would otherwise. as. it did from the old mill. have emptied practically untreated into the lake. They now plan to recover the fiber. and possibly the chemicals. and other matter which contribute to pollution. I do not know how far they will go. and I hope they are right. I am watching the situation closely. The new mill has been granted a license by the Corps of Engineers to construct an intake and outfall pipe into Lake Champlain. One thing which caused me to be a little apprehensive was that in looking at the plans. I found that the discharge pipe from the paper mill empties on the Vermont side of the lake.

The Departments new emphasis on motorization is completely contrary to the citys efforts to reduce vehicular traffic. It was just a year ago that the Nixon administration increased special delivery rates by 50 percentfrom 30 cents to 45 centsand now they are proposing not to improve special delivery service but to reduce it. a reduction that in some parts of the country has meant a complete elimination of the service. The reduction in New York City will provide just four special delivery runs a day throughout the city. instead of the 13 we now have in business districts and eight in residential areas. It also will mean that two of the four runsfor which the Department insists on using truckswill be made in rush hour: one between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. and the other between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. This service reduction has been opposed by New York Branch 36 of the National Association of Letter Carriers and because of the unions protests the reduction of service had been delayed for several months. but the Department is now scheduled to go ahead with the reduction on Monday.

The fact that a physician of his stature has taken so much of his time in composing this letter indicates that it is well worth our consideration. I believe.

I also feel that his letter provides excellent guidelines to the citizen which can help him in deciding which type of hospital can best provide the care he requires. Perhaps in our dismay over the present high costs of treatment. we have tended to overlook the low wages paid to hospital personnel in the past. Medical insurance is a privilege not provided to all of our citizens. The cost of coverage is prohibitive for many. yet their medical needs continue. It is imperative that medical care be a service for all. regardless of income.

A figure of $40 million is being discussed. The story is a familiar oneand a dire one. One of the most cogent statements which I have read with regard to the Cambodian invasion. and the wider war of which it is a part. was that made by Andrew W. Cordier. president of Columbia University. at a May 4 peace rally held on Columbias Morningside Heights campus. which is in the district which I represent. I would particularly note a small portion of President Cordiers statement. for I believe that it so well and so clearly expresses the feelings which I have expressed and fought for in this Congress. President Cordler said: The conflict is for the Vietnamese a disaster. and the expenditure of American lives and resources in that conflict is totally unwarranted. Our men must be brought home. The squandering of their lives in Vietnam and Cambodia must stop. The massive resources used day by day In support of American military involvement should be redirected with all possible speed to support major programs in our own crisisridden cities. These words of one of the leaders of the academic world. of the community which I represent. and of the entire country. should be well noted. I commend them. and the remainder of President Cordlers statement. to my colleagues. The statement follows:",

It is a Commission that has now been captured by the very industries whom it is supposed to regulatethe railroads. Every time that a railroad matter appears before the Commission. whether it involves rates. the discontinuation of a route. or some other matter. the decision is inevitably made in favor of the railroads rather than in favor of the public concerned. I completely agree with the distinguished senior Senator from Montana that the regulatory Commission should be very carefully examined in the next Congress. We should have hearings on whether we should continue the Interstate Commerce Commission. have a new commission. or abolish it entirely. The whole concept of a regulatory agency has been destroyed by. decision after decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It has been my obligation as a Senator from Montana. and also on behalf of other Senators and Representatives from the Northwest. to appear several times before the Interstate Commerce Commission to protest the discontinuation of such trains as the Main Streeter. the Great Northerns Empire Builder. and also the service from the Northern Pacifics North Coast Limited. Now that we have a consolidation of the BurlingtonNorthern. we have an automatic discontinuation of service insofar as these great railroads are concerned. We find that gradually they are automatically discontinuing service in the State of Montana and probably in .other States. I know that we will have a petition for discontinuation of service of the Main Streeter. the Great Empire Builder. or the Northern Pacifics North Coast Limited. We will have a gradual destruction of all of the main routes in Montana. The Interstate Commerce Commission. as the oldest regulatory commission concerned. should certainly be subjected to a congressional or a senatorial investigation as to its effectiveness and functions.

Many families were completely wiped out. Almost all seasonal workers. who were harvesting rice in lowlying fields close to the Bay of Bengal. were drowned. Coastal embankments provided some protection for those living behind them. Despite such protective embankments in many areas. the official death toll of those buried or reported dead is currently 200.000 and unofficial estimates are as high as 750.000 to 1 million. According to preliminary estimates. the lives of about an additional 2 million people have been severely disrupted by the disaster. About 250.000 houses were completely demolished and another 110.000 were partially damaged. Crops. including over 600.000 megatons of rice nearing harvest. were destroyed.

His is the most recent in a long line of support given to the pending legislation to improve the management pf this important area of the United States. Dr. Wenks statement of the primary issues cogently summarizes the problem. He said: Let me restate the primary issues: it is how to provide for many diverse and often conflicting coastal demands. public and private. and still obtain the greatest longterm social and economic benefits. We face an increasing pressure for more intense and variegated use of a scarce resource. and in the confusion of aspirants. we have responded on a first come. first served basis. We have almost completely neglected planning. Unless regional alternatives among competing uses are illuminated and then evaluated. we will rather helplessly continue to respond to claims motivated by shortterm advantages to individuals. industry or local governments. and perhaps to inflexible momentum of the federal bureaucracy. Private beach development restricts public access. Dredging and filling may downgrade commercial fishing. Offshore drilling rigs limit freedom of navigation. and estuarine waste disposal depreciates all surrounding recreational use. While each single action may be justified on its own merits. the effect of piecement development can be chaos. Mr. President. the importance of the coastal zone to the United States is highlighted by the support the National Governors Conference and the National Legislative Conference gave to the pending legislation. They have both ranked coastal zone management high on their list of priorities. In addition. the Council of State Governments has formed a Coastal States Organization. chaired by Dr. William Hargis. director of the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. which has actively pursued the interests of the coastal States to seek better management of this important area.

The executive branch is beginning to talk about expansionary policy needed to reverse the rising unemployment rate and the sagging economy. Part of the administrations problem has been its failure to recognize the economic facts of life. Sylvia Porters column in the Washington Star of December 1 puts very clearly and succinctly the actual state of economic recession caused by present administration policies. I am sure other Members of Congress will want to read her column. and I therefore ask unanimous consent that the column be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. Miss Porter notes that the present recession. now in its 17th month. is the longest of any of the five business downturns since World War II. Administration policies. she points out. have had less impact on inflation than in any of the four previous recession. She says: In fact. the upsurge In pricesprices at the wholesale level and touching the cost of livinghas been by far the sharpest recorded in any postwar recession period. Any claims *that the \"Game Plan\" is working would. she stresses turn \"the credibility gap into a credibility chasm.\" and she points to the \"nightmare combination of climbing unemployment. still sharply rising prices. sluggish business activity. fading profits. spreading bankruptcies and Wall Street disasters...\" She cites a renowned economist. Martin Gainsbrugh of the National Industrial Conference Board as indicating that if. as seems likely. there is no real growth in 1970. it will be \"the first occasion since 1938.\" One would have thought that the second \"Inflation Alert\" would have addressed itself to these problems. Instead. I can only find the repetition of the same old cliches. The administration refuses to adopt a wellrounded set of economic policies which would permit us to proceed expeditiously to high employment. and steady growth without inflation. While monetary and fiscal policies should be more expansionary at the present moment. there is a crying need for wage and price guidelines and selective credit controls to assure the American people that inflation will not resume its acceleration. and indeed. that prices can be stabilized while we seek our major goals of resumed growth and full employment.",

The first situation I am concerned with involves an organization of the above type which derives more than onethird of its normal support from sources consisting of membership dueseither from other organizations or individualsand subscription proceeds arising from the publication and sale of a scholarly journal. The remainder of its support comes in the form of grants from a private foundation that has consistently supported the organization. While I recognize that under certain circumstances a private foundation will be considered a substantial contributor and its grant cannot be used in determining whether onethird of the support comes from the public.

As I read proposed section 509 (a) (3). I wonder whether membership organizations which fail to qualify under the public support test because they have insufficient public support as compared to support from qualified persons. may nevertheless remain outside the definition of private foundation. Section 509(a) (3) states that an organization which is operated exclusively for the benefit of or in connection with a public charity and is not controlled by disqualified persons will also be excluded from private foundation status. Would not this section be applicable if an organization with two sources of supportsay. membership dues and other income from public sources amounting to 25 percent of its total support and grants from disqualified persons amounting to 75 percentwere to transfer the activities that were normally funded by the membership dues and other public sources into a separate charitable organization which would thereafter be the recipient of all such grants?

I think taxpayers are aware of the special provision included in the 1924 act. which was then raised for very legitimate reasons. Yet it has become one of the great tax loopholes of all time. We are fortunate that it was closed by the members of the Finance Committee in this bill.

This is the real substantive issue on this matter and it arises as follows: Because there was a modern history of racial segregation in the public schools in the South attributed to governmental action. the courts have held that when you come in to prove a case in order to bring about desegregation you do not have to prove that the school system continues to be segregated in violation of the Constitution. The fact that it was segregated according to law creates a presumption in that regard. Now. Mr. President.
