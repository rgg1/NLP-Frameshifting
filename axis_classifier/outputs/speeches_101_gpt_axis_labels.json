The spirit of the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio would say that during the course of the deficit summit over which this committee has no control. there no doubt will be additional decisions made on the budget numbers. As these budget decisions are made by the deficit summit. brought back here to the House and to the other body for confirmation. it is important that the conferees on this housing bill stick very closely. in fact. stick exactly to the budget numbers that the final budget conference provides for the House. It is no ones intention in this bill that the housing bill exceed the authorized amendment. authorized under the final budget agreement that this Congress would reach for all spending for this Congress. So. it is important that the conferees pay very strict attention and keep very strictly within the final budget agreement as arrived at by the House and the Senate. and only then will we have a housing bill that can make progress during the course of the coming decade. I strongly commend the gentleman from Ohio for holding this bill to some fiscal responsibility. and holding it to fiscal responsibility by not Just words and statements and resolution on the House floor. but by placing a statutory requirement in the bill itself that this bill. when finally authorized and signed into law. will be strictly within the letter of the budget agreement.",

Now. however. with the work that has been done on both sides. we can all feel assured that any problems that we had were worked out. It Is beyond the budget limitation to some extent. but I think the merits of the program deserve our support. The target. I believe. is excellent. particularly good for all of us. It makes it more widely acceptable to all and applicable to all parts of the Nation. and I think it is a visible and viable effort now to meet more of the lowincome housing needs. Finally. Mr. Chairman. I want to say with respect to the new production program that I think it is going to be a good one. and certainly in my area of the country it is going to be much needed. So.

I want to compliment the gentlewoman from New Jersey for the fine work that she has done in support of the Community Housing Partnership Act. I am also delighted to receive her support. which was critical to the passage of this initiative in both the subcommittee and the full committee. The gentlewomans initiatives with regard to the poor of not only her State. but throughout the country. is something that I have witnessed over 4 years and I very much appreciate the substantial efforts that she has made to improve the language in this bill and to make sure that her concerns for the poorest of the poor met with this legislation. Mr. Chairman. the reality is that in our country today as a result of the reductions in the Tax Code and the reductions and additions that the Congress has seen to put forth to direct appropriations for housing have effectively evaporated the use of housing by the forprofit sector in terms of getting lowincome housing built in America. As a result of that. nonprofit corporations from all over this country have moved in to fill the void. building over 150.000 affordable housing units over the course of the past few years. This legislation for the first time will provide some economic support from the Federal Government to those nonprofits. and the initiatives of the gentlewoman from New Jersey will make certain that the neediest of the needy are in fact served through this legislation. Her amendment calls for 50 percent. those individuals who spend a minimum of 50 percent of their income on rent be given first preferences. along with those individuals who live in substandard housing and who find themselves displaced. I think these are very important amendments. I think that they will do what I believe nonprofits would be in the business of accomplishing in any event. but I think that the reality is that it is important for the Congress to stipulate the exact nature of the need and the fact that this Congress is saying that we want the poorest of the poors needs addressed first. so I welcome the amendment and I look forward to its passage.",

It Is designed to address a problem that has effectively precluded development of federally assisted housing in Westchester County without having any affect on the balance of the New York metropolitan statistical area. The problem the amendment addresses arises because of the very high development costs in Westchester County coupled with the fact that the county is part of the New York metropolitan statistical area. Inclusion in the metropolitan statistical area has the effect of holding down the limitations which govern these programs and. because of high development costs in our area. has made development of urgently needed affordable housing uneconomic. The resultant inability to develop housing has made it impossible to respond effectively with Federal help to the housing problem in Westchester. We have the highest per capita homeless rate in New York State. The key figure which has inhibited federally assisted housing development is the median income calculation. A few comparisons will. I feel sure. make clear to my colleagues the discrepancy with reality caused by the current method of calculation which this amendment remedies. The New York MSA including Westchester County is subject to a $36.900 median income limitation. The Long Island suburbs of New York in Nassau and Suffolk Countieswhich are very comparable to Westchesterhave a median income of $49.600 according to recent HUD calculations. The Poughkeepsie MSA has a HUDdetermined median income of $44.000. This adjustment will correct that anamoly and make economically feasible federally assisted development in Westchester.

I would submit as important as this issue is it is my hope that the State Department will also take a broader look at how it can help rectify this problem. It was Eugene Dewey. who was a former Assistant Secretary of State and is now the Deputy U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs. who indicated recently that the Reagan administration back in 1982 did not do justice to the proposal by the Vietnamese at that time to fully settle the problem of those people placed in the reeducation camps. I am deeply concerned that some of the recent decisions by the State Department with respect to cutting back on the number of interviews being done each month in Vietnam under the ODP program could slow down the opportunities for those people who served lengthy sentences in these political reeducation camps to have a chance to come out of Vietnam. So again I want to congratulate my colleague. the gentleman from Virginia and at the same time make it clear that I believe that the State Department and our Government must do more in overcoming some of their concerns from a budgetary standpoint to see that this problem is addressed. Certainly we can solve the problem. as was demonstrated with the passage by this Congress of the Amerasian Homecoming Act. We are currently moving forward very quickly to resolve the issue of all of the Amerasian children fathered by American servicemen in Vietnam who were left behind when we pulled out of Vietnam in 1975. Out of the total numbers of Amerasians that are looking to come to the United States. we have already been able to interview more than half of them and over 12.000 of them in just the last year have left Vietnam to come to the United States. It is my hope that when Members like my distinguished colleague from Virginia focus the attention of this Congress on an outstanding humanitarian issue that it brings the day closer and sooner that we will be able to fulfill our responsibilities.",

I rise to express my strong support for Senate Concurrent Resolution 16. calling on the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to expedite the release and emigration of reeducation camp detainees. and I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his work on this legislation. Fourteen years have passed since the end of the Vietnam conflict. During the course of that conflict. thousands of opponents of the Socialist Government of Vietnam. including officials of the former Republic of Vietnam were detained without trial in reeducation camps. or prisons. since 1975. The 1980s saw a wave of amnesties granted which resulted in the release of many of these detainees. Nonetheless. despite these welcome releases. many thousands of Vietnamese citizens remain in longterm detention because of their suspected opposition to the current Vietnamese regime. This is in direct opposition to the publicly proclaimed position of the Vietnamese Government. which states that all detainees would be released and former detainees would be allowed to emigrate. By way of this resolution. the United States Congress will send a clear message to the Government of Vietnam that the release of the reeducation camp detainees is one of the highest priority items in our bilateral relations with that nation. At the July 1988 Hanoi negotiations. the United States and Vietnam agreed. in principle. on the resettlement of those released from the camps. Subsequently. much to the chagrin of United States negotiators. Vietnam suspended talks on this issue. This issue is simply too important to sweep under the rug. We call upon the Government of Vietnam to make public the names of those individuals who are still incarcerated. and to immediately release all remaining longterm prisoners. Accordingly.

I held a hearing in San Francisco on the issue of Southeast Asian refugees and their reasons for leaving their homelands. At that hearing. the tragic reality of Vietnams reeducation camps became clear. Thousands of political prisoners. with varying degrees of opposition to government policies. continue to be held in this gulag of camps or prisons. These camps number as many as 150 and have been the sites for massive numbers of executions since 1975. In July 1988. the United States and Vietnam agreed that prisoners released from reeducation camps would be resettled outside Vietnam. Yet Vietnam has failed to release even a list of the names of those people who are imprisoned. The Government of Vietnam also continues to restrict the free exercise of religion. Nearly 10 percent of the Vietnamese population is Roman Catholic. Priests have been forbidden from preaching in new economic zones and the Vietnamese Government has restricted the construction and repair of churches. Many priests have perished in reeducation camps. Madam Speaker. the Vietnamese Government would very much like to develop a full diplomatic relationship with the United States. Its economic problems necessitate this rapprochement.

There are instances where people have been about to be provided the right of first refusal by the Farmers Home Administration or the Farm Credit System when. in fact. they may have been convicted of criminal fraud prior to that. There is no reason to reward these types of people when they have actually used criminal fraud against the Government. We want to help honest farmers. producers. and borrowers who are the victims of adverse weather or farin credit conditions. We want to close this loophole that has permitted some borrowers found guilty of fraud against the Government from benefiting from the right of first refusal. Also. we find a few instances where some people are utilizing this right of first refusal opportunity and turning around within a short period of time and reselling their property at higher rates. and perhaps denying a sale to a beginning farmer. We consider that is not appropriate when the Government has extended the right of first refusal on the assumption that the farmer is going to continue farming. We are just tightening down on some loopholes that may have been inadvertently created in earlier enactments. would point out that the Farmers Home Administration [FmHAJ states that it will seek an amendment to this bill in the Senate. to prevent additional abuses. FmHA came forward with an amendment too late after our markup to include it in this bill. so they may ask the other body to take up that matter.

Let me also say that I want to commend our colleague. the gentleman from Nebraska . who has introduced similar legislation and who has worked with us on this legislation. Madam Speaker. H.R. 2469 is designed to correct two unintended problems which have arisen in the right of first refusal that was included in the borrowers rights provisions of the 1987 Credit Act. It was intended that some farmers who were forced off their farms by economic conditions beyond their control might find it possible to continue farming under improved conditions. The act included a provision which allowed them to have first priority in the resale of the land they lost. This right was included for both Farmers Home Administration and the Farm Credit System. An unintended cicurnstance has developed. however. Some persons are using this privilege for the sole purpose of selling the land to another party. Some who have the right of first refusal are actively seeking prospective buyers. Others. persons who have financial resources. are seeking persons with the right of first refusal to make a deal for the resale. The intent in the 1987 Credit Act was to help farmers forced off the land to get back into farmingnot make a profit on reselling their former land. H.R. 2469 would prohibit the resale of land for 2 years after the right of first refusal is exercised. A second problem has also arisen. Persons who have been convicted of fraud against Farmers Home are said to be planning to exercise the right of first refusal to regain control of the land. It was not intended for such a situation to occur. H.R. 2469 removes the right of first refusal from any person who has been convicted of fraud against the U.S. Government. and in the case of Farm Credit. any unit of the Farm Credit System as well. I urge the approval of H.R. 2469.",

H.R. 2281 extends a 2year. $50 million National School Dropout Demonstration Program which is already in current law. in the School Improvement Act of 1988.

Until funding is approved to launch this new larger school dropout prevention program. we must maintain the Federal commitment to attack the deplorable problem of school dropouts in our Nation. It has been estimated that the 1 million students who have dropped out of our high schools. just this year alone. will reduce revenues to the Treasury by $68 billion. and the students will lose $228 billion in lifetime personal earnings. Businesses are feeling the brunt through spending $210 billion annually on employee training in basic reading. writing. and arithmetic.

I rise in support of H.R. 2281. a bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 which will continue authority for a dropout prevention program. As you know. the problem of students dropping out of school Is a staggering problem in this country. Last Congress. we created two programs aimed at helping to combat this problem. The smaller program received funding. the larger did not. This bill extends authority to fund the smaller program. The larger program would need approximately 20 times the funding as the smaller program extended in H.R. 2281. At this time. I believe that such a large funding requirement is probably a budgetary impossibility. H.R. 2281 will allow us to continue our support of combating the problem of dropouts in a smaller and more targeted program. Through this bill. we can choose to fund either one or the other program. but not both. The larger program mirrors the chapter 1 program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. which targets Federal support for basic skills education. As a practical matter. money used in the chapter 1 program could be used for services in the high school. however. due to funding shortages. local educators almost without exception use all the chapter 1 money in the early grades. This program would direct money toward the higher grades. Even though I may prefer to have the larger program funded. the bill recognizes the practical reality of these fiscal times. During our consideration of this bill we have included some changes suggested by the Department of Education. Two changes included during the full committee markup address the evaluation process and allow the Secretary of Education to reserve funding for the evaluation. Furthermore. the amendments require that a report be submitted in a timely fashion. Finally. the bill recognizes the importance of educational partnerships and allows for the Secretary to fund more partnerships. I hope you will join me in support of H.R. 2281. so that we may continue our support of stopping this tremendous problem of students dropping out of school.",

Here is a hint: It is not the football contest being waged on Sunday in New Orleans. It is the childish game that is being played daily here in Washington. Day after day. we continue to allow the Bush administration to hide behind the growing surplus in the Social Security trust fund rather than facing the reality that in all other accounts the budget deficit in 1990 is not $141 billion but closer to $206 billion. It Is clear that the administration intends to continue to allow Social Security revenues to mask the deficit and further use the Social Security payroll tax as an ongoing source of funding for the general budget. Those Social Security funds were not intended to be used for a purpose other than protecting the retirement income of upcoming generations of retirees. We can put an end to this \"great budget charade of the 1980s.\" and return to honest budgeting. We can move ahead with legislation. which I am introducing today. that rescinds the Social Security payroll tax increase that went into effect on January 1 and reduces the FICA tax to 5.1 percent in 1991.

And we can put additional dollars in the pockets of American workers.

That would gut the trust fund and imperil the retirement benefits of todays workers. What we need to do is to make the trust fund immune from political temptation and save the reserve for future retirees. The way to do this is to refund annually the portion of the reserve not needed for current benefits into individual Social Security retirement accounts for every American worker. Workers would own these accounts. invest and reinvest them in safe investments and have them available upon retirement for a portion of their retirement benefits. Congress could not get its hands on the money. the retirement of future workers would be protected. and we would build a tremendous base of savings and investment under our economy that would lower interest rates. promote economic expansion and give every American worker a financial stake In the success of our economy.

This bill was introduced to address the erosion of judicial independence resulting from the Supreme Court decision in Pulliam versus Allen. In a case of statutory interpretation. the Supreme Court in Pulliam held that judicial immunity is not a bar to injunctive relief or an award of attorneys fees against a judicial officer acting in his official capacity. This is simply not appropriate. Congress must rectify the omission of these prohibitions by amending the relevant Federal statutes. The notion of judicial independence is deeply embedded in our common law heritage. It is essential to ensure justice because judicial officers must be free to make appropriate decisions within their official capacity without fear of reprisal. An independent judiciary is a vital component in any democracy which cannot be compromised. Mr. President. the bill before us today will restore the independence of State court justices and judges. If enacted. it will prevent injunctive relief actions against State court judges unless a declaratory decree was violated.

The President unveiled his plan at a White House meeting this morning. and I believe it represents a constructive. responsible approach to dealing with the major issues of child care and child development. I know nearly all of us have some variation of a childcare proposal introduced. A number of Members have on this side. and certainly a number have on the other side. This was a matter that President Bush discussed at some length in the campaign. I think in addition to the bill on child care he will introduce a bill which would expand the Head Start Program. which has been one of the most effective and popular programs around here for a long. long time. It is a good program. Child care. in my view. is not a partisan issue. Republican or Democrat. it is a family issue. It is an issue that is going to be addressed this year. I know that Senator DODD and Senator HATCH and many others have been working on different versions. Senator DODD has a preference. Senator HATCH probably has a preference. but I do believe that both parties have indicated publicly that we are going to do something about this problem. and we are going to try to address it in a way that is affordable and in a quality way. and I think that President Bushs plan is a step in the right direction.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on behalf of myself. Senator PACKWOOD. and Senator HEINZ. I am pleased to introduce a joint resolution designating November 1989 and 1990 as National Hospice Month. Hospice became a permanent covered benefit under Medicare and an optional State Medicaid benefit in April 1986. Today. over 625 hospice programs are Medicare certified. It has been a relatively short time since hospice came to the United States as a concept from England. The first hospice opened in 1974. Today. about 1.700 programs exist in each of the 50 States. an indication that Americans now see hospice care as a legitimate and needed alternative to the more traditional care of the terminally ill provided in institutions. In my home State of Texas. the number of hospice programs has doubled since 1986. Sixty hospices currently provide medically directed. interdisciplinary programs of palliative services to the terminally ill and their families. with spiritual support and bereavement counseling available in both home and inpatient settings. Hospice gives support to the patient who might otherwise suffer through his last stage of life alone and in fear. hospice reminds the family members that it is acceptable to be angry and to feel loss. and that they are not alone. The pain of AIDS has given an even greater challenge to the hospice philosophy. as programs around the country develop specialized programs of care to help AIDS victims and their families. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. which will focus attention on hospice care and all those who serve and are served by the Nations hospices. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. it is a pleasure to join with my colleagues. Senators BENTSEN and PACKWOOD. in introducing a resolution to designate November 1989 and 1990 as \"National Hospice Month.\" This 2year resolution will help recognize hospice care as a humane response to the needs of those who are terminally ill. Hospice is much more than Just a residence for the terminally ill: it provides emotional support and medical care to terminally ill persons. enabling them to live out the end of their lives in dignity. and as fully and comfortably as possible. In addition. hospice offers emotional support and understanding to the families of their terminally ill residents. Mr. President. as you know. most hospice patients are faced with severe pain and suffering while their families are faced with feelings of helplessness and frustration. While traditional hospital care is committed to treating and curing diseases. for most hospice patients there is no cure. Pain control and family support are often the only antidotes for these patients. an antidote that is not often found in an institutionalized setting. Hospice care is an alternative to traditional hospital care and the purely clinical treatment and separation from family that goes along with it. Hospice care provides an alternative that focuses not just on how long life lasts but also on the quality of that life. This resolution also helps recognize the hard work and dedication of those who make hospice care such a valuable service. Without the efforts of home health aides. social workers. registered nurses. clergy. and volunteers. hospice care as we know it would not be possible. It is their dedication to helping those who are most in need that makes hospice care a reality. Mr. President. this resolution celebrates the hope and caring that hospice brings to terminally ill patients and their families. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. so that we may again reaffirm Congress support for hospice care.e By Mr. REID (for himself. Mr. BRYAN. and Mr. KERREY): S.J. Res. 79.

LEVIN. and STEVENS expressing the sense of the Congress that there should be no further restrictions on the Federal interest tax deduction for first and second homes. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative MARGE RouxEmA. Mr. President. the mortgage interest deduction has been restricted twice by Congress during the last 3 yearsfirst in 1986 when the deduction was limited to two homes. and again in 1987 when it was capped at $1 million of mortgage debt. In recent months. however. some have suggested that the mortgage interest deduction should be further restricted to help reduce the deficit or to provide necessary funding for other Federal programs. Yet. if Congress were to further restrict the mortgage interest deduction it would have little effect on the current deficit of $159 billion. According to the Congressional Budget Office [CBO]. if the mortgage interest deduction were capped at $20.000 for a joint return and $12.000 for a single return. it would raise only $600 million in the first year. In addition. CBO reports that phasing out the deduction for second homes would generate about $500 million. Clearly. further restrictions would do little to help reduce the Federal budget deficit. It is my hope that the resolution I am introducing today will give others in the Senate an opportunity to go on record in opposition to further restrictions to the mortgage interest deduction. and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a resolution calling for economic Justice for Americas mailorder companies and the American consumer. Legislation is pending in Congress which would turn mailorder companies into tax collectors for each and every one of our 50 States. I think Americans already pay enough taxesand if they write to a mailorder company in another State to buy something they want. they shouldnt have to pay sales taxes on the purchase to their own State. Mr. President. it is the right of your State under the U.S. Constitution to levy taxes on you as a resident and to require companies in your State to collect those taxes when you buy from them. It is not the right of your State to require companies located elsewhere to collect those taxes. Thats what some State legislators would want them to do. Bills are pending in Congress that would allow the States to require mail order firms to collect the tax at the time of the sale. In effect. they want to turn mailorder companies in other States into collection agents for their own State treasuries. Mr. President. this wouldnt be just unfairit would be an entirely unwarranted restriction on interstate commerce. It would hurt consumers. especially the elderly. handicapped. and rural families who rely on mailorder services for their important purchases. It would hurt the mailorder companies and their employees. Consumers trying to make mailorder purchases would be forced to plow through an Intricate maze of State and local taxestaxes which often affect different items differentlyto try and determine the applicable tax. and then actually figure the amount due. No retail store imposes this kind of burden on its customers. It strikes many of my constituents and me personally as unfair and unnecessary. Mr. President. the proposal to require mallorder companies to collect outofState sales taxes should be called an \"abuse tax\"-because it abuses consumers. businesses. the economy and the U.S. Constitution.

On January 3. when I introduced House Joint Resolution 56 disapproving the pay increase.

But we are not sent here to sit on our hands. Mr. Speaker. we were sent here to represent our constituents. and the way we do that is to vote. so the fact that we are here in session today. debating this very issue. is testimony to the fact that in this House. the people do rule. But we should not let this issue rest with the vote that will be taken here today. We need to reform the procedure by which Congress sets its pay. And the best way to do that is to do what James Madison first proposed to this body 200 years ago. and that is to make it clear that no sitting Congress should raise its own pay. Madisons amendment. which was proposed as part of the original Bill of Rights. is still very much alive todayin fact. 25 States have not ratified it. On January 3. I also introduced House Joint Resolution 55. which embodies the Madison amendment. It says that no pay raise may take effect until after an intervening election. If we really feel we are worth more. we should have the guts to say so and then stand for election with that fact made plain. We also have to separate pay for ourselves. from that of the executive and judiciary. It is wrong to hold them hostage. Lets make this vote today a tribute to the foresight of James Madison. Lets vote this raise down. and then vote to reform the method. The American people deserve no less.",

I am voting in favor of raising the pay of Congressmen because I think 535 vice presidents of the largest corporation in the world. who make life and death decisions affecting people all over the world. deserve to be paid at the level recommended by the Commission. Even with this 51percent increase. congressional pay will remain below the level of $143.000. which would be the amount of pay Congressmen would receive if congressional pay had kept pace with inflation. Despite the stampede atmosphere created by the media the public should be reminded that this pay raise is the recommendation of an objective commission and was approved by the most popular President in recent history. as well as by the incoming President. It is unfortunate that a mob hysteria has been generated over a matter which will have no significant impact on the overall budget for fiscal year 1990. Meanwhile. this diversionary headlinegrabber has taken the attention of the American people away from the real budgetbusting monster on the agenda of the Congress. The savings and loan association scandal represents a $90billion swindle which will paralyze the national budget for the next 4 years. There will be no money to invest in educational reform. job training. or better health care. This savings and loan association ripoff constitutes the greatest and most brazen scandal in the history of the Nation. We are being plunged into socialism for the banking industry in order to compensate for the misdeeds of incompetents and criminals. The failing savings and loan institutions are a network of racketeering enterprises which operated for a long time in collusion with certified public accountants and Government regulators.

I am pleased that we finally have the opportunity to vote openly and on the record in opposition to this raise. The recommended increase for Members of Congress from $89.500 to $135.000 can only be called excessive in the face of the budget deficit this Congress was elected to deal with. When we appropriate 4 percent increases for civil service and military employees. and grant our retirees inflationrate COLAs. it is impossible to justify a 50percent raise for ourselves. The public outcry on this issue has come from all segments of our society. and it has not just been over the size of the increase recommended by the Quadrennial Commission. I have heard from literally hundreds of constituents. and many of them tell me they wouldnt necessarily object to the increase itself. as long as it was voted on. In letters. phone calls. and at town meetings across the Second District last month. I heard the same thing. If Congress wants a raise. why are they going about it in such a underhanded manner? If they think they deserve one. why not vote on it? I have had a hard time answering why Congress does not want to be held accountable for its actions to the very people who put them in office. The response to our actions. or rather inacion. up to this time. emphasizes the need to act now to reform our system. We must make changes which allow us to be straightforward with our constituents. The rules of the House must be changed to require a separate. recorded vote on any proposal. whether it is legislative in nature or a recommendation from the executive branch. which would change the salary for Congress. Also. such changes in salary. if approved. should not take effect until the beginning of the next Congress. Changes in the Presidents income are by law prospective. Why should Congress be any different? We were sent here to represent the people in our districts. For their trust in our ability to make the choices on the tough issues. we owe them this vote.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong opposition to the proposed 50 percent pay raise for top Government officials. The recommendations of the Presidents Commission on Executive. Legislative. and Judicial Salaries would raise the salary of Federal judges and Members of Congress to $135.000. and would raise the salaries of Cabinet members to $155.000. In an era of huge budget deficits and the resulting pressure to cut Federal spending. a 50percent pay raise is at best illtimed and most certainly sends the wrong signal to the American public that top elected and appointed officials are not willing to share the burden of deficit reduction. My constituents in the Fifth Congressional District of Alabama. like Americans all across the country. have sent a very genuine and very strong message of disapproval of the pay Commissions proposals. They have also expressed an overwhelming desire that the Congress. by recorded vote. approve any pay increases for top Government officials just as we do for other employees of the Federal Government and for beneficiaries of Federal programs. It is a basic question of Congress accountability to the people who elect us and I wholeheartedly agree that we should vote on any pay increase. As a cosponsor of H.R. 533. a bill that would abolish the Federal Pay Commission. require a recorded vote on any future pay increases. and delay the implementation of any pay raise for Members of Congress to the next term. I believe the current system is flawed and should be changed permanently.

Hundreds of calls and letters have flooded my office objecting to the pay raise and the same has occurred at offices all over Capitol Hill. Like many of my constituents. I object to the size of the raise at a time when our Nation is facing the most serious budget deficit in history. The public is demanding a public vote on this subject and thats exactly what we should do. Raises of this sort need to be approached in the same manner as other Government expenditures. Other Federal workers. State workers. and Social Security recipients receive a costofliving adjustment [COLA] every year to cover the rise in inflation. In past years. Congress exempted itself from the COLAs. which led to the Quadrenniel Commissions recommendation of a large. lumpsum increase. Senators and Representatives should be treated as any other civil servant. with their salaries rising with the inflation rate. If any raise is to be considered above that. it should be tied to legislative achievements. such as reducing the Federal deficit. The salaries for judges. however. need to be addressed immediately. Our inaction in this area has caused a crisis in the judicial branch. Between 1958 and 1973 only 6 Federal judges resigned from the bench. From 1974 to the present that number rose to 57. Its clear that people with decades of expedience as judges are not going to accept the salary of entrylevel lawyer. This is a legitimate public policy concern that should be addressed by Congress. Congress needs to reform the Federal pay system to prevent more dedicated judges and civil servants from fleeing to the private sector.",

The item that we will be voting on today would turn down that recommendation of increase in pay for high levels of the administration. for Judges. and for Members of Congress. So much ink has been spilled and so many hands have been selfrighteously wrung over this topic in recent weeks that it is time to complete this cynical exercise. Since the founding of this great Republic. Washington has tied itself in knots every few years trying to evade the inevitable conflicts of interest in setting Federal salaries. In this circumstance we are dealing with the Quadrennial Commission report that suggested a certain level of pay. At the same time that report suggested that we consider eliminating honoraria or outside income. I think it is important for the public to understand that the proposal would have done 2 things: Establish this level of pay. but. beyond that. take approximately half of that level of that pay away by eliminating outside special interest income. In recent years I personally have become very concerned and uneasy with the honoraria process. and it is time for us to address that matter. But we are not going to reduce Members pay as a result. It is very important that Members recognize that if. in the future. we are to attract the kind of quality personnel we need in the House to meet the major challenges we face. indeed we must pay at a level that will attract the best that is available for public service. In this instance I am afraid we are walking away from that responsibility. It is very clear that the vote today will be overwhelming to reject the Commissions report. It is the result of a public furor that may not completely understand the needs and demands of the House.

In visiting with those people. they always. early in the conversation. say. \"Tell us about your transportation. We want to know about water transportation in and around the area that you are trying to entice us to invest money.\" Fortunately. in my area we have the intercoastal canal and the Gulf of Mexico. But they also want to know about railroads. about air transportation. about highways. and the concern I have is that some of these people will start reading of some of the infrastructure problems that we have. Recently I saw a Federal highway study that referred to 40 percent of our bridges in the Nation. 20 feet In length or longer. that are functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. When you get concerned about that and then start looking at actions against our airlines. which more and more are providing not only passenger travel and passenger miles and seats on airplanes. but the statistics increase substantially each year and the industrial transportation of raw products and finished products is growing each year. In fact. I read about airports being built just to handle nonpassenger loads on airplanes. Then you look at the studies that indicate that 60 percent of our paved highways need some sort of surface rehabilitation. This demonstrates that we cannot ignore our transportation needs whether we are talking about highways or waterways. and particularly our air transportation. which is even more vital in foreign competition.",

Then when you hear the employees of a company brag about the company. about how wellmanaged it is. how the employees are happy to work there and want to stay there and work until they retire. it goes to the point of this being another transportation problem that we should try to avoid. instead of letting it deteriorate like 00 percent of our road surfaces and 40 percent of our bridges.

In other words. it has never been my understanding that we would be the ones to tell them how to spend their administrative budget. We do from time to time. if we think there is some problem. but I would hope the general procedure would be that they would get a general appropriation within broad categories. and as the Congress decided and the President agreed to add tests. those tests would be assumed to be within the general administrative budget.

I would like to engage in a discussion with the gentleman from Georgia related to a topic of great interest to all Members. As you know. section 1751 of the bill waives food stamp quality control sanctions against States from fiscal year 1982 through 1990. The waiver will allow States to focus on the present and future administration of the Food Stamp Program. Notwithstanding the strong likelihood of passage of legislation waiving the sanctions. the State Food Stamp Appeals Board has begun the process of scheduling evidentiary hearings on fiscal year 1984 food stamp quality control cases. According to my State. preparation for these hearings will require the investment of substantial resources. The 33 States appealing the fiscal year 1984 sanctions now face the prospect of having to pursue lengthy and expensive litigation regarding those sanctions notwithstanding the expressed intent of the House Agriculture Committee to waive those very sanctions. I. therefore. would like to go on the record in urging USDA to suspend all proceedings on fiscal year 1984 food stamp disallowances pending final action on the farm bill.",

The gentlemans amendment proposes to add at the end of title 18 \"Improvement of the Agricultural Economy\" a new subtitle E dealing with animal protection. His amendment specifically amends section 16(c) and adds a new section 28 to the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.). Subtitles A through D of title 18 deal with grain quality improvements. agricultural cooperation and development. other provisions. and reports and studies. The gentlemans amendment. however. would amend the Animal Welfare Act. a statute not mentioned in title 18. or for that matter. anywhere else in the bill. In other words the gentleman is attempting to amend a statute that is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture but is not included in H.R. 3950. It is well established under the rule of germaneness that an amendment must relate to the subject matter under consideration and that it must be related to the fundamental purpose of the bill. In this case the subject matter under consideration has nothing to do with the issues addressed under the legislation before us today. Mr. Chairman. if the gentlemans amendment were to be held in order it could mean that any statute with the jurisdiction of a House committee would be open for amendment every time an omnibus bill was considered in the House.

And what this amendment does is give the U.S. Department of Agriculture authority to enforce those guidelines we set forth in the 1985 farm bill. and it follows that or should follow that a law set down in the 1985 farm bill is germane and can be amenced under this provision of the 1990 farm bill. because all we are doing is really amending the 1985 farm bill. and that is basically all we are doing with this particular bill.

Veal calves are taken from their mothers when they are only a few days old and live the rest of their lives chained in individual wooden crates. They are fed only milk replacers and live in dark areas in order to keep them anemic. In addition to the calves being treated so Inhumanely. they also pose a health threat to humans. Since the veal calves are anemic. they are often infected with diseases. Therefore. farmers routinely feed the calves antibiotics to ward off these infections. Recently. the centers for disease control traced a food poisoning outbreak in California to antibiotic use on farms. They concluded that drugresistant salmonella bacteria are transferred from farm animals to humans. and that routine use of antibiotics in farm animals contributes to the problem. In addition to the use of antibiotics. farmers use other drugs that have not been approved for use in calves. The two commonly used drugs are nitrofurazone. which is a carcinogen. and chloramphenicol. which can produce a fatal bone marrow disease. Furthermore. these two drugs can only be obtained illegally. Mr. Speaker the passage of this measure will require farmers to make sure the calf is free to move around without difficulty. lie with its legs outstretched. and groom itself. without any impediment. as well as ensure the calf is fed a daily diet containing sufficient iron and digestible fiber to prevent anemia and to sustain full health.

The men and women honored by the memorial willingly accepted the responsibilities as firefighters to protect the lives and property of others. For some. their dedication and courage led them to dangerous situations which ultimately claimed their lives. As a representative of dozens of small communities. many times I have heard the local fire departments whistle blow. and witnessed a virtual transformation of a town. Men and women. without hesitation. rush from their jobs and families to help their neighbors. I can think of few professions and voluntary organizations which demand this unselfish attitude by both the firefighters and their families. Although the memorial lists only the names of the fallen firefighters. we know that without the support of their families. we would not have a courageous fire service. I am extremely grateful for the support of this resolution by my distinguished colleague and chairman of the libraries and memorials subcommittee. Chairman BILL CLAY. As we know. this resolution was approved by the House in the last Congress. and I appreciate the chairmans willingness to keep it going this year. Without his interest. and the help of his staff who took a day to come to Emittsburg to see the memorial. this national recognition would not have been possible. In addition. I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on House Administration. Chairman ANNUNZIO. and the ranking minority members of both the subcommittee and full committee. Mr. GILLMOR and Mr. THOMAS. With this resolution. we are nationally recognizing the heroic actions and courage of the fallen firefighters. I am delighted to be able to join in this national appreciation of our fire services.",

House Joint Resolution 183 recognizes the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg. MD. as the official national memorial to volunteer and career firefighters who die in the line of duty. Each year a ceremony is held at the memorial to honor those firefighters who have given their lives to help others. It is a moment to pay tribute to these firefighters but also an opportunity to thank their families for they too have given through their loss. I am especially pleased to note that the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial pays tribute to both professional and volunteer firefighters. In this it is unique. The contributions of these firefighters are identical. in that each has made the ultimate sacrifice. The memorial honors them regardless of how they came to firefighting. and well it should. Perhaps the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow best capture the spirit of this Memorial: Were a star quenched on high. For ages would its light. Still travelling downward from the sky. Shine on our mortal sight. So when a great man dies. For years beyond our ken. The light he leaves behind him lies Upon the paths of men.",

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the American Association of Retired Persons TaxAide Program which has served older taxpayers effectively and efficiently during its 21 years of existence. I have always supported efforts to educate the public and provide free tax counseling to lowincome and elderly Americans. TaxAide began modestly in 1968 with four volunteer tax counselors who assisted or helped to prepare approximately 100 tax returns for elderly taxpayers. The program has grown rapidly and impressively in recent years. During the 1988 tax season alone. more than 1.5 million tax returns were prepared by TaxAide counselors. In addition. many other benefits have been gained by older Americans. the Internal Revenue Service. and our Nation as a whole. TaxAide counselors have helped to ensure that older Americans claim all lawful deductions and other benefits under the Internal Revenue Code. Unfortunately. today many older Americans needlessly overpay their taxes each year. for a variety of reasons. Some are confused by the tax form. Others are overwhelmed by the tax law. Numerous elderly persons are simply unaware of available deductions and other tax relief measures. TaxAide. though. has provided an effective means to protect older Americans from overpaying their income tax. The program assists IRS by increasing taxpayer compliance. TaxAide counselors enable the IRS to serve more effectively hardtoreach older taxpayers. particularly those residing in nursing homes. elderly minorities. and the rural aged. Additionally. volunteers serve as instructors for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program. which enables IRS personnel to perform other services. Finally. the TaxAide Program provides an opportunity for elderly volunteers to engage in purposeful and fulfilling activity by helping others in their communities. Throughout its history. TaxAide has received several awards for the valuable contributions that it has made to our Nation. the IRS. and the communities where the program operates. Among these awards. TaxAide has received a Presidential citation and the IRS Commissioners Award for outstanding and significant volunteer service in the public interest. Recently. I had an opportunity to attend and speak at a ceremony of the Public Employees Roundtable honoring TaxAide for assisting elderly taxpayers in filing accurate and timely returns. I would like to once again offer my commendation and personal thanks to all the TaxAide volunteers for their service to older taxpayers.e",

Senator MITCHELL. as 1 of the 57 cosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 40. which designated June 21. 1989. as Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner Day. That date is important for all of us to remember. It was 25 years ago that James Chaney. Andrew Goodman. and Michael Schwerner volunteered to work on the Freedom Summer project. an interracial voter registration campaign. The project took them to Philadelphia. MS. in late June 1964 to ensure that the right to votethe birthright of every citizen in this countrywas extended to black Americans in the Deep South. It was a worthy effort. It was a noble effort. It also cost these three young men their lives. Many of us can still recall the moment we heard the shocking news of their murders. Their deaths were intended to deter the civil rights movement but they had just the opposite effect: They mobilized hundreds of thousands of Americans to redouble their efforts to end second class citizenship status for any American. James Chaney. Andrew Goodman. and Michael Schwerner represent an integral part of a national civil rights movement to protest racial discrimination. This movement led to passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. two of the most effective civil rights laws ever enacted by Congress. The lives and deaths of Chaney. Goodman. and Schwerner symbolize the dream of brotherhood among citizens of this Nation from all races. religions. and ethnic backgrounds. Their sacrifice should always encourage all Americans to rededicate themselves to the ideals of justice. equality. and community. James Chaney. a black American from Meridian. MS. Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. white men from New York. These names are part of our history. But history fades. like so many other memories. and it is easy to forget.

The cause of racial harmony. of social and economic justice did not die 25 years ago.

The desecration of the flag is not an expression of speech. it is an act that should be a crime. The flag is a shining symbol of this Nation. its desecration is an offense against our veterans who sacrificed their lives and is an offense against all those who love this great country and cherish its freedoms.

Long and difficult negotiations lie ahead of us. The United States must continue to provide sustained support for a full national reconciliation in Angola leading to free and fair elections. The actions of UNITA and the MPLA are an important diplomatic first step in which the U.S. Government should take great satisfaction. It was United States support to UNITA that finally convinced the MPLA and their Soviet and Cuban backers that there could be no military solution In Angola. This realization produced the Tripartite agreement signed on December 22. 1988. between Angola. Cuba and South Africa. After years of denying UNITAs existence as a legitimate nationalist force. the MPLA has agreed to direct negotiations. Again. it was the consistency of U.S. policy that produced this result. Early in his administration. President Bush affirmed that the United States will continue to support UNITA until national reconciliation is achived. The U.S. Congress has repeatedly reinforced the administrations position on Angola. Just last week the Senate and House agreed to my amendment to the fiscal year 1989 dire supplemental appropriations bill which strengthens the Tripartite agreement and restates U.S. policythat the United States will continue to support UNITA until genuine national reconciliation is achieved. Our Angola success demonstrates that we can form a strong bipartisan foreign policy. It illustrates the importance of a coherent foreign policy that is reached cooperatively between the administration and the Congress. The road ahead will be difficult. The United States must continue to strongly support UNITA so that the dual objectives of a government of national unity and free and fair elections are achieved. Once an agreement is reached that is satisfactory to both parties. the U.S. Government should consider how it can help the newly established government rebuild a nation.*",

I would like to take just a moment of the Senates time in recognition of one of our Nations finest correspondents. Charles Mohr was a dedicated correspondent whose work transversed four decades. Employed by the New York Times for a quarter of a century. he was this agencys chief correspondent in Vietnam and their chief correspondent for Southeast Asia. Charles Mohr was indeed most recognized for his reporting on the Vietnam war. His reporting in this area was critical. descriptive. objective. and honest. Truth was the goal and the guiding force. Charles Mohr. one might say. valued truth more than safety. be it safety in physical wellbeing or safety of career. As a correspondent covering the Vietnam war. he in a very real sense shared the dangers of battle. his receipt of the Bronze Star certainly attests to this. In his career. his refusal to adapt his reporting to enormous pressures similarly revealed his independence and integrity. As knowledgeable in the political realm as in foreign affairs. he was a White House correspondent during several Presidential administrations. He most recently reported on military issues and was one of a team of eight journalists which received the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism in covering the Reagan administrations socalled star wars program. All this being so. there was yet a greater impact which Charles Mohr had within and on his profession. His was an example of professionalism. of incisiveness. objectivity. and analytical prowess. Colleague Robert McFadden termed Mohr a \"consummate correspondent\" while Tom Wicker praised him and I.F. Stoneanother fine correspondent who died this past weekendas being characteristically \"cleareyed\". His was reporting at its best. mamed by ability. brilliance. and dedicationqualities for which there is no substance in the field of Journalism or any other profession. It was Walter Lippmann who stated: \"Without criticism and reliable and intelligent reporting. the government cannot govern.\" Charles Mohr helped us to better understand world events. to better understand the truth.

It has a longstanding tradition of cooperation with Industry through efforts such as application and commercialization of technology and technolo. gy transfer. Furthermore.

NABSE has as its purposes: First. to promote and facilitate the education of all students. black students in particular. Second. to establish a coalition of black educators and others directly and indirectly involved in the educational process. Third. to create a forum for the exchange of ideas and strategies to improve opportunities for blacks. Fourth. to identify and develop black professionals who will assume leadership positions in education. Fifth. to influence public policy concerning the education of black people. In view of these purposes. I believe that it Is timely that we recognize the founder of this organization. Dr. Charles D. Moody. Sr.. on the occasion of the 20th anniversary celebration. Dr. Charles D. Moody. Sr.. founder of the National Alliance of Black School Educators [NABSE] Is hereby commended for being a visionary and seeing the need for all children. but particularly African American children. to have the quality and quantity of education they so deserve. This great vision resulted in the creation of the National Alliance of Black School Educators which he founded in 1970 for black superintendents. Three years later. the membership was opened to include black school administrators and educators. The National Alliance of Black School Educators will celebrate its 20th anniversary on November 1619. 1990. Mrs. Christella Moody. his wife. is also commended at this time for her many years of service as historian of NABSE.

It recently came to my attention that many reservists who are now serving In the desert sands of Saudi Arabia. are paying large premiums to maintain their group health Insurance coverage. This seems ridiculous to me as the soldiers and their families are already covered by military health plans. and makes even less sense when one considers that most of these men and women are taking a reduction in pay while serving their Nation overseas. Many of these reservist would drop their group health coverage but for the fear of a long and costly reinstatement process. So they are caught in a catch22 situation and. as I mentioned before. It Is our duty to help them. The bill which I am presenting will. when enacted. allow our Operation Desert Shield Reserve forces to discontinue expensive. excessive group health Insurance payments. It will also guarantee their ability upon return. to reenter their former group health Insurance program without penalty and without a waiting period.

November 11. at Trinity College. Eight Sisters of Notre Dame came to the United States In 1840 from the seaport of Antwerp. Belgium. At that time. the congregation. which had Its motherhouse In Namur. Belgium. was only 36 years old. The Sisters first American settlement was In Cincinnati. OH. The Sisters of Notre Dame came to WashIngton In 1873 at the request of Gen. William Shermans wife to establish an Industrial school for girls and an evening school for working women. From this endeavor. Notre Dame Academy was Incorporated in 1833. In 1897. Trinity College was established as the first 4year Catholic college for women in the United States. In addition to a traditional undergraduate program. Trinity has a continuing education program. a flourishing weekend college program for women. and a coeducational graduate program. The Sisters of Notre Dame in Washington initiated the successful education for parish service program which has prepared numerous men and women for this archdiocese as well as for several in other parts of the United States and in Europe. Sisters of Notre Dame moreover. teach and/or administer at St. Jeromes Hyattsville. St. Camillus. Silver Spring. St. Peters. Waldon. and John Carroll High School. Many serve in various capacities at the archdiocesan pastoral center. Some are clinical or psychiatric social workers. chaplains. college professors. some are in health care. administration. or day care. Worldwide. more than 2.600 Sisters of Notre Dame serve in 35 States In this country as well as in Canada. Mexico. Belgium. Great Britain. Italy. Japan. Africa. Central and South America. The Sisters of Notre Dame in the Washington area are proud of their own missionaries on three continents who stand on the shoulders of those first courageous women of 150 years ago. As graduates of Trinity College who have benefited from the Sisters of Notre Dame. it is a personal privilege to call their contribution to the attention of our colleagues.

At the same time that we move today to assist Poland and Hungary in their monumental transformation. we must do this in an intelligent and skillful way. Efforts to waive cargo preference provisions are inconsistent with longstanding U.S. policies which should not be subverted. The U.S. Congress has repeatedly debated this issue and has voted to include cargo preference as a standing policy of our foreign assistance. It is a policy which should be preserved today. Efforts today to pass H.R. 3402. which will authorize over $800 million in aid and other assistance to Poland and Hungary. is an important first step. However. our focus on this crucial piece of legislation has been unnecessarily diverted by the attempt on the floor today to waive cargo preference requirements on the shipping of our food aid to Poland. A good deal of misinformation has surrounded the costs associated with shipping this countrys food aid on United States vessels. The source of much of this misinformation was a Boston Globe story of September 29. which cited an $85perton rate. This figure has presented a highly misleading picture. and has been specifically refuted by the U.S. Deputy Maritime Administrator. Robert S. Siblerman. who. in his letter to the Boston Globe editor. stated that the cost cited In their story were grossly overstated. I do not want to argue figures here on the floor.

Now we are patting ourselves on the back for lining up with Solidarity and the brave freedom fighters of Poland and Hungary. We do not mention the fact. although it is inevitable and it comes out. that this is an enormous subsidy to our domestic merchant marine. Now that is fine. we ought to have a merchant marine. we need a better one. we need a bigger one. But this unique situation is. as I say. unique. sui generis. in a class by itself. We are trying to help a Marxist country become a free country. And we do that by sending food. Now I have heard the argument that. OK. if you are going to subsidize the merchant marine. why are you subsidizing the farmer? Let us have this totally nonsubsidized help to the Polish people? Well. the truth of the matter is this is a U.S. donation of surplus food that we are paying money for in storage. So we help our taxpayers by sending our food on the cheapest bottoms we can get. Now there might be an argument that we could kill two birds with one stone until you read in the Boston Globe last week that. Polish officials were stunned to learn that United States maritime companies planned to charge them $16 million to ship the first $20 million in corn and sorghum-$16 million to ship $20 million. That is outrageous. That is absurd. That is a sad. ironic joke on the Polish people. not to mention our taxpayers. Now we are proud that we are helping Poland. we are helping Solidarity. Let us do that. Now if we want to subsidize the merchant marine. and I will vote for it. bring a bill in and let us do it. but let us not march behind the notion that we are helping Solidarity and the Polish people when we are helping almost as much our merchant marine.",

All the rhetoric in the world is not going to shift the focus of what has been the center of this debate. Somehow the Members who have submitted this amendment want to frame the debate on the fact that allowing American bottoms. the American merchant marine. to ship this is somehow unpatriotic and unAmerican. but buying American products at higher than market prices somehow is absolutely patriotic and wonderfully advantageous for Poland. The bottom line is that that is mostly malarkey. The reality is that American taxpayer dollars went into buying this food in the first place. and the American merchant mariners and those American ships paid for part of that food. Mr. Chairman. this is the law as it currently exists. and the gentleman is right. We ought to defeat the substitute and defeat the amendment.",

Mr. President. over threequarters of all Americans live in urban areas. where pest control is vitally important to residents health and wellbeing. Every year. cockroaches. fleas. termites. mosquitoes. and other pests cause a variety of diseases and significant damage to buildings and other property. Property damage from termites. ants. and other wood destroying organisms exceeds $1 billion annually. Research into urban pest control is undertaken through the Agricultural Research Service. Yet funding for such research has been very limited to date. Most pest control research has focused only on agriculturally related pests. while urban pest control research has received inadequate attention and support. Research into pest control promises to help develop Improved technology that is efficient in controlling pests. environmentally sound. and safe for consumers. This might include. for example. insect growth regulators. hormones. attractants. and repellants. The funding provided in this bill will be helpful in promoting urban pest control research. But it still is not adequate to meet the real need that exists. I hope that a higher funding level can be provided In the next fiscal year.",

No doubt. EDAs financial participation in many cases Is the crucial link to making a rural economic development project reality. The record speaks for itself.

Our transportation system is no longer a worldwide symbol of our Nations vitality. It is becoming a bumpy road to nowhere. My colleagues. this is like a bank telling someone on Christmas Eve that it has decided to keep the money being put into Christmas club accounts because the bank is short of cash.

I am a cosponsor of House Joint Resolution 467. a resolution to authorize and request the President to proclaim SepApri 4 1990 tember 21. 1990. as National POW/ MIA Recognition Day. While September is several months away. I want to use the opportunity of my cosponsorship of this legislation to relate a personal story. I have a special interest in the continued search for missing servicemen in Southeast Asia because the son of a friend of mine is among the missing. During the Vietnam conflict. Robin Gatwood. a fighter pilot. was shot down and reported missing. Since that time his father. Dr. Robin Gatwood. has been a leader in the effort to locate our missing servicemen. I can only imagine the frustration and pain that parents. spouses. and friends continue to feel. knowing that loved ones could still be alive and held captive in Southeast Asia. I know from talking with Dr. Gatwood that one of the sources of this frustration is the U.S. Government. The process of locating missing men has been. and continues to be. a long seemingly unending process. The very least we can do as a legislative body is to continue to call attention to this issue by proclaiming a day of recognition. We must continue to send the message to Hanoi that we will not forget our fellow citizens. This resolution will help achieve that goal.",

The measure which this amendment proposes is a direct militarytomilitary communications link between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The possible value of such a link was illustrated in the recent episode when a Soviet military aircraft flew from Poland across NATO territory until it crashed in Belgium. Despite the fact that NATO was aware of the aircraft in sufficient time to track it and to have our own NATO aircraft follow it and establish that the pilot had ejected. no attempt was made to communicate with Warsaw Pact authorities. Indeed. such an attempt was virtually impossible on such short notice. The militarytomilitary link which this amendment proposes would provide an existing and established channel for use in such incidents. where unpredicted military events could lead to unfortunate incidents between the two sides. As the members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact proceed to explore ways to reduce tension and enhance confidence and security in the ongoing negotiations in Vienna. it is my view that it could prove fruitful to explore the possibility and feasibility of a militarytomilitary communications link such as that proposed in this amendment. I hope the President will explore this concept seriously with our allies and will find that it can be included as part of the set of measures being negotiated in Vienna.",

OK. purchase a new ticket to Dallas and get back on another planeall at an incredible cost and a terrific inconvenience. I also understand that joint ticketing is prohibited with other air carriers. This all translates into an extremely anticompetitive situation. Air fares between Dallas and Wichita are several hundred dollars above what they are in those markets where Southwest Airlines competes with other airlines. Congress did not intend that there be islands of noncompetition when it passed the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. There is a ready and willing market in and around Wichita for competitive air service. It is time that this unreasonable and arbitrary barrier be removed. By Mr. BENTSEN:",

This bill is substantially similar to a bill I introduced last session and is identical to H.R. 1184. which was introduced in the House this session by Mr. ANDREWS. In 1988. $201.7 million in rattan. wicker. and burl furniture and furniture parts was imported into the United States. Although the current rate of duty on importation of these products from nations with mostfavorednation status is 7.5 percent. until recently much of these products were imported dutyfree because they were exported primarily from developing countries qualifying for dutyfree treatment under the generalized system of preferences. However. GSP benefits for rattan. wicker. and burl furniture and furniture parts imported from Taiwan. one of the primary exporters. terminated in 1987. and GSP benefits for such products exported from Hong Kong terminate this year. Thus. unless this bill is enacted and duties are temporarily suspended. U.S. importers and sellers of these products will continue to face a significant increase in their costs. There appears to be no significant U.S. production of furniture that would compete with the products covered by this bill. Thus. the suspension should have no adverse impact on domestic industry. and duty suspension is warranted. In sum. Mr. President.

This new scholarship program was very important to our friend and colleague. the late Congressman Claude Pepper. It was his desire that the scholarships be awarded to the hearing impaired and other disadvantaged or disabled secondary students. and that the program be administered by the Washington Workshops Foundation. Senator Pepper personally contacted Members of the House and Senate last year to ask for an authorization for the program to be named after his wife. Mildred. Senator Pepper was instrumental in founding the Washington Workshops Congressional Seminar in 1968. The Congressional Seminar Program is the oldest such program on Capitol Hill and has been responsible for bringing over 30.000 high school students to Washington to learn about and participate in Government. Since that time. the Washington Workshops has established a Congressional Internship Program as well as a Diplomacy seminar. Pepper scholarship recipients would be eligible to participate in each of these programs. These programs offer an invaluable and unique opportunity for citizenship education for our Nations young people. The Pepper Scholarship Program would extend this opportunity to the handicapped student who would not otherwise be able to participate through his or her own means. I am pleased to Join with Congressmen PAT WILLIAMs and JoE MOAKLEY who have sponsored identical legislation in the House. H.R. 2666.

For a country such as the United States which has become the symbol of freedom around the world. with the Stars and Stripes symbolizing this freedom. it makes me sick to think that such a symbol can now be legally burned.

We were able to meet with the Chinese Ambassador. We were stonewalled. We were not met with any responsive concerns or answers to our questions about the indiscriminant slaying of so many young peaceful student demonstrators. We made two proposals to him. We pleaded with him. first to stop the executions. as a show of good faith. and give more time to let the world see what has happened. to see whether in fact the accused young people are criminals or whether they were peaceful demonstrators. That was answered. as the world knows. with three students executed yesterday and apparently another 10 or 13 todaya gross travesty of human rights.

My amendment would specifically define schools for the purpose of the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad Program to include facilities which provide services for mentally retarded. This action Is consistent with the intent of the ASHA Program. The amendment will not make any significant change to H.R. 2655 and it will not earmark any money for any specific program.

These resolutions are important because this is a statement of strong feeling on the part of the legislative branch of this Government on what is an ongoing atrocity in the Peoples Republic of China. I cannot help but comment that years ago. when the Republic of China on Taiwan was sharply differentiated. as it still is. from the mainland Chinese. the socalled Peoples Republic. many of us used to refer to the Peoples Republic of China as Red China. and we were somewhat ridiculed as old cold warriors for making this distinction. and Red China was said to be a perjorative term. But I think we knew instinctively that Communists do things differently from other cultures and other peoples. They hold human life more cheaply. What has happened in Tiananmen Square confirms that and bears that out. If we study the statistics from the \"Great Leap Forward\" under Mao Tsetung from 1958 to 1961. we find that demographers have shown that 30 million Chinese died as a result of Mao Tsetungs \"Great Leap Forward.\" They died from various causes. not the least of which was starvation. So I think history is constantly the reference point for proving sadly and tragically that communism views human beings as units of production and consumption and considers them expendable. rather than as human beings with human dignity and rights.",

If the Wilson amendment were to become permanent it could cause the elimination of what has been one of Congress most effective means of communicating with its constituents. Unfortunately. the congressional frank has also become one of Congress most effective tools for getting itself reelected and has been badly abused. As Chairman of the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards I have often been appalled by the way some Members have perverted the frank. There can be no doubt that by the use of slick. highly targeted mailings many Members have greatley enhanced their chances for reelection. They have also lost sight of the original Intent of the congressional frank. a concept that Is actually older than Congress Itselfthat our elected officials owe it to the people to communicate their views on a regular basis. So reform Is needed. And while this amendment Is far from perfect. it will send a muchneeded shot across the bow to those frank abusers amongst us. Let me further add that there are some Members who still use the frank to provide muchneeded Information to their constituentsGERRY STUDDS. DAVE BONIOR. BILL FRENZEL. PAT MOYNIHAN. and many others still use the frank as It was originally Intend. edas an honest document to relay information to their constituents. I fully expect that this Is an Issue that we will be forced to revisit in the near future.

The same persons who have vociferously criticized funding much more comprehensive plans that address the treatment and education demand now want to take $45 million from the legislative appropriations bill on the grounds of a dire need for such programs. Why the sudden change of heart? The Inconsistentency of these actions calls Into question their motivation. As the drug crisis continues to plague this country. it is increasingly clear that we need a carefully planned program to improve drug treatmentwith funding at levels significantly higher than the $45 million offered by todays maneuvering. We have had opportunities to vote for such programs. I only hope that those who flipflopped their position with todays vote will continue their support of drug treatment and demonstrate genuine commitment to the problem In the future.

We hear talk that people just want to help those who are carrying the lunch bucket. I cannot help but remember back to my sophomore year in college when George McGovern was running for President. One of the proposals he had. as we may recall. called for anyone who was earning over $30.000 to be charged $1.000 and they figured they would have broadbased support for that because over 60 percent of the people fell in the category of earning under $30.000. What happened. Mr. Speaker. was that we found the people in this country did not support it because those earning under $30.000 wanted to be earning over $30.000. so they opposed the tax. In the same way Americans recognize that a capital gains differential will broaden the tax base and create more job opportunities. Mr. Speaker. I believe we have got to do everything we can to broaden the base. increase revenues to the Government. This proposal is a meaningful first step.

Pension and health benefits for retirees were drastically reduced. and the prospect for a reasonable settlement of the failing industrial giants economic problems looked grim as dozens of its operations were sold off. After years of confusion and loss. AllisChalmers is now poised to come back stronger under the direction of a new chairman and CEO. Mr. Robert E. Nederlander. As part of his introduction to the AllisChalmers Corp.. Mr. Nederlander should be aware of congressional action resulting in passage of H.R. 2969 last session which helped the AllisChalmers retirees. This law placed the retirees who created AllisChalmers profits at the head of the creditors line. alongside banks and other lending institutions. Although the AllisChalmers bankruptcy settlement was finalized before passage of H.R. 2969. attaching this bills language to budget bills during the previous two sessions impressed AllisChalmers with the necessity of following its intent in crafting the multibillion dollar bankruptcy settlement between the corporation and its workers. Members of Congress remain supportive of retiree rights today. as well. As an active cosponsor of H.R. 2969. I was pleased that the intent of this retiree benefits security measure was followed during the lengthy AllisChalmers bankruptcy process. From newspaper accounts. I understand Mr. Nederlander has agreed to purchase 40 percent of AllisChalmers common stock for $375 million. Chemical Bank. a partner in this acquisition package. has tentatively agreed to loan Mr. Nederlander $115 million toward buying the stock. I am heartened by Mr. Nederlanders desire to revitalize the AllisChalmers Corp. Although pared down as a result of bankruptcy. AllisChalmers remains an industrial giant and important part of the community which I proudly represent in Congress. On behalf of those thousands of retirees and employees striving for a renaissance at AllisChalmers. I intend closely monitoring the new leaderships performance at the corporation. The chaos is coming to order now at AllisChalmers. It is my hope that Mr. Nederlander and his leadership team will provide the sound judgment and fair treatment necessary to complete AllisChalmers rebirth as the Midwestern industrial giant that serves the world.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. adult literacy is one of the most pressing social and economic problems facing this country today. A productive economic future depends on a literate workforco. Nowhere is this need more critical than in the Sunbelt. The South remains the Nations least educated region. The facts are clear: In each of 14 Southern States. more than 30 percent of all adults lacked a high school diploma in 1980. Of the remaining 36 States. only three had adults without diplomas that matched the 30 percent rate. Of Southern adults 25 and older living in nonmetropolitan areas. just 50 percent had a high school diploma. while those in metropolitan areas the percent reached 66.5 percent. Last fall the Sunbelt Institute commissioned a study of literacyfrom a Sunbelt perspective. Beginning with the premise that literacy is a serious problem that needs action. the report examined Federal policies on literacy. The study found that: Of the 18.7 million Southerners who do not have high school credentials. barely one million are enrolled in a literacy program. Estimates from the Department of Labor cite the annual cost of literacyin just eight of the 16 Sunbelt Statesas exceeding $57 billion. It is clear that we must focus our attention on the problems of literacy to ensure that the Southern region remains competitive in the job market of the next decade. By 1990. three out of every four new jobs in the United States will require education or training beyond a high school degree. As the Chairman of the Congressional Sunbelt Caucus. a bipartisan coalition of 145 Members of Congress from 16 Southern States. I am extremely concerned that the problem of literacy could economically handicap the South. The Sunbelt Caucus recently sponsored a twoday conference in the Research Triangle Park. NC. examining what Congress can do to help prepare workers for tomorrow. The commitment of every one of us is necessary for us to ensure this will not happen. Regardless of the region where a child or adult lives. he or she must be offered the preparation needed to be a productive member of our future work force.",

The students. parents and faculty of Central Catholic High School have forged a clear path for other schools. both locally and across our Nation. to follow in meeting the challenge posed by the urgent national antidrug abuse effort. At every level of our society. the attraction to alcohol and lure of drugs has disguised itself as a viable alternative to meeting the daily pressures which face each of us. The community of Central Catholic realizing that. indeed. there is strength in numbers has awakened new resources for confronting the threat of drug and alcohol abuse in their midst. With patient understanding and unwavering determination. students. parents. and faculty have united their efforts to create an environment where the often painful yet inevitable lessons of life are not shunned in fear or shame but are transformed into the raw material of true education. Their commitment embodies what Pope John Paul II characterized so well when he said: The ultimate determining factor Is the human person. It Is not science and technology. nor the increasing means of economic and material development. but the human person. and especially groups of persons. communities and nations. freely choosing to face problems together who will determine the future.

Mike Schmidts professional career began in 1974. and for the next 14 years he averaged 37 home runs. 104 RBI. 99 runs. and 98 walks per season. He won the National League home run title 8 times and the Golden Glove Award for third baseman 10 times. His career stats were equally impressive: he had 548 home runs and 1.595 RBIs altogether. These achievements assure him a spot in the Hall of Fame. In addition to these accomplishments. his work ethic makes him a role model for Americas youth. We will miss his presence greatly. He helped the Philadelphia Phillies win five divisional titles. two pennants. and their only World Series. He was a class act on and off the field. His decision to retire on Monday caught many people by surprise. But as soon as Mike Schmidt felt that he was no longer playing up to his ability. he walked away.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. yesterday I introduced legislationH.R. 2513with several of my colleagues to extend the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC] to include approval responsibility over the acquisition of major rail carriers by entities which are not carriers. Currently. the ICC has jurisdictional review authority over all other takeover transactions of railroads by other carriers that may adversely affect the inner workings of the railroad. the businesses and consumers that utilize the railroad and the individuals employed by the railroad. This bill simply expands the ICCs authority. Since the industrialization of this country. railroads have played a major part in the transportation of commercial goods and passengers. Therefore. any dramatic changes in our Nations railroad structure should be examined with an eye toward public interest. Will a transaction improve the efficiency of the railroad? Will the accumulated debt in such a transaction leverage a railroad too much? All factors must be considered when examining the restructuring of a railroad. Im not necessarily advocating the termination of all restructuring efforts within the railroad industry. but I do believe that a certain review process is necessary in light of the merger mania that has taken over the marketplace this decade. A loss of a railroad due to a highly leveraged takeover would be detrimental to the health of our Nations economy. While this bill would grant regulatory oversight to the ICC to approve the acquisition of a carrier by a noncarrier. it would also establish time limits to the approval process to ensure that a productive acquisition is not entangled in a bureaucratic well. It also addresses the debt question by mandating that all debt owed to the Federal Government is paid in full if the transaction fails and the railroad is thrown into bankruptcy. The Federal Government simply cannot afford the loss of millions of dollars. Railroads offer an invaluable service to this country. and this bill merely fills the regulatory void contained in todays statutes to ensure that this industry remains healthy and viable.",

I am sorry that the gentleman from Tennesseeand that word gentleman fits him as well as it fits anyone in this House. he truly is a gentleman and I certainly respect what he has to say and his beliefs. But I am sorry that the picture that he had is retired because if it was on the floor and you were looking at it now. you would see something unique. You would see the American flag flying to symbolize America. That is what it is. it is not in and of itself a country. The interesting part is you would not see what America is all about. America is not all about the flag. The flag is all about America. The reason that that flag was flying over the Iwo Jima Memorial is because we do not put the Constitution or the Bill of Rights on a stick and fly it. But I can tell you there are millions of veterans out there right now who would say to you. if you spoke to them. that they fought. and some of their brethren and sisters died. not for the flag but for our way of life and the Bill of Rights and the right of people to be free. More important. the right of individual Americans to be able to take different positions from their own Government without fear. if they see fit. That is what they fought for. that is what some of them died for. We have no right to dishonor their memory by taking that symbol that they wanted to erect and say it is not worth anything anymore because we are going to shred the Bill of Rights and the Constitution rather than some people being allowed to shred a flag. Oh. they are stupid and they are foolish and they are dumb and 99.9 percent of the people in this country think they are idiotic. but let them do it. if that is what they think is right. because that is what this country is based on and that makes us different from anybody else in the whole world.

I would strongly urge this House to defeat the previous question and. falling that. to defeat the rule. At the Committee on the Judiciary markup of the constitutional amendment on Tuesday. the distinguished chairman. the gentleman from Texas . stated that the two most serious responsibilities that the committee has are considering proposed constitutional amendments and the impeachment of civil officers of the United States. This rule denigrates the seriousness of considering a proposed constitutional amendment by waiving numerous rules of the House. First. it waives the rule requiring a committee report. If we act today. there would be no committee report on file. It waives the rule requiring a 3day layover so that Members can look at the issue and study the committee report. And it waives the rule giving the minority a motion to recommit. The gentleman from New York lodged a point of order against the consideration of this rule. I believe the Speakers ruling was wrong. but it shows that this rule is a railroad job that tramples the rights of individual Members of the House of Representatives. This constitutional amendment was not on the printed notice that was given to all the Members when we left last week. It came right out of thin air. And that never has happened in my almost 12 years here. Furthermore. it makes in order a proposed bill which was introduced just last night that has had no committee consideration. no hearings and which poses significant constitutional questions. Now. what is the rush? Why not take these matters up next week to give people a chance to reflect on them. not only here in the House but in the country as well? Is your rush to kill the constitutional amendment so great that you have to trample on the ordinary rules of the House and denigrate the dignity of this institution? I hope not. and I hope the previous question is defeated.",

In the fihst place. this constitutional amendment does not itself effect any legislative action. It provides that the Congress of the United States. or the States. can take action. so it is not a preemptory thing in the sense that it puts down guidelines for us now. It says that in the future the Congress can act and the State legislatures can act. I feel we should enact this because we have tried to get various statutes passed and they have not gone by the Supreme Court. Now. the Supreme Court is made of ordinary mortals appointed to the Court. Four of the nine decided that it was constitutional to pass the legislation we already passed. This is not the first time that an autocratic majority. not that anybody deserves condemnation on the court. but an autocratic majority of the court has decided things which are contrary to the best interests of our country. as a matter of fact. by decision. They are not endowed by the Lord or anybody else with the answer to all questions. Four of the five decided that the laws we already passed were adequate laws. The trouble about the situation we have is not really just expression of opinion. It is the fact it is an incitement to violence. and people who have fought in wars in the past do not really like to see incitement to violence against the United States of America. for which we fought and for which many people have made great sacrifices. So it seems to me this proposal to have a constitutional amendment to allow the Congress to act. to allow the State legislatures to enact some reasonable version. seems to me to be a sound thing to do. It would eliminate the possibility of having unnecessary bloodshed and violence in our country for no real purpose.",

We must provide resources now to help our state. cities. counties and healthcare providers ... combat the AIDS epidemic.\" The letter was sent last week to a U.S. Senate subcommittee which is considering a plan to free up $190 rhillion for AIDS disaster relief and care programs. About $2 million of that would be earmarked for Hudson County. The money would come by shaving other social programs by about 1 percent. The plan is a stopgap measure. designed to last until 1991. when other AIDS funding will kick in. Its a good plan. and there should be no hesitation in adopting it. We need AIDS relief. We need it now. Why anyone fails to grasp the urgency of the situation remains a mystery. The AIDS epidemic is nothing short of a disaster. It is killing hundreds of thousands of people. with hundreds of thousands more already infected and living a death sentence. In Hudson County. the ravages of the disease are all too apparent. The county owns one of the highest incidence rates of AIDS in the nation. In the state. only Essex County loses more of its residents to AIDS than we do. Still. the temptation for the public and the politicians to ignore the problem is great. Sad to say. but because AIDS affects mostly homosexuals and intravenous drug users. many people dont care. They dont care because. in their minds. theyre part of the lowrisk group. They dont care because. as rampant as the disease is. it seems foreign to them. Something that happens to others. They wont care until they get AIDS themselves. Then it will be too late. Or they wont care until someone they know. and love. gets AIDS. The way the disease is spreading. thats likely to be too soon. Sen. Lautenberg. Rep. Frank Guarini. County Executive Robert Janizsewski and every other politician involved in the effort to obtain emergency AIDS funding should be commended. They have lobbied intensely over the past weeks. Theyve said what needs to be said. We only hope that someone was listening. (From the Houston Chronicle. Sept. 22.",

China is the big topic tonight. We have a President who vetoed this legislation over China last year. but he is ready to give China mostfavorednation status in terms of trade. He is ready to give them all kinds of goodies in trade and export benefits. and yet he will not allow us to support U.N. family planning because it has a small role in China. Well. Mr. President. why is it that it is okay for us touvonsider giving mostfavorednation status to China in trade. but we cannot help the women of the world deal with their own lives and perhaps through this improve their lives? I think it is hypocritical. In the next few minutes. Mr. President. we are going to be talking about El Salvador. Now. Mr. President. another area of hypocrisy is the way we have supported dictators. tyrants and totalitarian regimes around the worldwhere they have death squads that will go into villages and perform the most ghoulish atrocities against women. And El Salvador is one of those countries. I know that my time is up. But in El Salvador not only do they kill Jesuits. they rape women. they maim women. and do cruel and ugly and repulsive things to pregnant women.

The HAP was created to help military and civilian homeowners who are forced to sell their homes due to a base closure or reduction. These homeowners receive a payment based on the value of their home prior to the announcement of a base closure or reduction. For example. a family that sells its $100.000 home for $70.000 receive 85 percent of that $30.000 difference. or $25.000 These people are forced to sell their homes because of a Federal decision. They should not be punished for buying a home near their base. But then this benefit is taxed as income. they are being punished.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today Im Introducing a bill to authorize a federally guaranteed loan program to help fund major airport projects that expand national air capacity. We have a good program in place for financing airport projectsthe Airport and Airways Trust Fund. But its not working as well as it was Intended to. Why? Because the $6 billion surplus that has accumulated In the trust fund Is being held hostage to GrammRudman targets. Billions of dollarsraised from aviation users. and earmarked solely for aviation purposessit Idly. to mask the size of our enormous Federal budget deficit. while critically needed airport projects and improvements are delayed or abandoned. The best solution? Free up trust fund money and spend it on the many important airport projects around our Nation that now compete for limited funding. But short of that. weve got to look for alternative ways to finance additional air capacity. My bill is one way we can do that. The Airport Capacity Expansion Financing Act of 1989 would authorize the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Federal guarantee program. using the aviation trust fund as a backup to cover any liability in the unlikely event of a default. This approach would allow us to make use of the trust funds surplus without spending it up frontor in all likelihood. making any outlays at all. The Federal guarantee would serve to reduce the interest rates that State and local governments pay on bonds issued to finance major aviation projects. This could cut millions of dollars off the overall post of these projects and do so at a minimal cost to the Federal Government. Obviously. the guarantee would also make the financial community more receptive to underwriting these bond issues generally. Mr. Speaker. at this time. Id like to insert a summary of my bill for the RECORD.",

Sam died on Wednesday. October 15. at the age of 83. I know Philadelphia will sorely miss him. Sam built the Famous Dell Into a Philadelphia Institution. as important as the soft pretzel or the cheese steak. Famous was so famous that it has become almost as Important a tourist attraction as the Liberty Bell and the Betsy Ross House. Its a neighborhood place known for its famous food and famous customers. As the Philadelphia Inquirer said. Sams Famous was the kind of place you could expect to find a man like Attorney General Dick Thornburgh or Vice President Walter Mondale eating one of his succulent corn beef specials or smoked fish heaped on a large. hot bagel. Over the years. while the neighborhood and Philadelphia changed. Sam Auspitz and Famous Deli remained the same. Generations grew up with Famous Deli and now look back with fond memories for the place and its founder. generations who grew up on his sweet kugel. hot. fresh knishes. delicate cheese blintzes and masterfully cooked roast beef. I joined Sam and his son David for breakfast on many Sunday morningssomehow. from now on. Sunday mornings wont be the same. Sam Auspitz was an Immigrant. born In Hungary. who at age 16 took $300 In savings and opened his first dell. Famous Dell touched many neighborhoods In the city. While he never was a rich man.

This is a settlement that people should take note of. and both firms deserve praise for the highly cooperative agreement. Under the settlement. which could be worth $400 million to $600 million to Warner. Warner will receive a 50percent Interest In the Columbia House unit of CBS Records. Warner will also obtain cable distribution rights for all theatrical and madeforTV movies and miniseries produced by Columbia and Columbia will trade its 35 percent interest In Burbank Studios for the MGM Studios lot owned by Warner. Warners settlement of its complaint against Sony should be a model for the United States and U.S. businesses in dealing with foreign Investors. Its about time an American company stood up for Its rights and got something back from the foreign Invasion In American business. All but two of the major American record companies are now owned by foreign Interests. Since Sonys purchase of CBS Records 2 years ago. Sony has also owned the CBS Records unit Columbia House. the largest direct marketer of records. tapes. and video cassettes. The settlement will result in the returning of half of the companys profits to an American company and its shareholders. Both companies have stated that the settlement provides them with excellent opportunities. We should congratulate Warner and Sony for ending an acrimonious legal battle amicably. The two companies have emerged as long term partners. whose future success in some businesses will be closely tied to each other. American entertainment products have for many years been one of our chief exports to the rest of the world. As foreign Interests extend their investments into American media companies.

This bill. which I introduced last week. would rename lock and dam No. 4 on the Arkansas River after Mr. Emmett Sanders. formerly of Pine Bluff. AR. Mr. Speaker. I have long been an advocate of honoring our most distinguished leaders by renaming the public facilities which they have helped to erect in memory of their accomplishments. In my view. this measure of respect and gratitude Is best bestowed in the twilight of ones years so that the recipient is able to fully appreciate the honor. Accordingly. I have. in the past. offered legislation to rename a number of public facilities after senior public figures who have played an important role in the life of their community. Such is the case with Emmett Sanders. Mr. Sanders was the former mayor of Pine Bluff. AR. who. through tireless effort. worked to tame the Arkansas River. bringing navigation and a measure of flood protection to the area. He was an outspoken and extremely effective advocate of water resources development and progress and his efforts were met with not only success but the appreciation of the citizens of Pine Bluff.

The land owned by the United States was acquired in connection with the construction of the Melvin Price Locks and Dam project on the Mississippi River at Alton. IL. The land will May 11. 1.989 be under water when the pool behind the locks and dam is raised. This is expected to happen this September. Local interests wish to develop a boating dock and marina in the area. and have determined that the land scheduled to be inundated would be the best location for the boating facilities if its elevation is raised by the placement of fill material.

In 1988 the United States acquired a flowage easement over the land owned by the Blue Tee Corp. for the sum of $1.125 million.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I and 19 cosponsors have introduced legislation to permit $19 billion of excess tax reserves held by utility companies to be returned to utility ratepayers in the form of rate reductions over a 3year period beginning on January 1. 1991. Before enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. regulated utility companies accumulated book reserves for future tax liabilities. which reflected the use of accelerated depreciation for tax purposes and straightline depreciation for regulatory purposes. By using accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. utility companies postponed their tax liabilities until future years. when depreciation deductions would be exhausted. Before 1986 these firms accumulated reserves with the expectation that they would pay taxes at a 46percent rate. Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the corporate tax rate to 34 percent. part of the accmulated reservesthe 12percent difference between the rateshave been excess reserves. The excess deferred taxes will never be paid as taxes: They must be returned to the ratepayers. Section 203(e) of the 1986 act interfered with the ability of public utility commissions to adjust utility rates to account for return of excess deferred taxes to ratepayers. That provision requires excess tax reserves to be returned in the form of rate reductions no more rapidly than over the remaining number of years used to depreciate. fo. regulatory purposes. property the accelerated depreciation of which gave rise to the reserves. The provision was motivated by a concern that public utility commissions might act to return excess tax reserves in rate reductions in a single year. Such an immediate flowthrough of the excess tax reserves could seriously disrupt the cashflows of utility companies and their investment programs. In some cases. companies might need to borrow to augment the reduced cash coming from ratepayers. After considered review of this issue. my colleagues who have joined me as cosponors of this bill and I have concluded that section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 overly restricts the legitimate role of State public utility commissions in setting utility rates.

    "speech": "I would like to engage the Senator from Maryland in a brief colloquy on the reach of the FHA amendments contained In this legislation. A question has been raised whether the amendment to the FHA limits will affect the Resolution Trust Corporations [RTC] disposition rules for singlefamily properties. Those rules were recently codified in the Financial Institutions Reform. Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 [FIRREA]. I was one of the principal Senate authors of that legislation and a firm supporter of the RTC provisions. My review of the pertinent statutory language shows clearly that the FHA amendment before us today will have no effect upon the RTC disposition rules. Section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Actcodified under section 501(a) of FIRREAestablishes special guidelines for the RTCs disposition of certain single family and multifamily properties. The guidelines governing the disposition of eligible single family properties are intended to facilitate homeownership. foster sales to public agencies and nonprofit organizations and discourage purchases by speculators. Thus. for the first 3 months after an eligible single family property is made available for sale. the RTC is permitted to sell the property only to (a) homebuyers at or below 115 percent of area median income. or (b) public agencies or nonprofit organizations that would make the property available for low income homeownership or rental. The definition of eligible single family property is tightly drawn. Specifically. section 21A(c)(9)(F) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act defines the term as meaning a* 1- to 4family residence (ii) that has an appraised value that does not exceed the applicable dollar amount set forth in the first sentence of section 203(b)(2) of the National Housing Act (without regard to any increase of such amount for rightcost areas). The applicable dollar amounts are as follows: $67.500 for a singlefamily residence. $76.000 for a twofamily residence. $92.000 for a threefamily residence. and $107.000 for a fourfamily residence. The special disposition guidelines. therefore. only apply to singlefamily properties that are valued at or below these limits. The FHA amendment before us today would not alter any of the dollar amounts set forth in section 203(b)(2). It follows that the FHA amendment would not change in any way the class of single family properties covered by the RTCs special disposition guidelines.",

The tragic state of our university science facilities attests to the growing need for funds to rebuild our Nations basic science infrastructure. A survey of private colleges and universities shows that only 10 percent of these institutions rated their science facilities as stateoftheart while more than 40 percent of the institutions rated their facilities as inadequate to meet their current teaching and research needs. The problem is particularly acute in small colleges that do not have large outside funding resources. However. it is precisely these colleges that are producing the greatest number of future Ph.D candidates in science. It is imperative. therefore. that our undergraduate science facilities be as up to date as possible to educate and train tomorrows scientists and engineers. This program is crucial. not only to our universities and colleges. but to the competitive nature of our Nation as a whole. Although. the $20 million appropriated falls short of the recommended $125 million authorized. it still represents a major step forward toward the recognition of the importance of repair and renovation to our universities.

It will provide money for at least five new proposals that will serve as demonstration projects in this area. I want to thank my colleagues for their commitment to this critical legislation.

Tobacco. and Firearms [BAFT] collects a special occupational tax [SOT] on retail dealers in liquor. beer. and wine. The legislation I am introducing simply reduces the annual tax tavernowners pay from $250 to $100 and. at the same time. makes this reduction apply to a very narrow segment of the retail alcohol beverage industry. the onpremise. retailer with gross receipts from the sales of liquor. beer and wine of less than $750.000 per year. I understand that most small tavernowners are in this category. Mr. President. I have deliberately narrowed the application of this bill to these tavernowners. who number some 200.000 around the country. I have talked with retailers in the Montana Tavern Association which represents about 700 members throughout the State. and these owners tell me that the $250 tax was at least a 400percent increase. originally approved as part of the 1987 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. Public Law 100203. These tavernowners want to pay an equitable tax. In fact. they have agreed that an increase from the original $54 to $100 is acceptable and fair. I believe it is too. Two issues on this SOT matter concern me. Mr. President. First. many of these tavernowners pay city. local. and State taxes in Montana. for example. as high as $1.500 per place of business per year. they are burdened with unaffordable insurance rates. Federal and State taxes on their business operations. and most importantly. declining sales. These retailers need our help. Last. increasing the tax for alcohol beverage retailers ran counter to the recommendations of both the General Accounting Office [GAO] who urged repeal of all alcohol beverage occupational taxes in 1976 and the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] who in 1987 urged an elimination of the retailer SOT rate all together. Mr. President. my bill is narrowly focused to assist tavernowners in Montana and throughout the Nation. It is supported by the National Licensed Beverage Association [NLBAJ and. I believe. should be adopted by the Senate Finance Committee and the Congress this session.

These measures will bring in an estimated additional $15 million in revenues in fiscal year 1990 and even more in years to come. These increases will be in addition to the approximately $23 million in revenues that the FCC will collect under the existing fee schedule. Congress enacted the existing fee schedule as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986. The bill we are considering today increases the fees contained in that act and adds several additional fees. As a result of these changes. the FCC will collect a charge from almost every member of the public who requests authority to operate a broadcast. common carrier and private radio permit or license or requires an FCC action to allow him or her to continue to operate that permit or license. In addition. applicants for radio operator examinations and ship owners receivng inspections are also assessed charges.

It has done so through part 1. subpart 0 of its rules. 47 CFR 1.1101 et seq.. see also Report and Order on the Establishment of a Fee Collection Program. 2 FCC Rcd. 947 (1987). reconsideration granted in part. 3 FCC Rcd. 5987 (1988).

More specifically. the credit applies only to fuels produced from a well drilled or a facility placed in service before January 1. Mr. President it has come to my attention that. notwithstanding the fact that the nonconventional fuels credit does not expire until the end of next year. there may already be some problems for projects underway with a long lead time in qualifying for the credit under the placement in service rule. As a result. these projects may have difficulty obtaining financing. even though the scheduled expiration of the credit is more than a year away. Mr. President. it seems to me that in this kind of case the credit is not providing the kind of incentive that we want it to.

I would like to call to the attention of the Senator from Texas. the chairman of the Finance Committee. an issue that has come to my attention relating to the deductibility of certain reserves established in connection with group accident and health Insurance plans subject to a minimum premium rider. During the term of such riders. the employer is responsible to the insurer for funding claims up to a certain triggerpoint amount on a cumulative monthly basis. These minimum premium riders do not change the risk assumed by the Insurance company. and the insurer remains liable for all unpaid claims as of the date of termination of the rider. The insurance company reflects on its annual statement a liability for the future unpaid claims upon termination of the minimum premium rider in an amount essentially equal to the termination premiums. The IRS has taken the position. in TAM 8705003. that an insurer in these circumstances is not entitled to a current deduction for additions to its reserve. This certainly is a classic catch 22 situation: the IRS denies a current unpaid loss deduction on the ground that the insurers liability does not arise until some future date. and at the same time the IRS denies a current unearned premium deduction on the ground that risks insured against have occurred during the policy year. Mr. Chairman. this is unfair. and I hope that the IRS will decide that the insurer is allowed a current deduction one way or the other. A clarification was included as an amendment to our markup of this bill. but as you recall. all of those amendments were dropped on the Senate floor. If the IRS does not decide that the insurer is allowed a current deduction in these circumstances. then I certainly hope that we will act on the matter early next year and clarify that a current deduction is allowed in this case.",

For instance. an employer may have made a single ESOP loan to provide ESOP benefits to employees covered under five different collective bargaining agreements. but find that only four collective bargaining agreements may meet the requirements of the bills collective bargaining agreement exception.

There are several reasons why I believe the Postal Service should be removed from the budget. It is unique among all Federal entities: It operates on a userfunded. breakeven basis. In addition. it has a very large capital improvement program.

Because their position is out of sync with the morals and values of the American people. the opponents of standards have been going through enough acrobatics to qualify for a job with Ringling Brothers. The latest twist and turn is a proposal that we only authorize the NEA for 1 year instead of 5 years. I can assure all of those concerned that. whether It Is 1 year or 5 years. there will be a vote on standards as to whether or not Federal dollars should be channeled to obscene and indecent art or art that attacks someones religion. There will be a vote on this issue. whether it is a 1year authorization or a 5year authorization. and the American people will be watching that vote.",

I rise today to solicit my colleagues support for House Concurrent Resolution 331. a resolution which I recently introduced calling for the maximum participation by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] in assisting the transition of Eastern European countries to free market democracies. The OECD. an international organization to which most European and Westernstyle democracies belong. has a proud 30year history of advising marketoriented democracies on economic and social policy. and has played a key role in helping countries adapt their economies to market forces. Since 1980. the OECD has increasingly focused its efforts on restructuring economies to make markets work better. The OECDs committee structure brings together experts from national governments which could give Eastern European countries a forum with their Western counterparts to discuss. and examine ways to reform their complex economic and social problems. Few other organizations have the knowledge and expertise to offer advice on such a wide range of issues. from technology to taxation. and from education to the environment. Moreover. no other international organization has OECDs proven track record in providing such technical expertise. House Concurrent Resolution 331 would call on the President to seek to ensure the maximum assistance of OECD in facilitating the transition of Eastern European countries to free market democracies. This would be done by creating the basic statistics for the economic and social measurement of key areas. such as private sector production. trade. investment. output. and employment. by ensuring an effective exchange of people who have experience in the theory. policy. and practice of managing marketbased economies. and by coordinating the advice of highlevel nongovernmental experts capable of providing impartial. policysensitive advice on policy implementation and reform. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to smooth the transition to free markets in Eastern Europe by cosponsoring this resolution.",

The efforts of S. Sgt. Rubin Rivers were brought to my attention by one of my constituents who had the pleasure of being acquainted with this brave American. Staff Sergeant Rivers committed acts of bravery above and beyond the call of duty during a tank battle that occurred in the AlsaceLorraine region of France. On the first day of the battle. his leg was torn apart by shrapnel from an antitank mine. he fought on for his country. His commanding officer and the company medic urged that he evacuate for medical attention. but Rivers thought only of his fellow soldiers. who would surely need his support. Staff Sergeant Rivers took control of his tank again early the next morning. helping to turn back another round of advancing German tanks. The next day. his tank was once again hitthis time with a final. fatal blow. In all. Rivers fought for 2 long days and nights while in dire need of emergency attention. Staff Sergeant Rivers situation is unique for another reason: 1.25 million AfricanAmericans and 23.000 native Americans served during World War II. According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society. during World War II. 470 Congressional Medals of Honor were awardednot one went to an AfricanAmerican. and only 2 went to native Americans. Staff Sergeant Rivers was a member of Company A. 761st Tank Battalion. an all AfricanAmerican battalion. Rivers was part native American and part AfricanAmerican. and lived in Tecumseh. OK. My wish is that he be granted the commendation he justly deserves. If anyone is interested in becoming a cosponsor of this resolution. please contact my officeGreg Wilson at 2252211.",

Section 8 of the Constitution begins something like this: \"This Congress shall have the power.\" Then it continues to say \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations. and among the several States. and within the Indian tribes. * \" We are not dealing with the several States or Indian tribes today. but this bill does deal with commerce with foreign nations. and so I think that when the gentleman questions the constitutionality he ought to go to the heart of the Constitution to see with whom the Constitution trusted the power to deal with issues of commerce. because they knew a long time ago that if we left It to the folks downtown they will take a lot of things Into consideration. but they will not take the economic security of this Nation into consideration. I would say to the gentleman from New York that I had the briefings from the folks in the securities field. They filled my office. They spent an immense amount of time making sure that it was not bugged. They spent a small amount of time talking about some issues of secrecy. but most of the time they were concerned with the bureaucracy and how the bureaucracy was divided. and that is what we are trying to correct here. The fighting in the bureaucracy has crippled our economy. and that is the heart of the matter here today. So I want to say to my friend that I would be happy in a different forum to talk about the secrecy issues. but there are none. This bill more than adequately defends Americas national security and those kinds of issues. On the jurisdiction issue. with previous appearances of this bill on the floor of the House the committees the gentleman mentioned did not have jurisdiction on this particular bill.

We are left with the job of cleaning up this mess. punishing those individuals who broke the law. and putting in place a regulatory system that protects the public and enables wellrun thrifts to go about the business of home mortgage lending. Our first responsibility. and the only justifiable reason for the tremendous cost to American taxpayers. is our obligation to protect depositors. not to bailout stockholders or managers of failed S&Ls. When people put their hardearned money in the local thrift or bank. they do so with the explicit understanding that the Federal Government will stand behind those deposits. The deposit insurance grew out of the hardlearned lesson of the banking crisis that helped trigger the Great Depression. A failure to stand behind federally insured deposits would condemn us to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Mr. Speaker. I watched in horror with the rest of the world as Chinese students who believed in the principle of freedom and democracy were ruthlessly and mercilessly mowed down with tanks. guns. and bayonets. We have all heard the stories from eyewitnesses who reported that young students who begged for their lives or who shouted epithets of protest were quickly shot at close range. The saddest aspect of these inhumane acts was the heartless and unceremonious burning of the students bodies in an odious attempt to deceive the world and to dispose of the bodies in a quick and repugnant manner. Earlier this week. I participated with many of my colleagues in a walk to the Chinese Embassy to protest these egregious violations of human rights. In our talks with the Chinese Ambassador. I indicated that China. as a member of the World Community. is accountable to the internationally recognized human rights norms. as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. We now have reports that the repression in Beijing continues with reports of 20 people brutally executed and many more under sentence of death. and new arrests are being reported daily. We can only imagine the fate of those newly arrested individuals. Mr. Speaker. I have been contacted by hundreds of Chinese students from my district and around the country who are terrified of the atrocities they may suffer as a result of their participating in prodemocracy demonstrations. They report that they have been videotaped and photographed at demonstrations and are terrified that they may be imprisoned or executed upon their return to China. For that reason I have cosponsored the Mrs. PELOSIS legislation to waive the 2year residency requirement for those students and scholars who hold J1 visas. I urge all of my colleagues to join with Congresswoman PELOSI to demonstrate our compassion for these students whose only crime was to speak out for a right constitutionally guaranteed to all of us.

INROADS is one of the most creative of these private sector efforts.

The corporations then train these academically gifted students for corporate and community leadership. Since 1970. the INROADS Program has graduated more than 1.400 young men and women with degrees in business and engineering across the country. More than 3.600 students currently participate in the college and precollege components.

    "speech": "I want to take my time back and conclude this from my part. What we have done here is to leverage this money. When this bill started out. the administration was opposed to any money to enhance and speed up the war on drugs even though at the same time the President is out making speeches saying he supports more money. At least now the country is aware of what is going on. We have people In the administration and we have some people in Congress who talk one way and act another. At least now maybe we are on to a policy where we speak loudly and carry a big stick instead of the past policy of speaking loudly and carrying a very small stick and that is the policy we have had in the administration and to large extent in Congress. So what we need now is to take this bill as a commitment. We have a commitment which probably equals a $550 million increase in annual programs because it is leveraged to fund the first 100 days of such an annual program. We will have to further fund it later. But they can get started. For the first time they have the authority. and the chairman insisted on this. they have the authority to go ahead to use this to initiate these programs even though they are not front loaded. and they are just a part of what the President has in speeches said he is for. They can take the preliminary steps necessary to hire more agents. to build those field offices down there on the Mexican border. to initiate probably eight persons. to use closed military bases and to interface computers so the various agencies can coordinate their activities. So we need to do this.",

We havc no recourse in this legislation. in this conference report. to deal with what is manifestly a contravention of House rules providing legislation in an appropriation bill. In this instance it is the direction to the FAA to install and use explosivedetection equipment and require airlines to buy it. pay for it. install it and operate it. U 1100 The House Committee on Public Works and Transportation and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs have reported comprehensive terrorism countermeasure legislation. We are ready to bring that legislation to the floor. Part of that bill deals with this very issue of explosive detection devices with a very different approach into how the money should be raised to pay for those detection devices. It is unconscionable that the Senate sent this takeitorleaveit proposition to the House. when the House had already clearly spoken that this language was not to be included In an appropriation bill. Then. I might add. on top of that. they put a little frosting on the cake with an additional $400.000 funding for an airport in West Virginia. Now that is just unreasonable. It goes beyond the bounds. We have kept such funding projects out of the House legislation. The Senate comes around and puts this very unwise and unworkable approach and unfair approach into the legislation. If this legislation stands. air travelers will be paying twice for security: paying once in the airline ticket tax. part of that tax goes to security. If this stands. and I hope it will not when we pass our legislation. they will be paying a second time in an airport ticket surcharge which I think is unreasonable.",

The United States has in place a law that Is fair. carefully balanced. and uniform In Its application. I am referring to the Refugee Act of 1980Public Law 96212. Passage of H.R. 2022 sets a dangerous precedent of favoring certain emigres over other persecuted. equally deserving emigres. By passing this legislation. Members of Congress are selectively making a determination that certain groups of people are more persecuted than others. thus deserving of preferential treatment for admittance to the United States. Not only Is H.R. 2022 unfair. but It is unnecessary. Pursuant to the 1980 Refugee Act. the President determined. In consultation with the Congress. that 24.500 refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union could be admitted Into the U.S. In fiscal year 1989. In response to more liberal emigration policies of the Soviet Union and the surge of Soviet refugees seeking safe haven in the U.S.. the President Increased the number of Soviet and East European refugee admittances to 50.000. Of those 50.000. 43.500 are reserved for Soviet refugees. Clearly. the administration has taken appropriate action within the guide. lines of the law. My objection to H.R. 2022 is not the result. but the process. Obviously. the problem of politically persecuted Individuals has become so pronounced that we need to take steps beyond those available under current law. H.R. 2646 would give the administration the flexibility to consider the persecuted from the world over. Soviet Jews. Pentecostals. Vietnamese. Cambodians. and Laotians Included. rather than blatantly favor a few groups over the many. The plight of refugees worldwide is critical.

The bill would provide disability and retirement benefits for judges of the Court of Veterans Appeals and establish. for them and their families. a retirement and survivors annuity program. It also contains conforming provisions regarding the Civil Service Retirement System. Federal Employees Retirement System. and standards for removal of judges. A sum of $3.1 million was computed as the amount of funding necessary to establish and begin operations of the court. On June 30. 1989. the President signed into law Public Law 10145. which among other things provided the $3.1 million in supplemental appropriations for the initial expenses of the court. giving a clear signal to proceed. The bill directs the Administrator of the General Services Administration to acquire office spaces and courtrooms for the new court in the District of Columbia. It also authorizes the Judges to make independent employee appointments without regard to the competitiveservice strictures of title 5. United States Code. Until the court adopts its own rules of practice and procedure. the bill will apply the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure EFRAP] to the court. The FRAP are a comprehensive system of rules of general applicability in the Federal Court of A ppeals. They are the product of many years of experience of the bench and bar. and the interim adoption of these rules will ease the initial administrative burden on the court. The bill also includes other vital technical corrections and miscellaneous provisions. By establishing for the Judges of the new court a retirement and annuity program comparable to that of judges on the other Federal courts. the bill will help to ensure the longterm ability of the court to attract and retain the highest quality judges needed to maintain the court as a firstclass judicial body. Furthermore. the courtrooms will be. by design. dignified and gracious in order to enhance the reputation of the court and to gain the confidence of the veterans who will look to its decisions in their own lives.

    "speech": "Inspector General repeatedly noted in the late 1970s that such organizations were the source of the programs serious problems. In a semiannual report to Congress in November 1979. the Inspector General stated: We remain convinced that the greatest obstacle to the successful operation of the Summer Feeding Program is the continued participation of large private sponsor/private vendor combinations. They are the source of the worst abuses. and we continue to support legislation to remove time. In his next semiannual report to Congress. in May 1980. the Inspector General reiterated this point. It is our view that schools and sponsors that prepare meals on site have had the best programs. and large private sponsors using meals prepared by a commercial vendor have had the most problems. These findings led us to the proposed remedy. To help fill the gaps in the program and reach more poor children. certain nonprofit charitable organizations are permitted to operate the program. while all others would remain barred. The organizations allowed into the program would be those that meet all of the following criteria: They either prepare their own meals or obtain meals from a school or other public facility. No nonprofits obtaining meals from private vendors would be allowed in the program. They are smallscale operations onlyfor example they would be reAugust . 1989 August . 1989 CO stricted to serving no more than 2.500 children a day.

This bill would reauthorize five nutrition programs that would have expired in September 1989. These programs will be extended 4 more years. Nutrition programs included in this reauthorization include: WIC [Women. Infants and Children Feeding Program]. the Summer Food Service Program. the Nutrition Education and Training [NET] Program. the Commodity Distribution Program. and the State Administrative Expense [SAE]. These program extensions will help millions of children: 24 million children a year participate in the School Lunch Program. 3.7 million participate in the School Breakfast Program. 1.3 million in the Child Care Food Program. 1.8 million in WIC. and 1.6 million in the Summer Food Program. Research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture has demonstrated that the WIC Program has reduced the late fetal death rate by 20 to 33.33 percent. WIC has significantly increased the head size of infants whose mothers received WIC foods during pregnancy. Head size is an indication of brain growth. This same USDA study found that women who participated in WIC had longer pregnancies leading to fewer premature births. There was a 23percent decrease in prematurity among white women with less than a high school education and a 15percent decrease among black women with less than a high school education. In my own State of Alabama. we have one of the highest rates of infant mortality in the country. A rate more indicative of a Third World country than of America. I believe that the WIC Program is the key to reducing Alabamas unacceptably high rate of infant mortality. Our State health officer. Dr. Earl Fox. is to be commended for his work toward increasing Alabamas WIC participation. Dr. Foxs efforts along with the efforts of the Senate Agriculture. Forestry. and Nutrition Committee are essential in the fight against infant mortality.",

I believe the legislation before us begins to address those concerns. in large part because of his perserverance. First. while this legislation does include some new requirements. it also eases or eliminates a number of existing requirements. For example. the provisions that permit a clients participation in AFDC. food stamps or Medicaid to satisfy the WIC income test will eliminate the need for WIC agencies to conduct income eligibility determinations for a sizable portion of the caseload. This represents a major paperwork reduction. Also. paperwork is reduced by new provisions on nutrition education. allowing the use of mail issuance of WIC vouchers. and permitting States to conduct review of local agencies every other year. instead of annually. These provisions were all recommended by the States anVi should ease adminstrative costs and burdens. I hope that we have achieved a fair balance between new requirements and the reduction in old requirements. Second. to help make sure that the provisions of the bill representing new requirements do not lead to new paperwork burdens. we have included a provision. at the Senators urging. that precludes USDA from imposing new requirements to place more paperwork in participant casefiles. Third. we have included a provision. also at the Senators request. directing USDA to conduct a review of both the administrative costs of the new requirements and of the administrativecost savings from the requirements that have been eased or dropped. The review will help us develop an accurate picture of the situation. Finally. we have included provisions directing USDA to work to reduce paperwork requirements in both WIC and the school food programs. to consult with State and local administrators on this. and report back to us in a year on the paperwork reductions that have been achieved.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to Join my colleagues in urging the passage of the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 1989. This legislation has been cosponsored by every member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. This bill would reauthorize five child nutrition programs. They are the Summer Food Service Program. the Commodity Distribution Program. State Administrative Expenses. the Nutrition Education and Training Program and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women. Infants and Children. Two programs would receive significant funding increases under the bill. First. private nonprofit organizations would be eligible to participate. in certain circumstances. in the Summer Food Service Program. This program acts as a substitute for the school lunch program when school is not in session. Because of documented fraud and abuse by some nonprofit organizations operating in large cities. private nonprofit organizations were eliminated from participating in the program early in this decade. The elimination of all private. nonprofit organizations left gaps in the areas covered by the summer program. This bill would attempt to close those gaps by allowing established community organizations that serve manageable numbers of poor children and meet other requirements to participate in the program. The committee intends that the limitations imposed on these organizations would prevent abuse in the future. All of us recognize the relationship of adequate nutrition and the ability of children to learn. As Senator McCONNELL pointed out in the committee. a hungry child cannot learn. For that reason. this legislation would also provide competitive grants to State educational agencies for eligible schools for startup costs in implementing new school breakfast programs. Eligible schools are those attended by a significant percentage of children from lowincome families. Mr. President. I want to express my appreciation to Senator MCCONNELL for focusing the attention of the Agriculture Committee on child nutrition earlier this year. On May 2. 1989. Senator MCCONNELL introduced three bills regarding the School Breakfast Program. the Child Care Food Program and the Summer Food Service Program. Elements of all three bills have incorporated into this legislation. I congratulate the Senator from Kentucky for his foresight in the area of child nutrition.

For 3 years. the Committee on Education and Labor has worked to develop a comprehensive child care proposal that best meets the needs of parents and children alike. I believe that our proposal and the Ways and Means proposal are responsible approaches which provide quality child care and help to ensure the health and safety of our children while they are cared for outside the home. These provisions. which are incorporated in H.R. 3299. build on effective. existing programs like Head Start. early childhood education and initiatives by the States that address the critical issues of affordability. availability. and quality of child care. The Stenholm substitute does not target funds to increase the supply of quality child care. The Stenholm substitute does not contain an education or early childhood development component. The Stenholm substitute undermines quality child care. The Stenholm substitute permits children to be cared for by unfit caregivers in unhealthy and unsafe programs. The Stenholm substitute does not provide for parental involvement in. and access to. child care programs. Recently. Mr. STENHOLM wrote. \"Few issues strike a deeper personal chord in most Americans than that of how their children are treated.\" Today. each of us must ask ourselves which of these proposals provides the best care for our children. I believe that H.R. 3299 responds best to parents concerns about how their children are cared for. We have put forth a comprehensive proposal which increases access to. and expands the supply of. child care and includes successful early childhood development and education components.

Contrary to what some of our colleagues would like us to believe. the fact that the assistance Is indirect does not remove the constitutional problem.

I believe it is the most thoughtful. straightforward and effective approach before us today and should be adopted with all possible speed. We all recognize the need for quality day care in this country. In fact. I have formed a day care task force in my own congressional district to help me assess the needs of families. children and providers in the Third Congressional District of Tennessee. What we have found is that tremendous resources are required to meet the growing demand for child care but that our States. communities. and families need maximum flexibility to ensure that their varied and essential needs are addressed. The Stenholm substitute does Just that. It provides additional funding to States to assist in assuring that adequate quality child care is available while allowing the States to allocate the Federal funding provided to the programs which they deem essential to their local efforts. By giving the States the opportunity to ensure that their priority programs are funded. we are involving all concerned segments of our society in the planning. administering and providing of essential child care services. My colleagues we are creating a new Federal program. Time and time again in creating new programs our constituents beseech us to spare them the burden of additional red tape. Instead of creating yet another layer of Government bureaucracy. the Stenholm proposal will enhance and build on existing programs and make them more responsive to each communities needs. The Stenholm substitute also recognizes that church and synagogue child care programs have contributed in significant ways to meeting pressing child care needs in this country. This is sound legislation which deserves to be adopted. I urge my colleagues to Join with me in supporting the Stenholm childcare initiative.

As the 37th individual to succeed Andrew Jackson in representing the district which includes Nashville and Jacksons home. the Hermitage. I am proud to join in todays celebration of Jacksons birth. As my fellow citizens know. Andrew Jackson was our Nations seventh President. serving two terms from March 4. 1829 to March 3. 1837. And. significant to this years celebration of the bicentennial of the U.S. Congress. Andrew Jackson was Tennessees first Representative to the U.S. House of Representatives. being elected shortly after Tennessees admission in 1796 as a State into the Union. Andrew Jackson represented what is called the \"Hermitage District.\" which incorporates Davidson County. and now we have Robertson County. as part of the Hermitage District. and which is named after Jacksons beautiful home just outside Nashville. In fact. Mr. Speaker. this Saturday I will have the honor of participating in a ceremony dedicating a new visitor center and museum at the Hermitage.

I appreciate this opportunity to speak in this special order called by my good friend and colleague BOB CLEMENT to commemorate the 222d birthday of our countrys seventh President Andrew Jackson. There are many stories about this great Tennessean. One such story about his refusing to shine the boots of a British general during Americas war for independence serves as a very vivid example of his patriotic fervor. His exploits in the war against the Seminole Indians in Florida and his defeat of British forces in New Orleans served to establish his reputation as a fierce combat leader. In those early days of American sovereignty. his achievements were noted far and wide. Among the people of his day he was justifiably recognized as a real American hero. As President of the United States. Andrew Jackson utilized his passionate commitment to democracy on behalf of the American people. As one reads historical accounts of Jacksons Presidency. there are many instances of how he refused to compromise deeply held beliefs. not because he was trying to enhance his own reputation. but because he felt that his actions would have an important impact on the freedom of individual Americans or on the sovereignty of the United States of America. Andrew Jacksons service to our country established standards of public service that stand to this day. I hope that as we commemorate his birth date that all Americans will contemplate the great achievements of our country and the tremendous contribution that Andrew Jackson made to those achievements.",

These outstanding accomplishments were achieved by a man who was orphaned at the age of 14. After working as a schoolteacher. Andrew Jackson studied law and moved to Jonesborough. TN. which is located in my congressional district. and was admitted to the bar. He later moved to Nashville. where he gained enormous popularity. He had an outstanding military career. highlighted by his smashing victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. Mr. Speaker.

As a Senator from a timberproducing State dealing with great problems of our national forests I welcome his very thoughtful statement. I remember so well that a former Senator from Washington. Senator Scoop Jackson. labored long and hard trying to find a similar solution with in the days of the debates over the Alaska lands bill. We tried to find a way to assure that there would be a base to perpetuate the timber industry of southeastern Alaska and actually wrote into the law a guarantee of 4.5 billion board feet of timber from the areas not set aside for wilderness in the Alaska Lands Act so that our timber community would know and have some certainty. on a longterm basis. as to the availability of timber. Unfortunately. as the Senator knows and the Senator knows. we are once again locked in controversy over those who demand that some of the timber that Is absolutely necessary in order to assure the compliance with the existing law. as to the availability of 4.5 billion board feet over a 10year period. now be set aside for wilderness or other uses to the extent of forbidding timber harvest In a portion of the forest that we thought would be available. I think it is time. Mr. President. as the Senator from Washington has indicated. for us to take action which permanently designates portions of the national forests as being available for timber production. After all. that is what the forests were originally set aside for. was to guarantee that from public lands. the national forests. there would be an assured supply of timber which would be a yardstick to measure the efficiency and the management practices of the industry that uses private lands throughout the United States. Slowly but surely that yardstick Is being cut down so it is not about a foot long rather than a yardstick. Mr. President. We just do not have the timber available now to provide the measurement under Federal practices of the procedures and practices of the industry and private lands.

These provisions. sections 206. 306. and 408. direct the Secretary of the Interior to determine the validity of mining claims within the national parks designated by the bill and report to Congress recommendations regarding the acquisition of valid claims. The purpose of this requirement. like the similar provision in the Mining in the Parks Act upon which it was based. is to develop information to allow Congress to determine whether it should purchase valid claims to protect the parks from damage associated with mining. As introduced in the 99th Congress. the language in the California Desert Protection Act was essentially identical to the Mining in the Parks Act. requiring the Secretary to determine the validity of all claims and report to Congress within 2 years. When I reintroduced the bill in the 100th Congress. I changed the time limit imposed by sections 206. 306. and 408 because the mining industry argued that it would be difficult. and very expensive. for the Secretary to complete this work for all claims. including dormant claims. within 2 years. The sections now require the Secretary to make his report to Congress about the validity and acquisition of mining claims prior to approving plans of operations. I did not intend sections 206. 306. and 408. in either their original or amended form. to suggest that in the absence of such specific language the Secretary is not required to determine the validity of mining claims on withdrawn lands prior to approving plans of operation.",

At a time that we are rebuilding American industry and towns and States are competing for new industries to replace older more polluting industries. we are moving to give Eastern States a competitive advantage over the Western States. And we are doing this in the name of environmental protection. It is wrong and it is unconstitutional to discriminate against States located on one side of a manmade line on a map. Further. we allow a Governor of a neighboring State to file a notice to deny a permit in another State based on a showing that the plant emissions may cause an impact on air quality related values. Any one familiar with State rivalries knows that States will compete for industries. To allow a neighboring Governor to veto a plant in a State is wrong and misguided. If we have a problem with air pollution in an individual park. we should deal with that on a parkbypark basis. To adopt this approach instead is to hit small communities near our national parks and Western States with a sledge hammer. Finally.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. over the past two decades. the Clean Air Act has been amended several times. but the research and development provisions of the bill have remained essentially untouched. When one contemplates the overwhelming changes that have transpired during those 20 years. one is left wondering why such an essential part of the Clean Air Act has been virtually ignored. Since passage of the original Clean Air Act. the nature of environmental air problems has changed dramatically. When we first set up an air pollution research program at EPA. we were mostly concerned with dirty. visible smokestack emissions. Today. that problem has largely diminished. Instead. we are facing a new multitude of complex air pollution problems. such as air toxics. ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment. acid rain. and global atmospheric changes. Yet EPAs research mandate has not changed. Mr. Chairman. when the Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970. its single most important mandate was to approach the environment as a complex yet singular and interrelated whole. Research was envisioned as a critical part of that strategy. Yet. where EPAs regulatory responsibilities have been Increasing. the Agencys budget for environmental research has been shrinking. In real dollars the budget has decreased 20 percent in just the last 10 years. As a result EPAs emphasis on the basic research and development has suffered. We can no longer accept the status quo when it comes to air pollution problems. A research and development program driven by existing policy conserations will be incapable of anticipating the future. Mr. Chairman. today I am offering an amendment which substantially incorporates H.R. 4197. the Clean Air Act research Amendments of 1990. which was reported by the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology unanimously on March 14. 1990. The amendments reflects a number of changes developed with the Energy and Commerce Committee that recognize the need for EPA to coordinate its air pollution research activities with other Federal agencies. such as the Department of Energy. that have related research programs.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Science Committee amendment offered by Mr. ROE. This noncontroversial amendment would update the research title of the Clean Air Act. Most of its provisions derive from H.R. 4197. the ScheuerSmith Clean Air Act Research Amendments and H.R. 3816. acid rain research legislation I introduced last November. This amendment calls for broad research and development efforts on air pollution and its health effects. as well as monitoring and control methods. It targets acid rain. and air toxics for continued monitoring. thereby giving us a way of evaluating the future effectiveness of the Clean Air Act in combatting these pollutants. It expands research on pollution prevention methods. It supports improvements in air pollution monitoring equipment. The addition of our language to the clean air act amendments would strengthen the proposal significantly from an environmental standpoint. As you know. the existing research title of the Clean Air Act is 20 years old. Most of its provisions. which have not even been seriously overhauled since the mid1960s. were developed when problems like acid rain. air toxics and global warming were little more than obscure scientific phenomena. These provisions need updating and refocusing in order to respond to todays environmental problems. Passage of this amendment would be an essential part of such an effort. The amendment calls for the continued detection of damage from acid rain after the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program [NAPAP] expires in 1990. Without passage of the Roe amendment. the Environmental Protection Agency will lack the statutory authority to continue this nationwide research on acid rain. Finally. the amendment is considered noncontroversial and has drawn bipartisan support. especially from members of the House Science. Space. and Technology Committee. H.R. 4197. the bill from which this amendment derives. cleared the Science Committee in March by unanimous voice vote. Mr. Chairman. It makes no sense to pass clean air legislation without continuing the research and monitoring on air pollution that will enable us to evaluate its future effectiveness. Support the Roe amendment.",

We have allowed the air above cities. towns. farms. and even above our national parks and wilderness areas to become gray with air pollution. We must recognize that we have failed to a large extent in our stewardship of this planet. But today we have a chance to reverse past mistakes and start on the road to a cleaner. healthier environment. The Clean Air Act has not been revised since 1977. It is past time to face difficult problems squarely and stop postponing the decisions that are required to clean up the Earth and our atmosphere. There has been much debate about the cost of this bill. Those who know my record are aware that I have consistently opposed legislation that would impose unnecessary costs and burdens on consumers or businesses. Cleaning up the air will be costly. But the longterm costs of not cleaning up the air will be far greater. To cite just one example. the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that by reducing the amount of CFCs in the air it may be possible to achieve up to $41 billion in savings from increased agricultural yields. Perhaps more important. cleaning up the air will have a profound effect on health costs. The EPA has also estimated that reducing CFCs would produce a significant reduction in the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts and the number of cancer deaths caused by increased ultraviolet radiation penetrating our weakened atmosphere. To those who question whether we can afford this legislation. I say that we cannot afford not to clean up the atmosphere. We cannot afford the respiratory problems. the cancers. the birth defects. the damage to agricultural products. effects of air pollution on fish and wildlife populations and the natural environment. We cannot afford to let these problems continue. The Roe amendment deserves support. This amendment will expand EPA research programs on air pollution and acid rain. Someone is diagnosed with cancer every 30 seconds and someone dies of cancer every 60 seconds. This expanded EPA reseach program is essential if we are to conquer this and other health problems. We need to know more about the effects of air pollution on human health and our natural environment before we can take effective action. I urge my colleagues to support",

Instead of further highlighting the monetary details of this bill. I want to spend a moment looking back on certain events of the past year which have greatly influenced this particular bill. Few people realize that when an earthquake shocked the San Francisco Bay area just a year ago. the U.S. Army Corps transferred hundreds of engineers to help assess the physical damage of the quake. Earlier the corps helped respond to the Valdez oil spill by converting corps owned dredges into massive oil skimmers that proved to work even more effectively than some existing clean up technologies. Finally. I do not need to remind anyone of the disastrous hurricanes and flooding that have devastated the Eastern Shore and much of the South and Southwestern States over the past year or more. These natural disasters substantially increase the costs of maintaining and operating existing facilities. not to mention raising questions about our shortsightedness in delaying construction of new flood control projects in many of these States. I do not want to belabor the point. but many people falsely perceive flood control and navigation projects as a lower priority than many other appropriations accounts like those that go for education. agricultural research. or defense. But in reality. we are talking about saving lives and saving homes and businesses. with many of the programs and projects that are ini this bill. The same could be said for other portions of this bill that deal with important clean up activities at our nuclear weapons plants. and research at Department of Energy labs that already have led to breakthroughs in industrial applications. Again. I thank my colleague for his leadership with this bill especially in light of the very difficult time we have had this year.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that part of this bill includes the Intellectual Property Antitrust Protection Act of 1989. which was overwhelmingly supported and passed by the Senate in the first session of this Congress. Although changes have been made to S. 270 to accommodate concerns expressed by certain members of the House. the basic thrust of the bill remains the same. The Intellectual Property Antitrust Protection Act clarifies the treatment of intellectual property rights under the antitrust laws. It provides that an intellectual property right. such as a patent. copyright or trademark. will not be presumed to define a market. or to establish market power. whenever the conduct of an owner. licensor. licensee. or other holder is alleged to have violated the antitrust laws in connection with the marketing or distribution of a product or service protected by such a right. In other words. Mr. President. a court will not be allowed to presume market power in a antitrust case merely from the existence of a patent. copyright. or other intellectual property right. As I have noted before. this clarification is long overdue. The denial of certiorari by the Supreme Court in Digidyne Corp. v. Data General Corp.. 473 U.S. 908 (1985). and the Courts earlier decision in Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist No. 2 v. Hyde. 466 U.S. 2 (1984). compel us to address the treatment of intellectual property rights under the antitrust laws. As was noted by Justice White in his dissent in Data General. by denying certiorari. the Court refused to address. and thus left unclear. what effect should be given to a copyright or other legal monopoly in determining market power. This bill. in clarifying the treatment of intellectual property in antitrust cases. strikes a healthy balance between the policies of antitrust enforcement and the policies underlying intellectual property rights. It does not prevent a finding of market power where appropriate. but merely prohibits courts from presuming market power without proof that it exists. Mr. President. I believe that enactment of this bill. especially the Intellectual property provisions. will greatly encourage the marketing of new and innovative products. and will ultimately enhance the worldwide competitiveness of the United States. I encourage all my colleagues to support this legislation.",

In brief. this amendment prevents the abuse of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. popularly known as RICO. as a tool to surpress the exercise of first amendment rights. It simply provides that nonviolent public speech. protected by the first amendment. may not be treated as \"racketeering activity\" for purposes of crippling RICO lawsuits. Mr. President. there has been considerable support in Congress for legislation correcting various abuses of the RICO civil action. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved RICO reform legislation this year in the form of S. 438. and the House Judiciary Committee also approved a RICO reform bill in the form of H.R. 5111. Due to the limited time left before adjournment. and the differing approaches taken in the House and Senate bills. it seems apparent that neither of the board RICO reform bills will be enacted this year. However. we can and should enact a limited revision of RICO in the critical area of first amendment freedoms. I think all Members will agree that the RICO statute should not be used as a tool to suppress free speech. For that reason.

Today we need to alter the tax rate schedule In order to eliminate the regressvity In the current system where tax rates. both statutory and effective. fall for filers with the highest Incomes. This bill will also move us toward a reduced deficit. This bill will leave unchanged the tax liabilities of most families. increase by only 2percentage points the tax rate of moderately high Income families. for example. married couples earning between $78.400 and $185.730. but increase the marginal tax rate to 35 percent for the wealthiest individuals. for example. married couples earning over $185.730. These rate Increases still will keep the maximum rates considerably below the 50percent rate which was in effect as recently as 1986 and dramatically below the 70percent rate which was In effect until 1980. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that these changes will also generate $79.1 billion worth of deficit reduction over the next 5 years. I do not need to stress the importance of deficit reduction. Reducing the deficit will allow the economy to grow. free future generations of an onerous burden. and restore rationality to the budget process. Mr. Speaker.

It was the American people who supported and paid for Harry Trumans Marshall plan. it was the American spirit President Kennedy expressed at the Berlin Wall. and it was the deeply held values of the American people President Carter championed in his foreign policy. This is a great day for democracy. And it is a great day for the American people. We stood with freedom in the face of a long. cold. and bitter wind. And freedom has prevailed.",

Hermine Beckett Hanna has spent 30 years of her life enriching the lives of senior citizens and gaining recognition for grandparents. As a result of her continued efforts over those years. grandparents have had a day to call their own. As you know. National Grandparents Day has been celebrated every year since 1979. Hermines efforts have touched thousands of seniors. including two distinguished former Members of this House. the Honorable William F. Walsh and the late Honorable Claude Pepper. who were with Hermine as she began her endeavor in 1961. Building on a theme that Is gaining momentum in the United States. Hermine has directed her attention to educating the young in our community to the important contributions senior citizens have made. and to the important contributions they are willing to make if asked. Hermine urges the young to adopt a grandparent. not for 1 day a year. not for material giving. but for a lifetime of experience and caring just waiting to be shared with others. And so. my fellow colleagues. I am pleased to bring Hermine to your attention for her important role in the establishment of Grandparents Day. Her commitment is an example to the Nation. and I wish her well in bringing her message to the children of today. and the grandparents of tomorrow.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am joining with my colleague from Vermont. Representative PETER SMITH. in introducing legislation to address current. as well as future. environmental problems in Lake Champlain. As the sixth largest fresh water lake in the United States. as well as an international body of water. the ecological wellbeing of Lake Champlain is important to the United States and Canada. alike. Maintaining its recreational. social. and economic assets is important to the surrounding residents. industrial interests and governmental entities. The 600squaremile lake is suffering environmental damage from point as well nonpoint source pollution. Coordinated management of these resources is imperative and long overdue. The legislation we are introducing authorizes $25 million to create and implement a 5year pollution control and restoration program for Lake Champlain. The program includes a management conference to coordinate Federal. State. and local action in the effort. Identical legislation has been introduced in the other body by New York Senators DAMATO and MOYNIHAN and Vermont Senators JEFFORDS and LEAHY. In 1988. the States of New York and Vermont. and the Canadian province of Quebec entered into a memorandum of understanding to conduct cooperative planning and research for management. protection. and enhancement of Lake Champlain and its environment. Clearly. this is a bipartisan effort to address environmental problems which will not resolve themselves. The citizens of New York and Vermont have demonstrated their commitment to restoring the environmental integrity of Lake Champlain. The Federal Government must now lend its assistance in this important endeavor. as it has for other water resources vital to our Nation. We must protect all of our waterways from environmental damage. and Lake Champlain is no exception. It deserves our ongoing attention and protection. We cannot delay any further. Action must be taken now to enact into law the Lake Champlain Special Designation Act. We owe it to current. as well as future. generations of Americans to take responsible action before it really Is too late.",

MARTIN. and I have introducedthe Lake Champlain Special Designation Act. It is landmark legislation that is badly needed to protect a great body of water joining our two States from the deadly effects of pollution. For years we have worried about the increasing pressures of development of this beautiful and plentiful resource. in terms of fisheries and water quality. Now. with passage of this bill. we have the chance to prevent those damages before they occur while cleaning up the effects of old disasters. I believe this is a model piece of legislation. It seeks to establish an ecologically sound management scheme. early enough in the game to ensure a healthy lake well into the next century. In introducing this legislation. I would like to commend the members of the two delegations for working together in protecting Lake Champlain. Using this bill as a springboard. future generations of Vermonters and New Yorkers will be able to put their strong environmental convictions into practice. and save this lake as an invaluable natural resource for all Americans.",

I say to the Senator. is even though it is determined that it is not readily achievable to provide access under those conditions. that there must be some alternative method designed. Maybe the regulations of the Justice Department say you have to have a ramp. which is in this case would be. we will say. 20 feet high and 75 feet long.

But as a former small businessman and chairman of the Small Business Committee of the U.S. Senate. I am concerned. I am concerned about what I think may put some people out of business. And the reason we are here debating this bill. the reason we are talking about it. is that we are obligated here to weigh the interest of the rights of the handicapped. which ought to be total. against what is obviously going to be quite a burden for a lot of small business people. AnJ what I am trying to do is to set this record straight so that these small business people who do not want to pay a penalty and who want to come into compliance have some understanding of what their rights are. Now my question is this: going back to the same illustration. Somebody is going to write some regulations and say. for example. you will provide a ramp for wheelchair people if the building is less than three stories high. Somebody is going to go to have to make some kind of a regulation about what you do to provide accessibility and what you do not do.

When West Germany mandated lifts on their buses. it is amazing what happened. Some entrepreneurs went to work and they developed this lift that only cost $8.000 or $9.000. That is the one being used in Denver. It is made in West Germany. West Germany. I will tell the Senator this and I will stake a lot of money on this bet with the Senator. If we pass this bill we will find businesses out there looking at 4.000 buses that the Greyhound Corp. has. plus a lot of others. it is going to be about 16 years from now when the new buses will be phased in. We can bet our bottom dollar someone is going to be out there. the new technology is going to come along and these new lifts will be cheaper.

H.R. 1400. which was favorably reported by the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service on September 26. H.R. 1400 was originally introduced by my distinguished colleague from Maryland. Congresswoman MORELLA. on March 14. 1989. and it has 373 cosponsors. I want to salute Congresswoman MORELLA. who serves on the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits. for her tireless efforts to advance this legislation. S. 1890 would remove the restriction in present law which limits the creditability of National Guard technician service to persons who performed such service on or after January 1. 1969. The bill also applies to Federal retirees who retired on or after January 1. 1969. but before the date of enactment of this act. The legislation. as reported by our committee and as approved by the Senate. would require employees or retirees to make a deposit. with interest. in order to receive retirement credit for pre1969 National Guard service. Current employees would be required to make a deposit before they retire. Retirees and survivors may make these deposits in either a lump sum or in installments over a period not to exceed 2 years. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1890. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

I am pleased to rise in favor of the passage of S. 1890. a bill to provide relief from inequities which remain in the crediting of Civil Service retirement to National Guard technicians who retired before January 1. 1969. The average age of these National Guard technicians is about 66 years of agemost of them are World War II and Korean war veterans. The concept of this bill is not new to Congress. Ever since the 91st Congress. bills have been introduced to address this inequity which befell National Guard technicians. I introduced such legislation in the 100th and the 101st Congresses. Mr. Speaker. I am heartened to see that S. 1890 is before us today. Though this legislation has a long history. it would not have come to the floor without the tenacity of my constituent. Joe Cimmino. who has. over the years. done a superb job in patiently explaining to Members staffs the inequities and necessity to correct present law. Nothing happens without somebody making it happen. He has indeed been the guiding force. I think he deserves credit for it. Also I would like to commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. the gentleman from New York . for helping to guide this bill through. and his staff. Particularly I want to pay tribute to someone else who has been tenacious. the person on my staff. Heea Fales. for the work she has done indefatigably on this bill. Mr. Speaker. it should have been simple. but it wasnt. Now it is finally coming to fruition. Mr. Speaker. I believe the bills are unique in that though they affect only 105 people. 81 Senators and 374 Members of the House have supported S. 1890 and H.R. 1400. I want to take this opportunity to thank each of them for their support. especially our colleague from Mississippi. Mr. MONTGOMERY. who has always supported the National Guard technicians. Thank you.

I rise in support of S. 1890. a bill which corrects inequity against the group of individuals who were employed as National Guard civilian employee technicians. In 1968. Congress passed legislation granting Federal civil service credit to those technicians who worked for National Guard units across the country. However. the law only covered those technicians who served after January 1. 1969. It did not cover those technicians who left the Guard prior to January 1. 1969. to work somewhere else in the Federal Government. Later. legislation in the 94th and 99th Congress corrected most of this oversight. except for a small group of about 100. The last attempt was H.R. 3006. which I introduced back in 1986. Before that. in the late 1970s. and even in the 1980s. I was working to correct this inequity. Now my good friend. the gentlewoman from Maryland . introduced H.R. 1400. the companion bill to S. 1890. last year in another attempt to correct this inequity. I am proud that I am a sponsor of H.R. S. 1890 had 81 cosponsors. as has been mentioned. This bill. H.R. 1400. has 374 cosponsors. I only wish that it was a House bill that we were passing today. because the gentlewoman from Maryland and the gentleman from New York and others have done all of the work. I certainly want to congratulate both Members. as well as several others I would like to mention. One is Joe Cimmino. who is a retired technician. He has worked to lobby for this bill. He is responsible for a number of House Members and Senate Members who have cosponsored the bill. What really makes it wonderful. this bill does riot affect him at all. It was something he felt like should be corrected. He is a retired technician. but he gets no benefits from this work. Second. Heea Fales. minority staff on the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits. She has worked very hard and pushed this bill. Mr. Speaker. I have to admit that I tried to do this for 10 years. I have been unsuccessful. I congratulate those who have been successful. I hope Members will support this legislation.",

Mr. Speaker. H.R. 2548 represents the culmination of 2 years of intentive effort by environmentalists. the business and agricultural communities. and local governments to reach a consensus plan to protect and restore the Laguna de Santa Rosa area in northern California. Located in the Russian River watershed. the Laguna de Santa Rosa plays an important role in wildlife protection. agriculture. flood control. and in providing open space and recreational opportunity. As one of the most significant freshwater wetlands in northern California. the Laguna supports a wide variety of plants. animals and waterfowl. This includes over 230 types of birds and several State and Federal rare. threatened or endangered species. Unfortunately. the Laguna and its resources remain at considerable risk. Urban encroachment. adverse landuse practices. and conflicting public management practices have all resulted in the loss of significant wetlands habitat. Despite State and local conservation efforts. nothing short of a national commitment to protecting this area will reverse the present course of irreparable long term damage. H.R. 2548 provides the Secretary of Interior with the authority to establish a 9.000acre Laguna de Santa Rosa National Wildlife Refuge developed with a comprehensive land acquisition and management program. With the cooperation of the State of California. H.R. 2548 is designed to restore and enhance wetlands habitat. protect sensitive plant and animal species. encourage the maintenance of agriculture. and enhance educational and recreational opportunities. I believe these goals all point to this areas national significance. Mr. Speaker. the truly unique broadbased community support that exists for this measure offers us the opportunity to take a very constructive step forward in protecting the Laguna de Santa Rosa.

Mr. Speaker. the legislation which is before the House is the result of a bipartisan compromise on international narcotics control assistance for fiscal year 1991. A great deal of work has gone into this compromise. In particular. I would like to commend our ranking minority member. BILL BROOMFIELD. LARRY SMITH. the chairman of the Committees Task Force on International Narcotics Control. and his minority counterpart BEN GILMAN: PETER KOSTMAYER. from the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. and chairman and ranking minority member of the Human Rights Subcommittee. for their tireless efforts to put together this language. None of us is completely satisfied with the language as it stands. but in an effort to move this process forward we have all had to make some sacrifices. The Committee on Foreign Affairs ordered reported H.R. 5567 on September 11 of this year. In order to gain bipartisan support. we subsequently made several changes to that bill and offered it as an amendment to the comprehensive crime control bill. H.R. 5289. It was adopted by the House on voice vote on October 4. at which time I included a detailed explanation in the RECORD of the background of the provisions in the measure. for purposes of legislative history. I am again submitting a detailed explanation of the bill as amended. Given the uncertain status of the conference on the crime bill. we are now taking up H.R. 5567 with amendments as a freestanding bill. The amendments consist of technical clarifications sought by the executive branch. and an increase in the ceiling we established on military aid and police aid to the three Andean countries. Military and police aid to these countries would now be set at an aggregate total of $250 million. with a $175 million subceiling on each type of aid. It is our understanding that this formulation is acceptable to the other body. and we would hope that they would pass it as a freestanding bill without further amendments as expeditiously as possible.

The International Narcotics Control Act of 1990 is the product of many hours of work by the Foreign Affairs Committee. After H.R. 5567 was originally reported out of committee last month. we developed compromise language which was supported by the full House and added as title XXIII to H.R. 5269. the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1990. The legislation before us today represe.1ts a further modification from title XXIII. Committe Republicans have always indicated that our major problem with the title XXIII legislation was the authorized level of $67.5 million in foreign military financing. The FMF level of $118 million in this bill represents a major increase from the amount in title XXIII. H.R. 5567 sets an overall ceiling of $250 million on police and military aid. This ceiling is likely to be higher than the available funds. given other demands on the various assistance channels. Because the future of H.R. 5269 is uncertain. and because the Foreign Affairs Committee strongly believes that H.R. 5567 should be enacted into law this year. we are acting today on freestanding legislation. I support H.R. 5567. and would like to commend the chairman for his efforts to work out legislation that Is agreeable to the minority and to the administration.

No one has been more committed to assisting these individuals than the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Jack Kemp. Without his leadership. we would not be here today. In addition. I must thank and commend my colleague. ALAN CRANSTON. chairman of the Senate Housing Subcommittee. for his dedication and hard work in getting a housing bill. Chairman CRANSTON and I have spent 3 years developing this legislation. I know that we are both pleased to have our efforts. and those of people like Jim Rouse and David Maxwell. come to fruition. Lastly. let me recognize my friends in the House who made this bill possibleChairman HENRY GONZALEZ. Congressman CHALMERS WYLIE. and Congresswoman MARGE ROUKEMA. Without the strong leadership of Chairman GONZALEZ. we would not have a housing bill. He. in particular. is to be commended for his longtime dedication to addressing urban and rural housing problems around the country. And. of course. the guidance and direction of the Republican leadership on the House Banking Committee has been essential to energize this process. As I recall. it was just over a year and a half ago that CHALMERS WYLIE called a meeting between the President and the leadership of the House Banking Committee. That meeting helped to spur the movement of housing legislation. Congressman WYLIE must be credited for taking the initiative to make housing an issue for 1990.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that the conferees during deliberation of the National Affordable Housing Act agreed to integrate housing and supportive services to enable many. of this Nations elderly to live independently. As you know. I have been a very strong supporter of the existing Congregate Housing Services Program [CHSP]. I have visited the CHSP facilities in Maine and continue to be impressed with their effectiveness and operation. I have seen firsthand the importance of CHSP to Maines elderly. For a modest amount of money. the CHSP has prevented the unnecessary institutionalization of thousands of senior citizens. enabling them to live out their lives in dignity and independence. As we move on to the new congregate housing program under the conference report. I would like to. clarify the transition process with you by which existing CHSP sites will be incorporated into the new funding structure and program. Under section 802(i)(1)(B)(i) of the legislation. it appears that existing CHSP programs are exempt from the matching requirements under the new congregate program for 3 years. The language also says that \"The Secretary concerned shall require each such program to maintain. for such 3year period. the same dollar amount of annual contributions in support of the services eligible for assistance under this section as were contributed to such program during the year preceding the date of the enactment of this act.\" In addition. under section 802(j)(3) of the legislation. it appears that existing CHSP programs are to be funded for the remainder of the term of the. contract and then are to receive priority for assistance upon the expiration of such contract. My concern about the transition stems from the fact that many of the existing CHSP contracts are for 1 year. Therefore. when these contracts expire. for example in February or March of 1991. was it the intent of the managers to ensure that existing CHSP contracts. upon availability of funding for CHSP. are renewed for 3 years? I am concerned that upon the expiration of existing CHSP contracts. the current CHSP sites may receive priority for funding only. but not necessarily an extension of their existing contracts.",

This week marks the 31st anniversary of Public Law 8690. which instructed \"the President to issue a proclamation each year until such time as freedom and Independence shall have been achieved for all captive nations\" In light of recent reforms which are changing the entire face of the Communist world. it Is especially timely that we remember the plight of millions July 21. 1.989 who struggle for freedom and selfdetermination in all the captive nations. The recent elections in Poland and the overwhelming victory of the Solidarity Party provide hope for peaceful change in Sovietbloc countries. We must not. however. be blinded by these events and Gorbachevs promises of glasnost. Instead. we must continue to press the Soviets on human rights issues until all citizens of the captive nations have their freedom. The litany of continuing oppression goes on and on. The Ukrainian Catholic and Orthodox churches are still outlawed. Soviet Jews face many hurdles trying to emigrate and reunite with their families. Countless minorities are persecuted for either their religious beliefs or their national and cultural aspirations. There is. however. no greater force than the human spirit and its yearning for freedom. No regime can forever deny the basic rights of its citizens. Despite the risks involved. massive public demonstrations continue within the Soviet Union. They are protesting for freedom of speech. freedom of religion. and democratic government. Their voices are being heard and they are making a difference. Sooner or later. change must come. Progress has been made in some of the captive nations. but there is still a long way to go. We must use this historic opening in Soviet society to foster liberalization from within. At the same time. we must condemn crackdowns from hardliners In the government. The celebration of Captive Nations Day reminds us of how fortunate we are in this country to live in a free society and how important it is that we never rest until all people around the world enjoy these same freedoms. I commend the Captive Nations Week Committee of Metropolitan Detroit for organizing this important event. The plight of those living in the capthie nations must never be forgotten.",

What leads me to conclude that the B2 would be a very good investment for the security of the United States is as follows: A very good case can be made for reasons of technology. arms control. and force structure. The technological argument is the most profound one. Much the way the advent of the submarine in the early part of this century fundamentally transformed naval warfare. the advent of the Stealth bomber will transform air warfare. Ships visible on the waters surface become invisible under the water as submarines. Just as a handful of submarines in the early years of the Second World War almost won the fight against Britain. It was not until 1943 that the Battle of the Atlantic was finally won. That is what this Stealth airplane does. the B2 airplane does.

Concerning the request of the gentleman. the ranking minority member. the majority did allow the gentleman from Alabama . to offer the Cheney budget early in the bill. they provided that if that Cheney budget passed. then they would allow an amendment to be offered clustering the V22 and the F14 so that it would attract more votes to be successful. However. should the Cheney budget fail. the gentleman from Alabama EMr. DIcKINsON] was then deprived of his right to offer the kind of separate amendments that would attract the most votes. as was given to the proponents of the V22 and the F14.

The U.S. Coast Guard has served our Nation with honor and distinction both in times of war and in times of peace. This legislation authorizes $2.3 billion for the Coast Guard to continue the provision of vital services: To enforce customs laws. provide lifesaving. training. and other safetyrelated functions. assist in water pollution and olispill control. enforce fisheries laws and protection of our territorial waters. and. of course. provide assistance to stop the influx of Illegal narcotics at our Nations borders. The total level of funding in this bill represents an increase of $3 million above the Presidents request and $477 million above the authorization for fiscal year 1989. Mr. Chairman. recently we were pleased to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Coast Guards founding on August 4. 1790. I am confident that my colleagues In the Congress share my pleasure in observing the tremendous progress made since that time by this smallest branch of our Armed Forces. Accordingly. I urge my colleagues to join In supporting H.R. 2549. the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1989.",

It gives a small preferred advantage to American companies. when bidding against foreign companies. for American taxpayer dollars relative to this authorization act. provided that the product is literally put together and assembled by American hands. Second of all. that it contains at least 50 percent contents that were domestically produced. I think it offers again an opportunity that instead of having Just food stamps. housing vouchers. welfare. we get a chance to keep a couple of companies alive on closed competitive bidding procedures. where many times other foreign firms come in with lower labor wages and come in with loss leaders. I think it is good language. It is a reasonable type of procurement policy. Without question. it is an attempt to get our foot in the door and hopefully down the line with leadership from leaders on the other side like the gentleman from New York . the gentleman from Michigan . and others. maybe we can even give a better shot to American firms.

This advisory group would be funded largely by private contributions of $2 million a year. It also allows specific projects to be funded from the national oilspill fund at the discretion of the fund operator. Failure by the private sector facilities to provide the resources that they have committed to. would result in that facility loosing its Coast Guard contingency plan. Such plans will be a requirement of operations in the near future. The language that I am introducing today represents a compromise that is the combined efforts of the communities in Alaska most affected by the Exxon Valdez and other spills. fishing groups from all over the State with the common goal of making the transportation of 25 percent of our Nations oil production safer to transport. and the oil industry. The Alaskan oil industry and all other groups that have been involved with this process have been very forward thinking in their approach to citizen involvement and they too should be commended for their efforts. Specifically this amendment would set up advisory committees in the Prince William Sound and in the Cook Inlet. These committees would make recommendations to the terminal operators on safety improvements and environmental concerns. The oil industry is then required to respond specifically in writing if they are not able to comply with the recommendation. The advisory committees will have the resources to hire consultants and to do independent scientific research necessary to fulfill their mandate. This amendment may provide the model for oil operations around the country. So that through better community involvement we can move forward with more domestic energy production and a safer transportation system. This is a good amendment. Mr. Chairman. and I urge its immediate adoption.",

This amendment helps to open up the door to many Coast Guard families who are In need of decent. affordable housing. As It now stands. the Defense Department now has the authority to transfer Departmentowned housing properties to Defense agencies. and the uniformed services. Yet. the Coast Guard Is not Included. This amendment equalizes the status of the Coast Guard with the other services on this important Issue. I know how difficult it Is for citizens working in the military and Coast Guard to find affordable housing. In my own district of Rhode Island. I recently discovered that eight service families working for the Navy found the situation so tough that they were living in public housing. Eighteen Navy families receive food stamps. and eight families are receiving AFDC. In the defense bill of this year. I helped to get $13.7 million to help out with refurbishing affordable Navy housing in Middleton. RI. Certainly. additional housing made available under the Base Closure Act should be made available to those service familiesmilitary and Coast Guardwho most need It. In Rhode Island. Massachusetts. Connecticut. and New York alone the Base Closure Act will close out almost 240 units of housing Identified as suitable and desirable for Coast Guard families. Of the 239 housing units. 39 of these units are presently occupied by Coast Guard families who will be forced out. Including the Coast Guard in the group of services with access to Department of Defense housing will greatly ease this burden to Coast Guard employees. I fully support this amendment to make it easier for all families serving our country to have access to the kind of safe and attractive housing that they deserve. The Coast Guard plays a crucial role for Americas coastal security Interests. Lets not make It harder for Americas Coast Guard families to live by the shores where they work.

I might observe. however. that it is difficult sometimes to make genuine policy criticisms. which I feel are legitimate and. in fact. I believe are needed if we are to improve the process of working ourselves out of this problem. if we are. for example. going to have a good debate about how to pay for the savings and loan problem. Are we going to pay for it in present value terms. for example. over a 5- or 6year period. or are we going to pay for it over 40 years? How is the structure of the bailout going to work? What sort of policies are we going to have toward housing in America? All these sorts of things. it seems to me. are legitimate questions. and we are apt to have disagreements.

We believe that is in the language. but it was never our intention. and we are glad to make that clear. I. myself. would prefer not having a cap. But I understand the concerns which have been expressed here. If that is the will and the judgment of this body. I certainly accept that because I think the other provisions in this legislation are so important in terms of addressing the fundamental problems. We should not prohibit those remedies from going into effect because of that particular issue. I will announce later in the day. working with the Senator from Arkansas and others. the Senators from Oklahoma and Montana and a number of others who are concerned about this. what we might try and achieve and do. I just wanted to give those assurances to the Senator as we move forward in this.",

First and most important. of course. deals with the substance of the measure and it remains my hope that we will be able to reach agreement on the substance of the measure that will permit us to pass and see enacted into law a strong and effective civil rights bill. That process of negotiation has been ongoing for several weeks and I know that many Senators have been involved. including the distinguished Senator from Vermont who is present on the floor who has been a valuable contributing member to those negotiations. In addition. we have been discussing the best way to proceed to disposition of the bill with or without an agreement. As all Senators know the invocation of cloture limits the time for Senate consideration of the bill and that time continues to run. I have earlier today obtained agreement to proceed to continue debate on the measure and. to facilitate the continuing process of negotiations in both respects. not to have any amendments offered during that time. In both instances those have followed discussions with and have been cleared with the distinguished Republican leader. so that that process can continue. having this cleared by the Republican leader.

It seems to fall completely within the Cove decision which says a civil remedy was the type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of common law: Remedies intended to punish culpable individuals as opposed to those simply required to extract compensation or restore the status quo were issued by courts of law as opposed to courts of equity. Then it goes on to say that such cases require a jury to determine the damages under the seventh amendment. I would appreciate knowing that because certainly it does open ip a number of options for us if you do not have to go to the jury trial. which I am sure this body would be interested in.

Legal relief. of course. is the type which would require a jury trial. \"First.\" the court says. \"we have characterized damages as equitable where they are restitution. such as an action for disgorgement of improper profits.\" \"Second. a monetary award incidental to or intertwined with injunctive relief may be equitable.\" In these harassment cases. that is almost always the kind of equitable relief which is sought. I do not need to repeat the other kinds of cases in which such awards are permitted under our statutes without a jury trial except to say that cases like copyright cases have a great deal of relationship to the situation we had here. They are very frequently cases in which it is clear that there has been a violation of the plaintiffs rights but where precise delineation of exactly what damages are is extremely unclear. I cannot tell my colleague at this point whether or not these statutes have been tested but they are still on the books so they are still being enforced to authorize awards of what amount to damages in very large amountsthe largest I think I quoted here was up to $500.000without jury trials.

I agree with my distinguished colleague from Idaho that section 89. in current form. is much more complex than is needed to guarantee that employees within a company benefit equally from a companys taxexempt health insurance plan. However. while I am supportive of the amendment. I do not believe it is necessary to call for the repeal of this section of the Internal Revenue Code. While the end result of section 89 is far from the initial concept Members of the Congress had in 1986. it should not be repealed. Mr. President. the Congress started out with a simple enough concept in 1986to ensure that workers had access to their employers health plans and that employers did not intentionally or unintentionally exclude lowpaid workers from participating in their best or executive only health plans. However. as we are all well aware. the Congress instead adopted ridiculously confusing and complex rules in order to ensure that workers actually elect the health benefits being offered regardless of their income bracket. As section 89 currently stands. the only thing we are accomplishing is to confuse employers and put employees at risk of having their health benefits stripped away. This end result is far from the original intent we had just 3 years ago to ensure equitable health insurance coverage. April 12.1.989 We must move swiftly to simplify these burdensome rules and I believe we are doing that. On March 17 of this year. I Joined my friend and colleague from Arkansas In introducing the section 89 Simplification Act of 1989 to give employers an opportunity to avoid the tremendous burden of testIng health plans for compliance with section 89. S. 654 provides the option of returning to that simple concept the Congress envisioned. This bill is a start. Most importantly. It Is providing us with a vehicle to open up discussion with the business community on this most serious issue. Mr. President. we need to simplify section 89. I think we can all agree with that.

I applaud the initiative taken by Senator Symms in offering this resolution which requests the House of Representatives to adopt and send a bill to repeal or modify section 89 of the Tax Code. The objective of section 89 was to make sure that employers made the same fringe benefits available to both key employees as well as the rank and file employees. With 25 million uninsured workers and workers families in America. encouraging private insurance coverage is a worthwhile goal. This sounds reasonable. The problem is that instead of encouraging more health coverage for workers. employers are dropping their plans because they cant figure out the rules necessary to comply with the new law. Several bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to change section 89 in some way. These bills either repeal. delay or modify current law. I understand that the bill on the House side that calls for a straight repeal of section 89 has nearly 300 cosponsors. On March 15 I introduced S. 595. the section 89 Small Business Relief Act of 1989. My bill takes a different approach toward reform. I do not believe it is a final solution to the problems caused by section 89. but I do hope it will serve as the basis for a compromise. S. 595 proposes five changes In the current law. First. it would completely exempt those businesses with fewer than 20 employees from the section 89 requirements. Second. it would delay the compliance date for 2 years after the effective date. which was January 1. 1989. Third S. 595 would raise the standard of coverage from 17 hours a week to 25 hours. Fourth. my bill would reduce the required coverage percentage in the \"alternate coverage test\" from 80 percent to 65 percent. Finally. It would also declare that companies offering equal benefits to all will be judged in compliance with law whether or not all employees choose to participate. Mr. President. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to make this law workable for business men and women in this country.",

The original objective of section 89 may have been to discourage discrimination in employersponsored benefit plans. but the effect has been to discourage employers from offering any benefit plans at all. The recordkeeping and testing requirements are so complex. and the penalties for noncompliance are so severe. that many small businesses are finding they cannot afford to continue to provide group health insurance or other benefit plans. If our Tax Code is to be used to promote social goals. such as broader access to health care and employee benefits. we should make sure that the tax laws help accomplish these goals. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives to address the problem: bills to delay implementation of section 89. bills to repeal section 89. and bills making substantive changes in the law to provide relief from its worst excesses. The cosponsor lists on all of these bills continue to grow. It is clear that Members of both Houses want to act on legislation which will provide a workable remedy for U.S. employers. I am pleased to join Senator LOTT and Senator SYMMS in urging the House of Representatives to initiate action and to send the Senate a bill that will eliminate the problems section 89 is causing.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague from Vermont in proposing this important amendment. The amendment we are offering would exempt employers who offer their employees remedial education from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Some employers presently offer remedial education to help bring their employees reading. writing. and arithmetic skills up to an eighthgrade level. Under current law. the kind of compensation to which employees participating in such education programs are entitled is unclear. Because of this uncertainty. some employers who might otherwise initiate worker education programs are discouraged from doing so. In todays rapidly changing world. we must prepare each individual not only to function. but also to become a participating. contributing member of society. If we fall in this responsibility. not only do we fail those individuals. but society as well. By promoting employer education programs we will be taking a small step toward opening doors for many Americans who would otherwise have little hope of surviving in the modem work force. Too many people are entering the American work force illprepared. illiterate. and undereducated. 700.000 young people drop out of high school each year. Another 700.000 graduate functionally illiterate. Add to that 1 million workingage immigrants entering the American work force each year. and you begin to realize the gravity of the situation that confronts us. These people must be educated. Mr. President. by exempting employers who sponsor remedial education programs from paying overtime compensation to participating employees. we hope to encourage more businesses to initiate such programs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today we are considering a major initiative aimed at protecting most American workers from unfair labor practices. If signed Into law. this minimum wage bill would prevent exploitation of the working poor. increase buying power. and stimulate the economy. There is one important group. however. who will not see the benefits of a raise in the minimum wage. I am referring to the men and women who serve us every day here on Capitol Hill. By exempting itself from important labor and civil rights laws. like the Fair Labor Standards Act. Congress has applied a double standard to its own employees. We deprive the men and women who make our work possible of the civil. physical. and economic working rights and standards enjoyed by other Americans. The result: Dickensian working conditions suffered by some Capitol Hill employees. Eleven years ago. I realized that Congress has to clean house and for the first time introduced the Fair Employment in Congress Act. Since then. I have reintroduced similar legislation over and over again. The bills purpose is simple. It would eliminate Congress exemption from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. the Equal Pay Act. the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. the Occupational Safety and Health Act. section 504 of the Reha..itation Act of 1973and the Fair Labor Standards Act. It would make Congress subject to the same restrictions upon employment and discrimination which apply to the rest of the country. Today. the Senate takes an important step toward reforming the double standard which we have applied to our workers. I commend my Vermont colleague. Senator JEFFORDS. for his work in this area. Adoption of this resolution marks the first time the Senate has recognized its own employees in this context. I thank Senators FoRD and STEVENS for their willingness to bring the issue of congressional application of the Fair Labor Standards Act before the Senate Rules Committee. The time for discussion and debate on this issue is long overdue. I am encouraged by the efforts of Senators JEFFORDS. FoRD. and STEVENS on this resolution and by Senator GLENNS commitment to discuss the Issue of Capitol Hill labor practices before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

At current crime rates. the Department estimates that over 83 percent of all Americans will be victimized by a violent crime at some point in their lives. This is a sobering statistic. Unfortunately. with drug abuse rampant across the country. this statistic is not unrealistic. However. there is hope. Studies have shown that in order to win the war against crime we must move away from our lopsided dependence on the Government and its enforcement agencies and move toward a partnership between the Government and the people. This partnership should have two goals. First. to encourage the people to provide the police with any information that might assist them in solving a crime. Second. the Government must ensure the people that when individuals are convicted of crimes. they will serve their time. In the hopes of moving this partnership forward I have introduced the Good Neighbor Act of 1989. This bill would designate as taxexempt moneys received by citizens In recognition for their assistance in solving a criminal investigation. In order to qualify for the taxexempt status. an award must be sponsored by a qualified nonprofit organization. and the arresting agency must certify that the Information provided by the taxpayer materially contributed to the arrest. It Is my hope that this measure will encourage more people to come forward and participate In the various crime stopper programs which exist throughout the country. In addition. I have cosponsored H.R. 2529 which would increase penalties against criminals and others who wrongfully use or possess firearms. For instance. this measure would create a mandatory 5year minimum sentence without opportunity for parole for the unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. fugitive from justice. unlawful user of a controlled substance. or one who deals in stolen firearms. While these two measures alone are not going to solve the problems of crime In America. I believe they are a step In the right direction. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Good Neighbor Act which I am Introducing today. By doing so we are recognizing the courage which is required when a citizen is willing to Individually stand up against crime.",

They succeeded in doing so and have maintained an active membership of 150 over the past 50 years. The members are a diverse group comprised of teachers. doctors. engineers. and other professionals. The organization serves as a professional link with community affairs and Intercultural projects with other ethnic organizations. There is also a monthly publication entitled \"The Bulletin\" which Is an important link among the members keeping them abreast on monthly events. activities. graduations. weddings. and so forth. Members often refer to The Bulletin as a way Into a close knit family since members are not exclusively In the Detroit and Windsor area. It also features Ukrainian history and current events In the Ukraine. Education plays an important role In the goals and objectives of the club. Twelve scholarships are awarded annually to high school students of Ukrainian descent who show promising futures. Ukrainian culture also plays an important role in the organization. One of their major activities is a type of folk egg decorating called pysanky. Members have taught classes and have had displays at museums and at shopping malls. One ambitious member even wrote a book about it.

It is thus only fair that all employees should have a say In where their money is Invested. During the debate. those who supported striking the Visclosky provisions stated that there is no precedent for joint trusteeship. In fact. multlemployer plans have been managed in this fashion for over 40 years. Other opponents cited their concerns about the performance of these pension plans under joint trusteeship. It is important to note that multiemployer plans generally perform as well as singleemployer plans. Quite simply. this is a fairness issue. The democratic process is invigorated by giving employees a voice in where their pension funds are invested.",

My plane flight over the United StatesMexico border provided breathtaking views of mountains. mesas. and the mighty Rio Grande. I was flying into Maria to attend the dedication launch of Texas first aerostat radar balloon. deployed along the border to deter drug smuggling aircraft from penetrating U.S. airspace. As the plane followed the Rio Grande. I could look down and clearly see the land to two countries on either side. Nothing but water stands between American and Mexican soil. The trip brought home to me both the importance of protecting our country from drug smugglers and apparent ease with which they may enter. I am working toward two goals for the drug war in Texas: First. supporting local community efforts. and second. stopping drug trafficking along the Southwest border. We would not be here today without the commitment and hard work of the local communities. The people who make all this happen are the ones who deserve the greatest thanks. Without local residents. there would be no aerostat and no troops to win the war on drugs. In west Texas. local residents and the Federal Government are joining forces to beat drugs at the border. No trespassingthat is what the radar balloons tell those drug traffickers on the other side. For you. no trespassing. no vacancy. no thanks. We simply do not want your business. Cooperation and community action help keep the dealers business out of our daily business.",

These refugees have been controlled by various factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. These people are extremely scared and worded after hearing rumors about repatriation which is likely to occur In the next few months. This does not mean that those people do not want to return to their homeland. but that they are afraid of being forced to repatriate by the factions who have controlled them for years. If Khmer people. who live in the camps In ibailand. want to go back to Cambodia with Khmer Rouge. they should be able to do so. Just the same. if they want to go back to Cambodia with Son Sann. they to should retain that right. Forcing these refugees into repatriation is selfdamning. Condoning such action does nothing for the progression of human rights. it only Inhibits this process which we are continually striving for. Once again. it Is time to truly recognize the needs of these war stricken refugees. Let us take quick action before this forced repatriation transpires.",

First. the Education and Labor Committee bill does allow churchbased child care. If a church wants to operate a sectarian child care program as part of their ministry. of course it would not be proper for the program to receive Federal funds. given the churchstate separation provisions of the Constitution. but if a church wishes to operate a nonsectarian child care program as a Social Service. they can qualify for assistance under the HawkinsDowney proposal. The second point about the committee bill I want to emphasize is that it does provide for parental choice. Expanded Head Start. schoolbased care. family care. centerbased care. these are all options under HawkinsDowney. By making quality child care affordable. the committee bill will succeed in giving parents many more choices than they have now. Let us pass the best child care proposal. Mr. Speaker.

The Zuni Indians and their ancestors have occupied what is now western New Mexico for thousands of years. The first Spaniards that encountered the Zuni were greatly impressed by the intricate irrigation systems of the tribe and their sophisticated cultivation of various crops. The Zuni were famous for their waffle gardens and their corn crops which supplied the U.S. Army for many years. These farming practices continued until the end of the 19th century. However. resources on the 408.000 acre Zuni Reservation have been greatly depleted in the 20th century. Timber. coal. salt. and water resources have all diminished in the modern era. Because of a tremendous soil erosion problem in the 20th century. 90 percent of the agricultural land on the Zuni Reservation is currently unproductive. H.R. 4143 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Zuni Pueblo to jointly develop a plan for renewable resources. watershed rehabilitation. a data system for resource management and monitoring. a professional training program for Zuni Indians in resource management. and a cooperative technical assistance program. The authorization of $25 million will assist the Zuni and the Interior Department in finding a longterm solution to the erosion problems in this semiarid region of the American Southwest. It must be remembered that the United States is the trustee for Indian lands and retains the duty to ensure that resources are conserved and the lands are productive. At the very least. the Federal Government has the obligation to ensure that the erosion problems do not worsen on this reservation. Testimony was presented to the Interior Committee which clearly showed that worsening of this problem is inevitable without this legislation. This bill will help to revive and preserve an agrarian culture whose irrigation systems served to provide a bountiful food supply and prevent erosion long before the Europeans came to this continent. Mr. Speaker. this version of the bill has bipartisan support and the support of the administration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the purpose of S. 1747 is to restore Federal recognition to the Ponca Indian Tribe of Nebraska which was terminated by Congress. The Ponca of Nebraska have a compelling story. They were supposed to permanently occupy their aboriginal homelands in northern Nebraska under treaties with the United States in 1858 and 1865. However. in 1876 the Ponca were removed by the United States from their Nebraska homeland to the Indian Territory of Oklahoma. Onethird of the tribe died on the journey. The story of Chief Standing Bears return to Nebraska in 1879 to bury his son on the Nebraska plain Is well known. Congress recognized the right of the Ponca to the land in Nebraska and Standing Bear and his followers were allowed to resettle their aboriginal homeland. Standing Bears group became the Northern Ponca of Nebraska. Those who stayed in Indian territory became the Southern Ponca of Oklahoma. In the 1950s. Congress adopted the termination policy. The goal of this policy was to end Federal responsibility for tribes. Several tribes were terminated under the policy. including the Northern Ponca of Nebraska in 1962. The policy had a negative result on all the terminated tribes and the States in which they resided. Economic hardship for individual Indians. increased responsibility for States. and the tragic loss of tribal culture. tradition and sovereignty contributed to the failure of the policy. The 100th Congress expressly repealed and repudiated the termination policy. In the past several years. Congress has restored Federal recognition to virtually all of the tribes terminated during the time of this unfortunate experiment in Indian policy. The Northern Ponca were among the last of the tribes terminated and are now among the last of the tribes to be restored. The Northern Ponca are ready for restoration and have done extensive historical. economic. and statistical research to comply with the Bureau of Indian Affairs requirements with regard to the preparation of the membership rolls. an economic development plan and the establishment of a tribal government. Mr. Speaker. this bill has bipartisan support and I urge the passage of this long overdue legislation.",

I rise in support of S. 1747. a bill to restore Federal recognition to the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. a tribe which was* terminated by a 1962 act of Congress. I believe this bill is justified for the following reasons. First. termination Is no longer a part of Federal Indian policy. Congress expressly repudiated this policy In the last Congress through the enactment of Public Law 100Second. Congress has restored the Federal relationship with most of the previously terminated tribes. Third. there Is no diecernible distinction between the Poncas In Nebraska and the other tribes which were terminated and then later restored by Congress. Finally. the administration Identified several criteria against which It measures a request for restoration of the Federal relationship. The hearing record on this bill is replete with historical and other data showing how the Poncas in Nebraska satisfy these criteria. It Is my understanding that the administration supports the restoration of the Ponca Tribe in Nebraska. as does the Nebraska congressional delegation. Accordingly. I urge the support passage of S. 1747 and urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.",

Because the Sencea Nation was locked into such leases for over a century. it has been estimated that they have lost somewhere in the neighborhood of $250 million. The Seneca request for $60 million. with a Federal share of $35 million. is more than fair. and an amount far less than the possible result of a long and costly legal battle.

I congratulate the gentleman from New York for his fine efforts in bringing this settlement bill to the floor. Today we have the opportunity to vote for a bill that resolves long standing grievances and disputes in a peaceful manner. It addresses the inequities of the past with regard to the Seneca Nation and restores the compact of trust we have with the Senecas. It allows the city of Salamanca. NY and its surrounding villages to look to the future in a spirit of cooperation with the Seneca Nation. Mr. Speaker. I think we have a responsibility to go forward with this legislation. Nearly 100 years ago. these lands were taken from the Seneca Nation when the property was leased to the State of New York without the Nations consent. Although the New York State courts invalidated the leases. Congress overrode the courts and extended the leases for 99 years. The original terms of the leases set unconscionably low rents and there are no provisions to update them to reflect fair rents. Consequently. the Seneca Nation has been deprived of an equitable return for use of its land. These leases will now expire in 1991. Both the Seneca Nation and the city of Salamanca would like to sign new lease agreements. However. before this can be accomplished. the Seneca Nation has asked for a settlement due to the inequities of the past. This legislation Is intended to implement that request. Under the settlement. the Federal Government would provide a mix of economic development aid and cash totaling $35 million to the Seneca Nation. New York State would provide $25 million. This bill authorizes the Federal share of that $60 million settlement. which represents less than 25 percent of the amount that the Seneca Nation could have received if the rents had been set at fair market value. Without this legislation. we cannot hope to negotiate the new leases for Salamanca and the surrounding communities. With this legislation. the people of the Salamanca area and the Seneca Nation can work toward building for the future. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

It is the policy of this Government that the resolution of humanitarian issues is not contingent upon political issues such as the normalization of relations with Vietnam.

How quickly we resolve the humanitarian issues will determine the pace for addressing the political ones. I am particularly disturbed by the testimony of the Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency who said before the Asia Subcommittee that the Vietnamese have been holding back documents on hundreds of our missing servicemen. Also distressing is confirmation that the Vietnamese had warehoused the remains of more than 400 Americans who died during the Vietnam war. and that a substantial number of remains repatriated by the Vietnamese showed signs of longterm storage. According to the Deputy Director. \"We must conclude that a serious effort on theirthe Vietnamesepart could result in an accounting for many hundreds more of our men.\" Parceling out the remains of our men who died in the Vietnam war to meet Vietnamese political objectives is immoral and will. in the end. be counterproductive.

The Tax Fairness Index proves what every average American knows as a hard reality: the Federal tax burden on average American families increased during the last 10 years. while taxes on the wealthiest Americans dropped sharply. We now can put numbers on that reality. The Federal tax bite on a typical twoparent. middleincome family rose from 23.7 percent of income in 1980 to 24.1 percent in 1988. In the same period. Federal taxes on the wealthiest 5 percent of U.S. families dropped from 28.9 percent to 25.7 percent. Such a change is contrary to the firmly held conviction of American people that the tax burden should. above all. be fair. Of course average Americans react negatively to suggestions of tax Decreases. For 10 years tax increases have fallen on the wageearning productive backbone of our country.

Now. with the report that was just issued by the Institute for Defense Analysis. we know for certain that the V22 is an aircraft that must be produced. The IDA study compared the V22 with other aircraft that could be procured for the Marines. st h as the CH60 and CH53 helicopters. It found that the V22s speed. range. and survivability advantages would enable it to be more effective than all of the proposed helicopter alternatives In each of the four Marine missions that were examined. The study also found that the V22 is more cost effective than helicopter alternatives for the Navy combat search and rescue. Air Force special operations. and DOD or other Government agency druginterdiction missions. The Bush administration has been figiting with many of us in Congress over whether to produce the V22. doing everything it can to terminate the program. As this independent evaluation of the V22 so clearly shows. however. the President is simply wrong on this issue. It makes no sense whatsoever to terminate this costeffective and necessary program. Yet. in spite of the studys positive findings for the V22. President Bush and Secretary of Defense Cheney continue to oppose the program and have indicated that they will actively work to kill it. Now. we will soon begin deliberations in Congress on the defense budget for fiscal year 1991. We will have to make some hard decisions. and its vital that we spend our defense dollars wisely on programs which meet critical needs of our Armed Forces. The V22 is such a program. It will give the Marines a desperately needed capability. and does so in a costeffective way. Flight testing continues at Boll and Boeing facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania. Considerable progress is being made and new milestones are being reached with virtually every test flight.

The versatility of this stateoftheart technology is perfect for Coast Guard missions of drug interdiction. atsea search and rescue. and oilspill containment. Of immediate concern to Texans is the oilspill accident of the Mega Borg tanker off the Texas Coast on June 9. which highlights the need for new technologies to contain oilspills. Since 1979. there have been approximately 16 major oilspills in the Gulf of Mexico. and we need the most efficient technology available to contain and clean future oilspills. Admiral Yost testified before the House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Navigation in favor of tiltrotor technology and described its applications as being the answer to a Coast Guard commanders prayer. In a later hearing. Admiral Kime. who is the current Coast Guard Commandant. agreed with Admiral Yosts assessment of the usefulness of this technology in Coast Guard missions. The tiltrotor aircraft would be perfect for the Coast Guards missions of drug interdiction because it could intercept any drugcarrying ship or airplane. It could search over a wide range of ocean for a distressed vessel. then touch down and pick up survivors. The tiltrotor could quickly reach the scene of an oilspill and. with oiltrappig booms lowered from its cargo bay. prevent the oil from spreading. The efficiency and versatility of the tiltrotor aircraft is unlimited. Like a helicopter. tiltrotors can hover. take off and land vertically. By turning their rotors forward in midflight. they can acquire the speed. range. and fuel efficiency of a conventional turboprop airplane. It is faster and more fuel efficient than helicopters. it has a much longer cruising range. and most important. it is more survivable during combat. The tiltrotor aircraft is designed for lowintensity conflicts and it really is the aircraft we need if we want to get American troops in quickly and out safely in a limited warfare scenario. So far. only the United States has the capability to develop and build this technology. I support the tiltrotor and I support our countrys efforts to stay ahead In developing new technologies.",

The Third World. in many places. remains quite turbulent. We can expect continued activity by terrorist groups. There is a need to aggressively combat international drug trafficking.

The compromise was required by the failure of the other body to gain the necessary 60 votes for a waiver of the GrammRudman Budget Act to make in order the onbudget financing adopted by the conference report and the House of Representatives. While the position of the House is clear. it became necessary to reconvene the conference last night and work on a compromise that would gain approval in the other body and the signature of the President. The compromise calls for $20 billion onbudget this year. with borrowings of $30 billion placed offbudget in future years. This agreement to place the first $20 billion onbudget will enable the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to move ahead immediately to start closing the insolvent thrifts that are currently draining the insurance fund of some $20 to $30 million a day. That was one of my primary concerns about the offbudget mechanism. the fact that it would delay the resolution of the cases pending on the marketing of bonds. Mr. Speaker. I have favored an onbudget financing from the first day of the long battle over the legislation. The House has twice endorsed the position. However. we must have a bill. and the compromise entered into last night is the best we will be able to do under the circumstances. The President created lastminute problems in both Houses yesterday when he decided to send up a hastly drafted veto threat over the financing proposal adopted by the conference. As a result. we asked Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady and OMB Director Richard Darman to appear before the conference last night. and we discussed the issues with them and gained their endorsement for the package before Members today.

The bill gets the Job done. Oh. anybody in this body can find one of some 900 legislative pages. 1 page or 2 pages of something they disagree with. but the fact is the bill gets the Job done.

Oh. one side says that over 30 years one will cost $4 billion and the other. but the other side says. the Secretary of the Treasury says. that that approach will cost $7 billion more than the other one over that same 30year period. Mr. Speaker. the fact is that both financing schemes work. They both have the funds repaid by the same savings and loans and banks. and ultimately in some part the taxpayers.

I simply cannot support the final funding measure contained in this bill. I supported the amendment of the gentleman from New York [Mr. LAlALCEJ earlier this year along with 170 of my colleagues which would have put the cost of the savings and loan bailout on budget and subject to GrammRudman. Had the President and the Congress agreed to that procedure. it would have saved the American taxpayers some hundred and fifty billion dollars. but. as my colleagues know. the President and the Congress rejected that approach and agreed to what we are doing here this evening. The fallback position then became putting the funding on budget. but exempt from GrammRudman limits. This approach would have saved the taxpayers at least $5 billion. and probably $20 billion when we take into consideration the debt management costs involved. My colleagues. we have fallen back even further. and in my judgment too far. This conference committee report will cost the taxpayers at least $3 billion in increased interest payments compared to the Housepassed. onbudget plan that passed this body on June 15 with 320 of our colleagues supporting it. Mr. Speaker. there is absolutely no sensible reason to deal with this problem off budget. Any suggestion that to have this bailout on budget will undermine the GrammRudman limits stands common sense on its head. After all. my colleagues. GranunRudman is the law of the land. It cannot be amended without the Presidents signature. The GrammRudman limits cannot be avoided without the Presidents approval. So. any suggestion by the President and by the Secretary of the Treasury that we are running a big freight train through GrammRudman is absolutely ridiculous unless. of course. the President wants to change GrammRudman himself. And I guess when I listen to the President that I cannot help but think that he may be afraid of himself on this particular issue.

Over the last 8 years. the number of hospitalized veterans has increased 10 percent and the numbers using outpatient care have risen 34 percent.

Our response has been to turn away those veterans who can afford private care for nonservice related disabilities. Today. fewer than 5 percent of the VAs patients can be classified as \"discretionary\" cases. This means further cuts put the VAs basic mission at risk. If budget cuts force additional staff layoffs. use of inadequate equipment. postponement of needed facility repairs. and a shortage of medical supplies. we will be endangering our ability to serve the core VA population: those men and women who risked their lives and suffered injury for our freedom. The deficit crisis demands we make every effort to cut out the waste in our budget. But continual cuts eventually will erode the level and quality of the services provided.

The Trauma Care Systems Planning and Development Act of 1989 will encourage States to develop regional trauma centers and enhance systems of emergency medical care. It will save 20.000 lives each year. Trauma. the medical term for severe injury. kills 140.000 persons each year. Among Americans under the age of 44. trauma is the leading cause of death. The economic costs as well as the human costs to our Nation are enormous. yet trauma can be largely prevented. In 1985. a San Diego County study found that after the 1984 introduction of a regional trauma care system. the death rate from major trauma dropped 55 percent. Unfortunately. the life saving services of a regional trauma center are unavailable to over 80 percent of our constituents. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.",

Already the Danny Wall gang has committed as much as $50 billion. $50 billion to bail out failing savings and loan associations. This gigantic savings and loan association swindle is a dragon that will eat all efforts to eliminate the deficit. This gigantic savings and loan association swindle is a dragon that will eat all initiatives. all new initiatives in any area. whether it is education. energy. cleanups or the repeal of the surtax in the catastrophic health care program.

I commend my Republican colleagues in joining me in this crucial vote to allow repeal of the disastrous. bureaucratic redtape monster known as section 89. This vote today represents another positive step toward attempting to right some of the many wrongs perpetrated on the American people by the infamous Tax Reform Act of 1986. Unfortunately. exactly as I had predicted. this Tax Confusion Act has created problem after problem for many Americans. Mr. Speaker. I was an early cosponsor of legislation to repeal section 89 that now enjoys the support of more than 300 Members of the House of Representatives. which is nearly threefourths of the membership of the House. As these Members of Congress have now come to realize. section 89 is nothing but a boondoggle for business. By the U.S. Treasury Departments own admission. complying with just the partial regulations of section 89 will require 9.000.000 hours and impose great monetary expenses on businesses. Section 89 was a misguided attempt by Congress to make benefits fairer for lowerpaid workers. Although the intentions were good. section 89 puts employee benefit plans at risk because many smaller companiesas they discover the complexities of compliancemay be discouraged from offering any benefits. If that happens. everyone loses. Again. I commend my Republican colleagues who are pushing for this vote to preserve an environment for businesses to expand and create new jobs. We cant continue to let this issue languish in the Ways and Means Committee. This is a vote for jobs. and a vote to allow businesses to continue providing vital benefits for employees. which needs to be passed immediately.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on January 1. 1989. Internal Revenue Code section 89 standards governing tax qualification of a certain employer provided fringe benefits became effective. While section 89 is intended to ensure that businesses do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. it attempts to effect this policy. through an exceedingly complex set of tests which require employers to collect and maintain extensive information on workers. plan coverage provisions. and workers benefits eligibilitles. and sanctions noncompliance with onerous penalties. In short. the law is so exceedingly complex and imposes such a costly administration burden that it will impede. rather than encourage. the expansion of health care coverage among the Nations uninsured. Clearly. any Federal policy directed at closing the gap in health care coverage among the working uninsured must focus on the small business sector. And any policy which would discourage the expansion of health insurance coverage among small business must be avoided. This is why I have joined with over 300 of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation to repeal section 89. Repeal will give us an opportunity to explore reasonable. simplified alternatives to achieve the policy goals of assuring fair distribution of employee benefits and reducing the ranks of the uninsured. Recently the Bush administration ordered a 90day delayfrom July 1 to October 1in the beginning date for testing benefit plans for compliance with section 89 and the Ways and Means and Finance Committees held hearings on rewriting the law. Both developments are further evidence that the battle for section 89 relief had gained real momentum. I am disappointed however. that an amendment was not made in order to the legislation we are considering today. to make supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1989. which called for an outright repeal of the section 89 nondiscrimination rules. In light of the tremendous outpouring from the American public. I believe the Rules Committee should have made this proposed amendment in order.

Mortgage counseling service is a vital resource for homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes as a result of unanticipated financial crises. Unemployment. extended illness. the death of a spouse or family member can be devastating for the homeowner who has carefully invested in home ownership and is suddenly faced with an unexpected loss of income. For example. in my own congress!onal district. Housing Opportunities. Inc.. of McKeesport. PA. a private nonprofit HUDcertified counseling corporation. provides a variety of services to protect home ownership and revitalize urban neighborhoods. Two especially important services provided include: The Earned Home Ownership Program [EHOP] designed to make it possible for marginal income. firsttime home buyers to obtain permanent mortgage financing through prepurchase counseling and specially structured financing. The Home Ownership Protective Effort [HOPE) which assists unemployed and underemployed families in avoiding foreclosures resulting from mortgage delinquencies. Both the EHOP and HOPE projects are based on professional financial counseling. utilization of community resources. and I think of special significancefocus on the development of disciplined family financial management. Through counseling and with the cooperation of local banks. churches. civic organizations. and corporate efforts. these programs have enjoyed tremendous success in helping owners become current in their mortgages. avoiding loss to themselves and to their lenders. Under the HOPE program alone. the numbers speak for themselvesa report provided to me by housing opportunities of McKeesport states that as of December 31. 1989. 2.220 families have been served. 624 families have been brought current on their mortgages. and $4.264.033 has been generated in mortgage payments.

It. in fact. assists in saving the Government money by ensuring that homeowners and prospective homeowners have available to them a resource by which they can avoid default and work toward protecting the asset. which is. for most Americans. the biggest and most important investment they will make in their lifetimetheir home. The amendment clarifies the statute with respect to contracting with independent home ownership counseling and I urge its adoption.",

Mr. Chairman. this is to make sure that the Houses intention and the Congresss intention in 1987 is. in fact. realized. that when an owner makes a decision to participate in the section 8 program. that that decision to participate is made with respect to all of the properties involved and gives individuals with section 8 certificates the broadest possible opportunity to participate in the program.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Mr. PRICE and Mr. CARPER. It was carefully constructed and compromised to complement the provisions of the bill authored by Mr. BARTLETT and myself. We welcome the increased protections for lowincome. very lowincome. and elderly tenants as well as tougher sanctions against owners who allow their properties to fall into disrepair and a reasonable solution to the useful life problem. The most important change that the CarperPrice amendment makes pertains to the right of first refusal for nonprofits and other approved organizations. Once the owner has notified HUD of his intent to sell the property. there is an absolute right of first refusal for HUD or the nonprofit to purchase the property at fair market value as determined by an appraisal. Combined with the other tenant protections in the amendment as well as the incentives contained in BartlettBarnard. I strongly feel that this right of first refusal maximizes tenant protections and preserves the maximum amount of housing while still recognizing the contractual rights of owners. Voting for CarperPrice in no way alleviates the problems with the FrankMartin amendment. The FrankMartin amendment. with or without CarperPrice will at best not preserve any more housing than the BartlettBarnard amendment. We did not choose either the easy or the cheap way out of this problem. which would have been to simply abrogate contractual rights. The CBO has analyzed the effects of BartlettBarnard without CarperPrice and projected that the provisions will preserve a majority of those units at risk from prepayment of mortgages. The CBO study also gives a credible estimate as to the maximum amount of housing that will be lost. but there is no credible estimate for FrankMartin. We have put our best foot forward and tested our amendment as rigorously as we know how. CarperPrice only improves the preservation aspects of BartlettBarnard. Since the Frank amendment does not increase incentives available to owners. then by definition it cannot preserve any more units that BarnardBartlett unless it does so by abrogating contractual rights resulting in an unjust taking of property. We can either pay for these units or take them.",

From the central valley of California to the coastal plains of south and eastern Texas to the prairie potholes of the Grain Belt. agriculture has been the principal culprit in draining and filling our precious wetlands. The facts are startling. More than 80 percent of wetlands loss in the United States is due to agriculture. Of the 215 million original acres of wetlands in the United Statesexcluding Alaskaonly 95 million now remain. In the past 40 years. 16 million acres of wetlands have been lost to agricultural conversion. The loss of wetlands to agriculture has had a devastating environmental impact. Waterfowl breeding areas have been destroyed. causing drastic reductions in populations. The severity of droughts has increased because fewer wetlands exist to retain and replenish ground water. Soil erosion and pesticide and chemical runoff from agricultural production has increased pollution of rivers. lakes. and streams because fewer wetlands are there to trap sediment and filter out contaminants. I am introducing two bills to put an end 1o any further destruction of wetlands by agriculture and to begin to restore wetlands which have already been converted to agricultural use. The Swampbuster Improvement Act of 1990 will plug existing loopholes in the swampbuster provision of the 1985 farm bill.

The paper was to make imaginative use of color and graphics. and combine aggressive local reporting with nationally syndicated columnists and features. The Shelby Sun Times made its debut on May 28. 1987. Since then. Garry Summerfords leadership and the talents of editor Allan Hestor and his staff. have won wide acceptance for the paper. Its circulation has expanded to almost 20.000. The paper is housed in comfortable new offices. The Sun Times is an editorial and commercial success. I mention this by way of noting that the Sun Times will publish volume 4. issue 1. next Friday. June 1. which happens to be Garry Summerfords birthday. I would like to wish Garry a happy birthday and to thank and congratulate him for his splendid work with the Sun Times.",

Steven Smith will be ending his 2year tenure as president of the San Pedro Coordinating Council. This occasion gives me the opportunity to express my deepest approciation for his years of service to both tha San Pedro Coordinating Council and the community. Stevens contributions to the San Pedro educational system go back to 1966. As a teacher and supervisor with the Los Angeles Unified School District. he has assisted in providing hundreds. if not thousands of area students with an education. It is Stevens philosophical belief that: \"A childs education needs to encompass the vitality of the home and community if the child is to be a successful citizen in our society.\" Even with his many educational commitments. he has still found time to be active in the San Pedro business community. Throughout the past 4 years he has been a member of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce Business and Education Committee assisting in promoting area business. From 198788 Steven served as the vice president of the San Pedro Coordinating Council. Over the past 2 years. from 198890. he has served as the council president. As president for the last 2 years. he kept the interest and issues of the local residents at the forefront. The meeting of the council during his presidency involved many local leaders and legislators discussing such critical issues as the homeless. growth versus no growth. earthquake preparedness. gangs and juvenile needs. and port growth and safety. I commend Steven for his leadership on bringing these issues to the forefront. My wife. Lee. joins me in extending our thanks for Steven Smiths contributions to the community. The San Pedro Coordinating Council is losing an extremely compelent leader. He is truly a remarkable individual who has devoted his talents and energies to enriching the lives of so many other people. We wish Steven. his wife of 24 years Judy Elan. and his children Adrian. Sommer. and Alexis all the best in the years to come.",

I also believe that the goals of EDA programs can be better met at the Federal level through the administrations national policies of fostering economic expansion and job creation. In the case of highly distressed areas. incentives such as those in the administations enterprise zone proposal would be more effective than the EDA programs. Despite my reservations. I could support the enactment of H.R. 2014 if it were amended substantially to: Delete the appropriations for EDA and retain only those provisions that would improve EDA program management In the event funds are appropriated for EDA. and Limit the appropriations authorizations for the ARC to $50 million in fiscal year 1991. $52 million In 1992. and $53 million in 1993.",

I am introducing legislation today that would enable Holocaust victims who reside in nursing homes or receive home- or communitybased care to keep their war reparations payments from the Federal Republic of Germany. I invite my colleagues to join as cosponsors. West Germany makes reparations to Holocaust survivors as an attempt to compensate. in some measure. for the severe physical and psychological injuries and the loss of opportunity that resulted from the Holocaust. In the United States. however. reparations recipients who receive Medicaid benefits may not keep their reparations if they reside in a nursing home. or if they receive medical treatment from home- or communitybased servces. This situation results from an inconsistent and unfair Medicaid procedure. Medicaid regulations instruct officials not to count reparations as income when determining initial eligibility for Medicaid benefits. Once eligibility is established. however. Medicaid officials count the reparations as income in their determination of how much the patient must contribute to the cost of their care. The inauspicious result: these Holocaust survivors do not get to keep the compensatory moneys. Because reparations are meant to make amends for past injustices against Holocaust victims and not to support basic needs. I am introducing legislation to correct this unfair and inconsistent Medicaid policy. My bill amends title XIX of the Social Security Act to disregard reparations from the posteligibility computation of income for Individuals who reside in nursing homes or receive home- or communitybased services. It is my hope that this bill can be enacted expeditiously to allow these victims to receive their compensation. Although the reparations can not wipe out the suffering. they can make a difference by improving the quality of life for a Holocaust survivor. A copy of the bill Is printed below: H.R.

On February 14. 1990. in the Fresno Bee. Mr. T.M. Johnson. the director of the Kaweah Delta District Hospital in Visalia. CA. illustrated the serious financial responsibility that Medicare places on our national hospitals. I should like to insert Mr. Johnsons article into the RECORD. At my request. Kaweah Delta Hospital sent me a letter recounting the administrative costs that Federal programs can impose on the hospital. I place into the RECORD the letter and payment sheet that details Medicares unfair compensation to Kaweah Delta Hospital for legitimate medical expenses. Kaweah Delta Hospital is a 280bed facility and the largest hospital between Fresno and Bakersfield. It is the most sophisticated hospital within easy reach of half of million residents of the southern San Joaquin Valley. many of whom live on farms in the surrounding countryside. Yet it receives only 40 percent of its outpatient surgery cost from Medicare. Unreasonable expenses that hospitals like Kaweah Delta must now absorb can only result in the deterioration of medical care for those who cannot afford private medical insurance and must rely on Medicare. America can improve top quality medical service to all Americans. rich or poor. by relieving the financial burden that our current Medicare system places on hospitals. Our Nations physicians. health care workers. administrators. and supporting staff all deserve our praise and thanks for providing such technologically advanced and comprehensive medical care to all Americans. But. Mr. Speaker. I fear that high quality health care will deteriorate unless we shall relieve the unfair financial burden that our national hospitals now bear. It is particularly troublesome to realize that hospitals serving a large area and population. such as Kaweah Delta. might have to curtail or cancel many of its programs if corrective measures shall not be made.

This invasion marks the first time in modern history that one Arab country has invaded another Arab country. But memory serves to remind us that Saddam Husseins Iraq has already been responsible for some of the most heinous acts in modern history. This is the same Iraqi regime that used poison gas. not only against its Iranian foes. but against its own Kurdish citizens. This is the same Iraqi regime that attempted to smuggle highpowered electronic switches that can be used in production of nuclear weapons. This is the same Iraqi regime that indicated that it was prepared to scorch half of Israel if provoked. And last night. Iraq crashed into Kuwait. It is clear that this conflict is more than just a family quarrel. And its more than an effort by Iraq to set off another oil shock. It is a plain and simple power grab. designed to make Iraq the preeminent power in the regionpolitically. economically. and militarily. Our efforts today should give force to the unanimous vote of the U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the Iraqi invasion and calling for its immediate withdrawal from Kuwaiti territory. It should also give support to the potential mediating efforts of the Arab League Foreign Ministers. who are now meeting in Carlo. But for these efforts to bear any fruit. the word must go out to Baghdadnot just from Washingtonbut from London. Paris. Bonn. and Cairothat the international community will not tolerate this kind of behavior. It Is illegal. it is murderous. and it should be punished.",

The brutal extermination of 5.000 innocent Kurds. the threatened use of chemical weapons against its neighbors. and the methodical acquisition of the equipment and technology needed for ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons have all taken place over a period of time. Yet. following a tradition of timidity and appeasement first established in response to the horrors in China a year ago. the administration chose to drive straight down the road to appeasement. The Presidents policy to Iraq was as successful as his policy toward China. Whether the butcher resides in Baghdad or Beijing. the administration somehow feels that the power of reason and quiet diplomacy will prevail. Such an approach is a poor excuse for a lack of courage. I am not one who ordinarily favors the imposition of unilateral sanctions. They rarely deprive the country In question of the products and services it is seeking. Yet when one commits crimes against humanity. harbors known terrorists. and threatens regional and possibly world peace. we are left with no choice but to take a clear stand in a way that even Saddam Hussein can understand.

Iraqs illegal and unjust invasion of neighboring Kuwait should come as no surprise. For years. the Hussein regime has engaged in massive human rights violations against its own people. This regimes reign of terror has included the use of chemical weapons to kill its own Kurdish population including innocent women and children. This is the same regime that was willing to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of its own people in a senseless war with Iran. And this is the same regime that threatened to burn half of Israel. Iraq now invades a sovereign state because it disagreed with Kuwaits oil production. It did so because Iraq wants to increase oil prices which will in turn be absorbed by the American consumer. This bill sends a clear message to the Government of Iraq that the President. the Congress. and the American people are fully committed to working with our allies to utilize all the economic and diplomatic tools at our disposal to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait immediately.

These are the very reasons this House voted sanctions against Hussein in considering the farm bill last Friday. Today. we must pass the stringent economic sanctions recommended by the Foreign Affairs Committee. Economic and diplomatic pressures are the only way well achieve peace In the Persian Gulf. None of us wants to see an armed resolution to this conflict. Above all else we must remember that weve still got hostages over in Lebanon. Every time I hear macho rumblings in the Middle East. things get volatile. and I fear for the lives of Terry Anderson and the other Western hostages. They make for easy retaliation targets and we must not jeopardize their safety. The economic sanctions we consider today are the most judicious response to the present emergency and the most likely to bring Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to his senses. For the first time. in dealing with a Middle East crisis. we can turn to the Soviet Union for help. Working together. the worlds economic powers should be able to convince Hussein to end Iraqi aggression in Kuwait. Not only must we prevent Hussein from obtaining nuclear technology and chemical weapons. we must cut off his lifeline by refusing to purchase his oil. All Husseins got is oil and we all know his people cant eat that. We must pass this sanctions bill and get that message across loud and clear.",

I cannot express too strongly my condemnation of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Aside from his total disregard for Kuwaits territorial sovereignty and basic human rights. in one swift move Hussein has gained control of 20 percent of the worlds oil supply. which will clearly effect the U.S. economy. Hussein has stated that his goal was to drive world oil prices to $30.00 a barrelif that happens. this Nation and other energy dependent nations would experience severe economic impact. For these reasons. I joined my colleagues in unanimous support to impose sanctions against Iraq. I am pleased that our Nation has come together with a united voice to denounce Iraqs actions and to give our support to Kuwait. Peace in the Middle East has long been a pursuit of U.S. foreign policy and those efforts are now at risk. Hussein Is a real danger to our interests in the gulf region and to our ally Israel. The United States can no longer view Iraqs threats against Israel. or any other country In the Middle East. as empty words.

Saddam Hussein. in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is an unacceptable act of aggression by a dangerous tyrant who is known for his flagrant human rights violations and his barbaric use of force against neighboring nations and his own citizens. The invasion not only threatens to disrupt the supply of oil to the United States and other nations. it also heightens the risks of conflict throughout the entire Middle East. where a massive military buildup in the Arab world has contributed to dangerous instability. Husseins unrestrained aggression against his neighbors threatens to plunge the entire region into conflict. at a severe cost to the United States and its allies. It is imperative that the United States respond swiftly and strongly to the Iraqi invasion. President Bush did just that earlier today when he froze Iraqi assets and blocked most oil imports from that nation. This legislation provides strong support for the actions the President has already taken. and it provides him with additional tools to place added pressure on Iraq to help bring to an end the aggression by that nation. Theactions of Iraq should be condemned by all civilized peoples. and we should join with as many other nations as possible in applying strong pressure on Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait. It is essential that we do so as quickly as possible. so that we can minimize the disruption to world oil supplies and prevent the conflict from escalating further. in addition. we should take all appropriate steps to ensure the safety of Americans in that nation. Mr. Speaker. as I mentioned earlier. the President has already acted forcefully to respond to the tragic incidents in Kuwait. This legislation will help the President go even further to protect our interests and our allies in that region of the world.

I wish to express my appreciation for the cooperation of the chairman and the ranking Republican member in modifying section 214(n) dealing with the personal liability of directors and officers of federally insured financial institutions. I have talked with various Members on this issue because of my concern whenever Federal law preempts State corporation law. The discussions have been Illuminating. There is no intention. I am happy to say. to preempt State corporation law in any general way. Section 214(n) sets a standard of care owed to the financial institution because it is federally insured. It is surgically designed to protect the Federal interest. the taxpayers interest. and no other. For two centuries now Congress has been writing special provisions to safeguard Federal interests. Various Federal officers and agencies have the benefit of special rules governing where a suit may be brought. the defenses to be raised. and the cause of action. These highly specialized provisions have been accepted as a valid component of federalism. Therefore. just as it is not considered an infringement of States rights that the Federal Government make it a crime to assassinate a President. assauIt a postman. or even to rob a fed29 -o9 0903 Pt. 61 erally insured State bank. section 214(n) as modified does no violence to State interests in governing corporations they may create.

Some have raised constitutional objections to this provision. We have asked for a Library of Congress opinion of this issue. and they find no constitutional problem. In March of this year the Department of Justice agreed to a provision requiring the special counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board to report directly to Congress without OMB review. Provisions requiring direct reporting to Congress by executive branch officers may be traced back to the very first Congress. The original legislation creating the Treasury Department required the Secretary to report directly to Congress. Prior to 1921. each Federal agency submitted its budget request directly to the Congress. The Bureau of the Budget. now OMB. was created in that year. by Congress. to help it sift the various requests. The Supreme Court has also recognized the right of Congress to have agencies report directly to it. as the Library of Congress report clearly explains. The statute books are full of examples of agencies which are specifically relieved of OMB review. For example. the SEC. the Federal Reserve. the FDIC. and the Bank Board do not need OMB clearance. In addition. OMB review is also precluded for regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms within the Department of the Treasury. Reports of the Secretary of HHS are reviewed by OMB. but may not be revised by that agency. Mr. President.

I am pleased that a provision has been included in the committee amendment which provides legislative language indicating that farmland will not fall under the 65percent loan to value rule. I know that it was not the committees intention to apply this rule to farm operations. However. there is some concern that the committee report language might not be sufficient to assure that regulators would not apply the 65percent standard. So. this amendment Is necessary. I would also like to take this opportunity to note that the general loan to value provisions could in my view create considerable problems to farmers and small businesses. Clearly. regulators need to keep a watchful eye. But. I am concerned that these provisions may significantly change the priority of considerations by which financial institutions make loans. Presently. loans are made looking at many factors In addition to collateral such as cash flow and guarantees. Legislative loan to equity ratios change this pattern. Financial institutions which are willing to make a loan for a larger sum than the loan to collateral value might indicate may be forced not to take a collateral position. We may see a higher proportion of unsecured loans which would have the reverse of the intended effect. I am also concerned about how this rule will work in our present regulatory environment. Loans are continually being restructured. Are we going to see an added cost for new appraisals? Are we going to see loan amounts reduced because of reductions In appraised values? Are we going to see pressures to get inflated appraisals? Clearly. there have been abuses by some regulated institutions in the types of loans made on the basis of collateralized land. And. that must be stopped. But. I do not believe that the method in the bill is the best solution.

Robbie quickly decided to remove the children from the cars path. putting his own life in danger. He took two children in his arms and pulled them back to the curb while pushing the other two students. They all reached the curb. narrowly avoiding the oncoming car. In those brief seconds. Robbie saved the lives of these small children. The School Safety Patrol Program is an excellent idea which provides a badly needed service to the community.

CourlerJournal which indicated that the Social Security Administration [SSA] was unexpectedly running short in administrative funds and was planning to suspend disability appeals hearIngs. Mr. Speaker. because so many individuals rely on Social Security disability benefits. Congress has provided a contingency fund-$90 million for fiscal year 1990solely for emergencies. such as these. These funds are controlled by the Presidents Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. Upon learning of this unconscionable situation. many Members of Congress conveyed theirdismay and outrage. I elected to call the Administrator of Social Security. Ms. Gwendo. lyn King. Apparently. OMB had already gotten the message because Ms. King told me that OMB had already authorized a release of the contingency funds insuring a full schedule of disability appeals hearings through the end of this fiscal year. September 30. While the immediate funding shortage for Social Security disability appeals hearings has been addressed. there still exists the problem of the increasing number of appeals occurring in disability cases. In our congressional office. almost all disability awards come after appeals of rejections at the earlier stages of the process. This has led to an increasing backlog of disability case appeals. This backlog has been a nightmare for my constituents.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my concern with preliminary results of the 1990 census. which estimates New York Citys population at 7.033.000. This figure is well below New York Citys actual population and. if allowed to stand. it would have a devastating effect on the city. During the 1980s New York experienced its greatest economic boom since World War II. City officials and outside experts believed that the citys population had grown by almost a million people over the past decade. Even the Census Bureau estimated that New York Citys population grew from 7.071.000 to 7.317.000 between 1980 and 1987. an increase of almost 300.000 people. I find it impossible to believe that 300.000 people have left the city In the last 3 years. New York City officials have determined through examination of housing. utility. birth. hospital. and school enrollment records that the census has missed as many as 254.534 housing units. Given the New York City occupancy rate of 2.5 people per unit. these missed apartments could mean an undercount of over 600.000 people. The Census Bureau has already admitted that it undercounted New York City by 450.000 in 1980. Its clear that the Census Bureau missed the boat and are doing an even worse job in 1990. Mr. Speaker. an undercount in the 1990 census would deprive New York of Important Federal dollars and congressional representation. I urge the Census Bureau to use all of the data available to it to see that the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers missed by the census are included in the final counts.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today my colleague DAVID PRICE and I are introducing the Youth Apprenticeship Act of 1990. legislation designed to create demonstration apprenticeship programs for high school students: programs that combine academic study with onthejob training and skills certification. I am pleased to be joined by Senator SAM NUNN who is introducing companion legislation in the Senate today. American youth who attempt to enter the job market having dropped out of high school. or with only a high school diploma. are at a tremendous disadvantage compared with those who complete college. Too many of our young people spend their first years out of high school either unemployed or in a series of lowwage. deadend jobs. The result is loss of both earnings and selfesteem for the individual and loss of productivity for the economy. It is a situation that we as a nation should not and can not tolerate. At a time when we face an ever more competitive world market while our own demographic base is shrinking. we simply can not allow as many as half of our young people to face the future without realistic prospects for productive employment. We will need the skills of all of our people to preserve the strong economy that is the best guarantee of the individual opportunity upon which our society is based. The Youth Apprenticeship Act of 1990 will facilitate the development of a national system to provide an effective transition from high school to good jobs for those young people who do not go directly on to college. At the same time. it is my hope that these apprenticeship programs. by showing young people the relationship between education and work. will encourage all of them to complete high school and more of them to pursue postsecondary education. Although such an effort must be national in scope. it Is important to note that this legisla. tion does not create a Federal program. The apprenticeship programs will be designed and run on the State and local levels. with the",

Many of us feared that a wellorganized attempt to rehabilitate Nixon was under wayand that there was a danger that Dick Nixon would again become a force in American politics. After viewing the television documentary. I have concluded that most Americans will react with horror when they watch the replay of the shabby melodrama of Watergate. Watergate replayed was also a grim reminder of the more recent IranContra scandal. Watergate should have taught all future Presidents a lesson. Unfortunately the conspiracy of IranContra showed us that the only thing that was learned was more effective damage control. The dimensions of IranContra were far broader and far more dangerous. But Republican Party damage control and a wimpish Special Prosecutor have sanitized the stench of IranContra. Remembering is Important. Todays decisionmakers should take heed. Since this administration holds Nixon in high regard. and since several key players in this administration were in the White House at the time of IranContra. the question which has great validity is: What will be the next conspiracy?

Donnall Thomas was awarded this years nobel prize in medicine for developing the technique of bone marrow transplantations. This procedure so far has saved thousands of lives of sufferers of fatal blood disorders. It is now the preferred method of treatment for diseases such as leukemia and Hodgkins among others. The National Bone Marrow Donor Program Registry has between 4.000 and 10.000 people who are waiting to be matched with donors. Successful transplants raise survival rates from 0 to 15 percent to 40 to 80 percent. It is estimated that 100.000 donors from diverse ethnic groups would be required to satisfy the existing needs for transplants. The Federal Government needs to assume a leading role in encouraging and supporting donations for this worthwhile program. The bill I am introducing is a step in this direction. It provides for granting administrative leave to Federal employees who participate in bone marrow donations. The costs for this bill are relatively modest.

Burns attention to the historical record and extraordinary artistry resulted in a film that gave many millions of American television viewers an unprecedented national history lesson.

He now lives In Walpole. NH. a small pictureperfect town with his wife and their three daughters.

There was never any reenacting of the time period or reconstructing of the battles. Instead. Burns chose to show the main battlefields as they are today. but on the exact day and time of day the fighting began.

The gentleman and the folks who work in that House Working Group on Acid Rain deserve to be commended for making it possible to keep the pressure on for not only a clean air bill but finally to do something about acid rain. I wanted to share with Members an experience I had. because I know the gentleman mentioned New Hampshire. mentioned New England and art. Two summers ago. back in 1988. I had the opportunity to go to Cornish. NH. which is over near the Connecticut River over near Vermont. In that district of mine is the SaintGaudens Memorial. SaintGaudens is a very famous sculptor. In fact. if anyone has seen the movie \"Glory.\" the ending sculpture is one done by Saint Gaudens. He did the sculpture of Col. Robert Gould Shaw in the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts. That is what inspired that movie. Augustus SaintGaudens has a mausoleum in Cornish. and it has a temple. It is called the temple. and it is where his remains are at this national park. But when I went there. it is amazing how much damage acid snow and acid rain have done to that magnificent marble temple that is only 75 years old. If it will do that to a structure of such beauty made of marble. not made of paper mache but a solid stonelike marble. we know how involved and how dangerous the continuation of this process is.

They also said that the report. still in draft form. ignored a number of studies suggesting serious air pollution problems.

We achieved this Superfund level while increasing construction grants by $800 million above the Presidents budget. and overall EPA funding by $700 million over the budget request. and about $200 million over the House allowance. The administrations failure to request sufficient resources for construction grants and other programs made it very difficult to address the growing needs of the Superfund Program.

The States of Wisconsin.

It would be a tremendous setback for the progress that we have made in this very important area of air quality. if we are not able to complete this urban airshed model.

Senator SIMON. in this matter of great importance to our States and to all the United States. As you know. there is precedent for Federal costsharing for air quality models in severe ozone transport regions in the Northeast and Southern California. For example. last year the San Joaquin Valley ozone model effort received $1 million in Federal money. and I understand that this year the VA. HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill in both the House and the Senate contains an additional $2 million for this Southern California air model. The $3 million the San Joaquin model will receive represents onethird the cost of this model. Madam Chairman. those of us who represent the people of the southern Lake Michigan air basin are seeking the same Federal commitment to solving the smog problem in our area that has been provided to the people of Southern California. The States of Illinois. Wisconsin and Indiana have committed funds in their fiscal year 1990 budgets for funding the first year of the models cost in keeping with the House passed language stipulating that the southern Lake Michigan air basin model be twothirds nonfederally funded. It is imperative that the Federal share for this model be provided in order to proceed with the plan agreed to by Illinois. Wisconsin. Indiana. and the U.S. EPA to restore the Chicago areas air to health. Madam Chairman.

The air pollution problems around southern Lake Michigan pose a serious problem to the three States of Wisconsin. Illinois and Indiana. What makes this problem particularly vexing is that unique transport mechanisms may operate around this large body of fresh water. Our States are prepared to cooperate in the management of this airshed. but we need some additional technical information to most effectively use scarce public and private funds to improve air quality. No State can solve the problem alone. Each will act together. but we need strong Federal leadership. In particular. we need better data on how pollution is transported in the basin. For this reason. we are seeking an EPA analysis of the interstate movement of pollution. This date will allow us to protect the environment and the publics health.

I was not here 14 years ago when this legislation began. but we heard it said today that this piece of legislation that is coming before us today gives us the opportunity to leave something better In the world after us. This is a better bill than it was in 1975. I would say. Mr. Chairman. that it is going to be a better bill when we are through with it on this floor than it is today. We will pass legislation that will both improve the tanker safety and response capability and provide fair compensation to those who are harmed by these environmental disasters. This legislation before us improves current law in many important ways. and particularly it vastly improves our Nations ability to prevent and respond effectively to oilspills. Nevertheless. the bill can and must be improved. First. Federal oilspill legislation should articulate clear goals and standards for cleanup and restoration. but it must require that those cleanup standards meet the more stringent standards applicable under affected States environmental laws. as well as minimum Federal standards. The bill before us today does not meet that requirement. As it came out of our committee it did. and I hope that on this floor we will be adding that additional requirement. Also. I would like to comment on someone who began work on ollspill prevention many. many years ago. the senior Senator from Washington State. Warren Magnuson. who is no longer with us. However. about 10 days before he died last summer. he was speaking out about improved tanker safety and the need to consider double hulls. I believe it is important that as we consider this legislation we take advantage of the wisdom and experience that those who have gone before us have had. This is a fine piece of legislation.

I would like to point out to my colleagues that more often then not this representative democracy works the way it should work with citizens providing council and some valuable input that guides our action. Let me give you a classic example. Right after the Exxon Valdez tragedy. I received a telephone call from one of my constituents a Dr. Joseph Ryerson of Holland Patent. NY. He is a retired Federal employee. He is a radar expert who worked at the Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. NY. He said to me: Why dont oil tankers which carry millions of gallons of oil have sonar on board so their navigators can be forewarned of underwater obstacles in shallow waters? I said. \"Well. that makes a lot of sense. Why dont they?\" So I got on the telephone. I called the Navy. I called the Coast Guard. and to my dismay. I discovered that they do not. I discovered that we have this great technology used by the military. financed at taxpayers expense with millions of dollars that is not transferred to the commercial civilian sector. So I said to myself. \"Why not change that?\" To the eternal gratitude of all my colleagues on the Committee on Science. Space. and Technology. they adopted an amendment that I offered that asked the Coast Guard. directs the Coast Guard to conduct a study to see what kind of military navigational aids we have that could be transferred. the technology could be transferred to the civilian sector so that they have this navigational system to forewarn them so that perhaps in the future we will not have another Exxon Valdez. So I say that the Congress listens to the people when they talk. We do pay attention out there In America when you call us or write us. and we translate your good ideas Into action here in the Congress. As a result. we all benefit. So the system does work. I want to congratulate all my colleagues who have worked so hard on this very Important legislation. Hopefully in the future we will not have any more Exxon Valdez spills. Mr. Chairman.

I would like to suggest to my colleagues that what scientific information has been given to me. if the Exxon Valdez had been carrying methanol. we would have had a desert. and all fish and wildlife would have been killed. in that area because of the methanol toxicity. Think about that a moment. because the methanol is not going to be coming necessarily from Alaska.

However. it is my understanding that the distinguished chairman of the Merchant Marine Committee will be offering an amendment to H.R. 1465 which provides that amounts spent from the ollspill liability trust fund will be subject to annual appropriations except for emergency removal costs which are capped at $30 million. Natural resource damage and civil penalty payments will also be available without further appropriations for Federal response and removal actions in this amendmentat a cost of approximately $1 million according to an informal CBO estimate. Since the committees with jurisdiction over these matters have decided to limit direct spending to truly emergency situations where an olispill has occurred and must be cleaned up.

We are all too familiar with the Exxon Valdez oil tanker which ran aground In Alaskas Prince William Sound on March 24 dumping more than 11 million gallons of oilmaking it the largest spill in U.S. history. Three other spills have occurred in June of this year and just 3 days ago. a Yugoslavian cargo ship laden with fuel oil and phosphates ran aground at the tip of the Florida Keys. The Coast Guard fears that rough weather will further damage the ship leading to a possible ollspill. Mr. Chairman. there is no time like the present to address this crucial issue. The future of our environment is In danger of irreversible damage if we do not act now ot protect our natural resources from the ravages of an ollspill. All of us here today will have the opportunity to make a difference. We can ensure strong regulations on liability by supporting those efforts to allow States to have the ability to set stricter standards than Federal law currently allows for. First and foremost. it is this Nations responsibility to work as hard as we can to prevent ollspills from occurring. However. as recent history has shown us. we cannot always prevent these spills. Fast and effective cleanup Is necessary. The lessons we have been taught by Valdez show the reality of disorganization and lack of effective leadership when a catastrophe of this nature occurs. This bill will help us to quickly respond to a spill with the best technology and training that can be developed. We also must make sure that those responsible be held accountable for their actions and pay the price of their mistakes. Mr. Chairman. we need oil and we also need to maintain our precious natural resources so that our children can inherit a safe. clean and longlasting environment.

Under the ABC bill. we tax the citizens. and we bring the money to Washington. DC. then Congress passes bills to appropriate the money. That money goes to a Federal agency. which In turn gives it to the State governments. The State governments in turn purchase daycare slots In different daycare centers. That is the way the ABC bill works. Under the Dole approach parents send their child where they want. The bill allows them to take a certain portion of that cost off their income tax. Parents know what the tax credit is ahead of time. They know how much they are going to be able to take off their income tax depending on what their income level is and how much they spend on child care. They put their child in the daycare center. of their choice and they take so much off their income tax. I ask you. Mr. President. which is the simpler approach? Tax the citizen. bring the money. to Washington. DC. appropriate it. give it to a Federal agency which gives it to a State which buys slots in a daycare center. or say to a parent. send your child where you want and take part of the expense off your income tax. no additional bureaucracy. no additional IRS agents. no additional rules or regulations from the Federal Government or from the State government. just a simple choice.

I wish I had time to do the arithmetic of this bill. but I am just going to do a little bit of speculating. I want to repeat. I sure would not like to be out there in the States of this Union when they have to ration the child care under this bill. My best guess is that if the entire profile of young children that this bill says are going to be helped. if you are going to try to help them. then I think you probably are going to help about 7 percent of the children. I do not believe that is the way it is going to turn out because I think there is going to be selective processes out there in the States that favor centralized facilities that find every excuse to fund religious facilities. I believe out there in all of the counties and parishes across America. politics is going to get involved in that very tiny portion that are going to be privileged enough to get help. I am proud to say that we are going to help the poor children first. We are not trying to convince Americans that we are going to help everybody. Those who are for ABC say we might even help $47.000 income families. If you really believe that. you are going to try to take care of 16 million children with about an $800 million grant program. My best guess is that is about $25 a child. That will not work. So the process of rationing is going to create a new group. Maybe we will call them kiddycrats instead of bureaucrats who are going to have to be out there making decisions on behalf of parents. and are the parents in this country going to be surprised when they find out about that process and that they have been left out.

The Supreme Court has made a distinction In matters of assistance which has the economic effect of assisting religious groups with transactions between Government and the groups and Government and individuals who freely choose to utilize their benefits in a religious setting. That is exactly the situation Senator FORD and I are trying to address in the area of child care. The certificate program under ABC provides assistance to all families in the eligible categories. It requires a genuine choice by a private individual In order to allow assistance to flow. Therefore. there is no establishment clause reason why the certificate program should be restricted by section 19(a). And Mr. President. as unlikely as this may seem. there is strong support for this argument even In the report of the committee explaining this provision. The report states: The Committee expresses no view concerning whether the restriction in section 19(a) is constitutionally required by the Establishment Clause. In other words Mr. President. the committee. which in the person of its chairman and the Senator from Connecticut is objecting to this amendment on constitutional grounds. expressly denied that It included the section we are amending for constitutional reasons. If they cant defend the prohibition on constitutional grounds. how can they oppose an exception from it on those same grounds? Mr. President. I cannot. as a Member of the Senate. prove to my colleagues that the Supreme Court will approve an unrestricted certificate program. But neither can the opposition to the amendment cite a single case where the Supreme Court has invalidated a certificate program. It is our opinion. based on solid expert research. that such a program would be valid. and on that basis. there is every reason for the Senate to go forward. I want to deal now with a number of other objections that have been raised. or will be raised with respect to the amendment. First. there is the argument that the committee bill did not limit \"churchbased\" child care. only \"sectarian purposes and activities. including worship and religious instruction. For all practical purposes. the committee has created a distinction without a difference In those terms. I quote from page 48 of the report:",

There is strong support for the judgment that we have made that the Constitution permits the States to provide childcare assistance for parents to dispose of as they wish. without running afoul of the establishment clause. Churchbased child care is one of the foundations of the service infrastructure in this country. It is available to a large segment of our population. It is affordable. It Is high quality. And it is established. not something we need to create. When Americans are crying out for more and better childcare services. when we have less than a fourth of the supply we need. it is critical that we make the most of every resource we have.

What is wrong with saying to the mother who does not want to work. who wants to take care of the childmaybe she has a disabled child or two disabled children. Why should she be discriminated against as she is In the DoddHatch proposal? So I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will understand precisely what they are voting for. If you want more government. you have a big chance for it in the DoddHatch bill. If they want to give you more government. even if you do not want it. they are going to help you. You think about the little town you are born in. where the parents are going to go for all this. and how are they going to raise the case. as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out. How many children? You have five. and one gets to go to a daycare center. or what? Not all five. But if you have a tax credit. you are going to benefit across the board. no discrimination. So I just say in conclusion that there is a big religious issue here. It has not gone away. I heard people say it has gone away. It is not going to go away because it is still there. The Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out very well and the Washington Post pointed out very well this morning that it is not going to go away. Another reason you should not vote for more government is I would rather let my parents. my mother and my father. and my grandparents in on taking care of my children than I would some Federal bureaucracy which dictates to the States that you have to meet six different standards.

We looked at the class of 1986. which I believe is his class. and of the total amount of money raised by incumbents who were in the class of 1986. 4 percent came in the first 2 years. 10 percent came in the second 2 years. and 86 percent came In the last 2 years. So very few of the class of 1986 were raising any money in the first 2 years. To show that the pattern persists. we looked at the class of 1988.

There are plenty of reasons for changing the current campaign finance system. I do not like the status quo. I would like to change it. But the one thing it has been in the Senate is competitive. Under the current system. the Senate has changed hands twice. and Senator DIXON makes an important point when he says in his New York Times article \"The Power of Incumbency\"-at least in the Senate-\"Is a Myth.\" Senate races have. indeed. been pretty darn competitive. I have a couple of observations about spending limits and challengers. Campaign costs for successful challengers have been expanding at a greater rate than both population growth and inflation. What we need to remember here is that a challenger does not have to spend more to win. but he has to be able to spend enough. Challengers typically do not outspend incumbents. unless they happen to be sitting Governors. By the way. I might say under the Democratic proposal that is before us. if it happens to pass. every incumbent here is going to be a sitting duck to an incumbent Governor running against him in an election with that kind of spending limit. But that is Just an aside that some of my colleagues might be interested in. Nevertheless. the challengers do not have to spend as much to be competitive. but they have to be able to spend enough to get their point across. That is illustrated by recent statistics: 13 of the 16 successful Senate challengers elected since 1980. that is 13 out of 16. spent more than the limits proposed in the Democratic proposal in order to win. As I have said repeatedly. challengers do not have to spend as much or more than an Incumbent. but they have to spend enough to communicate their message. In most cases this is an amount which is more than the Democratic substitute would allow. Only two successful challengers since 1980 spent more than the incumbent. I would just like to mention the Senate challengers who are sitting in the Senate today who were elected who spent more than the spending limit contained in the Democratic substitute before us: Senators LIEBERMAN.",

This week I learned some news that I find very disturbing. and it leads me to question whether progress is indeed being made. An American company. AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems. lost a contract with the Kansai International Airport. and there are some serious questions about whether the contract awarding procedures were followed according to the rules. rules that had been previously agreed to. The contract was for a specialized rail system. This American firm is the worlds unquestioned leading producer of these systems. There are only 15 in existence and 12 were built by AEG Westinghouse. Not only is this American firm the most experienced In building these systems. the system Is one of only a handful of projects at Kansal where we know without doubt Americans have a leading edge. Kansal International Airport is an $8 billion project. It is going to be one of the construction wonders of the modern world. The airport is being built in some 60 feet of water in Osaka Bay. The Kansai project was supposed to become a symbol for a new era in United StatesJapan cooperation. an era during which United States companies would have the same opportunities to compete for work in Japan that Japanese companies have for projects in the United States. It sounds very reasonable. However. the circumstances surrounding the rail system contract suggest that Kansal will not be a symbol for progress.

Hundreds of my constituents are gravely concerned about their Social Security benefits. As you know. the \"notch\" identifies those born between the years 1917 and 1921 who are receiving transitional replacement rates for their Social Security benefits. This transition period was put in place by the 1977 Social Security amendments. in response to an error in the benefit formula begun in 1972. If the old benefit computation rules had been left unchanged. benefit levels for many individuals retiring in the future would have been higher than their earnings before retirement. causing a severe threat to the Social Security trust fund. To correct this error and preserve Social Security. the 95th Congress enacted changes to reduce the replacement rate to that which had been originally intended. To protect the benefits of people already receiving or about to receive Social Security. Congress provided a special transitional computation for those persons reaching retirement age in the first several years after the new rules went into effect. This explains why those born between 1917 and 1921 may be receiving slightly higher benefits than those born after 1921.

Unfortunately. there exist some local officials who do not succeed in locating a deceased persons next of kin for one reason or another. As you can imagine. this is very unpleasant for a family in this situation. The issue was brought to my attention by a family who lives in my district. Two parents had a son who had run off on his own from their home in York. PA and finally resided in another State. The son died later of natural causes. and although the local medical examiners office attempted to locate an uncle. whom he had listed as next of kin. it was not successful in locating the uncle and made no attempt to locate the parents. After searching on their own. the parents finally found out 3 years later their son had died. This is clearly a tragic situation which no family should have to endure. Today. I introduced a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that medical examiners and coroners should make reasonable. good faith efforts to locate the next of kin of deceased individuals. and that States should develop such procedures. Such guidelines might include: At the place of death and current residencehouse. nursing home. and so forthcheck for personal papers. phone lists. letters. and so forth. Check for a will or insurance policies. Check hospitals for previous admissions. Check telephone directories. Check city directories. Check with police agencies. Contact banks. and financial institutions for possible accounts with beneficiary. Contact veterans assistance. Contact Social Security Administration. Contact neighbors. Place notice in newspapers and electronic media. Contact FBI for fingerprints. Contact place of employment. Check with registrar for deaths of same name. If place of birth is known. check with local registrar. police. hospitals. Use police telenetwork. and Check with secretary of States office. Federal agencies and departments. such as the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. should cooperate with local officials in these efforts.

At the age of 6 years old Michael dreamed of becoming a world champion boxer. Sunday. in Phoenix. his dream was realized. Michael defeated the International Boxing Federation light flyweight champion. Muangchai Kittikasem. in a seventh.round technical knock out before his hometown fans. It was an outstanding performonce. combining finesse with sheer punching power. Michael Carbajal truly lived up to his nickname \"Manitas de Piedra\" [Little Hands of Stone]. With this victory. Michael became the first 1988 U.S. Olympian to win a world championship. He fought for the gold medal at Seoul. He lost the bout on a much dsputed decision. Humble. as ever. Michael said of the gold medal bout. \"I was disappointed. naturally. but I was just happy to be in the Olympic games. And I knew in my heart Id won.\" His pride and sportsmanship are a credit to all Americans. Michael gives a great deal of credit for his success to his family and the foundation that they established for him. His family settled in Arizona long before it was granted statehood in 1912. His father. Manuel. who was the Arizona Golden Gloves flyweight and bantamweight champion in the late 1940s. taught all of his nine children. including the girls. to box. Michael learned to box In a homemade ring. built by his oldest brother Danny. in the family garage. His love of family and boxing kept him out of trouble while he grew up In Verde Park. a Phoenix neighborhood plagued with drugs and crime. In his free time he takes courses in youth counseling at a local community college so that he can help children resist the temptations of gangs and drugs. This commitment to his family and community is a further tribute to his athletic achievements. Michaels victories are not just his own. They are Phoenixs. Arizonas. and Americas. He Is only the second American to win a world championship in the history of the 108 pound division. The State of Arizona is proud of his outstanding achievements. Michaels goal is now to win world championships in four weight divisions. Mr. President. I ask that my colleagues join me and all Arizonans in wishing this outstanding American our congratulations and the best of luck in his future endeavors.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to join my senior colleague from the State of Nebraska in introducing legislation to repeal a Federal tax provision that imposes a serious handicap on the fundraising and operating abilities of charitable organizations. such as churches. baseball teams. labor unions. and other nonprofit organizations in the State of Nebraska. This provision. incorporated into the 1986 Tax Reform Act. calls for the collection of Federal income taxes. or \"unrelated business income taxes [UBIT]\". on the proceeds received by charitable organizations from \"games of chance.\" It requires not only the payment of the future tax liability of funds collected. but also the payment of taxes back to 1986. The bill we are introducing today calls for a straightforward repeal of the provision included in the 1986 act and the return of the law to how it stood prior to passage of the act. In Nebraska. many charities perform their fundraising activities by means of a pulltab lottery system called pickle cards. Although not mentioned in the 1986 Tax Reform Acts official committee report and not enforced or apparently noticed by the Internal Revenue Service until very recently. the collection of taxes on pickle card proceeds. will have a devastating effect on the groups reliant on pickle cards for fundraising. The effect of the collection of these taxes will be felt by a variety of groups performing inportant functions in the State of Nebraska. For example. a number of parish schools utilize pickle card revenues to finance athletic. transportation. equipment. tuition programs for students. Others negatively affected by the provision include the Septemberfest Salute to Labor. numerous athletic associations. such as the Nebraska Softball Foundation and Gladiators Athletic Association. the Knights of Columbus in North Platte and Schuyler. NE. along with other fraternal organizations. and other groups providing special services to their communities. In a day when we. as a nation. have elected to rely more on private and nonprofit resources to provide important and needed services to our communities. we must not accept this provision that could wreak financial havoc on those organizations. groups. and associations that are left to pick up the pieces. I urge that our colleagues give this legislation their consideration and approval.e By Mr. BREAUX: S.J. Res. 273.

I rise to introduce a joint resolution designating the second week in June as \"National Scleroderma Awareness Week.\" Three hundred thousand Americans are affected by scleroderma. a chronic disease of unknown origin that has no cure. It causes thickening and hardening of the skin. In its most severe form. the hardening process spreads to the joints. causing decreased mobility and to the body organs causing functional impairment. Scleroderma usually strikes healthy individuals at any time between the ages of 25 and 55 years old. but it occurs in women two to three times more frequently than men. Early diagnosis allows therapeutic treatment that may slow the progression of the disease. But even with treatment. the prognosis for scleroderma patients varies widely. some experience a remission or have minor symptoms that do not interfere significantly with a normal lifestyle. But for others. who may develop kidney malfunction. respiratory weakness. heart spasms. digestive and intestinal problems. or respiratory weakness. the disease can be fatal. Activities and events organized around a nationally designated week will heighten public knowledge of scleroderma and facilitate financial support of much needed research and patient support groups.

The American Jewish community. with all Its diversity. is united in support of Jerusalem as the undivided eternal capital of the state of Israel. As we know you appreciate. Jerusalem maintains a special place in the hearts and minds of the Jewish people. It Is uniquely significant to us in religious. historic and cultural terms. The fundamental right of Jews to live in this city must be respected. Jews have lived in this ancient city without Interruption since the days of the Bible. For much of Jerusalems history. including well over the last 100 years. Jews have comprised the majority of the population of the city. Only from 1948 to 1967. under Jordanian rule. were Jews for the first time prohibited from living in parts of Jerusalem. Fortunately. this prohibition ended in 1967 when Israel successfully defended Itself against -Jordanian aggression. We understand that U.S. policy now is that the final status of Jerusalem is to be determined by a negotiated settlement. We also believe that U.S. policy recognizes the right of Jews to live in any part of Jerusalem. a judgment expressed by Vice President Dan Quayle on Tuesday to the Conference of Presidents. This was reinforced in the statement today by Margaret Tutwiler in which she declared \"the United States position. as was enunciated earlier this week. Is. of course. Jews can live in East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem. There is no difference from that policy. and its been stated. as you know.\" We trust that this correctly states U.S. policy in regard to the right of Jews to live in Jerusalem. Respectfully yours.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. an important event took place in Washington yesterdaythe ground breaking ceremony for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. This project. authorized by Congress in 1984. is intended to honor Federal. State and local law enforcement officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. Service in the law enforcement field is a very dangerous and. all too often. a thankless task. In the last 10 years. more than half a million officers have been assaulted. nearly 205.000 wounded and more than 1.500 killed in the line of duty. The 500.000 courageous male and female active law enforcement officers who serve across this country are losing their lives at the rate of one every 57 hours. Fortunately in Maine the figures are not quite so numbing. but they are serious nonetheless. Since 1808. according to research by the Maine Department of Public Safety. there have been 63 Maine officers killed in the line of duty. Nearly onefifth of those have died since 1980. Two of those officers were killed last year and two others already this year. While no monument can ever do justice to the grief and pain felt by the families and friends of these felled officers. this memorial will serve as a constant reminder of and tribute to the daily dangers faced by those who keep the peace in our behalf. I would also like to note that this national project has spurred an effort in my State as well. The Maine Legislature has authorized the Maine Chiefs of Police Association to solicit funds to build a permanent memorial in Augusta. our State capital. to honor State law enforcement officers. I wish this effort well. These brave men and women in uniform who put their lives on the line deserve our respect and recognition.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to bring to my colleagues attention an innovative refugee assistance program in Oregon which has proven to be especially cost effective in helping newly arrived refugees achieve economic selfsufficiency. The Refugee Early Employment Project CREEP] is a federally funded demonstration project based in Portland. OR. which carries national significance. A 3year study of REEP has recently been completed by the Refugee Policy Group (RPG). a Washingtonbased refugee advocacy organization. The study is a fitting tribute to the many Oregonians who have dedicated themselves to enhancing the lives of refugees in Oregon. The aim of REEP is to facilitate employment and economic selfsufficiency among refugees. in addition to exploring alternative strategies for the delivery of cash assistance. social services. and case management. REEP has managed to accomplish these goals. while reducing expenditures by a margin of 18.5 percent compared to Oregons previous refugee assistance program. More important than cost savings. however. is the direct effect that this program has had on refugees struggling to begin a new life in the United States. REEP attained one of its primary objectives by placing at least 75 percent of employable refugees in permanent. fulltime employment within 18 months of their arrival in this country. As a result of this increased employment rate. more refugee families can be expected to obtain economic selfsufficiency at an earlier time. thus reducing the expenditures required to support these families during their first 18 months in America. If REEP can be successfully replicated in other regions of the United States. and all indications are that it can. it will result in a considerable financial savings to refugee assistance programs. and it will provide a tremendous boost to the livelihood of refugees seeking a new life far away from their own wartom and often repressive nations. Special gratitude is owed to Ron Spendal and Shari Cook of the Oregon Adult and Family Services Division for their imaginative leadership during the project. Their efforts. together with the coordinated contributions of many others. are helping to bring about a brighter future for refugees In the United States. Mr. President. I ask that the contents of the Refugee Policy Group executive summary on \"The Refugee Early Employment Project\" be printed in the RECORD following my remarks. The summary follows:",

I rise to supplement the record and to clarify certain statements which appeared in Senate Report 101139. accompanying S. 1364. a bill to establish a Joint FederalState commission on policies and programs affecting Alaska Natives. Section 2(b)(5) of the bill provides that the President and the Governor of Alaska shall give careful consideration to recommendations received from Alaska Native village. regional and State organizations. The committees intent is that both the President and the Governor should consider recommendations for appointments by the whole spectrum of Native interests In Alaska. The report then specifically mentions the Alaska Federation of Natives EAFN] as one of the organizations to be consulted and urges that no appointments be made to the Commission until AFNs recommendations have been received. It is not the committees intent that the recommendations of the AFN should have any greater weight than the recommendations of any other Native Interests In the State. It has recently been reported by the press in Alaska that the language in the report means AFN is to have a strong hand in deciding who gets appointed and should have the most clout in selecting the Commission. Although the committee values AFNs leadership role in the Alaska Native community. we recognize that there is great diversity among Alaska Natives. The committees intent is that at a very minimum. AFNs recommendations should be heard before any appointments are made to the Commission. However. that does not mean that AFNs recommendations should be given greater weight than those of other Native interest in Alaska. including specifically tribal and other interests making recommendations from the village and regional levels. It is essential that the Native tribal perspectives be adequately considered by the Commission. The members of the committee and I personally urge Native village and regional Interests. as well as AFN. to make their recommendations directly known to the Governors office. the Alaska Congressional delegation and the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.

Recycling plastics is one answer to the growing problem of more and more garbage and less and less landfill space. Even though polystyrene foam food containers represent less than onequarter of 1 percent of our solid waste. recycling will help keep these containers out of landfills. roadside ditches. and lakes. oceans. and rivers. The next big challenge is to educate consumers so they participate in the McDonalds recycling program. Customers at 100 McDonalds restaurants in New England are being asked to place their foam containers. utensils. salad containers. and hot drink and sundae cups in special trash bins marked \"for recyclable plastic only.\" Educated consumers hopefully will apply these new habits to recycle other disposable products. McDonalds based in Oakbrook. IL. is a good corporate citizen and has taken the lead in raising money to help seriously Ill children and their families and many other worthy causes.

This is a contract that is reached between the Department of Agriculture and the farmer to participate in the programs. If the farmer carries out certain actions. then he receives certain benefits. If he is unwilling to do that. then he does not receive the benefits. So the point should be that in fact if this is going to be the rule of thumb that is extended. then this should go to each and every company. whether they are with the Department of Defense. whether they produce chemicals. or whether they produce anything else. If you are going to have a contract with the U.S. Government. then you cannot have an adjusted gross income of more than $100.000. That is exactly the logic of the amendment under the ArmeySchumer proposal. This is not an income maintenance program. That is the bottom line. The fact of the matter is that unless we have the degree of participation necessary. this program does not work. If it does not work. it does not work.

The point I was trying to make awhile back. and I hope this is not old information. because we have been going over this and over and over again. I tried to make this to the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Texas . We have heard a lot about the 4 percent and heard a lot about the 20.000 to 25.000 people here who are rich or who can certainly afford this who are investors or whoever. A lot of those people are landlords. My question was: Has anybody trieC to make a determination that if yotu isenfranchise the landlord and if for economic reasons or simply because you really singled nim out as unworthy and he decides he is not going to allow that tenant to enter his land in the program. we have also disenfranchised that small family farmer. many of them. the average producer whose daily livelihood really depends on the landlords operation and his cooperation and his good farm management: now. many farmers in my district farm their own land. but then farm and rely on leased ground to make their operation really economically viable. Many of them have multiple landlords to work with. If one of those landlords falls into the unworthy category of the gentleman from Texas or the gentleman from New York or the gentleman from New York [Mr. OwENs. he wears a scarlet \"B\" on his bib overalls. and that stands for \"big.\" and that landlord says. \"No way will I partLicipate in the Federal program. If I am out. then the land goes with me.\" What does that do to that average. moderatesized family farmer trying to make a living? Do we know how many farm families depend on the capital assets of these individuals? That was the questionI was trying to raise. I would make one other question of the sponsors of the bill: Why did we exclude dairy. that is. the dairy program? I certainly have the attention of the gentleman from Wisconsin. Why did we exclude dairy from this particular kind of cutoff? Could I ask that?",

Let me return to the gentlemans point about the land. remembering. if you will. by IRS hard data. we know the average income of these 20.000 people who may be disqualified. taken from farming. is 4 percent. One of the things that would happen if the acreage they owned or wished to acquire were disqualified from programs. you would not have them inflating the price of land as we have seen happen all too often to the point that the small operator that was really farming his own land that wished to acquire land would not be able to afford to purchase his own land. and you would have a tendency to work against the chronic trend for the programs themselves to encourage concentration in agriculture.",

The bill embodies muchneeded reforms of the Hatch Act. which presently restricts Federal and postal employees in their ability to participate in this Nations democratic political processes. At the present time. 41 States permit public employees to participate in most general campaign and partisan activities. Americas 2.8 million Federal and postal workers should have this same right. but the Hatch Act prevents them. The present law is enforced by some 3.000 regulations. many of which are silly and contradictory. For example. the regulations permit Federal employees to support a candidate. but forbid them to host a \"Meet the Candidate\" forum in their homes. Federal employees can attend a political rally. but they cant wave a banner or flag. They can put a lawn sign in front of their homes. but it cannot be larger than a bumper sticker. H.R. 20 would lift these confusing limitations and give Federal employees the option of participating in election campaigns on their own time. just as other citizens can. As amended by the Senate. the bill retains certain restrictions to make sure that Federal employees do not use their positions within the Government to influence anyone else. To that end. Federal employees would be strictly prohibited from engaging in any political activities while on the job. while in a Government facility. or while in uniform. Federal employees would also be barred from seeking a partisan political office and from making a political contribution to their superiors. They would also be prohibited from Intimidating or coercing any Federal employee to participate. or not !o participate. in any political activity. To enforce these restrictions. the bill provides an effective array of penalties. including fines. job termination. or jail.

I thought that Internal Revenue Service auditors and Justice Department employees. for example. should be exempt for that reason. However. as we ail know. there was no opportunity to amend the bill. I therefore voted against it. The bill we have before us today helps my concerns. In a nutshell. it prohibits Federal employees from influencing the political posilions of private citizens who may be vulnerable to their decisions. As an example. lets say that an IRS agent is conducting a taxpayer return audit. That agent would not be able to approach the taxpayer on a matter of political consideration. Likewise Veterans Department employees making decisions on serviceconnected compensation cannot solicit political activity on the part of the veteran applicant.

Can we really say that nothing has changed since 1939? Technology has changed. the world situation has changed. and yes. even the civil service has changed. Our Government employees have proven themselves worthy of our trust and respect. The civil service is a worthy career entitled to the same rights as other professions. Yet. as soon as you walk through the door. you are: Forbidden from waiving a political poster at a convention. Forbidden from exercising your right to hold office in a political party. and even Forbidden from handing out campaign pamphlets to your neighborson your own time. Opponents of Hatch Act reform are outraged that we should extend political rights to our civil servants. They insist that Federal employment Is a privilege and this privilege justifies restrictions on partisan political activity. This is the same attitude which has brought about the silent crisis in our Federal work force. Where else can you have less right to do more for less money? Our Nations work force is not going to suddenly turn to coercion and corruption. IRS agents are not going to threaten political opposition with audits. Yes. bribery and blackmail are still illegal. There is fear in every workplace that employee organizations will employ intimidation techniques to gain political power. Yet. we would not deny the private sector the right to participate merely because of our irrational fears. The protections at the heart of the Hatch Act are retained in the amended version of H.R. 20. Civil servants and the public are protected from Intimidation and coercion. On the job political activities would still be prohibited and subject to severe penalties. Employees would still be forbidden from running for partisan political office. However. these same employees can finally become a part of our political system of government. They can participate in activities that their friends. neighbors. and private counterparts take for granted. This Is the right to free association and the right to exercise their basic first amendment rights.

There is widespread agreement that our Federal statistical system is not keeping pace with the fundamental economic and demographic changes taking place in our Nation. The Bureaus ability to collect data on manufacturing. retail and foreign trade. service industries. and other key sectors of the economy. has suffered in recent years due to a lack of adequate resources. I believe that the initiatives proposed in the Presidents budget are a small. but necessary. step toward a more accurate statistical system. I wholeheartedly support the Appropriation Committees decision to fund the Commerce Departments program to improve demographIc surveys. When one considers the fundamental role of statistics in government and business decisions involving billions of dollars. this appropriation Is a very small investment to ensure their accuracy.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment offered by my friend from Iowa. NEAL SMiTH. This amendment will provide a muchneeded increase in the funding for bank and financial prosecutions being carried out by the Justice Department under last years savings and loan bailout bill. I am sure that all of us have been made aware of the deep concern our constituents have over the S&L scandal. There is a growing feeling in this country that not enough is being done to investigate and prosecute those who have fraudulently ripped off the savings and loan industry. This thievery will cost everyone of usevery man. woman and childthousands of dollars and threatens the financial security of our entire Nation. There is no doubt that these people deserve the maximum punishment allowable under the law. Most Americans want action taken at a faster pace than the administration is proceeding. The Presidents budget request for fiscal year 1991 contained approximately $55 million for S&L prosecutions. Chairman SMITHs amendment would raise this funding level to $75 million which is the amount previously authorized by Congress under last years S&L bailout bill. While more funds may eventually be needed. it is my understanding that we are constrained by House rules to the statutorily authorized amount provided in the bailout bill. I would like to point out that the Judiciary Committee has ordered reported a Justice Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1991 which contains $100 million for S&L prosecutions. As I have indicated to Chairman SMITH. I would hope that this and other funding authorizations and limitations will be used as guidance in the upcoming conference with the Senate. As such. it is still possible that the $110 million level may be incorporated into the conference agreement and voted upon by the full House and Senate. In any case. Chairman SMITHS amendment is a good first step in providing increased funding for S&L prosecutions and I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. The rising cost of the savings and loan bailout. estimated to eventually cost over $300 billion. makes it an issue of special concern. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh recently estimated that up to 30 percent of the failures in the S&L industry could be blamed on fraud. The criminals who used S&Ls for their own personal gain should be tracked down. yet few of the 21.000 possible savings and loan crimes referred to the Justice Department have been prosecuted. This amendment will appropriate the total $75 million authorized to be spent for the investigation and prosecution of S&L fraud. It is a good start. but we should go even farther. Although a Justice Department authorization bill has not seen passed yet this year. the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved an amendment to the Justice Department authorization bill that would authorize $110 million for investigation and prosecution of financial institutions covered by the Financial Institutions Reform. Recovery and Enforcement Act [FIRREA. The 30 percent of the thrift bailout the Attorney General estimates is due to fraud will cost the taxpayers at least $100 billion over the next 40 years. The least we can do is provide the funds to prosecute the people who stole this money. Prosecuting S&L criminals will not reduce the cost of the bailout. but it will show the citizens paying for it that those who stole billions of dollars will be brought to justice. The taxpayers deserve nothing less. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

I want to take just a moment and talk about how we got into this mess in the first place. It is worth taking a few minutes to again review that. There are probably five major factors for the S&L collapse that we have seen. One of those Is coupling deregula. tion and broad new powers and activities for thrifts with desupervision. and while we were giving those thrifts brand new powers. many of them Statechartered thrifts we found at the same time that we had fewer examiners and fewer supervisors looking over the shoulders of the thrifts as they exercised their new powers. We also increased the deposit insurance from $40.000 per account to something like $100.000 per account. That raised the exposure of the FSLIC. We had insufficient capital requirements for those who owned and operated the thrifts. They had too little money of their own at risk in the activities of those thrifts. If the thrifts failed. it was no skin off the back of the owners. Who would pay the losses?",

I think it is very important that we understand that we declare our national priorities by our budget allocations. Not having this additional $28 million is saying to the cit!ins of this country that this is not the highest priority. If you look at what the Stanford Law Review has recently estimated the true cost of this bailout in the future. they are estimating over $1 trillion for 40 years. That is in large part due to the bureaucratic delays. a lot of the inactivity regarding the sale of assets. The bottom line on this. if this is going to cost an extra trillion dollars over 40 years. is it not rather trivial for us to be debating another $20 million to fully prosecute the people who have committed fraud and abuse from the taxpayers of this country? Earlier this year when we had hearings in the Banking Committee in Dallas. TX. more resources are needed. When we passed FIRREA. which is a good bill supported by the President. many of us had grave concerns about the execution of the provisions of the bill once it was passed. whether the Justice Department would be truly vigilant in the prosecution of the fraud. whether the RTC would be guilty of bureaucratic paralysis. as we now find it to be. The bottom line is that we need this extra $20 million. We need more money. We need to be as aggressive as possible in the prosecution of fraud in the S&Ls. Mr. Chairman.

That is Just not the case. The very first appearance that the Attorney General made before the Committee on the Judiciary under the new administration was one in which he specified the plans that he had as the Attorney General for the prosecution of the S&L cases. The very first thing that the President of the United States did in his overall program which he brought to the Congress was his program for the S&Ls which included prosecution of the cases involving fraud and the requests for money and the requests for U.S. attorneys. and all of the programs that have come up since have been staunch evidence of the fact that this administration and the Justice Department are fully intent on making sure that the S&L fraud convicts are put into jail and made liable for restoring those stolen goods. This brings me to the next point. that there are others of us. many of us. who are working on other facets of this S&L crisis. We need the cooperation of everyone to complete it. We have legislation in that will make sure that those who are convicted of S&L fraud will not evade restitution by filing bankruptcy which is a distinct possibility.

Sessions told the House Banking Committee that his agency could use more funds to strengthen fraud investigations. The House Government Operations Committee. in a review of 1989 FBI division teletypes relating to requests for increased staff to combat financial fraud. found that certain FBI divisions with fraud and embezzlement cases asked for help but received nothingno prosecutors. no agents. no support staff.

Other divisions which received increased but inadequate funds included Chicago. which had 300 pending investigations. Dallas. Houston. New Orleans. San Antonio. Miami. Boston. and Newark.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the Soviet TransCaucasus is awash in blood. In Baku and other cities throughout the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians have been the targets of theft. torture. and murder. Since the newest eruption of violence 10 days ago. in Baku alone. more than 65 Armenians have lost their lives. more than 130 have been injured. and countless others have been forcibly and brutally evicted from their homes. Particularly disturbing is the fact that these attacks have been carefully planned and premeditated. they have been executed with a singlemindedness and intensity that calls to mind the term \"pogrom.\" Given the nature of the attacks against the Armenian people and the very real threat of civil war. it would appear that Soviet President Gorbachev was left no alternative than to dispatch army troops to Azerbaijan. This past weekend. an estimated 29.000 troops were present in the region to quell the violence. The tragically high death toll to date poignantly demonstrates the need for a resolution of the underlying conflict. Troops alone cannot end the fighting between Armenians and AzerbalJanis. At the root of the violence is the issue of NagornoKarabagh. a region where the Armenian majority is subjected to Azerbaijani rule. As long as Azerbaijan continues to control this area. I fear that the atrocities will continue. We in the United States must do what we can to press the Soviets on this issue. In fact. I recently returned from Moscow where I met with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on a wide range of foreign policy issuesincluding the antiArmenian violence. Last November. the Senate passed Senate Joint Resolution 178. a joint resolution that I authored and introduced on the issue of NagornoKarabagh. Among other things. the joint resolution urges the United States administration to make NagornoKarabagh a priority item in its bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union. Since I still believe this to be a necessary course. I would hope that the House of Representatives would pass the resolution shortly and that the administration would take heed. I ask unanimous consent that this joint resolution. as well as a letter that I and Senators WILSON. PRESSLER. SIMON. and KERRY sent to President Gorbachev be printed in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.",

Perhaps I may be forgiven for suggesting that she is a remarkable young woman. She is my daughter. Jane Helms Knox [Mrs. Charles R. Knox] has always wanted to be a teacher.

I refer to a study by David Cantor of the Congressional Research Service. \"Steel Imports: Is the U.S. Market A Profit Center for Foreign Steel?\" which was released last December. This study begins with the statistical fact that the VRA limits were not filled in 1987 or 1988. and probably not in 1989. and goes on to demonstrate that one likely reason for that was the fact that for other industrialized producers the U.S. market was less prof Itable than their own. In other cases. mostly LDCs. prices were higher in the U.S. market. but that was primarily because of price controls in their domestic markets. While this information may be more of academic interest at this point. it helps make clear the ongoing primacy of market forces in international steel trade despite the VRA Program. And. in fact. it is market forces that are determining the level of imports into the United States. That may come as something of a shock to those who opposed extension of the VRAs because it is a significant addition to the mountain of evidence demonstrating they wereand arewrong. No doubt when this issue returns in 1992 they will be back arguing against any further extensionsand they will be wrong once again. Mr. President.

In 1986 California voters overwhelmingly approved proposition 65 to require that the public be warned about exposure to chemicals which cause cancer and birth defects when levels exceed \"no significant risk.\" I strongly believe the public is entitled to this information. The Bush administration proposal. however. would preempt Californias law. I strongly believe the preemption is unjustified. In December 1988 a White House Working Group reviewed the economic impacts of proposition 65 and concluded that the costs of compliance have been minimal and that industry has greatly overestimated the costs for outofState food producers. The Working Group also concluded that very few products contain amounts of chemicals sufficient to require warnings. Moreover. since the Working Group report was issued. a number of other concerns about proposition 65 have been resolved. such as the decision not to require warnings for vitamin A in milk. I want to advise my colleagues that I cannot support the Bush administrations new pesticide proposal. It is not in the interests of California.",

Housing and Urban Development and 20 miscellaneous Federal agencies. Mr. President. I think it is fair to say that the 1990 appropriations bill for the VAHUD Subcommittee was one of the toughest we have had to piece together. As I have said on many occasions since I first took over this subcommittee In January. I thought I was given a Federal checkbook. After having gone through our hearings. Senate action and conference with the House. I now realize it was a change purse. and not a checkbook. that I was given. We began our task with a 302(b) allocation that was $1.5 billion short in outlays from what we determined was needed to meet all of our programmatic responsibilities. In addition. we faced a large number ol meritorious rquests from members. In the Senate alone. we received about 550 requests. with a dollar value totaling $33 billion. Because we only had $48 billion to work with in our allocation. it simply was not possible to accommodate every one of these items. Nevertheless. I believe the conferees have made a solid. goodfaith effort to do as much as possible. Because of our outlay limits. we were forced to make up some of our 302(b) shortfall with scorekeeping adjustments to avoid cuts that would have been forced on high outlay programs. like NASA and VA medical care. which between them represent almost 73 percent of the new outlays in this bill. And even with the use of these scorekeeping techniques. we were still forced to take a 1.55percent acrosstheboard cut from every program. project and activity In the discretionary accounts in the bill. except VA medical care. where a 1percent reduction was made. Like all conference agreements with the House. this bill contains some compromises that modify the original Senatepassed legislation. However. on balance. the conference report represents a balance between the many diverse and important agencies which it funds. I would like to outline some of the most important highlights in the conference report:",

Moving the development office would impose a significant inconvenience on New Jersey PHAs. Housing officials would be forced to travel to New York City for meetings and information. In addition. the move would create confusion. as New Jerseys PHA officials would be required to deal with the Newark office for the comprehensive improvement assistance program and operating subsidy matters. and with the New York office when planning the construction of new units. Moreover. given the questions that have been raised recently about the functioning of the New York office. it would seem inappropriate to expand the authority of that office at this time.

I applaud this decision. for it sends a strong and clear message to employers that they can not escape their own plan funding obligations by declaring bankruptcy. shifting billions of dollars of liability to the Government. and then going back into business and setting tip new plans. This case began 3 years ago when in 1987. LTV Corp.-having already declared bankruptcynformed the PBGC that it could not and would not continue to fund its plans which had unfunded obligations of over $2 billion. The PBGC. in order to protect the retirement incomes of LTVs workers. terminated the plans and assumed paying the guaranteed benefits. LTV then established new socalled FollowOn pension plans for its union employees and retirees which were virtually identical to tile terminated plans under which the PBGC was paying the unfunded obligations. The simple result of this situation was that LTV was continuing benefits to its workers as if no plan termination had occurred while shifting over $2 billion in unfunded pension costs to tile Federal Government. Mr. President. now that the Supreme Court has spoken. companies should be forewarned that the law requires them to fulfill their pension funding responsibilities and that such obligations can not be avoided by seeking protection under bankruptcy laws and then pretending as if nothing has happened. $2.5 billion in unfunded liabilities to workers and retirees Is a big deal and the Federal Government is not going to be the deep pocket bailing out billions and billions of dollars of liabilities when the employers who ran up those liat ilities are able to pay them off themselves. We have seen and had enough of these kinds of problems with the savings and loan crisis. This decision reaffirms that the PBGC is a safety net for the 40 million workers and retihees who rely on it and should not be viewed as the personal bank account of those seeking to subsidize unfunded pension liabilities.

The tiny State of Jammu and Kashmir. bounded on the wet by Afghanistan and Pakistan. and on the east by China. remains the seat of a conflict regional in its dimensions but potentially international in scope. Since 1947. disputes over Jammu and Kashmir have already caused two wars between India and Pakistan. But another IndoPakistani battle could escalate into a world tragedy because both countries now possess lethal technological weapons. It is highly unfortunate that this issue has rekindled animosities between two democratically elected governments in the strategic southern cone of Asia. Continued violence and stalemate in Jammu and Kashmir can only undermine the stability of each nationone trying to solve its own internal ethnic disputes. and the other struggling to move out from tinder the shadow of dictatorship. Although recent history would dis. courage us from hoping for a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir problem. the United States cannot afford to sacrifice hope or consign the innocent civilians of this region to a fate of protracted war.

This is Intended to be the difference between what the authority collects in terms of rents and the cost of operating the property. Part of the formula for calculating that differential relates to utility costs. For some time. the formula utilized by the Department has recognized the unusual occurrences of severe winter days. freeze conditions. by authorizing a heating degree adjustment factor which essentially allows for an adjustment for the additional costs which a public housing authority would undertake because of unusually severe winter type conditions. There is. however. no commensurate recognition of the severity that may occur during the times of drought and extreme heat which we have had in the last few years. We have all seen scenes of these persons. particularly elderly persons and the very young. who have been dramatically adversely affected as a result of that. That also has an adverse effect in terms of the economics of operating many of the public housing attthority properties. So the amendment that I have submitted would direct HUD to develop an appropriate cooling degree day adjustment factor in the same way that we currently have a heating degree day adjustment factor. It would recognize a legitimate cost which Is borne by public housing authorities in virtually every area of the country which has been subject to the severe heat of recent years.

It would be a matter of redistributing within an existing formula that attempts to assess costs to public housing authorities for their utility bills across on a national basis. It would add another factor In to the formula through which the funds were allocated and distributed. But I cannot answer the question. I think it is obviously a legitimate but unanswerable question until the Secretary devises his particular means of implementing tile directive.",

Sixtyseven Senators have cosponsored the bill. 278 Members of the House of Representatives have Joined as sponsors. The bill has been held up in the committee in the House for reasons which today remain unclear. It has been delayed despite the high public approval and proven economic benefit of the bill. Analysis indicated the coins design would yield a net profit to the U.S. Government of as much as $1 billion. moneys which can be used to reduce the national debt. It is a common practice among nations to redesign their coins. The United States has changed coin designs 33 times before in our Nations history.

Our purpose is to increase the level of funding for this vital program which has seen its buying power cut in half at the same time that the social problems it is designed to address have increased dramatically across the country. Title XX of the Social Security Act provides the main source of Federal funding for a wide range of increasingly necessary social services such as child day care. protection from abuse or neglect. sheltered employment and communitybased residential programs for disabled individuals. and chore services and home delivered meals for the elderly. Title XX has lost 50 percent of its purchasing power over the last 10 years. At the same time. reports of child abuse. the need for homebased services for seniors and disabled Americans. and the need for affordable child care have become urgent national concerns. Our bill is modest compared to the need. It simply restores $200 million to title XX in each of the next 3 years. It raises the authorization of title XX from its current level of $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion by 1992the level it would have reached in 1985. absent the reductions of the early 1980s.

This legislation will help restore funding for the title XX Social Services Block Grant which serves some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Title XX is the primary source of Federal funding for child care. community services for senior citizens and those with disabilities. and protective services for abused and neglected children. The Social Services Block Grant enables individuals and families to help themselves become economically and socially selfsufficient. I believe we have a responsibility to encourage those with disabilities to reach their potential and care for themselves to the best of their abilities. We must assist parents with dependent children to obtain quality child care so they can work and provide for their family. We must provide community services such as adult day care. chore aid. and homemaker assistance to enable the elderly to remain in their homes. Title XX provides all these services and more. But because its funding levels have not Increased with the rate of inflation. these programs are having difficulties meeting the needs of the people they serve. The Social Services Block Grant Restoration Act would increase funding for the title XX block grant by $600 million over 3 years. This increase is essential to helping people served under title XX to live independently and maintain a high quality of life. Mr. President. during this time of fiscal restraint. I ask my colleagues to look at this legislation as a much needed investment in the lives and future of our most vulnerable citizens. It is my hope that the Senate will approve this legislation and in so doing. recognize the Importance of services provided under the title XX Social Services Block Grant.o By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. PRESSLER):",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise as a prime cosponsor of legislation introduced by my friend from Massachusetts. Senator JOHN KERRY. that will provide longneeded assistance to our firsttime homebuyers in this Nation. This legislation fills a critical gap in the area of home ownership affordability. Nationally. home ownership rates have fallen dramatically. That drop has been most pronounced among young families in the 25- to 34age group. But Mr. President. why has this occurred? One reason is that we live in an era of rapidly declining purchasing power. Data clearly indicates that average real income has fallen for wage and salary workers. and the average per person income. from all sources. has been growing more slowly during the 1980s than it did during the 1970s. Notwithstanding. the dominant national trend is for the aging of the babyboom generation and the arrival of the babybust generation into prime household formation years. The demand for affordable housing continues. however. concrete financial mechanisms are needed to make the homeownership dream a reality. Owning ones home not only promotes the local economy. but inspires home owner pride that is so essential to develop the social fabric of a community. It provides a foundation to be involved in neighborhood activities and support local community projects. Mr. President. in my own State. firsttime home buyers. without equity from a previous home purchase. are faced with home prices double and triple that of the middle 1970s. and the necessity of saving a minimum of $16.000 to cover the downpayment and closing costs for a modest home. Many responsible and hard working young people from Seattle to Spokane. Bellingham to Battle Ground. WA. cannot afford to make that first initial downpayment. It is both unfair and tragic for this to occur. That is why I enthusiastically endorse this bill introduced by Mr. KERRY. To conclude. Mr. President. affordable housing for all citizens is important to the social and economic welfare of this country. It is a priority issue in my office and must be a priority item for our national agenda. I will continue to study and support initiatives that promote this ideal. and implore my colleagues to do the same.9 By Mr. JOHNSTON (for himself and Mr. McCLURE):",

PlayItSafe is currently available in 31 languages In 2.800 cities throughout the world cultivating a mutual exchange between nations of ideas on safety. Only by providing our children with information which will help them become more aware of how and why accidents happen can we encourage them to avoid situations where the potential for injury is great. Mr. Speaker. I believe that the achievements of the PlayItSafe Program are felt all across the Nation and the world. I congratulate PlayIfSafe International for its concern for the welfare of our children and its aggressive program of bringing readily understandable educational materials to our youths.",

American Heart Association. and American Lung Association. It is a Tobacco Prevention Program targeting students who will graduate from high school in the year 2000. Each year the students will be involved in programs to learn more about the dangers of tobacco. with the goal of a generation of young people who are smokefree. I want to make special mention of these students because at an early age they have made an important decision to live their lives in a healthy manner.

And they are also willing to make a stand against the peer pressure that can be found even in the early grades. and which they are sure to encounter as they progress through the school system. The toll smoking takes on our society each year is tremendous. It is a real health concern for all of us. but we can be encouraged by the actions of these second graders who are leading the way to a smokefree generation. I look forward to the high school graduation ceremony where these youngsters. and perhaps many more who will join them after today. graduate as the \"SmokeFree Class of 2000.\" They have my support and congratulations.

Under the provisions of this bill. the number of usual and customary congressional newsletters each Member can send annually would be reduced from six to two. In addition. the legislation requires that each Congressman or Senator prepare a statement every 6 months outlining the number and costs of all mass mailings he or she has prepared and sent. Within 30 days. the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration would collect and make available to the public a summary of the information from such statements. The legislation also divides the joint congressional postage account into two separate accounts. one for the House and one for the Senate. in order to prevent either body from spending savings generated by the other. Finally. the bill stipulates that if any Member exceeds his or her postage allowance. they would be required to pay the excess from their office payroll account. The need for this legislation is clear. The appropriation for congressional mailing. despite election year fluctuations. has significantly increased in the last 10 years.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing two bills that address two separate problems that have arisen in the Northwest because of the current timber supply crisis. The first bill would provide for a $20.000 reward for information concerning the placement of hazardous devices on Federal lands including the spiking of timber resources. Last year. as part of the omnibus drug bill. we increased the penalties for such acts of sabotage. However. because of the nature of the crime. it has been impossible to catch the perpetrators. Tree spikers can act months before a timber sale is offered. Any evidence of their crime. other than the deadly tree spikes. is long gone by the time the spikes are discovered. Without a reward system for information. these criminals will never be caught. These acts are a real threat to human life. Tree spiking is designed to maim or kill mill workers and loggers. A mill worker in California had to have his face rebuilt because a saw blade came flying across the mill after hitting one of these spikes. Most of my mills in my district have had to install costly metal detectors in an effort to protect their workers. So now those who value a tree more than a human life have switched to ceramic spikes. which have the same deadly result. I hope my colleagues will help me end these acts of violence against innocent workers. The second bill I am introducing would require the Federal Government to pay interest when the harvesting of timber under a Federal timber sale contract is delayed for more than 30 days by a court injunction on administrative stay. Many Northwest mills are located in small communities. and are the mainstay of the local economy. The Federal Government now requires substantial upfront capital when it awards a timber sale. When that money is held up indefinitely. the whole community loses. The mill cant harvest the timber it has under contract. and it has less capital to purchase alternative log supplies. This bill is a fair response to this situation. and may also bring some order to the issuance of stays and injunctions. I would ask my colleagues to join me in support of Northwest workers by cosponsoring these bills.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to call to the attention of my colleagues the Scouting for Food Drive of the Boy Scouts of America. As chairman of the Select Committee on Hunger. I would like to commend the Scouts for their dedication to helping to reduce hunger and to meet the needs of this Nations poor. In most places. Scouting for Food will be held the week of November 10. 1990. In the Dayton. OH. area. which I represent. the drive will be conducted in February which coincides with Scouting Anniversary Month. I consider it a great privilege to be named honorary chairman of this years drive in Dayton. Last year in Dayton. we collected 1 million cans totaling more than 60.000 pounds. Nationwide. during 1988 and 1989. Scouts collected 132 million cans of food. I am hoping to surpass the record this year. Hunger is a severe problem here in this country. An estimated 20 million Americans. Including 4 million children. go hungry at some time every month. Between 1983 and 1985. the average number of households requiring emergency food increased almost 40 percent. About 70 percent of these families had children to feed. During Scouting for Food. local Boy Scout councils will ask for donations of nonpedshable items with nutritional value such as peanut butter. baby formula. packaged meals. and pasta. and canned foods like tuna. chunky soups. meats. fruits. vegetables. and stews. The Scouts will organize the collection and arrange with local agencies to warehouse and distribute the food to the needy. Scouting for Food is more than collecting food for the needy. The Boy Scouts see the program as a way to get more people involved with helping the poor. Only through strong public commitment can we eliminate the problems of hunger. Doing the good turn has always been a cornerstone of Scoutings citizenship and characterbuilding efforts. By helping the hungry people of this country. the Scouts are truly doing a good turn.",

We cannot forget the rest of the American work force who may not go to college but may need some postsecondary education. They too will play an important role in our economic future. When we authorize student financial aid programs. the legislation should recognize the diversity of postsecondary education options available to students. We should ensure that financial aid does not exclude any one type of education.

The conference agreement does not include a provision I authored in the House bill regarding the availability of emergency medical units of the Armed Forces. Conferees failed to understand the importance of this provision. which would have directed the armed services. and in particular the Army. to retain sufficient capability to provide emergency medical assistance in the same manner as was performed by emergency medical helicopter units. such as MAST or Medevac. that have been deployed. The leadership of the House and Senate committees apparently did not understand that these emergency medical units provide emergency services not only to civilians. but the military personnel as well. MAST. or Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic. units help transport civilian accident victims to local trauma centers. and Medevac. or Medical Evacuation. units transport military people injured in the line of duty in remote areas. such as desert training ranges. or thick forest wilderness. Conferees failed to understand that if these emergency units are deployed and not replaced. military personnel who have suffered serious injuries may not receive prompt medical assistance. Civilians Injured in remote rural areas might likewise be denied access to lifesaving health care facilities without these capabilities. Conferees also assume that nearby military units will be capable of providing alternative medical services to replace deployed MAST and Medevac units. There are some military reservations and some remote civilian areas. however. where no replacement capability will exist. This is exactly the point of my original language. There are cases where the nearest military medical facility will be 100 miles away. In those instances.

Without his deft leadership. decisive action. and determination we would not be here today. I will cast my vote in favor of S. 774. No matter how painful. there is no escaping the duty to act on this difficult issue. For every month we delay. it costs the Federal Government nearly $1 billion.

Senator RIEGLE and his outstanding work in moving this bill. He has taken on an onerous. thankless assignment and quickly produced a workable solution to an urgent problem. My opposition to the bill comes from the continued willingness of Congress and the President to agree to take offbudget any program which runs a deficit. Senator RIEGLE proposed a plan to leave the bailout on budget and I applaud his effort. but this was defeated in the committee. Leaving the bailout on budget has two advantages: first. it would allow the bonds that the Federal Government is issuing to receive a lower interest rate and thereby save taxpayers billions of dollars over the life of the bonds. second. it would be a rare exercise in truthinbudgeting. By issuing the bonds through a quasigovernmental agency and not backing them with the full faith and credit of the Federal Government. we are sticking the taxpayers with a higher interest rate that translates into increased interest costs of $150 million a year. Clearly. the Government is the dominant player in this activity. and the debt taken on by the taxpayer should be acknowledged and made a part of future budget planning. Finally. Mr. President. everytime we run into some Government program or service that we can establish is losing money. we take it offbudget. This is outrageous. and I cannot support this bill because it continues the charade that does nothing but mask the enormity of the deficit by pretending that it is not there.

This does not even rise to the level of a ploy. it is out and out deception. This is just one example.

    "speech": "Mr. President. April 24 marks the commemoration of the 74th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. in which onehalf million Armenians were brutally murdered by agents of the former Ottoman Empire. It is extremely important that all Americans recognize and remember this atrocious action by the Ottoman Turks against the Armenians. The Government of the Republic of Turkey refuses to acknowledge that the Armenian genocide ever occurred. The Turkish Government would like the memory of the Armenian genocide to fade away. We simply cannot let this historical massacre be forgotten. By recognizing the anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Americans can help prevent future genocides against other groups of people. Soviet Armenians have been victimized by terror and violence more recently in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. Tens of thousands of Armenians have been expelled from the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbijan. which borders the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. Azeri officials are attempting to depopulate the Armenian regions of their republic. The United States cannot ignore these human rights abuses. The Armenians have experienced a tremendous amount of suffering during the 20th centuryfrom the genocide that occurred over 70 years ago. to the human rights abuses in the Soviet Union. and the earthquake last December that devastated their homes and public buildings and killed tens of thousands. Mr. President. the history of the Armenians is ful. of tragedy. The least we can do is to appropriately commemorate this 74th anniversary of the awful genocide that destroyed so many innocent Armenian citizens of Ottoman Turkey.",

The outcome will have a direct bearing on the interests of the United States. The National Democratic Institute. recognizing the importance of the upcoming elections in Panama to the Interests of the United States and to the promotion of democracy in our hemisphere. initiated a program to monitor these important elections in Panama. As part of the effort. a high level international delegation traveled to Panama under the auspices of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government from March 12 to 16. 1989. to study and analyze the conditions for free. fair. and democratic elections in Panama. The Council is made up of current and past democratically elected leaders of the Western Hemisphere. Its executive committee members are former U.S. Presidents. Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. former Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. former Costa Rican President Daniel Oduber. and former Belize Prime Minister George Price.

Even though many of our powerplants burn lowsulfur coal we are required to use technological controls to further reduce our emissions.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to commend the exemplary corporate citizenship of the California law firm of OMelveny & Myers. manifested in its commitment over the past 6 years by its pro bono legal services to the Childrens Institute International. In recognition of its extraordinary contribution to Childrens Institute International in sustaining this nonprofit organizations mission to fight child abuse and neglect. OMelveny & Myers will receive the Champion of Children Award from CII on June 28 of this year. This award is presented annually to the individual or firm who has provided significant support to CII and has been on the forefront of services rendered to abused and neglected children. Our society is faced with the tragic and widespread problem of child abuse and neglect. There is a critical need for assistance in coping with the complex legal requirements for child abuse cases in the State and Federal justice systems. OMelveny & Myers has donated thousands of hours of legal assistance to CII In its efforts to help hundreds of child victims and their families. and has done so with great compassion and sensitivity in a criminal justice system which unwittingly traumatizes young victims and those who try to help them. OMelveny & Myers is one of the oldest and largest law firms in the United States. Founded in Los Angeles in 1885. it has enjoyed a long and distinguished history both in the national and international legal communities. I find it commendable that this venerable firm has consistently chosen to demonstrate a compassionate civic conscience to complement its business success. From the center of such humanitarian concern has emerged the very real gift of assistance to abused children in need. a gift which I am privileged to illuminate in this Chamber of the U.S. Senate. I congratulate OMelveny & Myers as it receives this years richly deserved Champion of Children Award.o",

    "speech": "Mr. President. on Sunday. June 10. the Arizona Republic profiled a true American hero. Rev. Leon Sullivan. Reverend Sullivan has been active since the 1950s in helping Americas poor and underprivileged get a step up and learn to help themselves. First he established the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America [OIC]. beginning in Philadelphia and then expanding to 140 locations throughout the United States by Now. Reverend Sullivan is taking his ideas of selfhelp overseas through his International Foundation for Education and SelfHelp [IFESHI. Helping to battle the twin evils of poverty and illiteracy. he is establishing farms. small enterprise developments. and vocational training programs in countries throughout Africa. Additionally. in March. he signed the first contracts with the Agency for International Development [AID] to purchase $2 million in debt in Nigeria. Niger. and Guinea and then parlay that into more than $5 million in local currencies which are used to establish development programs in those impoverished countries. Our attention and our focus for our limited foreign aid dollars are becoming directed to Eastern Europe and away from Africawhich has been ignored for far too long. Programs such as Reverend Sullivans innovative debt for development initiative have the possibility of helping these debtburdened countries escape their debt problems and provide them with a financial basis to train workers and thus attract private investment and supplementary international development aid. I commend Reverend Sullivan for his long and distinguished career in developing innovative and effective selfhelp programs and ask that the Arizona Republic article about Reverend Sullivan be printed in full at this point in the RECORD.",

In our free society. every American has the fundamental. not governmentgiven. but Godgiven right to think what he or she pleases and say what he or she thinks. say. \"I may not agree with a word you say. but I will defend to death your right to say it.\" Voltaire did not say. \"I do not agree with any part of your destruction. but will defend to the death your right to destroy.\" Voltaire did not say. \"I may not agree with your buying an election. but I will defend to the death your right to buy it.\" Now. the trouble with this resolution is it does only half the job. The Supreme Court made a supreme mistake twice. once in the case before us and once in Buckley versus Valeo where it ruled that unlimited money expenditure by an individual to elect someone is protected speech. The court tells us that spending money is speech. Destroying something is saying something. Buying something is saying something. That is the problem with which we are faced. Now. if you are going to correct an incorrect decision by the Supreme Court. If you as I have concluded that it is the Court which violated the edict of Thomas Jefferson not to legislate. if you accept as I do that it is the court that has amended the first amendment and it is we who have the responsibility to stop that amendment. then both mistakes should be corrected at the same time. Buying an election is not speech and the destroying the flag is not speech. either. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a joint resolution which has been introduced in the House by Congressman FISH. The resolution designates October 23 through October 29. 1989. as Eating Disorders Awareness Week. The two most common eating disorders are anorexia and bulimia. Anorexiaalso known as \"starvation sickness\"-involves a pattern of excessive dieting over a period of months or even years. Bulimia is a related disorder of compulsive binging and purging. Both are serious emotional disorders that can lead to physical illness and death. While eating disorders can affect men and women of all ages. they are most prevalent among younger women. A recent Gallup poll projected that roughly 2 million American women between the ages of 19 and 39 are affected by symptoms of bulimia or anorexia. An additional 1 million teenagers also suffer from these disorders. The causes of anorexia and bulimia remain uncertain. Many studies suggest that social and psychological factors are involved. while research at the National Institutes of Health has shown that biological factors may play a role as well. What is certain is that early treatment is essential to recovery. Without early intervention. eating disorders become more and more entrenched. increasing the chances of serious physical injury. The hidden nature of eating disorders is the most serious impediment to their early diagnosis and treatment. For this reason it is imperative that we greatly increase the publics awareness of this problem. I hope that by designating an Eating Disorders Awareness Week. it will put an end to the pain and suffering that eating disorders have caused in the lives of so many Americans. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint resolution.o",

I urge my colleagues to review this report. It is indicative of the grave and deep environmental problems in Eastern Europe that only now are coming to light.

    "speech": "Mr. President. late last month. the Senate considered and then passed the State Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1990. A great deal of the debate on this bill was spurred by an amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina which would have prevented United States officials from negotiating with PLO terrorists who had been involved in terrorist attacks against American citizens. I cosponsored and supported the Helms amendment simply because I am convinced that America cannot expect to fight an effective war against terrorists by negotiating with and legitimizing terrorists. In June. the State Department commenced negotiations with Abu Iyad. the PLO terrorist who is widely believed to have ordered the assassination of our Ambassador to the Sudan in 1983. By treating this terrorist as a legitimate diplomat. the State Department unfortunately. if not unintentionally. sent a signal that terrorism can pay. And this is something the Senate cannot allow to occur if our Nation is to conduct a serious war against terrorism. This very same point was raised by Bruce Herschensohn In an eloquent television commentary broadcast on KABC in Los Angeles on July 21. 1989. He pointed out that the negotiations being conducted by the State Department with Abu Iyad \"provides a tremendous Incentive for terrorists.\" With the United States now again embroiled in a hostage and terrorism crisis. Mr. Herschensohns remarks may unfortunately prove prophetic. Mr. President. I hope all Senators will take a moment to review Mr. Herschensohns remarks. and I ask that a trascript of his commentary be printed in the RECORD at this point. The transcript follows:",

That invasion. which resulted in wartime deportations of more than 32.000 Lithuanians. 33.000 Estonians and 10.000 Latvians to the Siberian gulag. wiped out the Baltic regions dreams and hopes.

We ought to do everything we can to promote that movement. and bring about a free and independent Lithuania.

I want to take advantage of the opportunity also to salute the dedicated men and women who have served with distinction and carried those great burdens through the years. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join with Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI today in support of House Joint Resolution 363. to designate 1989 as \"United States Customs Service 200th Anniversary Year.\" and to authorize the President to Issue a proclamation on the bicentennial celebration of the creation of the Customs Service. This anniversary is particularly noteworthy since it coincides with the bicentennial of the Committee on Ways and Means. Both were born out of the new Nations need for revenue. Customs was virtually the sole source of Federal revenue throughout the Nations formative years. Through enforcement of prohibition in the 1920s. to todays emphasis on commercial fraud and control of critical technology exports. Customs has retained the essential role it played in our national security and economy since the beginning of the Republic. The challenge for the Customs Service now. and into the future. is to somehow maintain the delicate balance between facilitating the ever growing international traffic in cargo and passengers. and the Increasing demands of law enforcement. This is a particularly difficult task for Customs. since they also serve as the countrys \"first line of defense\" in the war on drugs. I want to personally salute the dedicated women and men of the Customs Service for their outstanding work to this end. They should be particularly proud of their agencys rich. 200year history of service to the country. I urge my colleagues to join with me In support of this bicentennial resolution.",

There are bodies of waterrivers. lakes. and streamsthat were once considered hopelessly lost but have now been brought back to life. These improvements resulted from the commitment of national resources that stood as the foundation for the clean water effort. There was a public resolve that clean water was a national priority and that the resources of the Federal Government should be used as a part of that effort. Although progress has been made. much more remains to be done. We are faced with an $83 billion price tag for sewage treatment plants. and with the need to find solutions to the complicated problems of nonpoint pollution. persistent toxics. and coastal and estuary pollution. With its recognition of the national desire for clean water. the 1972 act was a major turning point. It represented a commitment by the people to a cleaner environment. Americas Clean Water Foundation is workIng with Congress. the administration. and some 60 national waterrelated organizations to rekindle this nations grassroots commitment to clean water. The resolution being introduced today will help the foundation launch its 3year campaign to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. As a founding member of the board of governors. I congratulate Americas Clean Water Foundation for its willingness to take the lead in bringing the message of clean water to the attention of every American citizen. I hope that the 20th anniversary celebration that Is being planned will renew our national commitment and that we will be able to make the same kinds of strides in the coming decades as we have since 1972. Americas Clean Water Foundation is the type of activity we need to make water pollution control more than just an abstract figure of speech that means little to most people. It is important for people to realize that water pollution impacts on each and every person. Clean water is vital for every aspect of the quality of life in this country from business to recreation. The Americas Clean Water Celebration in 1992 will help make all of our citizens aware of the importance of clean water.",

A national and international approach to water protection is essential to ensure pure water for each and every living being.

We all need to know how far we have come in cleaning up our water and how much each of us. as taxpayers. have contributed to the effort. Further. we need to have a sense of where the water program needs to go In the years ahead to ensure a pure and healthy water supply for the generations to follow. For these reasons. I am delighted that the Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators [ASIWPCA] has agreed to undertake the important task of documenting water quality status and trends over the last two decades.

Fish and wildlife were disappearing from the Great Lakes coastline. and some fish that were caught were not edible. Our Nations lakes. aquifers. and rivers were being contaminated by Industrial waste and raw sewage. This trend had to be reversed. Congress took the initiative. Working through the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. Congress adopted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. This act. commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act. set the goal of making the Nations polluted waters fishable and swimmable. Now In 1989 we embark on the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of this act. We do so by introducing a joint resolution which. to a large extent. is the result of the hard work and leadership of Americas Clean Water Foundation.

It does not do so. That is an erroneous argument. It is misplaced. It does not describe what is in this bill. whether the Attorney General says it or not. He is Just another person and another lawyer. and his opinion counts for no more than any individual Senators. especially since the Attorney General is obviously pursuing the policy of the administration.

Finally. Mr. President. let me say it is hard to reach changes in a 32page amendment presented 22 minutes before the hour a week after it was debated. But so far as I can see. one change made in the amendment is that it makes it easier for citizen suits to occur than it did under the original NicklesHeflin amendment. By imposing the 1year deadline. that creates a threshold within which citizen suits can then be maintained that would not have been possible under the NicklesHeflin amendment. as proposed. So in that one respect. the amendment changed. as far as I can tell. and this was a very quick review because we only had the amendment 20 minutes ago. It makes it easier to bring citizen suits than was the case in the original NicklesHeflin amendment. Basically. I say to Members of the Senate. there is one issue here.

A vote against this amendment is a vote to enforce the law that we are about to enact. A vote for this amendment is a vote to say we are creating this authority. but we want to make It tough to have it implemented. I urge the defeat of this amendment.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I am pleased that is this llth hour on consideration of this monumental legislation. S. 1630. the Clean Air Act Amendments. a compromise amendment is being offered concerning Federal regulation of radionuclides. This amendment will continue to preserve the right of individual States to regulate nuclear facilities for the further protection of their citizens. At the same time. the amendment will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate these facilities if it finds Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations to be inadequate. The Environmental Protection Agency is charged with the task of enforcing current Federal environmental law for protection of the health and safety of the American people. I believe EPA should be allowed to fulfill its mission. Even more important. individual States should have the option of imposing stricter standards. if their imposition is deemed necessary to protect the health and safety of its citizens. This option is an integral element of current Federal environmental law. and should be retained. This is why I supported the GlennHeinz amendment. which passed the Senate last month. The GlennHeinz language is not perfect. however. and in fact it has many flaws. One important flaw Is the compliance burden which dual regulation entails. Additional regulation Is the last thing organizations affected under this amendment need. That Is why I am pleased that an amendment is being offered today which represents a compromise between these two positions. This amendment will allow EPA to regulate radionuclides. but would require that the EPA Administrator first conclude that NRC regulation is inadequate to protect public health. In addition. an individual States right to require tougher restrictions is fully protected. I believe this amendment represents the \"best of both worlds.\" and is a fair compromise which I hope will result in a more effective and streamlined process for regulation of emissions from radionuclides.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I believe some clarification is in order regarding some of the amendments I offered during consideration of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990. I offered several amendments which were adopted on voice vote that may need some clarification. The Simpson amendment requiring environmental impact statements on Federal forest fire policy was meant to ensure that Federal agencies fully take Into account the health effects of their fire policy with regard to the potent carcinogens that are contained in wood smoke. The fire review team that reviewed the policy after the devastating Yellowstone fires of 1988 barely touched on the issue of health effects. I believe the American people deserve to have their health adequately protected and to that extent I believe it is necessary to reexamine forest fire policy with that emphasis in mind. in addition to health effects the Federal agencies and Federal land managers must also take into account and study the effects on visibility in class I areas and in other areas that are caused by Federal forest fire policy. During the devastating fires of 1988 we saw a huge cloud of smoke cover five or six States and that resulted in significant visbility impairment in class I areas and in other areas. These factors must also be taken Into account in developing Federal forest fire policy. Many of the Federal land managers who are invovled in managing national parks or class I areas like to talk about visibility protection and how scenic vistas must be protected in our national parks. Yet these same land managers favor a forest fire policy which creates huge volumes of smoke and very significant visibility impairment. It seems to me you can not have it both ways. The Senate also considered t1 e AdamsSimpson visibility amendment which requires Governors in various regions of the country to look at pollution sources in their regions and make recommendations to the EPA Administrator for controlling those sources if they reduce visibility. In this vein I would note that the environmental impact statements required by Simpson amendment should be included in any consideration that the governors give to regional haze or visibility problems. Wood Smoke may pose a very significant health threat when individuals are exposed to it chronically and the EPA Administrator may need to regulate cancer causing chemicals from wood smoke in the future.",

Throughout the hearings on the clean air bill. the Environment and Public Works Committee listened to the controversies and uncertainties in health risk assessment. But such risk assessment is elemental in all that we seek to doto protect the health of our citizens. To do so. we must have the facts. We must bring the best science possible to the task. For that reason. during the committee markup. I discussed with committee members the idea of having the National Academy of Sciences conduct a review of risk assessment methodologies and to have NAS recommend to EPA how best to improve such assessments. The final compromise contains a NAS study. and again. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his efforts and contributions in this regard. This clean air bill imposes great responsibilities upon EPA. Be it air toxics. ozone nonattainment. acid deposition. or stratospheric ozone depletion. these problem areas involve complex scientific and technical issues. Indeed. Some of which EPA has not really learned how to do. But we must. The problems are complex. and environmental data are still highly variable.

Mr. Speaker. this conference report is completely unacceptable because it seeks to reverse current law and restore Government funding of abortionondemand. The current law banning abortionondemand is having some positive effects. That is the basic thing I want to get across. Taxpayerfunded abortions in the District have declined from over 3.000 in 1988 to 1 in fiscal year 1989. Further. the repeat abortion rate declined by 5 percent. while the overall number of abortions declined by 8.5 percent. According to statistics published last year in USA Today. in 1988. the last year that abortionondemand was taxpayerfunded. the District abortion rate was triple that of any State in the Nation. This conference report would revive weak language which was on the books prior to 1988 and which has never prevented a single taxfunded abortion. Finally. of all the ridiculous arguments which are used to Justify legal abortion and the public funding of abortion. the most bizarre is the notion that abortion reduces infant mortality. Abortion is infant mortality. As the Reverend Jesse Jackson so clearly stated in 1977 In an open letter to Congr.ss supporting the Hyde Amendment: \"As a matter of conscience.

The battle here then is over the expenditure of local funds by the District of Columbia and how it should be expended when It comes to abortion. I would tell those in the Chamber that there are over 15 States across this Nation which use their own State funds to fund local abortions under their own State standards. and included within those States is the State of California. Yet none of the opponents of the D.C. appropriation have taken the floor to attack these other States. What is the difference between a California abortion and a District of Columbia abortion?

In such cases there are punitive payback penalties. Also. in H.R. 996. is something which I regard as extremely important. and that is we made it fiscally responsible.

This does allow Members to make available the expertise in our National Laboratory. which is a national treasure. to further expand science and math education. It is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. This Is important legislation. As our Nation becomes more dependent on science and technology the greater our need for a strong. dependable scientific base. I am pleased that the Congress supports expanding the talent pool and exciting students to pursue science. mathematics. and engineering fields. We must search nationwide for our future scientists. We cannot be limited to the middle and upper classes to fill the countrys future needs. The best and the brightest must be developed and encouraged at every social and economic level and in every segment of our society. Only in this way can we hope to provide for the future.

H.R. 996 includes as title IV. my bill to create two annual college scholarships of at least $5.000 each for one male and one female from every congressional district to study science. math. or engineering. I want to express my appreciation to Congressmen HAWKINS and GOODLING of the Education and Labor Committee and Congressmen ROE and WALKER of the Science Committee for working together to reach the agreements reflected in the bills before us today. This bill is also similar to that proposed by President Bush. Under the bill. two individuels would be selected and nominated bya broadbased panel in each State composed of educators. scientists. mathematicians. and engineers. The final selection of the studentsto be known as National Science Scholarswould be made by the President. after consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Director of the National Science Foundation. To be eligible. students must have demonstrated outstanding academic achievement in the physical. life. or computer sciences. mathematics. or engineering and show promise of continued outstanding performance. In addition. consideration may be given to financial need and to promoting participation of minorities. women. and the disabled. The National Science Scholars Program will take a big step toward addressing the science. math. and engineering gap facing our Nation today. The statistics on how our students are outcompeted by foreign students are almost shopworn. Feaer students are choosing to study science and math. Japan. with half our population. is graduating almost as many engineers as the United States. American 13yearolds score last in math when compared to students in five other countries. Our best high school chemistry and physics students scored near the bottom in a 13country comparison. This scholarship program. because of Its broad geographic distribution. can be a highly visible and prestigious magnet. attracting students to these fields. It can provide role models. especially for young women and minorities who are now underrepresented in science and math. The program can symbolize our national stake in improving our science and math base. Again. I want to thank my colleagues for recognizing the science and math gap and for creating this avenue of opportunity for the many promising American young people out there whom I know can help get this country back on the road to competitiveness.",

There are few forces in nature as powerful or dangerous as a tornado. 50 touched down in Indiana over the weekend with devastating consequence.

Twothirds of the structures in the town of 3.000 residents damaged or destroyed. For a community of this size. such an impact has been devastating. This devastation comes on top of serious flooding that had already made that part of Indiana a candidate for Federal disaster assistance. My constituents are grateful that President Bush responded quickly to our application for a Presidential disaster declaration that has made 20 counties eligible for relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. the Small Business Administration. and other Federal agencies. As horrible as the destruction has been. it has once again shown how tough. reliant. and generous Hoosiers are in the face of adversity. Although emergency Federal benefits are now available to house those Petersburg residents whose homes were destroyed. none are needed. All the newly homeless in the town have found shelter with friends. family. and neighbors who still have homes. Church groups and other volunteers have worked around the clock to provide food and other necessities. Thousands of individuals have been generous. One anonymous woman in Evansville. IN. bought 192 dollars worth of food and gave it to the TriState Food Bank that benefits tornado victims in Petersburg. Mr. President. difficult times often bring out the best in people.

Meeting this challenge is essential if we are to maintain our relative standard of living. Unfortunately. there is no easy answer to this problem. A wide variety of factors have contributed to the trends we are now facing and we will need to make changes in a number of areas to turn them around. Among the disturbing trends that must be reversed are the large Federal budget deficit and low savings rate. which contribute to high real interest rate3 in the United States and increase the cost of capital for American businesses. We also need to increase our public and private investments in education. scientific and technical research. and infrastructure. Investments in these areas will fuel future economic growth. They can also address one of the core causes of declining competitiveness: the slow rate of productivity growth we have experienced since 1973. Progress in this area will require a longterm perspective on the part of both Government and business. One important consideration in promoting productivity growth is improving the skills of our work force. I have recently received an article on the subject of a National Human Resources Policy written by James OToole. a professor at the University of Southern California Graduate School of Business. and John Simmons. past President of the Association for Quality and Participation. Many of the recommendations in this article are best implemented by private business. others require Government action or assistance. Economic competitiveness is of great importance to the future of our constituents. For this reason. I encourage Senators to take a look at this article. published in the November 1989 \"Economic Development Quarterly.\" as we search for ways to improve productivity and promote economic competitiveness.

This program. under the auspices of the Colorado Institute for Hispanic Education and Economic Development. and in cooperation with the University of Colorado at Denver. is designed to develop the leadership skills of promising individuals in the Hispanic community. The director of this program is the honorable Polly Baca. a well known former State legislator in Colorado and a nationally recognized spokesperson on issues for women and minorities. Vision Hispanica II is the second in a series of programs in which leaders from the political. academic. governmental. and business communities come together to share their insights and skills with individuals in the Hispanic community who show great promise as community leaders themselves. The idea is to match these potential Hispanic leaders with men and women who are already experienced leaders. The program is designed to foster the leadership skills of its graduates. and to provide a supportive environment for the development of creative projects to help the Hispanic community of Colorado. Under Polly Bacas direction. the Vision Hispanica programs have become a model that should be of interest to other States. The graduates of this program have come from all walks of life. representing both sexes and various age groups. They are teachers. community activists. government workers. students. homemakers. business people. and parents. In short. they represent the diversity of the community. and I believe they also represent the next generation of Hispanic leadership in Colorado. and perhaps the country.

On October 10. 1774. the first battle of the Revolutionary War was fought near the present day community of Point Pleasant. WV. Fortysix officers and men of Col. Andrew Lewis forces were killed and another 140 were inJured in a daylong battle with a larger force of Shawnee Indians. The Colonials were victorious. gaining military confidence that was then instrumental in the opening of hostilities against the British in April 1775. In 1908. the 60th Congress officially recognized the Battle of Point Pleasant as the first battle of the Revolutionary War. While events in New England were coming to a head in 1774. the Shawnee and other native Americans were raiding Virginia settlements. The Colonials in the threatened area. led by the Governor of Virginia. Lord Dunmore. mustered to counter the raiding parties. The Colonials were split into two columns. the Northern Division led by Lord Dunmore and the Southern Division by Col. Andrew Lewis. a veteran of the French and Indian War. Lewis and his force marched 160 miles in a period of only 19 days from Camp Union. now Lewisburg. WV. to Point Pleasant. through some of the most rugged wilderness in the United States. On October 10. at the confluence of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers. Lewis and his men were cut off by the Shawnee led by Chief Cornstalk. For the entire day the 1.150 colonists and approximately 1.000 Indians were locked in combat. At sunset the remaining Shawnee retreated across the Ohio. Although victorious. the Colonials had paid a heavy price. Today a memorial to those brave and selfless men stands at the very site on which the battle took place 216 years ago. Their victory assured the future security of the frontier. Americans arew the strength from within themselves and from their rifles to challenge the British to open military conflict. I am proud of those first West Virginia servicemen. They typify the great tradition of military service and valor on the part of West Virginians. It is because of their tremendous sacrifices that we live in a land of freedom. democracy. and liberty.e",

As the author of a drug education bill that was incorporated into the antidrug package enacted in 1986. I take special pride in the school and community initiatives that have since been launched throughout my State with the help of new Federal support. Harrison County Schools antidrug program is one such initiative. Through the inspired leadership of Marcel Malfregot and other school and community leaders. Harrison County is sponsoring a highly popular drug education program. called Hooked on Fishing . . . Not on Drugs. The approach taken by Mr. Malfregot has been to try to unite and involve not only students. but the community as well. in a concerted assault on drugs and the horrors of drug abuse. The Hooked on Fishing Program encourages students to spend quality time with each other and their parents. Community leaders and parents commit time after school and on the weekends to spend with kids in ways that ensure they are learning and enjoying constructive. healthy activitiesinstead of experiencing the boredom that so often draws them into the depths of alcohol and drug abuse. Hooked on Fishing ... Not on Drugs is a shining example of a communitywide effort to get kids away from drugs and educate them at the same time. Nationally known fishermen have participated in the program. local businesses have donated equipment. and community sports clubs have devoted leadership and resources to this special effort. Mr. President. this is one of many local antidrug programs that demonstrates positive and creative ways to fight the war on drugs. My hope is that Hooked on Fishing ... Not on Drugs will inspire local schools. community groups. parents. students. and leaders to come up with approaches that make the most sense for them.

In his view. the countries of Eastern Europe must \"reestablish their moral values to rebuild their economies and clean up their environment.\" Because we have long accepted strong moral and ethical standards as objectives for our society. it is easy to underestimate the critical importance of these values to the success of our own economy and environment. Mr. Megyesy has a strong message for Eastern Europe which is also of profound significance to our own Nation. While the failure of the Communist economies is now apparent to all. the wide range of scandals which now afflict us should make us aware of the importance of ethics to our own freeenterprise economy. We cannot fix the S&L crisis. for instance. by simply changing a few rules. The solution to our problems and ultimately the success or failure of our society depends upon whether we maintain a foundation of strong ethical and moral values.

The 10mile radius or emergency planning zone encompasses 57.000 people. Indian Point. a nuclear plant which the Governor. over the objection of the county. went ahead and got fired up. has 199.000 people in that socalled emergency planning zone. Furthermore. the local governments and the State government were actually thrown out of the atomic safety licensing board deliberations because they flatout refused to cooperate on evacuation issues. They didnt even choose to participate. In sum. there is very little basis on which opponents of the plant can claim it isnt safe. Evacuation plans have been developed between Lilco and the NRC. It can be done. It is a fairly open area out there. There are excellent roads to travel on. The bottom line of this is: Here is a brandnew facility. ready to come on line and produce electricity for Long Island. NY. and America.

House Resolution 289 is a rule providing for the consideration of S. 974. This is a bill that would designate wilderness in the State of Nevada and release national forest lands not designated as wilderness for consideration for nonwilderness. multiple uses. House Resolution 289 is an open rule. The rule waives all points of order against S. 974 for failure to comply with the provisions of clause 2()(6) of rule XI. This clause would prohibit the consideration of any measure until the report on that measure has been available to Members of the House for 3 calendar days. The rule further provides for 1 hour of general debate on this measure. with 30 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and 30 minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture.

Mr. Speaker. this rule provides for one motion to recommit S. Mr. Speaker. as noted at the beginning of my statement. this rule provides for the consideration of a bill that would designate certain lands in Nevada as wilderness and would release national forest lands not designated as wilderness for other uses. No wilderness legislation for lands in Nevada has been introduced since 1964. As a result. Nevada is one of three Western States without a statewide wilderness act. This means that the Forest Service cannot proceed in its plan to manage roadless lands. that industrial projects and developments are delayed indefinitely. and that high quality wildlands remain vulnerable to environmental degradation. S. 974 seeks to address this problem by protecting the wilderness value of some of these lands while allowing the rest to be managed for other uses. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 289 is a straightforward. open rule for a measure that deserves enactment. I urge my colleagues to adopt this rule. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

It is never easy to balance the competing interests that are affected by these wilderness bills. There is one problem that has caused me concern about a number of these wilderness bills and it seems to be a factor here as well. I note that there are dissenting views signed by 15 Members and the first name on the list is the gentlewoman from Nevada . On a number of these wilderness bills. we have seen the Representatives of the area affected not being given the full amount of consideration they are due. Too often it is the will of a lot of outside interests being imposed on the citizens who are most affected. namely those who live in the area where new wilderness is being set aside.

The House position is essentially the position espoused by the gentleman from New Jersey . and the effect of that position would be to deny any funding whatsoever for the U.N. Population Fund anywhere in the world. The position that those of us on this side. supporting the motion of the gentleman from Florida is the Senate position basically. That Senate position would contribute $15 million to the U.N. Population Fund for voluntary family programs other than in China. and excluding abortion. The U.N. program does not fund abortions. There have been claims in the past that the U.N. fund in some way is involved in coercive family planning or in abortions. There really is no qutztion of fact. The U.N. fund is not involved in abortions. I personally have opposed the expenditure of Federal dollars to pay for abortions. so I personally would never support a motion which in any way would fund abortions. That issue is not really in debate here. in my judgment. The real issue relates to China. The argument will be made that the Chinese program of family planning is coercive. the UNFPA is involved in some way in family planning in China. and therefore the House position should prevail. which is to deny any funds to the UNFPA at all. I think it is very important for the Members to understand that in asking the House to recede. we are asking that the Senate position ultimately be adopted. which would provide a contribution for voluntary family planning. excluding China. There is no question that the money at issue here will not go to China for any purpose whatsoever. The UNFPA is involved in at least 120 other countries around the world. some very poor countries. where voluntary family planning is critically important. not only to those countries. but to the interests of the United States. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I would urge in the strongest terms possible that the House recede from its current position. allowing us to move to the Senate position.",

If passed. this vote would restore Americas voice in the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. and send a signal to the international community that America has a stake in responsible. voluntary family planning. If denied. we risk deteriorating the health and welfare of women and children by limiting family planning in poor countries. many of those African. where education and proper health care methods are not supported by United States bilateral aid. What are the facts. First. this provision would provide a $15 million U.S. contribution to the international fund for UNFPA. the largest voluntary family planning provider in the world. Second. the money that we are recommending would not go to fund abortions. voluntary or otherwise. because. our contribution would be placed in a U.S. monitored. segregated account to avoid its integration with other funds. This should allay the fears of my colleagues who believe that our contribution would be added to a general international pot. Finally. a baby born in Africa is 10 times more likely to die In infancy than a child born in the United States. Family planning provides the means to space births and avoid high risk pregnanciesgreatly increasing the chances that both mother and child will be healthy. The comprehensive. coordinated effort of UNFPA is the only multilateral organization able to meet that challenge. As a member of the African Subcommittee and of UNICEFs Advisory Committee. I know the benefits of UNFPA. I know that access to safe and effective family planning is the best way to prevent abortions. I know that UNFPA does not support abortion as of method of family planning. it does not sanction. nor has It ever sanctioned coercive implementation of family planning programs. If Congress allows for a Presidential certification on UNFPA funds. as the Smith amendment proposes. then the United States would in effect be relying on events In China to run our foreign policy decisions in other countries. So I ask my colleagues. then. to join the bipartisan movement to accept the Senate language. It is a vote to preserve U.S. autonomy in foreign policy.

The Smith amendment is necessary and serves only to confuse the issue. If you support voluntary family planning. vote to recede on the Smith amendment.

United States family planning programs operate in only about 40 countries. In Africa. where women in most countries average between six and eight pregnancies. the United States has bilateral population assistance in about a dozen nations. UNFPA works in over 40 African nations. It is crucial that we vote to fund a family planning organization that has a network already in place in nations the United States cannot reach.

I know many Members are troubled by the cost of the program. And others are concerned whether we are procuring the aircraft prematurely. I would only note that when the inflation factors are discounted. the cost of this aircraft is not out of line with others. especially in light of its revolutionary capabilities. It is also important to remember that no aircraft program has been subject to comparable preflight testing both on computer and in the wind tunnel. Secretary Cheney had these same concerns when he undertook the helm at the Defense Department. Since that time he has examined the program closely and inspected the manufacturing facilities personally. This review has convinced him that the B2 remains an essential program that has the full support of the Department. As part of the revised budget request. this program was delayed by 1 year in order to uphold the Secretarys policy of proceeding slowly in the early stages of very high technology programs. Many Members have viewed this program as a source to make available funds for programs deleted by the Secretary.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to introduce a bill to amend the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1988 to establish a priority for the provision of child care in transitional housing. The need for child care among the homeless is indisputable. A 1988 study conducted in California found that 35 percent of that States homeless are under 18 years of age. The National Academy of Sciences estimated that in the same year 100.000 American children were homeless. Under the provisions of my bill. the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would be directed to give priority to funding transitional housing programs that include child care services for their residents. Studies indicate that currently three types of child care services are available to residents of transitional housingon site care in transitional housing. additional child care slots set aside for the homeless in mainstream programs. or child care centers established to serve multiple local shelters. A transitional housing program providing any one of these three types of child care services would qualify for priority treatment making them eligiblo to seek a 75percent grant for the provision of the child care services. Homeless families are under extreme stress. There are parents raising their families in homelessness and spending their days searching for housing. employment. and a means to sustain and keep their families together. All too often the stress of trying to meet all of these needs. complicated by the persistent cry for attention on the part of small children. leads to child abuse or neglect. Responding to this basic need is also critical to break the cycle of homelessness by making it possible for the people to seek meaningful employment. One child care program director noted. \"There is no way homeless families can make it without child care.\" Mr. Speaker. we must assist in providing for this critical need. My bill reinforces the commitment of the Federal Government to ending the scourge of homelessness in a very meaningful way. By providing for child care to help homeless children develop intellectually and emotionally. we accomplish the dual goal of allowing homeless parents to seek permanent housing and employment. Making child care a priority in transitional housing is critical.",

Charlie has now announced he plans to retire from his second career in public service. as Secretary of the Mississippi Senate. at the end of July. Before being elected to Congress. Charlie was administrative assistant to Representative Williams. He began working for John Bell Williams in 1949. soon after graduation from Mississippi State University. He was with him until Williams left the House to become Governor of Mississippi in 1968. Charlie won election to fill that unexpired term and then was reelected to two more terms. but he surprised his fourth district constitutents in 1972 by announcing plans to return to Mississippi. His second career as Secretary of the Mississippi Senate began in 1980. In that job. he was in charge of 36 fulltime employees and had responsibility for a $2 million budget to pay salaries. purchase equipment and otherwise see that the Mississippi Senate was in good working order. But in addition to the administrative work. Charlie has been an adviser and counselor to lawmakers in our State. young and old. He knows politics and the political process and I know he will be greatly missed in the halls of the State Capitol in Jackson. In addition to being a great public servant and administrator. Charlie Griffin has been a friend to many. including myself. I have known him for more than 25 years and I can say that he has given his best in Jackson and in Washington to try to make things better for those he has served. I wish Charlie and his wife. Angie. well in retirement and I salute him on a job very well done.",

Since that time. Mr. Nixon has closely monitored Chinas development and its relationship with both the United States and the Soviet Union. Today. as we focus on the aftermath of the brutal repression of Chinas prodemocracy movement and formulate policy to address this very serious and emotional issue. I bring the very insightful commentary by President Nixon to my colleagues attention. I believe we should carefully consider the broader issues and implications of our actions as particularly advanced by Mr. Nixon. While there have been many commentaries and analyses on the situation in China and on future SinoAmerican relations. Mr. Nixons article is the best and most intelligent I have seen.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. June 28. 1989. SerbianAmericans from all over the United States will gather in Greyslake. IL. to commemorate the 600th anniversary of the historic Battle of Kosovo. This battle for independence showed the determination of the Serbian people to remain free of imperialistic rule. Although the Serbian Army was defeated by the Ottoman Empire. the soul and spirit of the Serbian people was not diminished. Their struggle for liberty and freedom showed the same determination which was so vital to the founding and protection of our own United States. After 500 years of alien control. the Serbs persistence finally prevailed in 1870. when a sovereign kingdom of Serbia was reestablished. However. some of the Serbian lands still remained under imperialistic control. Only after World War I. when the central powers were defeated. did the people in all the lands inhabited by Serbians achieve unity and sovereignty. This dedication to reunite their culture and beliefs is expressed best in the Serbian motto. \"Better the Grave Than Be a Slave.\" Mr. Speaker. June 28 will be a day to celebrate. A day to celebrate not only freedom. but also the quest for freedom. To celebrate the ability of an entire people to overcome oppression and demand democracy. To celebrate the astonishing plea for human rights that is being heard today all over the world. and to celebrate the accomplishments of the Serbian people. As this anniversary approaches. we realize that 600 years ago people cherished the same ideals that we so dearly value today. This creates hope that in the future resistance to oppression and dedication to freedom will still persist. So on this day of celebration. all the people of America can learn from their SerbianAmerican fellow citizens. By congratulating them on the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. perhaps we all can better understand the principles which created these United States.",

I sometimes think on occasion the debate that we have on the floor of this House actually comes out of the history of the walls around us. that what is said today has actually been said on many occasions before. and specifically with the minimum wage it is true. We hear dire processes again. as we did when the thing was first established. that great gloom and doom will happen to the countryside if we enact the minimum wage. Mr. Speaker. as part of my preparation today I went back and looked to see what the original debate on the minimum wage said about it. and I was struck with the similarity of then and today. On December 14. 1937. for example. one Member rose in this body and probably stood in the place I now stand. and that Member predicted the establishment of a minimum wage rate of 40 cents an hour would replace our constitutional form of democracy with a despotic form of government. establish a dominion over industry by labor. and drain our countryside of farmworkers who would surely flock to the cities for such high wages. Mr. Speaker. it did not happen then. and it will not happen today. We should not be misled by those who oppose decency for the American working people by giving them a decent wage. It has worked in this country for 50 years. and it will work again. Mr. Speaker. we should pass. and the President should sign. the minimum wage bill later today.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2. legislation to raise the minimum wage to $4.55 by October 1991. This bill is solidly within a 50yearold tradition in the United States. a tradition that holds that Americans who work should not be poor. The minimum wage is a social compact initiated by FDR in the New Deal that says to every American: If you work full time. year round. you will be able to support a small family without resort to welfare. That tradition and that social compact are threatened today. At todays minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. no one can support a family. The poverty line of 1989 is $11.130 for a family of three. Fulltime. yearround earnings at todays minimum wage are only $6.968far below that poverty line. President Bush is the biggest obstacle to enactment of a decent minimum wage. He wants to raise the minimum. he says. but not so high that it would lift a working family out of poverty. In George Bushs version of a kinder and gentler America. the minimum wage would beas he puts it-\"not a penny more\" than $4.25 an hour. and the three $0.30 increases to get it there would be phased in over 3 years. By the time the $4.25 figure took effect in 1992 it would fall dismally short of a living wage: $8.856 would be more than $4.000 below the estimated 1992 poverty line of $12.890 for a family of three. President Bushs position on the minimum wage has to be viewed in the light of his position of the capital gains tax. To understand his view of fairness and economic justice. you have to contrast his treatment of the working poor with his treatment of the investing rich. President Bushs capital gains tax proposal would give the wealthiest 1 percent of American taxpayers. those earning more than $225.000 a year. an average tax cut of $19.800more than twice the entire annual income a worker would earn under the Bush minimum wage proposal. The working poor would get \"not a penny more\" than 69 percent of a poverty level income. The wealthiest of the wealthy would get tax breaks big enough to hire two minimum wage workers each to take care of their gardens or to do their laundry. Is this the Bush full employment program?",

Mr. Speaker. there has been an absence of Republican participation this morning. I will give them credit for the fact that they are somewhat embarrassed about the position they have to defend because it is a position that begrudges hardworking people a chance to earn a barely minimum wage. The President has apparently imposed on them the discipline that says. \"Dont you dare vote that the poorest people in this society ought to make more than $4.25 an hour.\" an amount that everyone. including the President. understands is wholly inadequate to support a fhmily. Mr. Speaker. the pcsition the administration is urging on its Republican followers is. \"Dont let the poorest people in this society. those most disadvantaged by inadequate education. by the ravages of discrimination. by other problems that they have encountered. dont let them make more than 4.25 an hour as a matter of national policy.\" That seems to me a tragic situation. and. as I said. I acknowledge the fact that my colleagues on the other side are at least embarrassed about that position not to take the opportunity to articulate it. Mr. Speaker. the $4.55 that we are voting is also inadequate. Unfortunately it is probably the best we can do in this situation. We have an economy that has worked well. We have prosperity that benefits most of us. It would be wholly unfortunate if the great majority of us who are doing better than we have been begrudge the poorest and the weakest among us the chance to earn a little bit more of a pittance than they have been earning.

But I do not believe that it takes anyone 60 days to learn how to make a bed. sweep a floor or flip burgersthat is what this training wage really is. Mr. Bush says that he will veto any legislation with a minimum wage above $4.25 an hour. Our bill mandates 30 more cents for workers. Will this be overly burdensome to industry? No! The State of California unilaterally mandated a minimum wage 90 cents higher than the current Federal minimum wage. No jobs have been lost in my State as a result of this action. Indeed. Californias economy continues to boom. In short. what we are talking about is a difference of 30 cents. It is the least we can do.

Mr. Speaker. this situation is a national disgrace. All this time our lowest paid wage earners have continually lost ground in their fight to make a decent living for themselves and their families. They must be fairly compensated. Is this too much to ask? I say no. This is a fair package. Smaller businesses and small farms are exempt from provisions of this bill.

I do not care what financing plan you take. the one by Senator GRAHAM of Florida. the one by the administration or any of the alternatives.

I do not want to get back into my impassioned speech about bailing out depositors. but we have to. We cannot have the financial system of this country collapse. and people have runs on the banks and savings and loans like they did in the 1930s. So I am not up here to defend budget waivers.

The fact is I thought there was something basically honest about what Senator GRAHAM was attempting to do. Senator GRAHAM was proposing that we put on budget the whole $50 billion that is involved. There was an ethic about that. put it on the budget. There is not an ethic about waiving the budget. the restrictions of the budget. the GrahamRudman restrictions in this instance. I voted for that because I felt very strongly and still feel very strongly that we ought to put this item on the budget. This is gimmickry. There is a sham to say that we are going to spend $50 billion and we are going to do it over here. take it off the budget. Come on. Who are we kidding? So Senator GRAHAM came forward with a proposal to put it on the budget. In order to do that. it was subject to a point of order. But because I felt there was a legitimacy and a rightness about his basic proposition. and the only way he could get a vote in connection with his basic proposition was if we first took care of the waiver issue. I voted to waive under those circumstances. But that was a different issue. That was because I was trying to support the position that the chairman of the committee took In the committee. and that is that if you are going to spend $50 billion out of the Treasury. if you are going to cost the taxpayers of this country that kind of money. you ought to put it right out there. and let it stand up and be counted. That is what Senator GRAHAM was attempting to do with his amendment. I supported him in his basic thrust. and I noted that the vote was a very strong one in support of his position and support of the waiver. notwithstanding the fact that the Banking Committee is solidly against any amendments. and pretty much of the leadership is voting that way as well. I hope that answers the question.",

We have done it several times in the last 2 days. There is a fundamental difference of opinion on the net effect. Those 50 Senators who voted against the other waiver said it cost more money to do it that way. including the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.

Originally named the First Baptist Church of Louisville. during the early years the congregation met In the homes of its members. This changed in 1834 when along with the Free Masons the church constructed a twostory building to be shared by the two groups. Membership continued to grow. and in 1849 the First Baptist Church unitedwith the citys Second Baptist Church. which had been formed in 1838. They erected a building on the northwest corner of Fourth and Walnut Streets. and the new congregation became known as the Walnut Street Baptist Church. This building remained the home of the church until the early 1900s when it was sold and the present facility was constructed on the southeast corner of Third and St. Catherine Streets. When other churches moved to the suburbs during the fifties and sixties. Walnut Street resisted this trend and. instead. reaffirmed its commitment to ministering to the needs of all people. Today. the overwhelming majority of its members live in the Louisville area. and its Sunday morning service is seen in more than 40.000 homes.

The participation of former President Jimmy Carter. who continues to be a symbol of fairness and of mankinds desire for self determination. was also a significant factor in ensuring that there were free and fair election procedures. It also must be noted that Daniel Ortegas commitment to a smooth and effective transition of governmental power to the newly elected government is very welcome. The role of the army and the police will bear close watching. The United States must now monitor the transition process and be ready to review and to respond quicky to legitimate request that might be forthcoming from Mrs. Chamorro. particularly with respect to the removal of trade sanctions.

In fact. as service to the Nation is given high visibility by the President and other national leaders. I anticipate that more young people will be attracted to service generally. which can only benefit the military. The program we outline will provide a limited number of fulltime. civilian placements In a limited number of States. Only 1.300 fulltime participants would be serving in the first year of the program. The military recruits over 290.000 individuals each year. There is no way that this small program could have any appreciable impact on the overall recruiting effort of the military services. particularly at a time when the size of the active duty military force is declining and when recruitment requirements will be diminishing. This also holds true for the parttime program. The level of the participationpotentially up to 4.500 participantsis simply not high enough to affect the overall recruiting effort of the Reserve and National Guard. In my opinion. even if we went nationwide with this poposal rather than testing it. it still would not have an adverse impact on recruiting because it would instill a participation by so many young people who are not attracted to either the military or the civilian service.",

I called President Reagan to thank him for his efforts on behalf of the people of Nicaragua for the past several years. because without President Reagans steadfast resolve. we would not have seen a free election or a fair election. we would not have seen the election of Violeta Chamorro in that country. There is no doubt in my mind that one can look at many things that happened over the past several years. past several months. past several weeks and had it not been for Ronald Reagan. despite all the criticism he took from many Members of Congress and many Americans. he understood precisely what he wanted for the people of Nicaragua: Democracy. freedom. and get rid of a dictator. Because of his resolve and because of his steadfast efforts. because of the money the Congress appropriated to help the Contras. because of the imposition of sanctions by the President of the United States. at that time Ronald Reagan. and because of his continuing support. never wavering in his efforts to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Nicaragua. there is no doubt in my mind that the No. 1 catalyst in all this has been former President Ronald Reagan. So I thank him on behalf of the people of Nicaragua. on behalf of Violeta Chamorro. the winning candidate. on behalf of all of us who stood with Ronald Reagan through those rather contentious times. I say this does vindicate. as I said earlier today. Ronald Reagans policy during the Reagan years.

    "speech": "The Senator is correct. The formula for allocating grants under the ASHAA Program is determined administratively. Currently. the EPA determines who is initially eligible for funding by eliminating applications from public school districts with average percapita income in the top 30 percent of the country. For private schools. the EPA uses perpupil spending to eliminate the top 30 percent of the applicant pool. In some cases. needy schools that have unusually high asbestos abatement expenditures are eliminated because of these strict initial cutoffs. This automatic elimination fails to take into account the severe burden some schools may face for asbestos abatement costs and other important financial factors. In determining a school districts financial need. it is important to consider the cost of an abatement project. the number of people available to share the burden. and other factors. such as the local cost of living. But the exceptional costs facing particular schools that fall outside the current funding formula should be given recognition. At the request of the Senator from Illinois . the committee report on S. 1893 discusses this problem and urges EPA to address it. Further. the loan and grants program has been inadequately funded from the outset. This has contributed to the problem. We are trying to spread resources too thinly and are failing to assist many school3 with a legitimate financial need. EPA has done a good Job in trying to allocate these scarce resources equitably. but it is important to consider the other circumstances discussed.",

DC. in addressing the drug crisis. and I Joined with my colleagues from the District of Columbia. Maryland and Virginia in offering Mr. Bennett regional resources and asking that there be a regional approach to the solution. These additional funds give substance to the fight against drugs in Washington and in neighboring Jurisdictions. The District of Columbia needs the additional 700 police officers that will be hired. the increased court assistance to handle the drug arrests. and more prison space. The public schools need the funds to increase afterschool activities for atrisk students. Without these funds. some residents of the District of Columbia will have little hope of improving their situation. Clearly. we need a steady will and additional funds to combat the use of illegal drugs In the Washington metropolitan area. I urge my colleagues to support the Green motion to instruct the conferees.",

You know. in 1905 was the first time this Congress addressed campaign financIng. I had a relative in this body at that time. Once again in 1925. we addressed campaign financing. and then in 1971. a major campaign financial reform was voted on by this House. We as Members of this House understand more than anyone else what campaign costs can be. This legislation. which began as a bipartisan effort in February 1989. today comes before us with an enormous amount of work on both sides of the aisle. No one cannot say it has not been looked at. because it has. When we try to put together legislation to address a rural district. an urban district. a metropolitan district. the issues are not always the same. but I think the legislation before us today addresses many of those issues. What Is a voluntary limit. all Members and challengers must agree. It has PAC reform. What is a PAC? It is nothing but an outgrowth of small individual donors to contribute to the political system. So today before us. this evening. late in the session. it is once again time to readdress this issue. I think the Swift proposal meets the needs of campaign reform. It is time. as we did in 1971. to move forward.",

Since its inception in 1979. the Greater Chicago Food Depository has performed a vital role in attempting to alleviate hunger. By soliciting and efflciently redistributing surplus food supplies. this organization is able to provide fresh. quality food to those people most in need. This operation stands as a productive and creative alternative to food that would otherwise go to waste. Over the past 10 years. this food depository has distributed over 140 million pounds of vital. nutritious food through an extensive network of nearly 500 member agencies. In addition to hunger relief. the Greater Chicago Food Depository has served the community through drug/alcohol treatment centers. day care centers. and shelters for the homeless. In all. this organization has contributed an enormous amount to upgrading the quality of life for a significant number of Chicagos hungry. homeless. and underprivileged. Mr. President. hunger and homelessness are a national disgrace. The tireless efforts of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. and groups like it throughout the country. contributes to the eventual eradication of this terrible problem.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as I traveled through New York this past August recess. the Issue most frequently raised by my constituents was the amazing evolution transpiring in the Soviet Union. New Yorkers. like most Americans. have high hopes for the success of the reforms undertaken by Mr. Gorbachev. Many urged me to make every effort to support Mr. Gorbachev in his struggle: to eliminate trade barriers. to provide credits. and to reduce arms. I found myself constantly having to remind myself. and others. that Soviet rhetoric has not been matched by deeds. It is far easier to articulate the need for reform policies than it is to implement reform policies. Mr. Gorbachev faces an entrenched bureaucracy dead set on opposing his initiatives. Life for the average Soviet citizen Is. materially. no better than it was 5 years ago. and may. in fact. be worse. Freedoms we take for granted remain elusive in the Soviet Union. especially for those persecuted because of their religious beliefs. Let me cite just one example in thousands. Irina Voronkevich. a war widow whose father was slaughtered in the prewar purges of Stalin. has sought to emigrate to Israel without success since 1979. Her exit visa to Israel has been blocked for reasons of security. She is alleged to have had access to classified materials in her years as an employee of the Institute of Plants of the Ministry of Agriculture. Considering the state of Soviet agriculture. it is hard to imagine what of value Mrs. Voronkevich could reveal to anyone assuming this were anything but a pretext. The reality is that Soviet borders remain closed. Today. Irina Voronkevich is 77 years old. Her son and daughterinlaw were allowed to emigrate to Israel Just this past July. What kind of state torments an old woman separated from her family? Is this the true face of Gorbachev. of a bureaucracy still riddled with holdovers from the Brezhnev era. or something else? I do not know. but as long as women like Irina Voronkevich are denied their most basic human rights I will not ease my vigilance. Deeds. and only deeds. can truly bring the curtain down on the cold war.*",

This marks an Important and histodc occasion. as Hungary becomes the first Communist country to restore full diplomatic relations with Israel after having broken them during the 1967 war. Hungary has undertaken a number of courageous steps recently to create a freer. more independent political system. Last week. westemers watched anxiously as Hungary opened its border with Austria to East Germans seeking to emigrate to West Germany. in defiance of East Berlins wishes. In the past week. an estimated 14.000 East Germans have taken advantage of Hungarys open border in order to reach their destination in the West. Hungarys decision now to restore full diplomatic relations with Israel sends an important signal to the Soviet Union and other nations in the Eastern bloc who are searching to find their way In this era of glasnost. Further. Israel has much to offer those countries like Hungary which are struggling to make their nations more economically viable. President Bush has added to this welcome news by confirming that he would be granting permanent mostfavorednation status to Hungary beginning next month. I applaud that decision and commend the Bush administration for their leadership in negotiating a comprehensive business and economic agreement between Hungary and the United States which aims to assist Hungary in transforming its centralized economy by encouraging the development of a significant private sector. In short. Hungary is taking a strong and commendable leadership role in shaping much needed economic and political reforms in the Eastern bloc and that nation deserves our continued support and attention.",

Due to years of low investment and overly generous wage settlements. the industry was on the verge of collapse. It was apparent that increased world production was not the only cause of the weak position of U.S. steel in world markets. To avoid total decimation of the American steel Industry. the Reagan administration agreed to negotiate VRAs on the condition that the profits be reinvested. Obsolete firing ovens and outmoded operations were the primary reasons that U.S. steel was priced substantially higher than world prices.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I have introduced. with eight of my colleagues. a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to provide for the direct election of the President of the United States by the people. The electoral college is an anachronism. and it is time to recognize that the world has changed dramatically sinc.e the framers of the Constitution produced this compromise system. The voters of this country do not need to be second guessed in their choice of a President. There are several reasons that this system does not make sense in 1988. The electoral college was a compromise between the delegates at the Constitutional Convention who favored direct election by the people and those who favored election by the Congress. Those who favored election by the Congress felt that the people were unqualified to make a wise and informed choice of a leader for a new and fragile democracy. Perhaps in 18th century America. where communication was poor and citizens did not have access to information to make a wise choice. there were valid arguments for election by the Congress. However. television and radio have revolutionized everyones access to information. Americans can make an informed choice. There are other problems that have always existed. Small States have greater relative influence because they are guaranteed at least three electors. regardless of population. Large States skew the popular vote by giving a candidate with a 1 percent victory 100 percent of their electors. The result is that a candidate who wins the popular vote could lose in the electoral college. If neither candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes. then the House of Representatives decides the election and each State delegation gets just one vote. Again. this further distorts the vote of the people. and could create a domestic crisis of significant proportion. I believe it is time to let the American people elect their President. As a member of the Judiciary Committee. I intend to pursue this issue in the next Congress. I should note that my colleague. JACK BROOKS. of Texas. the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. has introduced a similar resolution. It is my belief that a majority of my colleagues. as well as a majority of the American people. strongly support this change.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. yesterday my colleague. Senator CHAFES. introduced the Medicaid Home and Community Quality Services Act of 1989. of which I am a cosponsor. I support this legislation because I endorse its goal of creating more opportunities for personal growth and independence for individuals with severe disabilities. In recent years. the trend in care for people with severe disabilities in my own State of Kansas and across the Nation has shifted from institutions to home and communitybased settings. These less restrictive environments have proven to be very effective in encouraging such individuals to realize their full potential and become integrated into community life. The Medicaid Home and Community Quality Services Act recognizes and promotes this trend. While I support providing more noninstitutional options to individuals with severe disabilities. I also believe we must do what we can to ensure that quality care is given to people living in institutions. I expect that careful consideration will be given to this and other issues of concern to institutional residents and their families. What is important is that we give people optionsincluding the option of an institutionand that we make sure that. whatever the setting. the services provided are appropriate and of high quality. Mr. President. we all support providing greater opportunities to people with disabilities to become productive and independent members of our society. Increasing options for quality care will give such individuals more control over their own lives. and for this reason I believe that this legislation deserves consideration.",

However. serious questions remained unanswered.

The center Is expected to open in Baltimore sometime during the fall of 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus arrival in America. The center will be the most comprehensive focus of marine research and public maritime exhibits in the world. The cornerstone of this facility will be the Center of Marine Biotechnology which will be one of five major components of the Christopher Columbus Center. The Center of Marine Biotechnology was established in 1985 to tap the vast potential of the worlds oceans by exploring the technological applications of marine science. The center has only been in existence for several years. yet it has already gained international recognition. Recently. the Presidents Commission on Industrial Competitiveness reached the conclusion that the Nations ability to compete has declined over the last 20 years. The Nation is currently a leader in marine biotechnology. but with this lead dwindling. the Federal Government cannot be complacent. The Federal Government is being asked to provide only 25 percent of the costs of the Christopher Columbus Center while the remaining costs of this $200 million center will be borne by the State of Maryland. the city of Baltimore. and private interests.

As 9year old Nathan Corgor will attest. \"Its fun to work with scales and beakers.\" Mrs. McKeel inspires this inquisitiveness in her students. and that is one of the reasons she Is being honored. The Presid~intial Award Includes a $7.500 grant whk.A. Mrs. McKeel will use to further improve Radio Parks math and science programs.

Under the Singh regime. Sikh leaders are tortured. Sikh women and girls raped. and Sikh youth killed In fake encounters. In fact. Justice Ajit Singh Bains. chairman of the Punjab Human Rights Organization. reports that during the last 2 years. over 7.000 Sikh youths have disappeared and are presumed to be killed. Until the Government of India stops their current repression of the Sikhs and allows International human rights groups. like Amnesty International. to enter the Punjab. then I believe the Sikhs are justified in their struggle for freedom and Independence. And for this reason. I have attached for the RECORD an article from the August edition of the Eastern Times. In which Justice Bains describes how the Sikhs have been thoroughly alienated from Hindus. In addition. I am also including an article from India Abroad which tells of the recent call for an independent Sikh state of \"Khallstan\" by Akali Dal leader Slmrajit Singh Mann.

There are other weather conditions that farmers are suffering from. In the planting season many areas had too much water. Senator BENTSEN introduced a bill pertaining to disaster as a result of Texas farmers having too much rain and suffering as a result of too much water. In my State we had a similar situation in regards to the planting season with too much water and then a different situation developed. a situation development relative to the fact that we had no rainfall for many. many weeks and we had extreme heat. This caused the farmers a great deal of problems relative to their crops. It is my understanding that there were a number of States in addition to Alabama and Texas that suffered. South Carolina suffered a major disaster relative to their fruit trees. and this may be true in some of the other areas close to South Carolina. Now the heat and the lack of rainfall has caused severe problems to exist relative to planting in regards to harvest in certain sections of Arkansas and Mississippi. I have talked with Senators from the upper Midwest. and I understand that North Dakota has had severe drought conditions. This all motivated me to introduce S. 3030. which is the disaster assistance bill of Since that time. I have been asked to have the following cosponsors added: Senator FowLzR. Senator MCCONNELL.

AL. Courtland is a small town In the Tennessee Valley area of Alabama. I would like to read a portion from his letter: Although the weather bureau records show above average rainfall for the first six months. the majority of the rain occurred in the first four months. This fact. combined with the extreme heat has taken a great toll on the crops and livestock provided In this area. I am enclosing a weather summary for our area that I obtained from the Tennessee Valley Substation in Belle Mina. This summary will show the extreme and prolonged heat and drought we have suffered. Senator. there are a lot of crops that are worse this year than they were in 1988 or 1989 when we had a disaster program. The President speaks of helping countries whose economies have been hurt by the Middle East crisis. Well. Senator. the drought we have suffered this summer. combined with the doubling of fuel prices caused by the problems in the Middle East. will mean financial ruin for a number of farmers unless we have a disaster program like the ones Congress authorized in 1988Mr. President. I think Congress should act in this regard. There are some provisions dealing with disasters that are In existing law. The Secretary of Agriculture has not yet seen fit to exercise his discretion and make those provisions of existing law available to the farmers. I call upon him again in regards to this to make available all disaster assistance that is presently on the statute books. H6wever. I do not feel that that is adequate. and I feel that we must move forward and pass a disaster assistance bill for this year of Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Hood Harris.

    "speech": "Mr. President. the people of the Soviet Union and espe. cially people of the Russian Orthodox faith. recently suffered a great loss with the murder of Father Alexandr Menn. a brave priest and revered theologian who had devoted his life to preserving and proclaiming religious faith and spiritual values In a hostile state that had for 70 years declared war against religion. Early last Sunday morning. as Father Menn was making his way to his parish church between Moscow and Zagorsk. he was brutally cut down by a person or persons unknown. Father Menn was ordained in 1961. and was well known as a theologian and church historian. He had been persecuted during the Brezhnev era for his outspoken defense of religious values. Father Menns courage and dignity in the face of persecution. and his solicitude for all those around him endeared him to Russians from all walks of life. In the words of the New York Times. he was \"an unusual combination of country priest and intellectual pastor\" who rebuffed both the KGB on one side. and antisemitic forces on the other. Murders of priests have been rare events in the Soviet Union. even in the postStalin era. In the Baltics. particularly. several priests have met with mysterious and brutal deaths. Some of these cases have yet to be fully solved. It is a sign of the Soviet Unions changing times. however. that President Gorbachev noted Father Menns death on the floor of the Soviet Parliament and has ordered a thorough investigation into the murder. Ironically. Father Menns struggle in the past laid the groundwork for the Kremlins change in attitude toward religion. Mr. President. the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian people have suffered countless physical and spiritual afflictions in this century. Yet the deep faith of so many Russian Orthodox believers will doubtless enable them to endure this most recent tragedy. Indeed. even on this sad occasion. may we remember the words of the Apostle Paul that \"all things work together for good to those who love God. to those who are called according to his purpose.\" The fruits of Father Menns labors. his inspiration to future generations. will surely live long after his untimely passing.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise in support of the bill introduced by the Senator from Montana (Mr. BAUCUSJ. The events in the Middle East are having an impact on all sectors of our economy. This legislation is a common sense attempt to minimize those effects. First. this bill would authorize the President to restrict U.S. imports from any country he determines to be failing to comply with the embargo approved by the U.N. Security Council. The United States and its allies are willing to make sacrifices to keep Saddam Hussein in check. Any nation that circumvents the embargo should be punished. Second. the bill specifically gives the President the authority to transfer title of the $600 million in frozen Iraqi assets to United States creditors. The United States and its citizens currently hold an estimated $2.6 billion in Iraqi debt. Of this amount. approximately $1.9 billion is held by banks participating in the Agriculture Departments GSM credit guarantee program. These banks will soon ask the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay the guarantees. The result. Mr. President. could be a $900 million hit to the CCC budget in fiscal 1991 alone. Under the current budget scenario. this money will have to come from vital USDA programs. Last month. I wrote President Bush urging him to use his authority under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to transfer title of Iraqi assets to United States creditors. including the CCC. This bill would specifically grant him such authority and would allow the CCC and other U.S. creditors to cut some of their losses. Finally. Mr. President. this bill directs the President to use all available authority and programs to help find new markets for those products displaced by the embargo. Iraq was a large customer of United States wheat. rice. cotton. and other agricultural and industrial products. We should do our best to ensure that the entire burden caused by the embargo does not fall on specific sectors of the economy. I congratulate the Senator from Montana on his leadership on these issues. and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

East Montpelier has just received a Take Pride in America Award for its forwardthinking planning. The 2.200 people of this community working through 120 dedicated volunteers de. cided to protect the scenic beauty of their town. Rather than taking the traditional planning approach of adJusting an existing 20year old plan. East Montpelier took the bold step of developing a new plan. a plan that asked community residents \"What do you want your community to look like in the year 2030?\" Currently. residents of. and tourists to. the area can enjoy the famous Vermont scenery of farms and open spaces as well as snowmobile and crosscountry ski trails. The countryside our citizens can enjoy. however. was threatened with overdevelopment. Without action. East Montpelier could have ended up like all too many other American towns: strip malls. fast food chains. and rows of identical houses and condominiums. Wetlands. forests. and community recreation areas were threatend by growth. Instead of loosing their valuable heritage. East Montpelier responded with steps to protect the scenic beauty of our State. A new town plan was developed. A $40.000 conservation fund was created to help preserve farm lands and nature areas. A rally day was held to promote the concept of nature preservation. For the record. Mr. President. I want to commend all of the residents of East Montpelier. and in particular. the more than 120 residents that banded together to take pride in a very special part of America.
