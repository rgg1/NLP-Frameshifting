April 14. marks the day in which womens earnings from January 2014 have reached mens earnings in 2014 alone. In one of the wealthiest. most progressive countries in the world. women still find themselves 31/2 months behind men in wage disbursement. That means that for every dollar earned by men in the United States. only 78 cents are earned by women. For a woman working full time over the span of her career. that means a total loss of $430.000. nearly $500.000. NonWhite. disabled. and LGBT women fare even worse. with some making as little as 56 cents to every dollar earned by men in comparable positions. I am proud to join my colleagues today in recognition of the fact that this disparity is not only antiquated. but economically regressive and morally indefensible. It has been proven time and time again that increasing pay for women has a direct and immediate impact on improving our economy and the health of American families. Fairly compensating women is not only the right thing to do. but it would increase consumer demand. create jobs. and raise the GDP. Today. on Lilly Ledbetters birthday. it is time for Congress to act to enable women to support Americas children and families and end this crippling drag on our Nations economic prosperity and moral stain on our country. It is time we play our part in ending the gender gap.",

It is interesting that the Republican budget chooses not to cut one corporate tax break for the purpose of reducing the deficit. Apparently. that is too touch of a choice for our Republican colleaguesnot to close the corporate tax break. not to cut the tax break that benefits hedge fund managers. They dont cut a single one of those tax breaks to help reduce our deficit. but they do want to increase the premiums on seniors who choose to stay in the traditional Medicare Program. They may call it a choice. but for most Americans. if I say your premium is going to go up 50 percent. yeah. you can choose to have your premium go up. or you can go somewhere else. That is not a heck of a real choice for most seniors who are struggling financially. Sure. it is a paytostay plan. but you have got to pay a lot more in premiums. according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is not according to me. this is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Democratic budget does make the decision to close some of those special interest tax breaks to help reduce the longterm deficit. so we dont have to increase the costs and risks to seniors on Medicare. so we dont have to increase the cost on student loans and start charging students interest while they are still in college. No. we dont do that. They are right. We think those are the right decisions that we made not to increase the costs of student loans and not to increase the costs and risks to seniors on Medicare. Yes. we choose to cut some of those special interest tax breaks instead.

The first. as I mentioned earlier. one of the great untold success stories of the Affordable Care Act reforms. as well as other reforms in the health care system in recent years. is that we have dramatically reduced the cost of health care on a per capita basis. In other words. the increased costs per person of health care have been dramatically slowed down. according to the Congressional Budget Office. which has helped save Medicare and other health care programs over $1 trillion. That is the right way to do it. by realigning the incentives so we are rewarding value in our Medicare system. not volume. as opposed to the Republican voucher plan. which saves money by shifting the risk onto seniors. The other pointand we have talked about this over and overit just aint so that the Republican budget balances. Again. it requires the revenue from the Affordable Care Act. that amount of revenue. in order to balance. at the same time they say they are getting rid of it. Two days from now. they are going to add over $268 billion to the deficit by getting rid of the estate tax for estates over $10 million. That is not accounted for in their budget.

Mr. Speaker. the talking points describe this bill as one that preserves access to manufactured housing. But the reality is that we have learned this bill is a solution to a problem that does not exist. We agreed that this issue needed additional study last year. and reports we have received from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. the manufactured housing industry. and the Center for Public Integrity have all shown us that this measure would not create access to affordable housing but would instead allow an incredibly profitable industry to make even more money by charging exorbitant interest rates and fees to lowincome borrowers. The industry itself asserts that it has been growing and is highly profitable even with the DoddFrank mortgage protections in place. In fact. according to its trade association. the manufactured housing industry recorded shipment increases in every month of 2014. The Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform found that 2014 marked a \"fifth consecutive year of annual industry production increases.\" Even one of the worlds investors. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffet. has been touting the postDoddFrank profitability of manufactured housing. In a letter to his shareholders. he pointed out that Clayton Homes. Berkshires highly profitable manufacturing housing subsidiary. earned a total of $558 million in 2014an increase of 34 percent over 2013. Yes. that is a 34 percent increase. even after the DoddFrank rules were in place. Unfortunately. Mr. Speaker. this is the same Clayton Homes that was the subject of a recent Seattle TimesCenter for Public Integrity joint investigation that found this manufactured housing empire profits in every imaginable wayfrom producing the housing. to selling the housing. to originating loans that take advantage of vulnerable consumers and leave them virtually no way to refinance. So. Mr. Speaker. I insert this article into the RECORD. This. again. is a scathing article that was produced by The Seattle Times. [From the Seattle Times and The Center for Public Integrity.

That would be out. Restrictions on loan terms for highcost mortgages. including the loan payments currently only allowed in very limited circumstances. prepayment penalties banned. a limitation of dueondemand features of loans. creditors banned from recommending default on an existing loan to be refinanced by a highcost mortgage. no fees can be charged by services or creditors to modify or renew or extend a highcost mortgage. late fees capped at 4 percent of past due payments and the pyramiding of fees banned. no fees for borrowers to receive a payoff statement. charges that qualify for points and fees cannot be financed into principal balance. a ban on issuing two loans in order to evade HOEPA coverage by splitting fees and rates.

Nobody I have ever met or had a conversation with said. Oh. I understand that. The car depreciates almost as soon as you sign the note. What happens is that this is an unintended reason for more. I think. congressional oversight of this particular industry because these homes also lose value like automobiles. Let me give you an example from the Seattle study. This is sad. and I will try and do this quickly. Mr. Speaker. Tiffany Galler is a single mother who was living in Florida in 2005. She bought a mobile home for $37.165. With the loan she purchased from 21st Mortgage. she then rented the home out. She made payments for 8 years. payments totaling more than the sticker price of the home. Galler lost her tenant in November of 2013. and she fell behind on her payments. She arranged to show the home to a prospective renter 2 months later. but when she arrived at her home site. Ms. Galler found barren dirt with PVC pipe sticking up from the ground. She called 911. thinking someone had stolen her home. but she found out later that her home was 30 miles away and was up for sale for $25.900.",

I rise today in support of H.R. 650. a bipartisan piece of legislation that would make commonsense changes to DoddFrank and restore clarity to a market that has been hit hard by unnecessary regulations. Texas builds or manufactures over 25 percent of the Nations new manufactured homesalmost 12.000 last year. To put that in perspective. Texas is home to 19 manufacturing facilities with an average of 185 skilled workers per factory. At a time when our Nation is still recovering from the financial crisis of 2008. now is the time to free small businesses from harmful regulations that only hurt hardworking Americans. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have access to affordable financing for manufactured homes. especially in central Texas. where the average home price for a manufactured home is $60.000. The one -size -fitsall regulatory approach under the CFPB is clearly not working. Instead of protecting potential consumers. the CFPB has. once again. gotten it wrong. Treating lending products for manufactured housing as high cost and predatory clearly will not protect consumers. but it will reduce access to small balance loans. With increased lender liabilities. obtaining a highcost mortgage has become nearly impossible. Having critical resources for low- to moderateincome families is vital in many parts of rural America. By passing the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act. Congress can correct one of the many unintended consequences of the DoddFrank Act. This bill is fair. and this bill is logical.

The money that the President requested of us. the $1.9 billion. was for the balance of this year and all of next year171/2 months. $1.9 billion. In this bill. plus what we earlier forced them to put into these matters. almost $600 million. that $600 million. this $622 million is just for 41/2 months. from now until the end of the fiscal year. I say that is more than adequate. If there is more needed. when the regular appropriations bills come up for fiscal year 2017. you heard Chairman COLE and Chairman GRANGER say we will put in the hopper whatever is needed at that time. So this is wholly adequate. It is more than adequate in terms of money. Now. for those who are concerned about whether or not we are taking too much money away from Ebola. in the first place. that fund is not just for Ebola. When it was created 2 years ago. it was for Ebola and other infectious diseases. That is what we are dealing with here. We are asking the administration to use that money. This is an infectious disease. You have got over $2 billion laying there unused left over from what was not spent in eradicating Ebola. By the way. the World Health Organization now says that Ebola is no longer an international emergency. So the money in the socalled EbolaI call it the infectious disease accountthat money is available and needs to be spent now. That is what we told the President shortly after he said he was going to send us a supplemental request. We said to use the money you have. Finally. they did spend $589 million of that. Now we are adding to that with some $622 million. So there is plenty of money there. There is plenty of money left in the till of the infectious disease account if it is needed for Ebola or anything else. There is upwards of $2 billion laying there unused. Mr. Speaker.

One of these is an $8 million ongoing solar panel project at the VA Medical Center in Little Rock. It has been 3 years since the planned activation of the system. However. engineering changes and the relocation of the panels to make way for a new parking garage. which was even known in advance of the award. has cost valuable taxpayer resources. Last year. I sent a letter. along with Senator JOHN BOOZMAN. to the VA Office of the Inspector General calling for an investigation into this solar panel project. which resulted in the VA Inspector General conducting a national review of all the solar panel projects across the VA. While this review is being finalized. many questions remain unanswered about these solar projects. Currently. the VA lists 34 key renewable energy projects dating back to 2010 that remain nonoperational. Todays bill contains an important provision in the report language that will protect the taxpayer dollars by prohibiting funding for solar projects at the VA due to these concerns about the mismanagement in these projects. I am pleased that the committee has included this essential language as we await the results from the VA Inspector Generals investigation into these costly projects.

At a hearing just last week entitled \"Combating the Crisis: Evaluating Efforts to Prevent Veteran Suicide.\" Chairman JEFF MILLER stated that the latest data available from the VA reports that 22 veterans per day are committing suicide. Last fiscal year. the VA General Administration account got a $15.68 million increase for more bureaucracy within the VA. This year. the Obama administration has requested another $81 million increase for that account. The committee wisely chose not to provide funding for the majority of the request in that bill. stating: \"It has doubts about the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional staffing at this late date in the administration.\" My amendment simply transfers a portion of the fiscal year 2016 increase for government bureaucrats to important mental health services for our Nations heroes returning from combat. Traumatic brain injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder have been consistently contributing to behavioral issues amongst our veterans. and all too often. these ongoing mental health issues result in suicide. With an average of 22 veteran suicides per day. more resources are desperately needed. While redirecting funds to where they are needed most. the Congressional Budget Office also states that this amendment would save money and reduce outlays. My amendment also helps bring the level of funding in the bill for mental health closer to the administrations requests for the fiscal year. The VA doesnt need more money to hire more paper pushers. Instead. lets appropriate that money to where and whom the VA was created for: to serve and help improve the mental health of our Nations heroes. I applaud the committee for including my language that ensures the Veterans Crisis Line will provide an immediate response from a trained professional and for the resources already directed in this bill towards mental health.

Troop 23 has been associated with Our Saviors Lutheran Church in Council Bluffs for over 50 years. The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately 2 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performancebased achievement with high standards that have been wellmaintained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank. a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges. as well as completing an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For Andrews Eagle Scout Project he provided 22 slabtopped benches for a pit area at Camp of Good Shepherd in Louisville. Nebraska. Andrew assisted in the milling of the slabs and coordinated the construction with members of several Webelos Scout packs. The work ethic Andrew has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker. the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work. dedication. and perseverance. I am honored to represent Andrew and his family in the United States Congress. I know that all of my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives will join me in congratulating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout ranking. and I wish him continued success in his future education and career.

I agree that it is important to make sure that consumers using multiline telephone systems. or MLTSs. can directly dial 911 without having to dial additional digits first. We are talking about the multiline phone systems that we use in large office buildings and hotels. Many of these systems require consumers to dial an extra 9 to get an outside line. Most of us know that. but too many people do not realize this applies to 911 also. If you dont dial 9 first. you cant reach emergency services. Such a requirement led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari Dunn was killed while her 9yearold daughter tried to call for help. She did what she was told to do in an emergencydial 911but because the system she was using required her to dial 9 first. she only heard silence at the other end. Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunns family. we are one step closer to fixing this problem once and for all. Karis Law is an important step to making our systems work better in an emergency. but we should not delay taking the next step. and that is providing location information to first responders. These multiline systems often fail to deliver precise location information. That means that if someone calls 911 from this very building. for instance. precious minutes would tick by as emergency personnel struggle to figure out where the call came from in the Capitol. We should act immediately to correct this problem. too. because making sure the call goes through is only helpful if public safety officials can find the caller. Mr. Speaker. that is why Democrats had hoped to include such a provision in H.R. 4167 during markup. We are encouraged by the commitment we received from Subcommittee Chairman WALDEN to work together on a separate bill to address this concern. We hope to get this done soon. With that commitment.

It would have required the FCC to post within 24 hours of adoption any final rules that were modified by the Commission. Such a requirement was inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. which requires that any rule changes are accompanied by an explanatory text. Additionally. the original bill failed to take into account the fact that in many cases where there is a delay in the release of FCC decisions. it is usually due to late receipt of dissenting statements from some Commissioners. To fix these issues. Democrats proposed an amendment during markup to provide the FCC to post. in its entirety. the text of any actions within 24 hours after dissenting Commissioners file their statements.

When I was the New Mexico Secretary of Health. I witnessed how successful and beneficial these contracts could be in efficiently delivering services to tribes and their members. Through these contracts. tribes operate hospitals. health clinics. mental health facilities. and a variety of other community health services. Having tribes manage and operate programs in their communities not only recognizes tribal selfdetermination and selfgovernance. but it also helps ensure that tribal needs are being met through traditionally and culturally appropriate methods. Although several agencies have the authority to execute 638 contracts. such as the Bureau of Land Management. the Bureau of Reclamation. the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services. the Forest Service does not currently have this authority. Several tribes have expressed to me that they would like to see the Forest Service have the authority. Many of the pueblos in New Mexico have land in tribal forests that are adjacent to national forests. and we know that wildfires and pests can quickly affect entire regions. regardless of who owns the land. In fact. the Las Conchas wildland fire. which is one of the largest wildfires in New Mexicos history. started on June 26. 2011. in the Santa Fe National Forest.

My wife and I have had the good fortune to plant over 100.000 trees on our land. with the help of the kids. and I want you to know they are doing well. I am supportive of this amendment because I think it is high time that the American Indians and the Alaska Natives. who are the first stewards of our lands. be allowed to better exercise their sovereignty and their selfdetermination in caring for the forests they have called home for untold centuries. We already have 638 contracts that allow the tribes to manage Federal lands in Indian Country. This amendment simply adds a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service to that list. By approving this measure. we help create jobs. protect our forests all across Indian Country. and we all become better stewards of our Nations great resources.

Tragically. todays regional crises are having a disproportionately destructive impact on girls. 2015 marks the year with the highest number of displaced persons since World War II. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. women and girls comprise half of any refugee or internally displaced population. Crises such as the ongoing conflict in Syria. over 1.5 million displaced in South Sudan. and the expanding migrant crisis in Europe. among others. risk leaving an entire generation of girls shaped by a lack of opportunity. genderbased violence. forced marriage. and disrupted education. Access to education is often a top priority for refugee families upon resettling in a foreign country. We know that. if empowered with the appropriate tools. girls can be facilitators of change who can transform their own lives. as well as the lives of their families. communities. and societies and serve as a bulwark against the conditions that contribute to extremism that so many terrorist groups have exploited. often at the expense of women and girls. The lack of access to education for refugee girls stifles empowerment and stands in the way of achieving a durable solution to conflict. As the United States and the international community work to cope with the current refugee crisis. it is critical that we focus not only on security but on the basic needs of refugees. such as access to education and increasing the role of women and girls in humanitarian response and civil society programs.",

Chartered November 10. 1940. the post was named in honor of Levi Douthit. a WWI veteran. As a member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. I understand the importance of acknowledging the bravery and valor of the men and women who fought in defense of our country. as well as those who continue to serve. Men like Levi Douthit and members of VFW Post 1674 set their personal lives aside to fight for our country. This post recognizes the service. sacrifice. and courage of fellow veterans and continues to offer aid and assistance to those who served our Nation in uniform. As participants in the Buddy Poppy Program. members support the veterans relief fund. They serve veterans in and around Siloam Springs who need help with daily basic needs and transportation to VA health centers for medical treatments. Members continue their dedication to the community. offering scholarships to students. teaching flag etiquette. and. as partners with Kind at Heart Ministries of Siloam Springs. helping build wheelchair ramps for veterans. The importance of Post 1674 to the community was apparent when more than a decade ago a lack of membership and financial troubles nearly forced its closure. Businessmen helped raise support in the community and kept its doors open. I congratulate VFW Post 1674 on its 75th anniversary. I wish Commander Frank Lee and the 163 members who served in U.S. engagements since WWII the best of luck and many more years of camaraderie. service. and investment in the community.*",

Each morning. he arrives before the crack of dawn. preparing fascinating demos and labs to truly engage his students. Nobody can escape his notoriously difficult AP Chemistry course without a firm comprehension and appreciation for the chemical world. even if he has to blow stuff upin the name of scienceto get his students attention. Every day. his students are challenged in new ways to approach unfamiliar problems and create solutions based on scientific processes. Whether it is titration. qualitative analysis. spectrophotometry. or chromatography. he finds a way to make each laboratory experiment challenging and captivating. Away from the classroom. Mr. Guardino demonstrates his passion for SCUBA by acting as a volunteer diver at the Monterey Bay Aquarium for over 30 years. teaching the ecology and chemistry of kelp forests from inside the aquariums massive tanks. Granting his students an incredible opportunity. he arranged a tour of Ed Ricketts lab. part of the inspiration for \"Cannery Row\". This allowed them to hear rich firsthand experiences of Steinbeck and \"Doc\" recounted by the 96yearold Frank Wright. Mr. Guardino cares deeply for each of his students. giving his best efforts to teach and expecting their best efforts to learn. Giving untold hours of his personal time. Mr. Guardino personally helped Ethan Millera student bedridden for months due to a severe illnesslearn the massive amounts of chemistry covered during his absence from school. Coming to school over the weekends and even on Thanksgiving. he ensured that Ethan understood the material. His tireless work paid off: Ethan completed AP Chemistry with an A both semesters and scored highly on the AP exam. earning college credit. Mr. Speaker.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. Mr. Speaker. we have spent considerable time debating the merits of TPA in this body. I want to bring us back to the fundamentals of this debate. I want to talk about why trade is so important to our economy. why trade is a conservative cause. and why trade is so vital to our Nation. Simply put. free trade empowers the individual to make decisions in his or her best interest without undue government influence. Look around at your house or at your car. Without question. there are imported products. Free trade allows you. as an individual. to make the best economic choice for your family. When economic enterprise is free from unnecessary government interference and all enterprise is treated equally. the most competitive actors will rise to the top. That means higher quality products and lower prices. which translates to improved standards of living and economic growth. Opponents of free trade will say we need protectionist measures to maintain certain industries. but that is a flawed argument. Protectionist measures may benefit a few in select industries. but ultimately protectionism is more harmful to the Nations economic health. Protected industries become inefficient. Consumers are denied choice. and American businesses face retaliatory trade measures overseas. Bottom line. protectionism is an abandonment of the free market in favor of government intervention. I believe that when American businesses and entrepreneurs are placed on an equal playing field. when we eliminate tariffs and protectionist barriers at home and abroad. American businesses can compete and win against any of their foreign competitors. The famed economist Milton Friedman said: Free trade ultimately forces competitors to put up or shut up. Mr. Speaker. let us set the table for free trade. Let us pass TPA. I know American businesses will put up.",

We have jobs. economic growth. and increased exports because of trade. Those benefits and the example of that can be applied to our entire Nation. By passing TPA. Congress will set priorities to ensure that any agreement levels the playing field with our trading partners and creates jobs here at home. Without it. the administration will be setting those priorities. and we. Congress. will have no say and little oversight. In my State. we export coffee. many agricultural products. aircraft. footwear. and software. We export. fully. 30 percent of our apples. 60 percent of our hops. and over 85 percent of our wheat. TPA is about instructing our trade negotiators to reduce the trade barriers that American farmers and manufacturers face so that we can create and sell openly around the world. Right now. our American wines face very stiff tariffs in Japan. but Chilean and Argentinean wines face none. Our beef faces a 38 percent tariff. oranges. 16 percent. TPA will instruct our trade negotiators to work on lowering these tariffs. The reason to vote on TPA and why it is so important is that it will make the deal public and give the American people several months to review any negotiated deal. Without passing this. there is no review period. The deal can stay secret. Some have objected that their voices have not been heard on this matter. but for months. the House Ways and Means Committee and the Rules Committee have considered dozens of amendments to three different traderelated bills. There has been ample time for debate. Mr. Speaker. this rule and the underlying bill are critical to our economy. Without it. our country will continue to face enormous barriers. but with it. we can grow our businesses. create more jobs. and ensure the American economy remains the most competitive and strongest in the world for decades to come.",

Our trading partners are not clamoring for the extrajudicial investor dispute resolution authority. allowing huge corporations to challenge their hardfought consumer protections. worker and environmental laws. et cetera. These are our negotiating positions. We could drop them and that would be welcomed abroad among our trading partners. Countries want the opportunity and the right to protect their food suppliesand that includes us.

The United States can either be in a position where we can write the rules for the future trade agreements and develop closer bilateral ties with our negotiating partners. or we can sit on the sidelines.

We can go to some meetings. we can write some letters. but can we actually legislate? No. Now. the reason that this is a very bad outcome is because the United States Constitution delegates Congress. this body. with the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this bill. H.R. 5210. the Patient Access to Durable Medical Equipment Act. delays the implementation of recent changes to durable medical equipment payments. For the past several years. Medicare has been reforming how we pay for DME. including items like oxygen tanks. walkers. or hospital beds. In much of the country. CMS uses competitive bidding to determine how much DME costs. But in some communities. primarily in rural areas. CMS pays under the DME fee schedule. Under this payment system. there is no competitive market to drive prices down. Nonpartisan. independent experts. including MedPAC and the Government Accountability Office. have warned us that Medicare is overpaying for DME through the fee schedule. To address this problem. CMS has been phasing in new payments that will reduce DME costs under the fee schedule based on competitive bidding pricing. These lower payments are scheduled to be fully phased in by July. Getting DME costs under control is critical. Higher prices result in increased Medicare spending and. even more importantly. they force beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket. At the same time. some DME suppliers and beneficiary groups have expressed concerns that lowering the price for DME too far could hinder beneficiary access to important equipment. To address this issue. the bill before us provides a compromise that will institute a temporary delay of the lower DME fee schedule payments for three months. This pause will allow us to gather more data on how the new payment rates impact beneficiary access. That being said. its not entirely clear that this delay is necessary. CMS has already been carefully monitoring access to DME. Just this month. the agency released data showing that payment cuts have not caused any harm to suppliers or to beneficiaries. Even as we have significantly reduced spending. suppliers continue to accept the reformed payment rates. and there is no evidence that beneficiary access to high quality DME has been hindered. This bill will give us three more months to verify that this is the case. This is only a shortterm freeze. and if the evidence continues to show that the new payment rates are working. there will be no reason for us to delay any longer.",

Mr. Speaker. these days. American small businesses are facing a capital crisis. This is particularly true for earlystage companies and startups. Despite the headlines from Silicon Valley. the truth is that the vast majority of earlystage companies are not securing venture capital funding. Indeed. almost 80 percent of startup investment goes to just three States in these United States. Meanwhile. angel investing for these earlystage companies is challenging. Investing in startup companies is inherently risky. which is why the wealthy investors who qualify to become angels often shy away from it. This is why we need to address the challenges facing angel investing. This is accomplished by changing our mindset and creating a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and growth. while ensuring that shareholder and investor protections remain strong. Ranking Member WATERS and I proposed an amendment that would increase the cap of investors from 100 to 250 for accredited investors of angel funds. and this would only apply to qualifying venture funds narrowly tailored to earlystage investing. What we have before us in the full House is a great work of compromise. and I thank the ranking member. Ms. WATERS. for her diligent work. working with my staff and her staff together over many long hours to come up with this compromise that we have that will. I believe. garner bipartisan support like it did in the Financial Services Committee. I do thank the ranking member for working diligently to make this outcome possible. The result of our proposed amendment and what we have before us allows for earlystage companies to raise the capital they need by opening up angel investing to more accredited investors. This is a good bill. It is a compromise bill. and I am pleased that this legislation enjoyed wide support. I urge my colleagues to support it and vote for it. and lets get this thing done and signed by the President.",

Some have succeeded. but the current system has left millions of people behind with a long road of recovery left to go. Now. the House is not blind to it. and we recognize. like so many others. that an anticompetitive state is depriving us of our ability to prosper. That is why we started the Innovation Initiative and why this bill is so important. Four years ago. Congress came together to pass the JOBS Act. a bill that provided small businesses and entrepreneurs more ways to raise capital investment. Now. this wasnt a bankers bill. It was a bill that opened the door for members of our communities to invest in ideas that could create goodpaying jobs. provide goods and services. and increase the quality of life for the American people in their community. After all. it is small businesses that have created twothirds of all net new jobs since the 1970s. But while small businesses remain the cornerstone of our economy. the Federal Government has made it harder and harder to start one. The entry of new businesses in the United States has declined by nearly 44 percent since the late 1970s. Starting a business has been especially hard in recent years. The policies today. after 71/2 years under President Obama. are not a roadmap for those looking for a better way.",

I am sure there are those who wonder why we on the opposite side of the aisle work so hard to pay attention to our constituents as it relates to investment and why we work so hard to pay attention to our consumers. I will tell you why. Everyone recognizes what happened in 2008 in this country. We literally had a meltdown. We went into a recessionalmost a depression. Why did we do that? We went into a recession and almost a depression because our regulatory agencies were not paying attention and people were being taken advantage of. We had a very difficult time trying to explain to the people of this country why we had so many foreclosures. why people were losing their homes. and why communities were so displaced. But we recognized that our regulatory agencies who had the responsibility for oversight and who had the responsibility for making sure people werent taken advantage of just had not been doing their jobs. I want you to know that with DoddFrank reforms. we have gone a long way to correct that. In addition to looking at our markets and looking at Wall Street. we created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is doing a magnificent job in looking out for our consumers and making sure that what happened that led up to the 2008 meltdown does not happen again in America. So I am very pleased that the Obama administration in the last 75 months has had consecutive job growth. It looks as if it is about 14.5 million privatesector jobs. Of course. when Mr. Obama took over. we know that about 800 jobs per month were being lost. So we dont take our job lightly. and we dont play with this. We want to make sure that there is capital available for startups because we support business and we absolutely support small business. We want to make sure they have access to capital. But what we dont want is we dont want. then. to be tricked or fooled or to be led into socalled opportunities that are really not opportunities at all. Mr. Speaker.

I will say that I agree with the gentlewoman that prior to 2008 and the crisis. the regulators were not doing their jobs. They were not monitoring as they were supposed to be. So true to form to the Washington way of dealing with things at that time. this administration was able to pass through a 2.000page Democraticinspired and -crafted piece of legislation called the DoddFrank legislation2.000 pages and 400 regulations. It did as Washington normally does: give those failed regulators raises. more authority. and bigger and fancier buildings. What was the result of that? Well. some jobs were created since 2008. We have had one of the slowest recoveries on record. As I said before. the most recent jobs report showed that only 38.000 jobs out of 300plus million people in this countrythink about thatwere created during the month of May. That was the worst jobs record since 2010. New business startups in this country are at a 20year low. Think about that if you are waiting to get a new job from a new businessa 20year low. So because of that. because DoddFrank did not fix the problem. because those 2.000 pages and those more highly paid bureaucrats in Washington didnt solve the problem. American families and small businesses are finding it extremely difficult to find credit to expand their businesses and to hire more people. So thank goodness we have this legislation here today and the work by the gentleman from North Carolina not only on this bill. but the previous bill that he was able to accomplish in a bipartisan manner.

Let me just say to Mr. MCHENRY again. I want to thank him for the work that he has done and the leadership that he has provided. He is absolutely correct. whether it is in the cities or in urban areas. we need to have access to capital for our small businesses and our startups. In addition. he has led the way for us to make investing and venture capital. et cetera. more accessible. I think we still have more work to do. One of the things we are going to have to take a very close look at is why our bigger banks and financial institutions are not investing in these communities and why they are not welcoming small businesses in to the banks and to these financial institutions and listen to their dreams and their ideas about businesses and provide the capital for that.

As a founding member and Vice Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and representative of a diverse and vibrant LGBT community in Californias 13th Congressional district. I strongly support this legislation. It is a shame and a disgrace that in 2015. after the LGBT community has made such enormous strides towards equal protections under the law. that we continue to see discriminatory legislation advanced in states like Indiana and Arkansas. At a time when what we truly need is comprehensive legislation to ensure that LGBT individuals are treated and protected. intolerance is sadly being codified in law under the false flag of religious liberties. I am glad that the national reaction to discriminatory RFRA laws was swift and disapproving. from businesses and individuals. to governments and communities. I was proud that the City of Oakland located in my district. banned cityfunded travel to Indiana in the wake of the states discriminatory statute. Now. Congress must respond by sending a strong message that we will not stand for prejudice and smallmindedness. This resolution is a step in the right direction. It outlines the need for LGBT people to receive full protections under the law and urges comprehensive legislation to prohibit discrimination in areas where unequal treatment against LGBT people is still the law of the land. I thank the gentleman from Indiana as well as my fellow colleagues in the LGBT Equality Caucus for introducing this important resolution and urge my colleagues to lend it their support.",

Belmont won the national championship for academics for the second time in three years. Every single player graduates. The teams cumulative grade point average has been above 3.0 for fourteen consecutive seasons. and no Belmont player since 2003 has left the basketball team for any reason other than graduation. Belmonts successes both on and off the court have separated the Bruins from the rest of the pack. Today.

Tom embodied what it meant to live the American Dream. He took a $2.000 investment in 1964 to open a small used car dealership and eventually turned it into one of the largest RV dealerships in America. He owned and operated Tom Raper RVs for 38 more years before selling his dealership empire to David Banes Camping World Company in Not only was Tom a monumental success in the RV business. but he was also known for his huge heart and charitable spirit. After selling his company. Mr. Raper used his time and money to give back to the Richmond community. In 2009. Indiana University East renamed Middlefork Hall to Tom Raper Hall after he bequeathed $2.17 million to the university. Tom donated more than $1 million to Wayne County to build a 5.000seat exhibition building and to make other improvements to the Wayne County Fairgrounds. He also gave $250.000 to the city to transform the gymnasium at the Civil Hall into a modern performing arts center. Most recently. Tom. established a $50.000 endowed scholarship fund at Ivy Tech Community College in Richmond as a means to provide more students with the opportunity to get a college education. It is for selfless contributions like these that the city of Richmond renamed Williamsburg Pike to Williamsburg Pike/Tom Raper Way. I have had the pleasure to meet with Tom several times throughout my life. He was an icon in Richmond and a philanthropic inspiration for any man or woman looking to give back to their community. I will always be grateful for the contributions he has made to improve the great city of Richmond. Indiana. Today. it is my privilege to honor the life of Tom Raper. My thoughts and prayers go out to Toms family and his wife of 46 years. Suzanne. May God comfort those he left behind with His peace and strength.",

And in 2014. the U.S. Department of Justice gave an alarming estimate that as many as 1 in 3 Native American women would be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. a rate 2.5 times higher than for any other group. Unfortunately. only 40 percent of sexual assaults are reported. and if the victim is in college that number is cut in half. according to the Justice Department. Research and information from Pennsylvania State University and a 2010 U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing found that the top reason sexual assault victims do not report the crime is their fear of not being believed and being blamed for the attack. To address this issue. End Violence Against Women International has developed a program titled \"Start By Believing.\" a message that confronts the reality that many victims do not get the support they need when they report the crime. Local governments. private businesses. universities and colleges across the country are participating in the Start By Believing campaign. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. and I encourage people everywhere to share this simple message of support for survivors of sexual assault. E541",

The State Department has known about Castro having Hellfire missiles since June of 2004. Apparently. what is the rush? Cuba continuously engages in military cooperation with our foes and could easily share the missile or its technology with the Russians. Chinese. or North Koreans to be used against our own national security. An exhaustive investigation must be held by Congress.

President Obama laid out these muchneeded steps in the face of Congressional inaction. which will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects countless communities across our nation. In 2014. firearms claimed the lives of more than 33.000 Americans. Over 2.800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of Texas. Perhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read headlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. But until then. our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen background checks. improve mental health services. and keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. This is what President Obama has sought to achieve and I truly believe that this can be done without infringing on lawabiding citizens right to bear arms. There have been numerous critics of President Obamas executive actions to reduce gun violence. However. we can no longer stand by as gun violence claims the lives of more innocent Americans. The President is limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. That is why Congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such violence from happening again. Mr. Speaker. gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in communities all across the United States. It is not a Democratic issue nor is it a Republican issue. It is an issue that affects every American in one form or another. Successfully reducing gun violence in this country will take more than just legislative action from Congress.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday. the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for H.R. 3340. the FSOC Reform Act. and for H.R. 3791. the Raising Consolidated Assets Threshold Under Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. House Resolution 671 provides structured rules for both bills. The resolution provides each bill 1 hour of debate that is equally divided between the chair and the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee. Additionally. the resolution provides for the consideration of one amendment to each bill. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the resolution and the underlying legislation. The DoddFrank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council. which is dedicated to identifying threats to the stability of the American financial system. The FSOC is supported in this mission by the Office of Financial Research. which was also created by DoddFrank. The OFR is armed with subpoena power to compel vast amounts of nonpublic. sensitive information from institutions across the financial system. The OFR feeds this data to the FSOC. which is empowered to designate banks. as well as nonbank institutions. as \"systemically important financial institutions.\" or SIFIs. This designation significantly increases the regulatory burdens that are faced by these institutions. and they have farreaching effects on the entire financial system. The impact of excessive regulation trickles down to customers. resulting in higher borrowing costs that may stop Americans from realizing their dreams of homeownership. of purchasing cars. of pursuing higher education. or other goals. Despite the vast power that the FSOC and OFR have. neither organization is subject to the annual appropriations process. The OFR is funded through assessments on banks. and it pays for the FSOC through these funds. As such. the FSOC is insulated from the transparency and accountability that Congress would give to normal organizations by virtue of this selffunding mechanism. This has. effectively. shielded the FSOC from any congressional oversight.",

Aside from your subcommittee holding a hearing this Thursday at 3. we were advised by the chair that there would be no further business of the Rules Committee. So I assumed. if that is the case. that we wont be going back to the Rules Committee. And I am sure that the budget. if it were to be here by Friday. would require a rule. Despite all of these things. I empiricize the fact that it doesnt appear that we will have a budget by Friday. Mr. Speaker. here is how we got to this point: last fall Republicans and Democrats came together to pass a bipartisan budget agreement. Now. however. Republicans are refusing to support their partys own budget proposal. Now. I understand what my friend said about negotiations going on. and that is good. It would be helpful if those negotiations were going on with Democrats in the room as well. I was very optimistic. as I am sure all of us were and. to a relative degree. still are. when Speaker RYAN promised to end Republican obstructionism and return to regular order. I felt very optimistic about that. It seemed that the nowdubbed donothing Congress is back and. with it. total dysfunction on the Republican side of the aisle. The dysfunction is so bad that Republicans cannot even agree to a budget number that they have already agreed to. Now. Democrats dont want to weaken the financial protections keeping our economy stable and strong. Instead. Democrats are ready to pass a budget that creates and helps create jobs and grow the paychecks of hardworking Americans. We would like to work in a bipartisan way. and we would assuredly like to work in a way that would bring us to the work that is needed to be done in a positive manner. If only the Republican Conference could stand up to the extreme faction in their own party to work with us. then we could get this business done. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Instead of debating and passing a budget. which we are required to do by law by the end of this week. as I have said. the majority has decided that we should spend what precious legislative time we have left debating bills that would roll back vital protections to the systemic health of our financial system. So now not only is the dysfunction in the Republican Conference putting one of this institutions most basic functions in jeopardy. which is passing a budget to fund the government. but. to add insult to injury. the majority has decided now is the best time to debate putting our entire financial system in jeopardy by rolling back measures designed to protect it. I might add that there is an appellate decision that is not on this measure. but on another that we dealt with earlier. I dont understand why we are going forward on these measures when we know. in fact. that they arent going to go anywhere in the other body. Mr. Speaker. in my judgment. the American people deserve better. So since Congress is required to pass a budget by Friday of this week and there is absolutely little sign that the Republican majority intends to fulfill that responsibility. well. Mr. Speaker. I want to give my friends on the other side of the aisle the opportunity to end the obstructionism and meet their and our obligation to pass a budget. Mr. Speaker. if we defeat the previous question.

H.R. 3586 also formally authorizes the DHS Secretarys Border Security Joint Task Forces. which utilize Department component personnel and capabilities. to secure the land and maritime borders of the United States. These tasks were launched in May of 2014 through the Secretarys Southern Border and Approaches Campaign and represents a more collaborative approach to border security missions than we have previously seen. H.R. 3586 also authorizes two programs specifically intended to bolster the Departments ability to identify and prevent threats from entering the United States via commercial aircraftthe Air Cargo Advance Screening pilot and the Immigration Advisory Program. Through these two programs. DHS is able to thoroughly screen and vet cargo and passengers coming to the United States from abroad on commercial airplanes and share information with international partners prior to departure.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as the representative of dozens of border communities in Texas. I take the obligation to stand up for them seriously. Improvements to security are a key portion of this bill. However. I have long maintained that they are not enough and they are not the only part of a successful border strategy. Trade is the lifeblood of many of these communities. Yet. far too often they find themselves relying on ports of entry that are understaffed and out of date. This limits growth and strains the ties of the local communities. In many cases. they want to do more to expand on the Federal resources that currently exist. Publicprivate partnerships are key to enabling this. Let me be clear: port of entry infrastructure is a Federal responsibility. but that doesnt mean that local communities and businesses shouldnt be able to pitch in. Since January 2014. the PublicPrivate Partnership pilot program run through the Customs and Border Protection has made a difference. It has enhanced the ability of CBP to increase resources and decrease wait times at ports of entry. This program provides guidance for reimbursable services and allows CBP to tailor its services to the needs of the stakeholders while meeting the demands associated with decreasing budgets. Both CBP and stakeholders have been exceedingly pleased with the results of this pilot program. Unfortunately. it could come to an end. In an effort to ensure the longevity of this program. language in the bill permanently authorizes portions of the PublicPrivate Partnership program for reimbursable services and donation authority and it establishes a framework to guide its implementation in a responsible manner. Publicprivate partnership authority for CBP is a critical issue for border communities like mine and has proven to be an essential tool to reduce wait times at the border and enhance the security of the homeland. I believe that we can secure our border and facilitate the flow of goods and services at the same time. The publicprivate partnerships that would be codified by this law will ensure just that. I would like to thank Representative MILLER for her leadership on this issue. and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.",

The assessment is to include an analysis of the improvements needed at and between the ports of entry. gaps in law and policy between State. local. and tribal law enforcement and international agreements that hinder border security efforts. the flow of legitimate trade along the southwest border. and the percentage of situational awareness and operational control achieved by DHS in the region.

Members who are listening to this debate should know already. which is that the Republican budget does not balance. not by a long shot. It assumes the revenue from the Affordable Care Act even though they claim to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It doesnt account for the costs of additional tax cuts that are coming through this House as we speak. and. if the revenue from that were lost. their budget would be even further out of balance. In fact. just today. in the Ways and Means Committee. they are increasing the deficit by over $250 billion over 10 years by giving a huge tax cut to 5.500 families in getting rid of the estate tax. Now. everyone should understand that the estate tax only applies to couples with estates worth over $10 million. They are saying that people with estates worth $10 million. who have done really well. shouldnt contribute anything toward investments in our country. even toward deficit reduction. That increases the deficit right away and puts their budget even more out of balance. so this doesnt come close to balancing. While it is actually cutting special interest tax breaks for folks at the very high end of the income scale. it actually disinvests in the rest of the country. They dramatically cut the portion of our budget that we use to invest in our kids futures. in early education. in kindergarten through grade They make it harder for students to afford college. They say they are going to start charging students interest while they are still in college. even though we have record student debt of over $1 trillion in this country. They make it harder on seniors right away. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. seniors on Medicare. seniors will pay more in copays for preventive care. If they really got rid of the Affordable Care entirely. seniors would also be paying higher part B premiums. That is what they say they want to do. get rid of it entirely.

I would be concerned about his statements if I believed for one second that the other side thought that getting to balance was even important. The fact of the matter is that they dont. In fact. their budget never. ever. ever gets to balance. nor does the Presidents. So the crocodile tears that I see on the other side about us allegedly not getting to balance just is absolutely not credible. And what we request of Federal employees is that they be treated exactly like folks in the private sector. That is what the American people think is fair. appropriate treatment for all Americans. not favorite treatment. not picking winners and losers. like the other side enjoys doing. I am so proud now to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas . who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. a gentleman with whom I have worked closely over these last 10 or 11 weeks on this budget and for whom I have the utmost respect for his positive contributions to our Conference and to our Nation.",

Or is it a budget that subscribes to trickledown economics of the Republican Party. which have never been successful for Americas hardworking families?

He retires this September. after 38 years of distinguished service to the House of Representatives. In 1978. Kevin left Omaha with former Congressman John Cavanaugh. with whom he remains friends to this day. and shortly thereafter joined the Clerks Office. where he has worked in the Tally section for the past 37 years29 as an Assistant Tally Clerk and the last 8 as a Tally Clerk. Kevin is a workhorse. not a show horse. His depth of parliamentary and institutional knowledge is matched only by his love of this institution. He has played a pivotal role in making the process operate smoothly. and his knowledge and guidance will be deeply missed. While Kevins upcoming retirement is a big loss for his colleagues and the House. we wish him and his lovely wife. Peggi. nothing but the best in their next chapter of life. I am pretty sure most of that chapter will be written on the golf course. With that. I wish them long drives and birdie putts. I might also add that Kevin and I played rugby at Creighton University a few years ago. Thank you. Kevin. for your outstanding service and for being a remarkable example to your colleagues of what serving this institution is all about.",

The Internet has the power to revolutionize the agriculture sector. and North Country farmers have shared with me various ways that increased broadband access could provide them with opportunities for innovation and improved agribusiness. For instance. a dairy farmer from Potsdam who spoke with my office uses broadband to automate feeding plans for his cows. To support our North Country farmers. I will be introducing the Precision Farming Act of 2016. This legislation will encourage the construction of rural broadband connections to farms by allowing providers to receive reimbursements for the costs related to construction. Furthermore. this legislation would put our Nations farmers first by prioritizing their loan applications for additional construction. To compete in a 21st century economy. our farmers must have access to broadband technology. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

My people. everybodys people. the American people want gun reform. My Republican colleagues are blocking the vote. But we need to have a voice. No more silence. Stop blaming mental health issues for mass shootings. The fact is. more often they are the victims rather than the perpetrators. Anger. hate. and racism are the main causes of mass shootings. Reducing the mental health stigma would save lives. as twothirds of gun deaths are suicides. I encourage those who need help. to seek help. reduce selfharm. and learn the signs of mental illness. We need to focus on prevention and training. especially of police and the public. on mental health. not more guns. We need to educate youth on how to peacefully resolve problems by conflict resolution and anger management. We must change the culture of violence. Violent images are too common in media. entertainment. and video games. Learn to have less hatred. more tolerance. and focus on what unites us.

President Obama and his administration have taken a position in 175 cases before the Supreme Court. but the President has only won 79 of those cases. That comes out to just about 45 percent. Indeed. over the course of his Presidency. the Obama administration argued 44 cases before the Supreme Court where their position failed to get a single vote. Not even the people the President appointed to the Court agree with his position. This number stands in stark contrast to the results from President George W. Bush. who won over 60 percent of his cases before the Court. and Bill Clinton. who won 63 percent of his cases. Most of the cases President Obama has lost have only one thing in common: the Presidents view that Federal power is virtually unlimited. Under this President. citizens must submit their liberty and freedom to whatever the government experts determine is best. The administration believes they can operate above or around the law. Madam Speaker. the Presidents record in front of the Court is a disturbing trend and something that should alarm every single American.",

I rise to talk about an issue that has affected my community in San Bernardino very personally and continues to impact our neighborhoods on almost a daily basis: gun violence. Over the past several weeks. Americans have stood together to demand action on commonsense measures to reduce gun violence. My office has dealt with full voice mails. flooded social media sites. and received countless letters asking for these commonsense reforms. The message is the same: Background checks are basic measures that will make our communities safer while respecting the Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners. And if you are too dangerous to fly on a plane. you are too dangerous to buy a gun. Madam Speaker. these measures are not controversial. Keeping guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists and criminals are basic measures where both Democrats and Republicans should be able to find common ground. I ask that this Chamber remain in session until we vote on this legislation. By foregoing bipartisan legislation to end gun violencebills our constituents are demanding us to considerHouse Republicans are playing favor to special interests. We owe the American people a vote. If we are too scared in this body to vote on these commonsense measures out of loyalty to our special interest groups instead of our own constituents. then we need to reflect on our roles here.",

I introduce the District of Columbia Federal Officials Residency Requirement Equality Act of 2015. a bill that would amend federal law to require certain officials who serve D.C. to actually live within its boundaries. In nearly every other jurisdiction in the United States. federal district court judges. U.S. Attorneys. and U.S. Marshals are required by federal law to reside within the jurisdictions where they have been appointedbut these same officials appointed to serve the people of the District are not bound by these same requirements. The only other jurisdictions where these officials are not required to live within their appointed jurisdictions are the Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of New York. However. this is because New York City is the only city in the country that is divided between two federal districtsbut the District is not similarly situated. My bill would put D.C. on equal footing with almost every other jurisdiction by ensuring that our Marshals. judges. and U.S. attorney live among the residents they have been appointed to represent. Clearly. the idea that these federal officials ought to live in the jurisdictions they serve is a significant onewhich is why the residency requirement for other jurisdictions is enshrined in federal law. Yet. D.C. was exempt from this requirement based on the nowoutdated notion that the District is too congested and small to house these appointed officials. The District of Columbia is a vibrant and bustling city with a diverse populace who deserve direct engagement on the part of its federal judges. U.S. attorney. and Marshals. My bill recognizes the fact that D.C. deserves the same type of community involvement by these federal officials as nearly every jurisdiction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

Our Bearkats are celebrating 100 seasons of hard fought contests on the college football gridiron. What happens at Elliot T.

On October 6. 1912 the team from Sam Houston Teachers College faced off against a \"pugnacious\". as one observer remarked. Rice Institute to begin the inaugural season of Sam Houston football. Since then. football has been a continuous sport at Sam Houston. except for the war years1918. during World War I. and 1943. 1944 and 1945. during World War II. The inaugural season saw Sam Houston end with an even 22 record. That first team was comprised of just 19 students with the average player weighing in at just 135 pounds. Their leather helmets cost $3 each and fullypadded pants of heavy canvas were $12. Today. the Bearkat squad has 100 players with an average weight of over 200 pounds. And it cost about $800 to outfit each player for game day. This years \"Century Season\" brings with it a legacy of big rivalries and even bigger accomplishments. In October. Sam Houston State returned home victorious over Stephen F. Austin State University in the 90th edition of the Battle of the Piney Woods. This timeless rivalry between the Bearkats and the Lumberjacks began in 1923 and is one of the three oldest continuous rivalries in Texas college football. Sam Houston has competed and won championships in four different leagues: the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Lone Star Conference. Gulf Star Conference and Southland Conference. The team played its first bowl game. the Shrimp Bowl. in 1952. In 1964. our Bearkats were National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) CoNational Champions.

Care of family is a powerful expression of our humanity. and Britnee has provided us a touching example through the care of her father and her son. She stepped up to answer the noble calling to serve as the caretaker for her father. Percy Sr.. who is a ninety year old World War II veteran. Caring for a family member can be a very rewarding experience. but it can also be a very challenging one. This challenge is only magnified when a loved one is diagnosed with Alzheimers. a devastating disease which strips individuals of their memory and lives. all while placing an exhausting amount of stress on their caretakers. Nevertheless Britnee has persevered in her love and care for her father. and has faithfully devoted her time and resources. However she is more than her fathers caregiver. as she also is a dedicated mom to her spirited two year old son. Britnee is a hero both to her father and her son. an example of courage. and a role model of selfless dedication. Thank you.

As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Military Construction. Veterans Affairs. and Related Agencies and the cochair of the Military Family Caucus. I strongly support efforts to ensure veterans have access to opportunities needed to become successful in the workforce. Simply. H.R. 1694 makes veterans compete against women- and minorityowned small businesses for an already small goal of ten percent of federal highway and transit construction contracts. While I agree with the sponsors stated goal of helping veterans and veteranowned businesses. I do not believe that the best way to do so is by legally undermining the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. Instead. we should help both veterans and disadvantaged businesses succeed. That is why I joined Representatives CUMMINGS. NORTON. BROWN. and BUSTOS in sponsoring H.R. 3997. which would create a Veteranowned Business Enterprise (VBE) program within the Department of Transportation with a stated national goal of ensuring at least 10 percent of federal highway contracts go to veteranowned small businesses. Instead. creating a specific and separate contracting goal for veteranowned businesses is a better way to maximize assistance to veterans. as opposed to forcing competition between these two constituencies. both of whom continue to suffer through disproportionately high unemployment rates. I urge my colleagues to help veteranowned businesses compete for Department of Transportation contracts without harming the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program by supporting H.R. 3997 and not H.R. 1694.

I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this great organization for its contributions to the Sacramento region. The Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund (NCRF) is a nonprofit and federallycertified community development financial institution (CDFI). NCRF provides capital and technical assistance to organizations working to revitalize lowincome neighborhoods and provide housing. services. and jobs to underserved people throughout the United States. Through creative. flexible financing and investments. NCRF makes capital available to community- and faithbased nonprofits. as well as missionbased forprofit organizations. that otherwise might be unable to obtain needed capital. NCRF was founded by Nehemiah Corporation of America. which provided the startup capital that enabled NCRF to begin making loans and investments. In addition to its community development loan fluid. NCRF also developed the Nehemiah Sacramento Valley Fund. a triple bottomline. real estate equity fund. to bring marketrate capital into lowincome neighborhoods in the six county Sacramento region. In 2010. NCRF launched the Neighborhood Restoration Program in response to the foreclosure crisis. The mission of this program is to advance community revitalization by providing homeownership opportunities for lowand moderateincome families. Building on Nehemiahs long history of encouraging and facilitating responsible homeownership. Nehemiah acquires properties located in communities that are affordable to low- and moderateincome homebuyers. Once acquired. each house is renovated to exceed Federal Housing Administration lending standards. and marketed for sale exclusively to first time homebuyers and low- to moderateincome households. In 2012. Nehemiah created Roofs for Troops to benefit the men and women who serve and have served our country. Through Roofs for Troops. financial institutions donate foreclosed properties to NCRF. Properties are renovated to exceed Veterans Administration lending standards and are marketed for sale exclusively to veterans and active duty military. A percentage of properties NCRF receives and renovates are donated 100 percent mortgage free to deserving veteran and active duty military families. In total. the Nehemiah Community Reinvestment Fund has created 500 affordable homeownership opportunities through its Neighborhood Restoration and Roofs for Troops Programs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce my legislation. the Port of Benton Restriction Release Act of 2016. This legislation will lift the conveyance restrictions on a 71.5 acre parcel of land that was deeded to the Port of Benton (Port) in 1996 by the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD). The Port acquired this parcel of land as part of an effort to transfer excess and unneeded land from the \"Former 3000 Area\" of the Hanford nuclear reservation. located in the TriCities region of Central Washington. back to the local communities. Recently. the Port has explored economic development opportunities on this parcel. however the existing conveyance restrictions have inhibited their ability to develop the land for the economic benefit of the TriCities region. In recent years. there has been an increase in economic activity near this property. including over $70 million in investments. the creation of the Manhattan Project National Historic Park in 2014. and the transfer of 1.641 acres of Hanford land back to the local communities for further economic and industrial development. The Port of Benton has targeted uses for this land that include clean energy manufacturing. bio products. solar array. and industrial operations. which could yield investments of $1 billion for the local communities and the creation of 1.500 jobs for the region. However. the conveyance restrictions on this property have inhibited the Ports ability to attract private and small businesses to make investments in the Former Hanford 3000 Area. These restrictions require that all subleases over five years on the property be submitted to MARAD for approval. Additionally. the Port is required to submit annual reports to MARAD for the parcel. This important legislation will release all remaining federal deed restrictions on the 71.5 acre property. which will allow the Port of Benton and the surrounding communities to continue their hard work to create jobs. stimulate economic growth. and retain a skilled workforce in the area. and this parcel of land is a critical component of this effort. For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. which will have a positive and lasting impact on the economic viability and competitiveness of the TriCities region.",

With her usual precision. she has identified the big problem. and she approached it as she usually doesin a very direct way. The picture she presents is not one we can tolerate in the United States of America. The good news is. we have done a good job on discretionary spending. That is what we are working on in these bills. The chart I showed last week. which shows about the same things in a little different way than hers. points out that the spending in 12 appropriations bills has been flat and will be flat for the next 10 years. In other words. if the work the Appropriations Committee is doing on $1 trillion were all that there was to the Federal budget. we would not have a Federal debt problem. That blue line is Federal spending under control. We set priorities. We have oversight. Senator FEINSTEIN and I have eliminated programs. We do that every year. We are getting control of this budget of big cost overruns that persistently happened on large construction projects. So I am proud of that blue line. I am not proud of the red one. That is the one Senator FEINSTEIN is talking about. This is $1 trillion. but on top of that is $3 trillion. That is the automatic spending. There has been very little courage shown on the Republican side of the aisle or on the Democratic side of the aisle. We make big speeches sometimes about the blue line. which isnt a problem. but very few speeches about the red line that are as straightforward as Senator FEINSTEINs remarks today. We have a responsibility to taxpayers. to ourselves. and to the next generation to deal with this line because that is the line which is causing the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say that our Federal debt is our biggest national security problem. which is quite a thing to say in a world as unsafe as we have today.

    "speech": "Mr. President. on one final matter. I want to take a minute to say something about an amendment yesterday that would have defunded regional commissions such as the Appalachian Regional Commission. or ARC. While I did not support that effort. it did raise some important questions about the direction of ARC. I have been a long supporter of the Appalachian Regional Commission. the only government agency whose main purpose is to help poor and disadvantaged communities in the Appalachian region. However. I am deeply concerned that after 50 years. ARCs focus has become clouded. For instance. ARCs internal guidelines cap at 30 percent the amount of area development funds that can be used in the most impoverished areas of Appalachia. It seems utterly illogical to me that at a government agency. whose mission should be to alleviate poverty. 70 percent of the funds go to counties that are not among the poorest. What does ARC stand for if not to help the poorest areas of Appalachia? Is ARC a specialized agency with a coherent mission or is it just another Federal bureaucracy that simply allocates funds among 13 selected States regardless of the need? I hope the vote last night will serve as a wakeup call for management at the ARCa wakeup call that it is time for the agency to reform itself and focus on the counties that most need assistance.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wanted to quickly take a moment to speak about the vehicle program from two sides. When I authored this legislation back in 2007. we began to see fuel economy standards increase in the United States. Part of our focus at that time was to keep jobs in America and make sure we had lowcost financing available for companies. such as retool plants. so that smaller. fuelefficient vehicles would be made in the United States rather than have those jobs shipped overseas. We saw that with the initial loan made to Ford Motor Company. They were able to bring jobs back from Mexico and also focus on electric vehicles. As we fast forward to today. we are looking at fuel economy for trucks and larger vehicles. A loan was recently made to Alcoa. They are focused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight trucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. There are positives. but there are also areas under this loan program that have not been successful. I come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to consider the Coats amendment. which will completely eliminate this program. my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a carefully crafted bipartisan compromise with Senator INHOFE. Senator PORTMAN. and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to deal with lead in water that will not only help 100.000 people in the city of Flint. but it will also help people in Jackson. MS. Cleveland. OH. and other States across the country. Our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds for critical water infrastructure needs. We strongly oppose pulling the rug out from under not only Flint but also Jackson. MS. Cleveland. OH. and communities across the country that are counting on us to come together and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address critical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning issues. I ask colleagues to vote no on the Coats amendment and allow us to phase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this investment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs across the country.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I want to say a few words. The junior Senator from California has been speaking in opposition to the waters of the United States amendment sponsored by Senator HOEVEN. I just want to put before the body a little bit of the history. In 2006 the Supreme Court introduced real uncertainty regarding which wetlands and water bodies were subject to Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Since 2006 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction and address the Supreme Courts ruling. EPA and the Army Corps just finalized the new rule last May. This new rule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating which types of water bodies are subject to Federal jurisdiction and which are not. It will make Federal permitting easier. faster. and less costly for business and industry. It maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and agricultural discharges. such as irrigation return flow and storm water runoff. Nevertheless. the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay suspending implementation of the rule. I strongly believe we should let the courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its interpretation of congressional statute. just like the Constitution calls for. The President has threatened to veto the entire Energy and Water appropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. Right now. we have the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a standalone piece of legislation and get the Senate appropriations process working again. So I am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the Senate defeat the Hoeven amendment. Thank you very much. Mr. President.",

There were five separate national hearings held in Washington with people from all over the country. This is a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work that has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community but of the law enforcement community and many others. Senator PORTMAN has been very diligent about coming to the floor to press for action from the House of Representatives.

Many of the crises we hear about in Indian Country come from lack of opportunity. lack of hope. Indian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups in the United States. Suicide is the secondleading cause of death for Native youth aged 15 to 24. The Indian suicide rate is 62 percent higher than it is for the general population. Unemployment on Indian reservations averages 19 percent. and on some reservations it is above 50 percent. Senators MURKOWSKI.

Chairman BARRASSO also understands the needs of Indian Country. and that is why he also supports this amendment. They understand that we have to support economic development for tribes whenever we can. My amendment sets aside $9 million. which can be leveraged into about $50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in Indian Country. Developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring power to the most remote parts of Indian Countryimproving access to reliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. That is why Congress authorized the loan program in the Energy Policy Act of 2005to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. But this program has never received funding. My amendment doesnt cost anything. We are simply putting $9 million of alreadyappropriated money toward a new use. I thank Senators HEITKAMP. UDALL. and MURKOWSKI for cosponsoring my amendment.

This year National Park Week is particularly important because it also happens to be the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. a milestone we will celebrate all year long. For those of you who dont know. our National Park System began in 1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. The organization charged with managing these parks. the National Park Service. was established four decades later in 1916. Today we have over 400 national parks and historic sites around the country. all full of wildlife. beautiful landscapes. and rich culture. These sites are all cared for by over 20.000 dedicated employees of the National Park Service. including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors safe. Arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic sites. some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country. in my opinion. For those of you who have not been to Arkansas. I encourage you to visit Hot Springs National Park to see our natural springs and thermal pools. If you are a history buff. you can visit Arkansas Post. the site of the only Revolutionary War activity in the State of Arkansas. If you are into the outdoors. you can float the Buffalo River. The list goes on. Each of the national parks and historic sites in Arkansas and around the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own adventure. So happy National Park Week and happy 100th birthday to the National Park Service. I encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission to all national parks in Arkansas and across the country through this Sunday. April 24.

In addition. they have won an injunction so that the President cannot do the very things my friends are concerned about that he wants to do. So we not only have the court. at least to this point. on our side. but we have it in a venue where you actually can win in the end. We are not likely to be able to do that in the Congress. given the Democratic control of the filibuster in the other body and the Presidential veto at the end of the process. In the courts. you can actually win. It is a constitutional issue. It ought to be settled constitutionally through a judicial process. Since we have stopped the President. since we are prevailing in court. it seems to me the logical thing to do is what the gentleman from Pennsylvania",

So I think the important thing to do now is to find out. why arent we able to do anything?

That is wrong. And those are the people who are preventing the country from moving forward. Beyond that. to the extent those seven Senate Democrats continue to want to abuse the rules. it is incumbent upon our conservative Republican colleagues in the Senate to change the rules. Conservative Republicans. Mr. Speaker. who have been very quick to try to tell the House what to do should now be over there right now making the case that if the Senate Democrats are going to use a rule to undermine the Constitution. then the rule needs to change.",

CMC is celebrating its 100th anniversary of business this year. This company started out in Dallas. Texas as a single operation in 1915 by a Russian immigrant named Moses Feldman. What began as a local recycling business grew into one of the top domestic steel manufacturers. fabricators and metals recyclers. CMC today is a Fortune 500 global metals company with operations in more than 20 countries with almost 200 facilities. It is an honor to have such a successful homegrown business in my district. This impressive company wasnt always so prosperous and fortunate. like many businesses. there were lean times and great difficulties it had come in contact with. The stock market crash of 1929 slowed down CMCs plan for growth as it did the rest of the nation. but by the 1930s it was ready again to thrive. E502 The company clawed out of the economic hard times before exporting scrap iron to international markets. CMC also contributed hard work and necessary services to Americas war effort during WWII. As Americans were instructed to take all scrap metal to be recycled for guns. tanks and ships. CMC used this as a means of helping and becoming part of the massive surge in manufacturing and producing on behalf of the war effort. Structural Metals Inc. (SMI) played a significant part in CMCs success by aiding its domestic presence. SMI was founded in Seguin. Texas and was a building block for CMCs domestic steel manufacturing operations. CMC became the first secondary metals company to be listed on a major stock exchange in 1960. In 1963 CMC obtained a stake in SMI and entered into steel manufacturing. In the 1970s and 1980s CMC added several other aspects of the steel industry to its already impressive resume. With such expansion and growth CMC became a Fortune 500 company and never looked back.

A similar bill passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously last year and passed the House of Representatives unanimously on December 8. 2009. I thank my good friend and colleague Congressman MATT SALMON. the Chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. for being the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation. With $15.7 billion spent on counternarcotics programs in Latin America and the Caribbean between 1980 and 2012. it is important to take stock of what has worked. what has not worked and what future U.S. drug policy should look like. This independent commission will be required to submit recommendations on future U.S. drug policy to Congress. the Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy 12 months after its first meeting. The time to examine U.S. drug policy is long overdue. While billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have been spent over the years to fight the drug trade. illegal drug use in the United States remains high. In 2013. there were an estimated 24.573.000 illicit drug users in the United States. In particular. I am concerned by the dramatic increase in heroin use in our country. Attorney General Eric Holder has noted that heroin overdose deaths in the United States increased by an alarming 45 percent between 2006 and 2010. On the supply side. nearly all cocaine consumed in the United States originates in South America while most of the heroin consumed here is from Colombia and Mexico. In addition. Central America and the Caribbean are key transit regions for drugs entering the United States. To tackle our nations horrific drug problem once and for all. we must have a better sense of what works and what does not work. Our partners in the Americas. who have worked closely with us in fighting drug trafficking for years. and the citizens of our great country. who deal every day with illegal drugs on their streets. deserve no less.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to honor the Gas Technology Institute. GTI. and its dedicated employees as they celebrate their 75th anniversary. Headquartered in Des Plaines. IL. GTI is a leading nonprofit research development organization in my home State. working diligently to address key global energy and environmental challenges. A proven leader over the past threequarters of a century. GTI continues to develop highimpact technologies. unlocking the economic potential of domestic energy resources. while reducing the environmental footprint of fossil fuels. Founded as the Institute of Gas Technology in 1941. the institute worked closely with the Illinois Institute of Technology to train graduate engineers to lead the development of the gas industry. As national focus shifted to gas research and development in the 1970s. the Gas Research Institute took shape to focus on natural gas supply. transportation. distribution. and utilization. In 2000. these two renowned programs united under the GTI umbrella where they continue to build off of past successes as a premier research. development. and training organization serving the global natural gas and energy markets. GTIs most profound successes are known across the globe. From catalyzing the U.S. shale gas revolution through innovative research and development in the 1980s and 1990s. to helping to put the first hydrogen fuel cell bus on the road in 2006. to its 65 patents on highefficiency. lowNOx burners and systems. GTI has a strong industry reputation for innovation and conducting the work necessary to ensure our domestic supplies are utilized to their full potential while national and global priorities continue to shift. Our Nation continues to benefit from GTIs expertise in developing gas distribution technologies and reducing energy delivery costs. as well as innovations in the detection. quantification. and mitigation of methane emissions from the natural gas sector. Its current efforts with the hydraulic fracturing test site will continue this tradition. improving air and water quality by increasing environmentally sustainable extraction methods. I congratulate and commend GTI for their continued commitment to providing technology -based solutions that expand U.S. energy production and foster economic growth. while also minimizing impacts to the environment. GTIs efforts in the past. present. and future are key to boosting American competitiveness. and I look forward to celebrating future milestones.*",

    "speech": "Mr. President. 150 years ago. as the United States and the world advanced out of the industrial revolution. several young businessmen formed the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company. HSB. in Hartford. CT. I am proud to represent this company and want to congratulate HSB on its 150th anniversary for its vital contribution to the economy of Connecticut. as well as the rest of the Nation. During the industrial revolution in the midtolate 19th century. steam boilers were used to drive industrial machinery. locomotives. and steamboats. Steampowered engines allowed for the rapid growth and expansion of industry in the United States. these engines enabled the effective transportation of goods across the country. Steam power also permitted factories in Connecticut to produce and market goods more efficiently than ever before. The tremendous benefits provided by steam engines and boilers. however. came with considerable risks. During the 1850s. boiler explosions occurred at an estimated rate of once every 4 days. Believing that better materials. better design. and regular inspections could reduce the number of dangerous boiler explosions. in 1857. several Hartford entrepreneurs started \"the Polytechnic Club.\" as a means to discuss practical changes to boilers that could mitigate the chances of worker injury and death. These discussions helped lead to the formation of HSB. The Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company was officially founded in 1866 on the premise that quality boiler inspections would enhance industrial safety. and that insurance provides a valuable financial incentive to ensure businesses conduct these inspections. From its founding. HSBs primary goals have been to improve safety and prevent losses for industrial businesses. Today HSB continues to set the standard for equipment breakdown insurance. as well as a variety of other insurance products. I am proud to honor this companys long and distinguished role in Americas industrial economy. Congratulations to the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company. and best of luck in the years to come.*",

I am pleased to have worked with Senator CANTWELL and Senator SCHUMER to introduce the SANDy Act today which would provide much needed certainty and resiliency to our communications networks during times of natural disaster or emergency. Severe weather and emergencies can have devastating effects on communities. as New Jersey knows all too well. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. we experienced loss in our communications networks including phone and Internet services. Natural disasters are one of the most important times to maintain access to 911 in order to obtain lifesaving services. Just this week. this legislation passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support. including from the New Jersey delegation led by Congressman PALLONEs efforts. I hope the Senate will now turn its attention to this important matter and move this initiative forward to the benefit of New Jerseyans and people across the country. I am further pleased that phone service providers entered into a voluntary agreement last month in order to provide service to consumers during times of emergency. regardless of the network the consumer subscribes to in that area. The SANDy Act expresses the Sense of Congress that this agreement should continue to be adhered to in order to best serve 911 professionals. first responders. and local governments in accessing communications services during times of emergency. Further. the legislation collects additional data on network security during times of disaster and the resiliency of telecommunications networks power utility during times of emergency. With additional information and data. we can better prepare for disasters and ensure our networks operate at the best of their ability when severe storms strike. Finally. the legislation provides authority to FEMA to reimburse costs associated with restoring and repairing critical communications services to first responders and communities. The SANDy Act is an important step toward better protecting and preserving vital communications networks when disaster strikes. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. By Mr. DAINES:",

Now. any engineer will tell you that these are sitespecific decisions that are based on many factors and that the thickness will vary. depending on where the well is drilled.

These existing air pollution rules have been in place since 1988. and it is past time that we moved forward with new pollution standards. new modeling. and new technology. The proposed rule. in this case. seeks to address the emissions of several very harmful air pollutants. including volatile organic compounds. nitrogen oxides. sulfur oxides. carbon monoxide. and particulate matter.

Actually. in some cases. it reduces regulatory burdens by eliminating redundant reporting requirements and by allowing operators to use emissions credits. The residents of the Arctic and other oilproducing regions and the workers in the industry shouldnt be subjected to additional air pollution from oil and gas development simply because of where they live and work.

From the way we heat our homes in the winter to the way that we choose our health care. this administration knows no bounds in its regulatory overreach. The EPA leads the way on this front. According to a report that was released by the American Action Forum. the EPA now imposes nearly 200 million hours of paperwork to comply with its regulations. This is the equivalent of 95.000 Americans working fulltime for a year. This represents an astonishing 23 percent increase from 2009 and a 34 percent increase since 2002 in the EPAs paperwork burden. New regulations. such as the Clean Power Plan. waters of the United States. and the ozone rule. all contribute to this growing burden. Yet. this burden isnt limited to just the act of doing paperwork. These regulations raise the price of energy. cost Missourians jobs. and hurt their bottom lines. The EPA uses the Air. Climate and Energy. ACE. program to advance research and regulations that are geared toward a climate change agenda. Regulations to address climate change are costing Americans billions with there being very little actual impact on global temperatures to show for it. The result of ACE research furthers regulations. which burden our Nations energy sector and communities across the country.

As my colleague has said. this would reduce the funds from EPA operations by $14 million and increase the Inspector General by $10 million. I think we would certainly agree that it would be a good idea to increase the funding for the Inspector General. and we would like to see the other side increase those funds. But we are uncomfortable with the idea of taking the funding from the operating account. This account has already been cut by $92 million. and it would reduce the operating account by $14 million. putting that money over there. This seems like too severe of a cut on top of what has already been done. We dont disagree that the work of the Inspectors General across all agencies in Federal Government are necessary and very important and they do good work. So. once again. I just oppose the shift in funding. I think it would be great if the other side wanted to enhance the funding for the Office of Inspector General. just not through this mechanism.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce legislation that will authorize the sitting President or his successors to use the armed forces of the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. On July 14. 2015. a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) designed to ensure that Irans nuclear program is used solely for peaceful purposes was finalized. With history as our guide. any agreement with the Iranian government must be met with skepticism. and therefore. backed up with muscularitymy legislation provides this muscularity. Indeed. the importance of an international framework that actually prohibits Iran from ever becoming a nuclear weapons state cannot be overstated. As Ranking Democratic Member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and the only American to have served as President of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europes (OSCE PA) Parliamentary Assembly. as well as a former member of both the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Committee on Foreign Affairs. I am acutely aware of the challenges in dealing with Irans nuclear program. Irans pursuit of a nuclear weapon at any time is a threat to the United States as well as our allies in the region. and its questionable sincerity in forgoing the procurement of such weapons has created legitimate cause for concern in the past and must. therefore. inform how we proceed today and in the future. It is my sincere hope that my legislation will provide the added hard power necessary to deter Iran from continued efforts to obtain nuclear weapons. including skirting compliance with the JCPOA. if implemented. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will send a clear message to the Iranian regime that the United States is willing to ensure that Iran never becomes a nuclear weapons state at any cost.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor Shiloh Church located in Oakland. California upon its 50th Anniversary as a strong religious pillar in the East Bay community. Shiloh Church was founded in 1965 by Dr. Violet Kiteley and her son. Dr. David Kiteley. in the living room of an AfricanAmerican family. They sought to bring glory to God by engaging and empowering believers through fellowship. discipleship. worship and service. Since its founding. Shiloh Church has become a multiethnic congregation with members from over 40 nations. To accommodate its growing membership. the church underwent extensive remodeling of the facility to include a technology center and youth center. Shiloh Church also has affiliate ministries impacting hundreds of thousands of people in Canada. Hong Kong. China. Japan. Philippines. and Ethiopia throughout the world through its biblicallybased training centers and church plants. Dr. Violet Kiteley. now in her 90s. has served in fulltime ministry for over 70 years. She has served as the President of Shiloh Bible College for over 35 years and was personally instrumental in training hundreds of E1230 leaders who are now pastors. elders. missionaries. and licensed ministers in churches across the world. Dr. David Kiteley followed in his mothers footsteps alongside his wife. Pastor Marilyn. and they have faithfully served the church fulltime since 1970 as copastors. Dr. David has traveled extensively and held leadership conferences in over 45 countries. Dr. Davids son. Pastor Patrick and his wife served as Senior Pastors from 2008 until 2015. Now. Dr. Davids daughter. Pastor Melinda. and her husband. Pastor Javier Ramos. will serve as 4th senior leadership transition in the churchs history that will carry on the spiritual heritage laid by the past generations. Shiloh Church has been able to better the lives of East Bay residents through its various outreach programs such as the Robert Allen Mercy House. which provides groceries and other resources to the unemployed. underemployed. and homeless. Since 1982. this program has disbursed over $1.000.000 of food each year to more than 15.000 families. On behalf of the residents of Californias 13th Congressional District. I extend my sincerest congratulations to Shiloh Church on the special occasion of its 50th anniversary. I wish Shiloh Church many more years of faithful and compassionate service.",

I have been able to spend time with and learn from some of the best community leaders America has to offer. These are folks who regularly put the interest of others before their own. They show us their character and generosity by going above what is required or expected of them. in order to improve the livelihood of the community as a whole. I come before you today to speak on Dr. Reddys latest philanthropic endeavorVictor Valley Colleges Dr. Prem Reddy Health and Sciences Building. Opened on August 28. 2015. this 24.000 square foot facility will provide much needed new labs for the science programs. as well as nursing specific training labs. all integrated with indoor and outdoor student gathering and study spaces to create a collaborative and technology driven learning environment. The building will also feature expanded anatomy and chemistry labs. as well as a digital science lab capable of up to 40 workstations. The new nursing lab will feature 8 simulated medical beds and instruction space for up to 40 students. All of these lab and training facilities are supplied with high tech audio and visual equipment and a wireless network for student access. The building also operates under the most technologically advanced systems for energy efficiency and energy savings. The students trained and educated in this stateoftheart facility will enter the healthcare industry in a period of great turmoil. As the payment methods and organization of the industry rapidly evolve. no one can predict what the future may hold. However. the one thing we know for certain is that we will always need the most highly trained and educated students to provide the actual care. person to person. That process begins by having a learning environment to facilitate their education. I graciously thank Dr. Prem Reddy for his generosity on making this building a reality. and I congratulate Victor Valley College for its development and wish its future students years of success.",

California this past July. In order to qualify for the World Games. Christina had to win a gold medal in local. regional and state competitions. and be approved by Special Olympics Florida. Christina achieved all of these feats to become one of 7.000 competitors from over 170 countries around the world. and the only equestrian rider from Florida. out of ten riders from around the nation. to represent the United States at the World Games. Christina is visually impaired. deaf. mentally challenged. and cannot speak. yet. she is able to communicate with the horses she rides and cares for in a way few individuals are able. Christina started riding at Vinceremos Therapeutic Riding Center in Loxahatchee. Florida. at age 12 and has ridden for over 20 years. At Vinceremos. Christina trains and volunteers on a daily basis. doing whatever tasks are required to care for the animals and the facilities. Christina developed a remarkable relationship with her coach. Kim Elie. who took it upon herself to learn sign language and created a buzzer system for communication purposes. When Christina learned she qualified for the World Games. she and her coaches and family faced one last challenge: funding the trip to compete in California. The Special Olympics only funds transportation for the competing athlete not for their family members and coaches. Thus. Coach Kim Elies husband. Mark Elie. set up an online fundraising account that raised over $8.000 to fund the travel costs of her family members and coaches. In a similar way. a local restaurant held an event in support of Christina that raised over $7.000 in one night. This money has created a fund in Christinas name that pays for sign language instruction for her coaches. Mr. Speaker. I am extremely proud of Christina for continuing to push the bounds for what is possible within her sport. Christina has overcome many obstacles to become the decorated Olympic medalist she is today. She may live with disabilities. but she competes with the heart of an Olympian. That is why I am so truly honored to recognize Christina Cooney as a Hastings Hero. It is inspiring individuals such as Christina. who give me great pride to represent in Congress.",

Mary was an extraordinary person. and she will always be remembered as a woman who lived her life with purpose and great dedication to her students. family. friends. and community. Mary Brown was the pioneer of girls basketball in the San Joaquin Valley. She left an indelible stamp in the record books and inspired young women to fulfill their potential in athletics and academics. In 18 seasons at San Joaquin Memorial High School. she directed the girls basketball team to a 31745 record. highlighted by 16 league titles and eight Central Section championships. Through her impeccable coaching. the Panthers won 13 consecutive league championships from 1971 to 1983. setting a state record. and the team had 97 straight league victories. the second longest streak in state history. In 1973 she was named the Girls State Coach of the year. As a graduate of Fresno State. Mary was an exemplary community leader and gave back in ways that will not be forgotten. Her ability to motivate and inspire young women to reach their greatest potential was clearly visible in her coaching techniques. Mary has brought great pride to San Joaquin Memorial High School. and the community overall. Many of her former players consider Mary an icon and legend in sports. Her commitment to the community of Fresno will not be forgotten. All of those who knew her or played for her are truly grateful for the lasting imprint she has made in their lives as an incomparable coach and leader. Mr. Speaker. it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in saying farewell to a woman who embodies passion and inspiration. Ms. Mary Brown.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express frustration and disappointment in my Republican colleagues obstinate and insulting discussion about President Obamas Executive Action on Immigration. We are a nation built on the shoulders of immigrants. For most of us. our family trees will reflect a history with roots in other nationsmaking us the sons and daughters of immigrants ourselves. It has become profoundly clear. however. that many of us today have forgotten this. The arguments being made on the House floor today not only disrespect the legacy of the immigrants who helped shape this nation. but it undermines the authorities we entrust to our nations President. Simply put. the Executive Action taken to address the immigration crisis in this country fall wholly and legally into his executive authority. DACA and DAPA are necessary in approaching our immigration policy in a compassionate and humane way. We are not prepared to rip babies from the arms of their mothers and deport them. We do not support destroying the families of hardworking men and women who came here looking for a better life. We are better than that. America is better than that. We all recognize that the President is responsible for upholding and executing the laws passed by this Congress. The actions taken on immigration policy are not only legal but necessary. yet my friends on the other side of the aisle appear to ignorantly and vehemently disagree. So to them I ask. if this approach to immigration reform does not sit well with you. why dont you instead do your job and bring forward legislation on comprehensive immigration reform and let us vote on it in this House? Youve made it clear in this discussion today that you understand that it is Congress job to create immigration law and yet. all I see is a Party content to sit on its hands and scream at the administration for taking the action that they refuse to take themselves. This nation is ready for comprehensive immigration reform. Our constituents deserve answers. our hardworking immigrant families deserve relief and our undocumented guests. who work tirelessly to contribute to the economy of this country. deserve a clear and fair pathway to citizenship. I support comprehensive immigration reform. I do not support this ill conceived resolution. I urge a no vote.",

My colleagues and I have voted repeatedly against Republican attempts to defund DACA and have signed a discharge petition requesting a vote on comprehensive immigration reform. Because Arizona is a border state. we have suffered from years of federal inaction to fix our broken system.

Mr. Leader. do you expect that we will start considering appropriation bills on or before the end of April?

The administrations strategy in Syria and against ISIL up until now has been to do the bare minimum. which has only exacerbated the deteriorating situation. Assad remains in power and has. himself. committed an untold number of war crimes through the use of chemical weapons and barrel bombs against his own people. all while giving ISIL time to develop and to strengthen. Last month. the administration failed to comply with the legally mandated deadline to submit a plan to Congress. However. just this week. the House unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution condemning the attacks as genocide. and today. Secretary Kerry determined that Christians. Yazidis. and Shiite groups are victims of genocide. Because of the Obama administrations inaction and failure to develop a comprehensive strategy. minorities continue to be targets for these atrocious attacks. Now that the administration has begun to recognize the severity of these massacres. it is time to finally create a comprehensive strategy that will address the root causes of this conflict. including the continued presence of Assad in Syria.",

If they actually care about defending the values of our Nation and of the wellbeing of American families. I ask my colleagues across the aisle to offer legislation that reflects the priorities of American families instead of debating a bill that the Republican leadership just threw on the calendar at the last minute because their original abortion bill was too extreme. even for them. Today. we should be discussing ways to ensure every woman can put food on the table by raising the minimum wage. like 29 States have done. and by passing equal pay for women. We should be discussing how to ensure that every person who dreams of a higher education has access to it by working with President Obama on his community college proposal. We should be discussing legislation to allow 43 million workers to take time off when they are sick and to make sure parents can take time off with their new babies. These are the familycentered priorities that reflect our values as a nation. and these are. certainly. the challenges that my constituents in south Florida sent me here to tackle. Instead. we are debating a bill with an underlying principle that has already been codified. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that a regressive policy of banning taxpayer funding for abortion. which only serves to punish our Nations poor and most vulnerable women. already exists. As the President said Tuesday night. while we may not agree on choice. we can at least agree that the best people to make these decisions for women are not politicians. Building on the zeal to interfere in the health decisions of women. this bill goes even further by tying a womans health options to her income. A strong majority of Americans agree. including 62 percent who identify as Republicans. that abortion is the wrong issue for Congress to be spending its time on. I agree with them. When my colleagues are prepared to work on legislation that truly addresses the concerns of the American people. we stand ready to work with them. Listen to your Members who sounded the alarm bell on the original bill that was pulled off this floor. and get your priorities straight.",

I am pleased to recognize the El Paso Veterans Treatment Court Program as an initiative that works hard to \"leave no veteran behind and honor their service.\" As the second program of its kind in the state of Texas. the El Paso Veterans Treatment Court Program has provided resources to numerous Veterans in the criminal justice system. Since 2009. the initiative has aided eligible Veterans and active duty Service Members who are charged with misdemeanor criminal offenses. in 2012 the program was expanded to include felony criminal offenses. The participants are diverted from the traditional criminal justice system and are assessed for substance abuse and mental health issues. Upon meeting program entrance requirements. participants receive an individualized treatment plan and attend frequent review hearings before the program judge. In addition to providing comprehensive substance abuse and mental health treatment. the five phase program also includes officials from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to determine the Veteran participants eligibility for further aid. The Veterans Benefits Administration assesses the Veteran for disability compensation. education benefits. and vocational rehabilitation qualifications. The Veterans Health Administration also assesses the Veteran to determine eligibility for housing and medical services. The program operates on a personal level as well. in order to address employment opportunities and individual needs. The El Paso Veterans Treatment Court Program provides an alternative route for Veterans and active duty Service Members in the criminal justice system. The initiative practices a holistic approach. providing resources. addressing treatment concerns and engaging in judicial monitoring. These necessary tools help participants engage in society as lawabiding citizens. The initiative has been widely successful in El Paso and recently received the prestigious Texas Veterans Commission Patriot Award in recognition of their diligence.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Serbias recent donation of $5.4 million to the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. where thousands of Muslims were killed in the Yugoslav Wars. is a clear sign that the Serbian Government wants to do what they can to improve relationships with countries in the region. Mending these relationships is especially important as the Balkans are on the front lines of the refugee crisis. As of the beginning of November. the same month that President Vucic announced this large donation. over 300.000 refugees had flowed through the country since the beginning of the year. Most refugees are fleeing Syria. Iraq and Afghanistan and travelling to Europe to seek asylum. Serbia is doing their part to process and protect these people. In October alone. 180.307 refugees were processed compared to 51.048 in September because of Serbias commitment to improving capacity. It is critical for countries in the region to work together to process the influx of refugees while ensuring the safety of their own countries and the world. The Balkans are a transit region making it important for all the countries to have an open line of communication in order to ensure the ordered. safe. and peaceful flow of people and is especially important for bordering countries. Serbias gesture to Bosnia is hopefully a signal of relationships on the mend at this very tense time in the world. While the importance of Balkan countries working together cannot be underemphasized. it is also of utmost importance for all freedomloving countries throughout the world to work together to fight ISIS. a big factor in the flow of migrants and a threat to our way of life. in which all lives are cherished. Every country must do their part. We must all come together and obliterate this scourge on our world. As cochair of the Congressional Serbian Caucus. I commend the Serbian Government for all that they have done to mend their relationships in the region and for their leadership during this incredibly trying time. And thats just the way it is.",

Top U.S. military officials have confirmed that ISIS is far from contained. When the President addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Sunday. Americans needed to hear a real strategy to eradicate ISIS. The speech came just days after an act of terror here at home. Instead of a plan. our Commander in Chief delivered the same empty rhetoric. The United States must show our international partners that we are committed to defeating ISIS. The first step is for the President to outline a plan to destroy them . . . not degrade them.

Many American Sikhs face misunderstanding in their schools and workplaces. despite the over 100year history of the faith in America. I thank the Sikh Community of Connecticut for their work to bring greater understanding of Sikh values to all Americans. In particular. Mr. Swaranjit Singh Khalsa and the Sikh Sivak Society. who organized an awareness campaign in my district to educate eastern Connecticut residents about Sikhism through public service advertisements seen around town. I was fortunate to meet Mr. Singh in my office recently to discuss the project and the challenges the community is facing. Sikhism originated in the Punjab region of South Asia. founded on the ideals of devotion to God. service to others. social justice. and equality of all people. Twentyfive million people practice Sikhism all over the world. including 250.000 Sikhs in the United States. making Sikhism the fifth largest religion in the world. Immigration of Sikhs to the United States primarily began in the 1960s. as many came in search of higher education. and stayed to raise families. Indeed. Sikhs have made great contributions to the culture. economy. and society of the United States. This month. Sikhs all over the world will be celebrating Vaisakhi. This holiday commemorates the founding of the Khalsa. or the collective body of committed Sikhs. Vaisakhi is a time to acknowledge the values of Sikhism. and the growth of the Sikh community. This year. the Sikh Community of America organized the Freedom March for Sikh Nation on April 9th in Washington. D.C. This event is a time for all Americans to come together to learn about and celebrate Vaisakhi. and bring attention to issues surrounding Sikh identity in the United States. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Sikh community for their many contributions to American culture.

From efforts to abolish slavery. secure civil rights. and protect human life. to providing health care. food. shelter. and hope to countless millions. religious organizations have been indispensable to the progress we have made. Indeed. the Civil Rights Act of 1964 recognized the extraordinary contributions of religious organizations when it preserved their right to hire individuals who shared their beliefs. Today we see clouds encroaching upon the sunshine of religious freedom and the freedom of conscience. These attempts to crush conscience must be resisted. It is conscience that convicts us of our own shortcomings. and it is that conviction that allows us to correct course and to seek what is good. beautiful. and true.

I told them I was next going to a hearing about the prison in Guantanamo and that one group had estimated it was now costing us over $4 million per prisoner to keep that prison open. One of the students said. \"How can I get in?\" There are now only 80 prisoners there. and we spent $445 million to run the facility in 2015. The Washington Times reported in 2013 that we were giving these prisoners classes on computers. horticulture. art. and calligraphy as well as library services. special food. and recreational facilities. We sometimes hear of country club prisons. Apparently. this should be called a resort prison. I know the Federal Government cannot do anything in a fiscally conservative way. but spending $4 million per prisoner in Guantanamo is ridiculous. It costs an average of $34.000 per year per prisoner in most Federal prisons and $78.000 per year in the supermax prison. Mr. Speaker. we should stop giving these terrorists such ridiculously expensive special treatment and send all 80 to the worst. most dangerous prison in the U.S.",

Originating from Detroit General Hospital. namesake Henry Ford became the sole investor in 1914 and coupled his entrepreneurial spirit with medical innovation. Admitting its first patient in 1915. Henry Ford Hospital was so successful in meeting the needs of a city in the midst of a population boom that by 1917 it had already expanded to its current size. In its early days. the hospital revolutionized wait times. reducing them to 30 minutes for a patient to be seen. and opened the nations first ward for treating chemical dependency. It developed new techniques in the fields of surgery and physical therapy. The excellent quality of care at Henry Ford Hospital would even later inspire works of art from visionaries like Diego Rivera. Beyond the positive impact Henry Ford Hospital has had on Michigan. it has also rendered invaluable service to our country by serving as an army hospital during World War II and caring for our soldiers upon their return. Henry Ford Health System and its partners have pioneered a broad range of medical knowledge. from bone research to kidney transplants to treatment of high blood pressure to robotic surgery. While innovation may be the driving force behind the success of the Henry Ford Health System. they have never lost focus of the top priority: people. In 2008. they launched the No Harm campaign which. over the course of the next three years. reduced surgical complications. decreased length of stay. and trimmed medical costs by 10 million dollars. Their good stewardship is felt by over 89.000 patients a year in the fivecounty area. a number that is very impressive for a hospital system that started with 48 beds. Henry Ford Health Systems commitment to and investment in the Detroit metropolitan communities are immeasurable. In 2011. Henry Ford Health System was one of only 4 recipients to receive a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. Americas highest honor for innovation and performance excellence. Mr. Speaker. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the 23.000 employees of Henry Ford Health System and congratulating them on their 100th anniversary and wish them many more years of success.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of the National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015. which I introduced earlier today with my colleagues JERROLD NADLER and DANA ROHRABACHER. This bipartisan legislation ensures that certain members of the National Guard and Reserves who fall on hard economic times after their service will continue to obtain bankruptcy relief without having to fill out the substantial paperwork required by the socalled \"means test\" under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. This bill simply extends the existing \"means test\" exception. which will expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act. Under the means test. a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case is presumed to be an abuse of the bankruptcy process if it appears that the debtor has income in excess of certain thresholds. The National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act of 2008 created an exception to the means tests presumption of abuse for members of the National Guard and Reserves who. after September 11. 2001. served on active duty or in a homeland defense activity for at least 90 days. The exception remains available for 540 days after the servicemember leaves the military. The National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015 would simply extend the exception until December 2019. This bill is a meaningful way for our Nation to recognize the tremendous sacrifice made by National Guard and Reserve members who have served on active duty or homeland defense since September 11. 2001 and may be suffering financial hardship.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce a bill. the Avontes Law Act of 2015. which was inspired by the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Avonte Oquendo of Queens. New York. Avonte was an autistic child who wandered away from his school. His lifeless body was not found for more than a month. \"Wandering\" is very common in children with autism and other disabilities. and sometimes children who wander are nonverbal or cannot communicate well with others. leading to dangerous interactions with strangers or even law enforcement. This bill authorizes a new grant program within the United States Department of Justice to provide local law enforcement agencies with the resources to procure response tools and increase education and training for first responders. schools. and families with the goal of preventing situations like Avontes from happening again. The bill also requires the Attorney General to establish standards and best practices for the administration of any type of voluntary \"tracking\" system used by law enforcement agencies that are awarded these funds. Tracking devices are one of the many ways we can help prevent another tragic situation like Avontes. Mr. Speaker. by taking a holistic approach to this issue. we can help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) live safe and happy lives all around the country.",

While tax liability can follow a taxpayer foreverplus interest and penaltiestaxpayers only have a couple years in which to claim a credit or a refund.

Mr. Brookhart was born on January 22. 1935. and passed away last month. He is survived by his wife of 56 years. Gail Anderson Brookhart. three sons and their wives. and 10 grandchildren. One of Smiths sons. Tom Brookhart. and his wife. Debra Brookhart. are my constituents and good friends in Tulsa. Oklahoma. Let me talk for a moment about Smith Brookharts life. After graduating from East High School in Duluth. Minnesota. Smith attended Iowa State College in Ames. Iowa. receiving his degree in 1957. He served our country in uniform as an ensign in the United States Navy. His service included two Antarctic expeditions. As a Navy pilot myself. I can tell you Antarctic expeditions are not something that are friendly. I will just say that. Ultimately. Smith moved his family to Branson. Missouri. where he became the CEO of Ozark Mountain Bank. He served in that capacity for over three decades. He was very involved in the development of Branson. Missouri. My family and I have had occasion to visit Branson. It is a very familyfriendly town where Christians are very welcome. I know that Smiths Christian faith was very important to him. At age 69. Smith received a heart transplant and was given a new lease on life. There is a beautiful line I read in Smiths obituary. which I would like to read: \"Smith would not want to be remembered for the accolades of his efforts. but for a life rich with friendships.\" Mr. Speaker. today. I honor Smith Brookhart. a remarkable American. father. grandfather. community leader. patriot. and servant of Christ. I would like to close with Romans 8:38: \"For I am convinced that neither death nor life. nor angels nor demons. neither the present nor the future. nor any powers. neither height nor depth. nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" May God bless Mr. Brookhart.",

This month. in May. the Mahaffey Theater celebrates its 50th anniversary. Opening in 1965. the venue was originally called the Bayfront Center Complex. a combination arena and theater along the citys most beautiful downtown waterfront. It quickly proved to be a gathering place for community and civic groups. and its many shows drew tourists from around the State. The artists that have performed at the Mahaffey could easily fill an entertainment hall of fame. from Louis Armstrong to Dionne Warwick to Liza Minelli to Johnny Mathis. Kenny Rogers. and even \"The Presidents Own\" United States Marine Band. an event that was secured by the invitation of my predecessor. Congressman Bill Young. The first significant makeover for the venue occurred in 1987. and the Bayfront Theater became the Mahaffey Theater after a generous gift from St. Petersburgs Mahaffey family. In 2011. Big3 Entertainment took over the management of the Mahaffey. with CEO and chairman Bill Edwards privately funding a number of major enhancements. Today. the Mahaffey is home to the Florida Orchestra. and it is the annual host site for the Miss Florida Pageant. The Mahaffey also supports. very importantly. the highly successful Class Acts program. which enables school children to experience the performing arts through intheater performances. as well as inschool outreach and extension programs. The theater also has been the site of very important moments of American history. The theater was the site of the 1996 Vice Presidential debate between Al Gore and Jack Kemp. And in 2007. the Mahaffey hosted the nationally televised Republican Presidential primary debate. known as the very first YouTube debate. having Americans. for the very first time. submit questions via YouTube video clips. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Mahaffey Theater. celebrating a venue that today anchors a growing and thriving Pinellas County arts community and serves as a stage that celebrates the arts but. most importantly. celebrates the remarkable human spirit. the creativity of so many performers. and the dedication and commitment of the greater St. Petersburg community.",

Sixtyfour people have died attempting the Eiger since 1935. earning it the German nickname \"Mordwand\" or \"Murder Wall.\" It took Sasha and her climbing partner. Carlo Traversi. nearly a month to make the climb. facing constant rockfall. rain. ice. and snowstorms throughout their ascent. Sasha became the first woman and the first American to climb the face via the Magic Mushroom route. one of the most difficult paths to the summit. As if her accomplishments were not impressive enough already. Sasha is also a thirdyear student at Columbia University. where she is studying nonfiction writing and business. She has been published in National Geographic and several other outdoor publications. and is an athlete representative on the board of the International Federation of Sport Climbing. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Sasha on her outstanding achievements. She is a shining example of how hard work. determination. and dedication can lead anyone to unprecedented heights. I wish Sasha all the best in her future ascents as she continues to make us proud. To paraphrase Maurice Herzog: There are other Eigers in the lives of women and men.",

Congress updated our food safety protections for the 21st century by passing the Food Safety and Modernization Act. greatly expanding these consumer protections through the Food and Drug Administration. Today it is critical that we maintain this progress and protect the implementation of this law from the obstructionist policies included in the SCRUB Act. It is especially important that we allow the FDA to carry out this effort unimpeded because our food safety standards are facing attacks from many other directions. A recent decision from the World Trade Organization repealed our countryoforigin labeling standards on beef and pork. undermining consumers right to know where their groceries are coming from. Meanwhile. the United States is considering entering the TransPacific Partnership. a massive multinational trade agreement that may allow food into our grocery stores and restaurants that may not even meet basic safety standards. The TPP weakens our ability to inspect these dangerous foods before they end up on our dinner plates. We know that seafood imported from countries like Vietnam and Malaysia are often contaminated with dangerous antibiotics and foodborne pathogens. Between 2002 and 2010. 44 percent of catfish and related species from China. Vietnam. Thailand. Indonesia. and Cambodia tested positive for antibiotics banned in the United States. Further. in 2013. 100 percent of the Vietnamese catfish farms used antibiotics not approved in the United States. Meanwhile. large amounts of shrimp imported to the United States also contain dangerous bacteria. Last year. harmful bacteria were found in 83 percent of the shrimp from Bangladesh. 74 percent of the shrimp from India. and 58 percent of the shrimp from Vietnam. For these reasons. the number of dirty seafood shipments from Vietnam and Malaysia rejected by the FDA increased 224 percent in the first 2 months of 2015 alone. We must amend this legislation to preserve the FDAs ability to protect our food. It is not too much to ask that families are assured basic food safety standards and protections are met. Please support this amendment. which will allow the FDA to continue doing its job by protecting consumers and making sure our food is safe to eat. I reserve the balance of my time.",

As a Member of Congress. I have witnessed firsthand what heroin and opioids can do to communities like my hometown of Taylorville. Illinois. In my hometown of 12.000 people. I never would have thought. growing up in the 1980s. that a drug like heroin would cause such a scourge. As a matter of fact. it is interesting to hear many of my colleagues talk about what is happening in their communities. Not too long ago. in that hometown of 12.000 people. our local newspaper had a coroners jury report that I believe I remember mentioned four deaths in one coroners jury report related to heroin and opioid overdoses. This is something in my community I never thought I would witness. and it is also something in my community that demands action. I am so proud to sponsor the STOP ABUSE Act with my colleagues here tonight. What they are talking about and what everybody who has stood in front of this sign tonight has talked about is the importance of addressing opioid abuse. This bill is something that. because of small towns like my hometown. we are here to address. It has become a Federal issue. I want to end by talking about a friend of mine. a gentleman that I grew up with. his family. He actually used to run our county health department at the time he was arrested for heroin use. Who would have thought that in a town of 12.000 people the director of the county health department would be addicted to heroin? It doesnt matter what your socioeconomic status is. it doesnt matter what your job is. and it doesnt matter where you were born or who you were born to. you. too. can become addicted to heroin. That is why we have demanded action tonight. That is why I am thankful to be here. That is why I am thankful to be able to help each and every one of my colleagues in a bipartisan way to address this problem. Mr. Speaker. we are going to do something about this issue.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. I would like to thank our cochairs for arranging this special order to discuss the faces of heroin and opiate addiction. The faces of heroin and opiate addiction are getting younger. In my home State of Ohio and across the country. we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of infants born with opiates in their system and needing for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. or NAS. Tragically. these children are born addicted to drugs and have no voice or awareness as to why they are suffering. The symptoms of withdrawal begin almost immediately. They may suffer from low birth weight. difficulty feeding or breathing. seizures. dehydration. tremors. and excessive or continuous highpitched crying. Hospital personnel may spend ten hours in a single day to holding and rocking these newborns in an effort to console them. but over 80 percent of children with NAS still require medication to treat their withdrawal. The toll that the heroin epidemic takes on these children can go beyond the terrible physical symptoms and complications. and the effects can be lasting ones. The faces of heroin addiction are young and they are fighting an incredibly difficult and painful battle without ever choosing to suffer. Through no action of their own. these children are victims of the heroin epidemic. Parents who do not successfully treat their addiction have overdosed and died. leaving these children without their mothers and fathers. We must work to ensure that children are not born addicted and not left without a parent. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do as I have. and go out into your communities and meet with your local hospitals. doctors. and healthcare professionals to see how they are dealing with the growing number of heroin and opiate addicted newborns. I have held multiple forums to better understand how we can begin to prevent addiction beginning at birth. The faces of the heroin epidemic are not limited in age or gender. We know now that it can be anyone: a child born unknowingly addicted or a parent who does not know where to turn for help. We must remain committed to combating the heroin epidemic and the devastating effects it has on these children and families.",

Nationwide. in 2014. heroin abuse was responsible for nearly 8.200 deaths. In just 10 years. the number of addicts has doubled to over 500.000. To address this health crisis. we must expand coordination between local. State. and Federal governments. law enforcement agencies. and medical professionals. We must assemble the best ideas from experts around the country. which is why Congresswoman ANN KUSTER and I formed the bipartisan task force.

At $439 billion. the deficit is about 10 percent lower than in 2014 and is less than one third of what it was in 2009. Yet. earlier this week. the administration was quick to boast about announcing the deficit being down that low when we asked in the past. \"What is the plan. Mr. President. for balancing the budget ever?\" Not telling me how to do it. but when. We havent gotten any answer. This has been the result of discipline started by House Republicans with the Budget Control Act and other measures to keep spending in line so that we will have a chance some day to have a truly balanced budget. If we had the economy responding and things to help spur the economy. we could reach that goal even faster. perhaps even by 2019. With the right discipline. we could balance the budget. Then no longer will we have to have a debate about whether we should be extending the debt limit. which I think is appalling for all of us here. especially for the next generation who are going to have to pay the price on that. So this is indeed good news. We want to get that budget deficit number to zero as soon as we can and maintain the business of this country.",

In my home State of Iowa. 72 of our 99 counties are considered medically underserved. and of these. 27 are served by only one pharmacy. Many of these areas are rural. and a large number of citizens in these sparsely populated areas rely on their community pharmacy for access to lifesaving drugs and treatments. Unfortunately. the implementation of Federal policy to address the rising costs of drugs has left independent community pharmacists at a disadvantage. Often unable to cover the costs of maintaining and managing a storefront. community pharmacies are closing their doors at an alarming rate. This leaves many Americans without access to the timely. efficient. and personal patient services they provide. To that end. I am most happy to cosponsor H.R. 592. to ensure that pharmacists are recognized as providers under Medicare part B so that my constituents can have access to local healthcare services instead of traveling long distances to seek out care.

The reason for this bill is that. recently. the IRS decided not to publish in paper form Publication 17. which is a necessary publication for anybody who has a moderately difficult income tax return to prepare. There are two classes of people who are affected by thisfirst of all. the people who do their own returns. Like many other agencies. the IRS only looks at the costs that it is directly imposing on the citizenry. It doesnt look at the costs it is indirectly imposing on the citizenry. In this country. the average cost of a professionally prepared tax return is easily over $200. If we turned around and billed everybody $200 from the government. obviously. we couldnt pass that bill around here. but because of the complexity of our Internal Revenue Code and of people having to go out and pay that $200. we dont associate it with a tax. but it makes people poorer just as if we had directly increased their taxes. When you dont provide copies of instructions for a tax return. you are punishing people who are trying to save that $200. $250. $300 by doing their own returns. Secondly. you are disproportionately affecting people who cannot navigate the Internet as wellin other words. our older population. It just seems offensiveas you have older people out there. some who are not familiar with the Internetsaying: No. No. We wont go with paper for now. That. again. is kind ofI guess I will call itelitism on the part of the IRS because it doesnt need the paper form. It is saying the 75- or 80yearold who is still doing his return doesnt need the form. We are. therefore. asking for this bill to be passed and are asking the IRS to. one more time. have sympathy for the people who may not have the additional $200. $250. $300 to pay a professional preparer and for the older citizens who may not be comfortable preparing their return online.",

Res. 673. a commonsense bill that expresses the support of Congress for having the IRS continue to provide taxpayers with a paper copy of instructions on how to file their taxes. I thank Representative GROTHMAN for introducing this resolution and for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue during tax week. I hear from constituents all the time about how difficult it is to access paper tax forms. let alone how hard it is to file their taxes. Every year. millions of people continue to file their taxes on paper. but. every year. the IRS continues to make this process even more difficult. As the IRS has transitioned to preferring an electronic filing system. many of my constituents are getting left behind. Not everyone is easily able to get access to paper forms on their own. The response that my constituents receive when they ask for help from the IRS is that all of the forms are easily available online. Unfortunately. more than 25 percent of all Americans lack regular or easy access to the Internet. and over 50 percent of seniors do not own a computer. Other people just want to file by paper. We need to preserve this option. Beyond the accessibility concerns. we hear more and more about the dangers of electronic data security and tax frauddangers which are exacerbated by efiling. Many of my constituents want to avoid these threats to their personal information. and the IRS is actively hindering them from taking sensible precautions. I actually introduced legislationthe PAPER Actin this Congress. which would require the IRS to send filing instructions and tax forms in paper format if someone traditionally files his taxes by paper. This seems pretty easy to me. While many of my constituents have concerns about how complicated their taxes are or about how high their rates are. they want to pay their taxes. We should not be keeping them from doing so. I urge all of my colleagues to support this simple resolution. I think. if the IRS would stop going after individuals about their politics. they would have plenty of money with which to send out the forms.",

When we had a chance. we did add several hundred million dollars to the IRS that one year. and service improved. but now it is relapsing again because the Republican majority here simply will not provide adequate resources to the government agency that is supposed to work with our taxpayers. Also. the IRS is supposed to do some work in auditing tax returns. Because of the lack of resources. now fewer than 1 percent of taxpayers have any auditing of what they present to the IRS. I understand the concerns. What I do not understand is the realization that you are the source. in large measure. of these concerns. Tomorrow. we will be debating bills that have a much greater impact in terms of the IRS and its employees. This is relatively innocuous. in part. because it is only a sense of Congress and because it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Even if it did. it would be nothing more than an expression of the sense. What we really need are dollars and cents given to the IRS employees so that they can do the work they want to do so that the 50. 60. or whatever percent of the calls that come in never get through to those people who would like to respond to the people who are calling them.

In fact. we have done that in the environment of where we have seen the abuse that the IRS has wrought on this country. We have seen the lavish parties. and the American people said it was unacceptable. We have seen the extreme bonuses that were paid to employees. We have seen the targeting of individual groups based on what they work on. We had hoped that the reduction in spending would be a reminder to the IRS of who they are to be accountable to. which is to the hardworking taxpayers. and that it would be the perfect opportunity for them to identify their priorities of what they should be doing. which is helping and servicing taxpayers who are trying to comply with the law instead of targeting individuals and instead of stopping to answer phone calls. He talked about only 50 to 60 percent of the phone calls being answered. I think only 38 percent of those phone calls are being answered. And then. even if they are answered at times. they are dropped out of courtesy because the IRS simply isnt there to answer the questions the taxpayers have. Taxpayers are spending somewhere around 6 billion hours preparing their taxes. $30 billion on computer programs and/or professional help to try to pay their taxes accurately so they can comply with the laws this country has in place. The problem is that. by stopping this distribution of IRS publication 17. who we are harming the most are those who are disadvantaged. the elderly who dont have access to computers. the poor who dont have access to getting the kind of help that they need or have the funds to find and be able to pay professional tax preparers. That is who we hurt if we dont pass this bill today. Lets help those who are disadvantaged. Lets make sure that they have the instructions necessary to pay their taxes accurately and on time.

After the inspector general gave his reportthis is May 17. 2013this is what I asked the inspector general: Did you find any evidence of political motivation in the selection of the taxexemption applications? And the inspector said: We did not. sir. Look. we could spend hours talking about what has happened to the rules regarding 501(c)(4)s in this country. We could go back and discuss the abuse of the 501(c)(4) provisions. We could go back and look at how much political money is being poured into this process by 501(c)(4)s. We could go back and discuss what was the original language in the 501(c)(4) legislation that no political money could be used. Instead. it was interpreted decades ago that it relates to the majority must not be. So what has happened is that 501(c)(4)sby the way. most of them are rightwing organizations. most of them. Most of the money has come from rightwing organizations using the mask of 501(c)(4)s to essentially. I think. pollute the democratic processes in this country. We shouldnt really be doing that. You raised it. so. I am responding. What this bill does is simply say that the constitutional rights should essentially prevail. and I fully agree. It is already in the 1998 legislation. So lets move on. Lets not use vehicles for political purposes. Look. we have so much more we could be doing today in terms of tax legislation. We have legislation relating to inversions. A number of us have introduced it. We complain that the executive uses too much power. They have used their power relating to inversions up to. I think. a legitimate point and have said to us in the Congress that we need to go furtherthe Congress doesto address the problem of inversions in this country. Essentially. we do nothing. We do nothing about this. There was talk earlier today about tax reform. We have heard this talking endlessly. and there is no product. There is no product whatsoever.

I thought. the incompetent way it was handled. but not because there was any evidence of political motivation. Again. I want to go back to the question I asked the inspector general in 2013: \"Did you find any evidence of political motivation in the selection of the taxexemption applications?\" Mr. George said: \"We did not. sir.\" So what has happened here is essentially getting up and reading a onesided. often erroneous text. often conclusions that are not at all based on fact. We really should not be relitigating this today. We should be acting on tax legislation. on the budget. and other necessary issues that face the people of this country. I hope no one thinks that the passage of this bill will in any way imply on the part of any of us who have been involved with this on the Democratic side that there is any substance to the attack that has been launched here on the IRS and conclusions that have been reached that are not founded on fact. It is kind of sad. The 1998 law says no IRS employee may violate the constitutional rights of a taxpayer. That is absolutely clear. It is absolutely clear. So with this. I want to express my regret that this bill is being used as a vehicle for strictly political purposes. Lets abide by the Constitution and the 1998 law.

Let me remind you that in 2013. Lois Lerner admitted that the IRS had targeted taxpayers based on their political beliefs. She said that the Tea Party matter was very dangerous. She suggested how to deny the applications. We know for a fact that she inserted herself into the supposedly unbiased processes that she had created and then bypassed even these procedures and singled out certain taxpayers for additional scrutiny and audit. Do we think. really. that it was just a fluke that 100 percent of the audits and the groups that were selected for audit were rightleaning? I dont believe so. sir. While that investigation may be over. it is still important to have discussions like this to reassure the taxpayers back home that this type of targeting will never happen. that we have legislation before us today that will stop some of the abuses that may have happened in the past and ensure that they wont happen in the future.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the Small Business Act requires that when large businesses receive Federal prime contracts. they must negotiate a subcontracting plan outlining who they intend to use as small business subcontractors. That plan becomes part of the contract. and the results are supposed to be part of the past performance evaluation for the prime contractor. Indeed. failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the agreedupon plan can trigger liquidated damages. Even though this has been the law for 38 years. the Small Business Administration has never explained what it means to fail to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan. This failure is a doubleedged sword. For bad actors. it lets them off the hook. For good actors. it leaves ambiguity about what they are expected to do. It also forces companies that take their compliance obligations seriously to compete against bad actors who never even report the results of their plans. Failure to report is a real problem. As many as 40 percent of the companies with subcontracting plans dont report any results. As a result. subcontracting dollars with small businesses are at the lowest point in over 40 years. My colleague. the gentleman from Florida . who chairs the Subcommittee on Agriculture. Energy and Trade of the Committee on Small Business has a commonsense solution for this problem. H.R. 4284 requires the Small Business Administration to explain what it means to fail to make a good faith effort to comply with the plan. It further explains that failing to meet the most basic obligation of the contract termreporting back on resultscannot be good faith. The beauty of Mr. CURBELOS legislation is that it solves a problem without placing any new burdens on compliant contractors while still ensuring that the American taxpayer gets the benefits anticipated in the contract. This legislation was included as part of a larger bill that passed the Committee on Small Business in January. and it received bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to support and pass H.R. 4284.

I ran for my local school board because. as a parent. it was clear to me that our schools were unprepared to meet my daughters needs and to meet the needs of students with dyslexia. and teachers had never been properly trained to identify this learning disability. After 12 years on the school board. I was elected to my State legislature. And as chair of the California Assembly on Education. I also worked to improve education for students with learning disabilities. Now. as a Member of Congress. I want to do my part at the Federal level. Across the country. many States are stepping up to this challenge. They have passed new laws to update their education codes. get assistive technology into more classrooms. and to boost teacher training. Advancements in cognitive science can teach us much more about how the brain develops and. therefore. how children learn. In closing. I want to share with everyone that my daughter is now 30 years old. She speaks three languages. and she is saving the world one life at a time in Africa. So she finally got the services she needs and is being very successful in life and following her own dreams. I also want to thank. again. the gentleman from Texas. who is my cochair on the Dyslexia Caucus. as well as all the members of the Science Committee for their bipartisan support for the READ Act. I urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on this very important piece of legislation.",

I rise in support of H.R. 3033. the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia. or the READ Act. This important legislation would require that the Presidents annual budget to Congress specifically fund the Research in Disabilities Education program at the National Science Foundation. It would also require NSF to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research. You are probably going to hear multiple Members come up tonight and talk about personal stories. about how this hits so very close to home for some of us. I have a 13yearold granddaughter in Texas. Matin Mangiaracinia. I have watched over the years as she and her mother and her dad have struggled to help try to identify the problems that she has with learning. teachers that were unprepared to diagnose. to identify the symptoms of dyslexia. Even then. once she was diagnosed and identified. having those tools and support applied consistently from one school to another or from one teacher to another is still problematic. Today Matin is a member of the National Honor Society because of the help that has been provided to her. But she still struggles. She has created a Web site on her own to draw attention to this important problem. and she is working hard to improve herself personally. I cant say enough about how proud I am of her and the many others that are afflicted with this condition. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R.",

As a past mayor. a hospital staff member for many years. and a local school board member. I know firsthand how this administrations plan is taxing the budgets of our local governments. including our schools. our hospitals. and our jails. This massive unfunded mandate must be repealed. Amnesty also undermines our national security by perpetuating open borders. making Americans less safe. Finally. it leaves behind millions of American citizens who are unemployed at this time. making it even harder for them to find goodpaying jobs.

They are frustrated with the Presidents executive order which attempts to reunite families and bring a rational. prioritybased approach to our immigration system. Given the Constitution. the laws. and the legal precedents. the Presidents actions are clearly well within his executive powers. If they dont like it. they can pass an immigration bill. which would clearly supercede the actions of the President. but they wouldnt even try. That is what this is all about. It is about making false statements about the President. demonizing immigrants and their families. and trying to score political points back home. That is a disgrace. but it gets even worse. Not only are the Republicans stalling on immigration reform and leaving millions of families in limbo. but they are holding up funding for the entire Homeland Security Department. They are threatening the safety of Americans at our airports. They are making our borders less secure and are potentially leaving us more vulnerable to attack. This is particularly shocking. given the tragic events in Paris last week. Holding the security of the American people hostage to the demands of the antiimmigration fringe of their party is totally irresponsible. This is not the time for political games. We live in a dangerous world. and the security of the Nation is serious business. Reject this political stunt. Pass a clean Homeland Security bill that we all agree on. Then. if you want to. pass an immigration bill that would supersede what the President has done. but dont give us all of this nonsense about blackmailing the country by threatening our safety and saying. \"Unless we get the immigration provisions we want.\" which we know the President wont sign. \"there will be no Homeland Security bill. potentially no Homeland Security Department funding. and no guards at our borders.\" That is absurd.",

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle conveniently leave these facts out. First of all. this has nothing to do with shutting down Homeland Security. Second of all. the total budget for Homeland Security is $39.7 billion. That is $1.3 billion over the Presidents request. That is $400 million over last year. Our amendments prevent the President from using any moneysno matter from whereon amnesty. There is no reason to shut down Homeland Security. If Homeland Security is shut down. it is due to the Democrats and President Barack Obama because he has more money for Homeland Security than he asked for. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 240 and the amendments. President Obama released amnesty plans in November that include changes to border security. status of persons currently living in the United States unlawfully. and future legal immigration policy changesall of which are directly under the purview of the legislative branch. not the executive branch. In addition this Presidents executive order included several other changes that directly result in amnesty. To be clear. democracy in this country was built on the foundation of a three branch federal government. Our founding fathers saw the importance of checks and balances to prevent any branch from becoming allpowerful and exceeding its constitutional authority. Furthermore. our Constitution specifically grants all lawmaking authority to Congress. and instead gives the executive branch the role of executing the laws passed. The Presidents overreach in granting amnesty has left Congress with no choice but to exercise the power of the purse today to restore the Federal Government to one of balance. within the confines of the Constitution. Last week I introduced the Defund Amnesty Act to ensure this type of change. and I applaud the leadership for bringing legislation to the floor to boldly put an end to the Presidents executive order on amnesty.",

But I also rise in support of the amendments to this legislation. And when considering the amendments that were made in order.

They have followed the rules. and they have earned that feeling of achievement. But it is America that benefits.

I strongly support these amendments because we are expressing the sense of Congress in these amendments that we respect naturalized citizens. we honor their hard work and dedication to the legal immigration and naturalization process. We should hold these new citizens up as models for how to immigrate to this country the right way. We should not punish them by using their very processing fees that they paid to accommodate illegal immigrants hiding from the rule of law.

In fact. these technologies have led to the evolution of nearly every food product we consume and have enabled us to enjoy the safest. highest quality. and most abundant and affordable supply food and fiber in the history of the world. The majority of the scientific community. including the American Medical Association. the World Health Organization. and the National Academy of Sciences. contends that food products grown with the use of biotechnology are just as safe as. if not safer than. any other food. Just last month. a group of 107 Nobel laureates joined the effort to fight back against the antiscience. activist group Greenpeace for its attempts to stifle these lifesaving advances. With almost 800 million malnourished people worldwide and the global population expected to rise to 9 billion by 2050. we are more reliant on biotechnology than ever to meet the everincreasing demand for a safe and stable food supply. In recent years. campaigns against agricultural biotechnology have raised concerns among consumers. and some States have begun to implement arbitrary and inconsistent labeling laws that threaten to increase consumer confusion and food costs while ultimately interfering with interstate commerce. The bill before us today addresses these issues by providing a blueprint for a nationwide uniform standard for labeling products derived from biotechnology. Though I believe the government should only require labels when it is a matter of health or safety. or to provide valuable nutritional information. it is important that this StatebyState patchwork not disrupt the nationwide marketing of food. With the Vermont mandate kicking in earlier this month. time is now of the essence.

This bill would have protected advancements in food production and innovation and ended the patchwork of State laws threatening our interstate commerce.

It will establish a meaningful national standard for biotech labeling that will prevent an unworkable patchwork of conflicting State laws. It will provide consumers with information they want.

While I was not present to vote on this legislation. had I been. I would have voted in favor of the bill. It is a reality that many of our crops are genetically modified and it is important that food companies disclose ingredient information. S. 764 is a compromise and provides a common sense federal solution to a patchwork system that has the potential to disrupt the food supply chain by having certain labeling requirements in some states but not others. with the increased compliance costs ultimately being passed along to the consumer. The bill institutes a national mandatory labeling standard for foods that contain genetically engineered crops. with several options for how food manufacturers can label their products. Mr. Speaker. it is for this reason that I support the disclosure of ingredient information and would have voted in support of this bill.

While I recognize this legislation. with a mandatory labeling requirement. is a step forward from the DARK Act that passed the House last year. it falls far short of the comprehensive labeling standard consumers need. More than ever. Americans want to know what goes into the food they eat. and have concerns about the presence of geneticallymodified ingredients. Rather than clear. sensible labels for these ingredients. this bill would allow manufacturers to use QR codes and other technologies to satisfy label requirements. These measures would shift a heavy burden to consumers to scan the code with a smartphone or other device and read about the food contents on a website rather than the package they hold in their hands. We need understandable. accessible labels that allow Americans to pick up a food product and easily understand its contents. That is why I join with leading consumer groups like Consumers Union.

People should be able to know what they are eating. The bill before us today would exempt many genetically engineered (GE) foods from any labeling altogether and would preempt proconsumer state laws. including the engineered food labeling laws in Vermont. Connecticut. and Maine. I actively supported an effort to pass a GMO labeling law in my home state of Oregon. and I continue to support strong state efforts to stand up for transparency in the face of federal inadequacy or inaction. The bill also includes several vague standards. and its labeling requirements would allow corporations to decide how to give consumers access to GE information. including through the use of a smartphone or the internet. Making access to GE labeling information electronic and/or dependent on a smartphone is not transparent. accessible. or available to many Americans. S. 764 has been sold as a \"compromise\" because it would require some labeling. but these provisions are clearly just a fig leaf We need plain language. mandatory. onpackage labeling. and until federal law protects our right to know what we are eating. the federal government should not preempt state efforts to protect and inform their citizens. I continue to strongly support federallevel mandatory labeling for foods that contain GMOs. and Im an original cosponsor of Rep. DEFAZIOs Genetically Engineered Food RighttoKnow Act .

Although this bill takes an important step toward federal preemption. it does so at the expense of consumer transparency and safety. For example. S. 764 falls short of providing a robust definition of \"bioengineering\". which will exempt the majority of GMO foods from being properly labeled. Additionally. this bill will hurt the most vulnerable among us. The provision to include \"digital labeling\" will withhold valuable information about GMO foods from rural. lowincome and elderly Americans who are less likely to own a smart phone or have access to the internet. Thats over 50 percent of rural and 65 percent of elderly people who will not be able to access the consumer information they need. Mr. Speaker.

Working together. we put three bipartisan bills on the Presidents desk this last week alone. In this Congress. Mr. ENGEL and I. working together on the Foreign Affairs Committee. have seen some 14 bills signed into law. So he is right. this isnt the norm. Earlier this year. there were intense discussions with the minority on legislation to push back on Irans missile program. I compromised more than I wanted. inserting a waiver. We were close. but at the end of the day. it became clear that the White House would aggressively fight any legislation with the words \"Iran\" written on it. For the White House. it is accommodation of Iran at all costs. and that includes essentially giving the Supreme Leader the veto pen over steps Congress might press the administration to take. So on this. we are stuck. Until the Democratic leadership is ready to look past this Presidents legacy. I imagine we will be stuck. Lastly. I would note that these pieces of legislation are tightly focused on Irans behavior outside of the nuclear agreement. That is the point. Whether one was for the agreement or against the agreement. these are outside of the nuclear agreement. These bills do not undo or kill the Iran deal but. instead. press back on the administrations promises when campaigning for their deal. This goes to the issue of what we were told. what was in the talking points on the floor of the House. in terms of how this deal would be implemented and that it would not impact our ability to stop this ballistic missile testing by Iran and these other abuses.

Turkey still has 30.000 troops in Cyprus. Erdogan thinks he is still in control. The beauty of democratic elections is that you can see what the people really want. And faced with the choice between a candidate that wanted to keep Cyprus divided and one that wanted to reunify Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots chose reunification. It is encouraging to hear that negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are getting back on track. You know. I was a judge in my former life. I dealt a lot with one word: justice. And as a judge I would never have allowed the kind of bullying that is seen by Turkey. The Turkish Cypriots should be able to negotiate on their own behalf. If they want peace. they should be able to get it. They dont need another foreign country like Turkey telling them what they can and cannot agree to. They do not want to be dependent on Turkey. They want to enjoy the economic freedom of the EU. Reunification will require a lot of work. but ultimately it will only happen if the two sides talk to each other.

Matthew Polk is deeply involved in the preservation of cultural heritage and I believe his comments are both insightful and valuable to the ongoing effort to preserve the cultural heritage of civilizations around the world. Mr. Speaker. I first wish to thank Congressman Issa for his interest in this matter and the opportunity to provide a statement for the Congressional Record. With regard to H.R. 1493. I applaud this bipartisan effort to protect Syrian cultural property as well as to coordinate our Governments enforcement efforts to protect international cultural property. I also applaud Mr. Chabots and Mr. Engels understanding that this bill is not meant to target the lawful trade in Syrian or other cultural goods and that it only authorizes import restrictions on artifacts illegally removed from Syria after the start of its civil war. Nonetheless. it must be emphasized that the burden remains on the Government to prove that the artifact in question is illicit. While protecting Syrian cultural artifacts from looting is important. it is also important that we stay true to our own values. Our tradition of due process requires that the Government meet its burden of proof before private property may be seized or forfeited. This legislation does not change the burden placed on the Government under the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act. Here. as under the CPIA. the Government must establish: (1) the item is of a type that appears on the designated list of Syrian artifacts that will be created. (2) the item was \"first discovered\" in Syria and is subject to Syrian export control. and (3) the item was illegally removed from Syria after the effective date of the restrictions. which in this case is March 15. 2011. The fact that an objects \"country of origin\" or manufacture may be \"Syria\" cannot constitute the sole basis for its seizure and forfeiture under either this legislation or the CPIA. Sincerely.",

Dr. Billington has overseen the expansion of the Librarys collection size. It has roughly doubled. from 85.5 million items in 1987 to more than 160 million items today. Dr. Billington dedicated much of his efforts to ensuring that our nations historic items and collections be made readily available to the American public. In his early years. at the dawn of the internet age. he worked to facilitate an innovative program for the Library of Congress known as the National Digital Library (NDL) Program. which ensured that American historical and cultural information was available online. As a result of his efforts. projects such as the NDL. Congress.gov. and numerous pieces of information from the U.S. Copyright Office have become frequently used in K12 education systems across America. In addition to efforts ensuring the spread of the richly diverse history of the United States. Dr. Billington is also responsible for the development of the World Digital Library. A project similar to the NDL. the World Digital Library compiles cultural materials from the 193 countries listed in the UNESCO into one database for public access.

In February of 1988. antiArmenian rallies through Azerbaijan gave way to waves of ethnicallymotivated violence. death and destruction. In the aftermath of these terrible events. Azerbaijans Armenian community all but disappeared. with thousands displaced. culminating in a war against the people of Nagorno Karabakh. That war resulted in almost 30.000 dead on both sides. Hundreds of thousands of refugees were forced to flee their homes. And to this day. those who lost their lives or were displaced by this violence still seek resolution and justice. Many displaced Armenian families have sought refuge in America. and are now making vital contributions in the Fifth District of Massachusetts. Proudly. our diverse District is home to one of the largest Armenian communities in the nation. Together. our community is a thriving example of strength and perseverance in the face of extreme adversity.

Pennsylvania. the Sheetz brand has grown into one of the most well loved brands in the country. with 14.500 employees and 437 locations across six states. Their business has changed with the demands of the country. and they have brought us innovations like MTO sandwiches and touch screen ordering. which was first installed in Altoona back in 1993. Recently. the Sheetz family proudly opened their 500th store in Thomasville. North Carolinaover 400 miles away from where the business was first born 63 years ago in Central Pennsylvania. Originally called Sheetz Kwik Shopper. the companys success is a wonderful example of what makes this nation great. It all started E282 when Bob Sheetz purchased one of his fathers dairy stores. After hiring his brother. Steve. the pairs original business plan was to open one store a year by 1972. With 500 stores currently open across Pennsylvania. Maryland. Virginia. West Virginia. Ohio. and North Carolina. their plan was a resounding success. Five members of the Sheetz family serve on the companys executive committee including Bobs son as president. and Steve. as Chairman of the board. Despite all of their growth and expansion. it remains a family business to this day. That is why it is no surprise that the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development and Team Pennsylvania Foundation have named Sheetz one of the best places to work in Pennsylvania for the last 13 consecutive years. I want to thank the Sheetz family for their dedication to the community. and their friendly service to the thousands of families that visit their stores each day. I would also personally like to congratulate Sheetz on opening their 500th store. Their effort to turn the business into one of the fastest growing family operated convenience store chains in the world is remarkable. but is also no surprise to anyone who has met a member of the Sheetz family. With plans to open 1.000 total stores in the future. Sheetz is not slowing down. I am extremely proud to represent the Altoona area. and to be able to tell all of my colleagues on Capitol Hill that the 9th District is the birthplace of some of the best sandwiches in the country.",

I rise today. however. to point out the fact that we are in the midst not of an incipient epidemic but a real epidemic that since lunchtime today has killed 15 people in this country. Fifteen people have lost their lives since the middle of the day today. The epidemic I refer to. of course. is heroin and opiate drug abuse and addiction. This is a crisis which is upon us right now. A month or so ago. we passed with great fanfare the CARA bill. the comprehensive addiction bill. It was the right thing to do. It was a good bill. but it had no funding. Passing a bill like that with no funding is like sending the fire department to a fire with no water. We cannot deal with this problem until we have the capacity to provide treatment to the people who need it. Right now there is a huge shortage of treatment beds. There is even a shortage of detox beds. let alone treatment. When a person finally gets to the point where they are struggling with this terribly destructive disease and they are ready to embrace and take on the treatment. to not have it available or to have it available at an exorbitant cost is tragic. We are losing lives every hour47.000 people a yearand it is expanding and exploding. and it is tearing our communities apart. I am delighted that we invoked cloture on an amendment involving the Zika virus. It is important that we do so. But we also should be attending to this crisis that is staring us right in the face and is tearing our country apart. I hope we can soon get to an amendment that will allow us to begin the process of funding the resolution of this scourge before it takes more lives and before it tears apart more families and communities.

I think it is a good amendment. and I commend our leaders in the Appropriations Committee for reaching this bipartisan agreement. However. I join my colleague from Maine. my colleague from West Virginia. and all of those who are disappointed that the opioid epidemic is not being treated with the same degree of urgency. Some Senators on the other side of the aisle have said it is their preference to deal with the opioid epidemic through the regular appropriations process. Let me say that I am not encouraged by the results so far. With all due respect to my colleagues. an extra $1 million here and there for a few programs. which is what we are seeing in the appropriations process. is not going to address the nationwide crisis that Senator KING has said is going to kill tens of thousands of Americans this year. While the HHS appropriations bill is still being drafted. because of the tight budget caps that are in place for this fiscal year. I am not optimistic that it will include the type of gamechanging funding that we need to stem the tide of this crisis. Unfortunately. we saw that the Commerce. Justice. and Science appropriations bill included only minor increases to programs to address the heroin and opioid epidemic. That is why we need emergency funding. and we need it now. In March. the Senate had an opportunity to provide $600 million in emergency funding to address this crisis. but despite strong bipartisan support. that amendment was defeated on a point of order. Congress needs to rise to this challenge. just as it has done during previous public health emergencies and just as we are doing right now to address the Zika virus. Just last year Congress approved $5.4 billion to combat the Ebola outbreak. which killed one American. but in 2014. 47.000 Americans died from drug overdoses. Each day we wait. another 120 people die of drug overdoses. We are losing one person a day in New Hampshire. Now is the time to act. I urge my colleagues to reconsider. I yield the floor.",

Where we may have had a disagreement. my friend has shown he is a man of conviction regarding the detainees from Guantanamo coming to the United States of America. But he also understands fully the importance of the position of the Secretary of the Army. Senator ROBERTS and I have worked closely together on this years Defense Authorization Act to ensure the administration does not have the authority to release or transfer detainees on the mainland. Unfortunately. the administration has failed for over 7 years to present a substantive plan on how they intend to close Guantanamo Bay. to me. to the Congress. to my colleagues. or the American people. Thanks to Senator ROBERTS efforts. this years bill extends the prohibition to any reprogramming request to transfer or release detainees. These provisions confirm that President Obama will not be able to move detainees to the mainland of the United States of America in the coming year. I want to point out that I understand Senator ROBERTS emphasis and value that he places on Fort Leavenworth. Fort Leavenworth is the intellectual center of the United States Army. This is where General David Petraeus spent 2 years developing strategy for the surgeat Fort Leavenworth. This is where the upandcoming leaders of the U.S. Armyand other services as well. but primarily the U.S. Armygo to get their training. their intellect. and their ability to lead. So I can fully understand why my friend from Kansas would be adamantly opposed to the transfer of detainees to Fort Leavenworth. which would change the complexion and the makeup of that very important place in the past. present. and future of the U.S. Army. So I thank my colleague from Kansas for his agreement today. I would ask him to say a few words before I ask consent that this nomination be considered. Again. I appreciate my old friend whose passion. whose commitment to the people of Kansas is without equalwhich also accounts for the fact that they have sent him here to represent them on several occasions.

I would like to congratulate and honor the Polynesian Voyaging Society for its work in bringing about this significant endeavor to raise awareness of global sustainability while sharing traditional Polynesian navigation practices and creating global relationships through cultural exchanges. Hokulea will voyage over 60.000 miles to 100 ports in 27 nations. including 12 Marine World Heritage sites identified by the United Nations Educational. Scientific. and Cultural Organization. Established in 1973. the Polynesian Voyaging Society developed a new generation of Polynesian navigators. perpetuating the teachings of Master Navigator Mau Piailug from the island of Satawal in the Federated States of Micronesia. The Polynesian Voyaging Society is largely credited with revolutionizing the perception of Polynesianstyle voyaging as a sophisticated form of sailing and navigation. In 1976. the Polynesian Voyaging Society completed construction of the doublehulled voyaging canoe named Hokulea. which translates to \"star of gladness.\" Hokulea is the first traditional voyaging canoe to be built in Hawaii in over 600 years and has since served as a cultural ambassador of Hawaii to the world. Crew members observed patterns in the stars. sun. moon. wind. and ocean swells to guide Hokulea to Tahiti on her inaugural journey. The voyage demonstrated that Polynesian wayfinding methods could successfully be used to travel on longdistance journeys and revived a navigational method many assumed was lost. In 2013. Hokulea and her sister canoe Hikianalia embarked on a journey around the State of Hawaii before commencing a 36month worldwide voyage named Malama Honua. which means \"to care for our Earth.\" Since the journey began. Hokulea has visited 24 islands and six countries across Polynesia. Mauritius. South Africa. Brazil. and the East Coast of the United States. visiting States Florida. South Carolina. North Carolina. Virginia. New York. and Washington. DC. I extend my deepest congratulations to the Polynesian Voyaging Society and the crews of Hokulea and Hikianalia and wish them smooth sailing as they continue the Malama Honua Worldwide Voyage. I look forward to hearing of their many adventures upon completion of the voyage. and I encourage all of my colleagues to visit Hokulea while she is docked in Washington. DC.",

In the nearly three decades he served on the Supreme Court. he was renowned for his brilliant opinion. sharp wit. and engaging debate with attorneys. His dedication to a strict interpretation of the Constitution never wavered. and he was beloved by his colleagues on the Court. He promoted the real constitutional intent. for judges to interpret the law. not legislating undermining democracy. Nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and confirmed unanimously by the Senate. Justice Scalia was the Courts voice for opinions that upheld conservative values. such as the District of Columbia v. Heller. defending the right to bear arms by the Second Amendment. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife. Maureen. their children. and grandchildren. In conclusion.

I am not sure it really resonated to me at the time what the next 30 years would entail. I believe it is safe to say that not only is he one of the strongest conservative voices of our day. but he could be of all time. I think of his life and I think of the example that he left for all of us. whether in politics or not. It is one thing to be conservative. it is another thing to effective. He showed with his life that he did not have to compromise his principles or his values to be effective. When I look at his peers around him. Justice Ginsburg many times talked about the friendship and the relationship she had with him. It was genuine. He took Justice Kagan hunting. He taught her how to hunt. She killed her first big deer with Justice Scalia at her side. What does that tell me? It tells me something that we need to remember: you can connect with people. you can hold your values. but you can have a genuine love for your fellow man. There is much to be said about Antonin Scalias faith. Obviously. he lived it. but he lived it in a way that set an example for all of us. Yes. we get frustrated. It is okay to be angrysometimes vertically. but never horizontallywith our coworkers. our friends. our neighbors. and our family. He set the mark. He set it high.

General Dunford has spoken of the need for our military to take more aggressive action against the ISIL group that is operating inside Libya. General Campbell has spoken of the need to retain a sizable enough force in Afghanistan to accomplish the dual missions of both conducting counterterrorism operations and training and advising the Afghan security forces. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter has issued a budget request that seeks funding for the weapons systems and programs we will need to balance against the regional ambitions of China and Russia. In other words. some of the most senior national security officials within this administration are already working to better position the next President for the national security challenges we will face in 2017 and beyond. Yet President Obama seems to remain captured on one matter by a campaign promise he made in 2008his illconsidered crusade to close the secure detention facility at Guantanamo. Today we received the descriptions of where the President would like to detain terrorists within the United Statesthough not any actual proposed locationsdespite the fact that it would be illegal under current law to transfer foreign terrorists at Guantanamo into the United States. This isnt a case where the President can even try to justify the use of some penandphone strategy by claiming Congress failed to act. To the contrary. Congress acted over and over again in a bipartisan way to reject the Presidents desire to transfer dangerous terrorists to communities in the United States. The President signed all these prohibitions and his Attorney General recently confirmed that it is illegal for the President to transfer any of these terrorists into the United States. We will review President Obamas plan. but since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities. he should know that the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against that proposal.",

The most recent report from the Michigan Department of Community Health ranked The Information Center as best in the county and second best in the state for quality assurance in their work with seniors. Their tireless efforts have helped the citizens of Southeast Michigan with comprehensive. communitybased programs that help control the cost of care for our elders and provide peace of mind to our families.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize an outstanding landmark to community health and welfare. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the nations Community Health Center program Community Health Centers (CHC) are the family doctor to over 23 million Americans and. as such. are the largest network of primary care providers in the country. The CHC model is distinguished by its comprehensive range of health services. recognizing the particular needs and characteristics of the communities they serve. Community Health Centers are located exclusively in medicallyunderserved areas. providing needed care for communities and populations that do not have adequate access to care. Community involvement in CHCs is guaranteed by the requirement that Federal Qualified Health Centers must have governing boards of directors that have patients of the center holding at least 510% of the board seats. In the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts we are particularly proud because the nations first community health center opened in December 1965 on Columbia Point in Bostons Dorchester neighborhood. Drs. Jack Geiger and Count Gibson of Tufts Medical School founded the Columbia Point Health Center in order to meet the needs of the residents of an isolated public housing project. cut off from the Citys health resources. Drs. Geiger and Gibson opened a rural center shortly thereafter in the Delta region of Mississippi. From that start. the community health center program expanded throughout the country. In 1985. Columbia Point Health Center joined with the Neponset Health Center to form Harbor Health Services. Inc. And in 1990. the Columbia Point Health Center moved into a new building and was renamed Geiger Gibson Community Health Center in honor of the founders of the national movement. Mr. Speaker. there are now over 1.270 community health centers providing services at 9.000 sites across the country. CHCs have become the primary source of medical. dental. behavioral health. substance abuse treatment. social services and other community health services for neighborhoods and rural communities that would otherwise be inadequately served. And CHCs have also provided employment and career opportunities for thousands of local residents. Mr. Speaker. fifty years ago it all began in Dorchester. Massachusetts. I am proud to rise today to recognize and honor what has become a national model for providing services to our countrys underserved areas and urge my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the efforts of our Community Health Centers.",

Here is what they say: It is clearly spelled out in the agreement that both the European Union and the United States will refrain from reintroducing or reimposing the sanctionsnow they are talking about Annex II sanctionsand restrictive measures lifted under the agreement. It is understood that reintroduction or reimposition. including through extension of the sanctions and restrictive measures. will constitute significant nonperformance which would relieve Iran from its commitments to this agreement in whole or in part. My colleague Senator AYOTTE from New Hampshire yesterday asked Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew about this provision. They did not give a clear answer because there is no clear answer. Right now there is huge disagreement between the United States and Iran on the language in the agreement on whether. to what degree. these socalled snapback provisions will work or will undermine our national security interests. which is what I believe they will do. I have asked the administration to quit using that term. It is not in the agreement. The language makes clear that it is going to take years. There is no \"snap.\" If we ever use it. that is it for the agreement. They have not given the Members of this body a straightforward answer on that issue. We need to keep asking these kinds of questions. We need to keep doing our due diligence. but we need clarity.

Duchesne County is rich with natural resources and home to some of the States most majestic scenery. Thousands flock to the region each year to fish its streams. which include the Strawberry. Duchesne. Lake Fork. and Yellowstone Rivers. Even more enjoy its mountains. including Utahs highest. Kings Peak. which is 13.528 feet above sea level. Its vistas are breathtaking and its valleys are serene and beautiful. The county has a meaningful history that traces its roots to Native American culture. In fact. much of presentday Duchesne County was originally part of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservations. In the early 1900s. other settlers began arriving in the region after Congress passed the Dawes Act. To farm and make improvements to the land. the government offered these individuals 160 acres under the Homestead Act. Today. approximately 18.000 Utahns live in Duchesne County and contribute to its quality of life. Livestock and farming along with oil and natural gas resources continue to drive the local economy. Just like its early pioneers. Duchesne Countys citizens work hard not only to support their families. but also to make their communities and our State a wonderful place to live. Duchesne County captures the best of small town America. Its towns are charming and its people are dedicated and patriotic. I have always enjoyed visiting the many wonderful towns in Duchesne County and getting to know its citizens. Again. I wish to congratulate Duchesne County on the marking of its centennial.

As the population in Arizona continues to grow and innovative businesses increasingly settle in our State. we must ensure that we have the infrastructure in place to foster economic development. international trade and job creation.

It also funds the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy Start Initiative. This program helps moms and infants get access to primary and preventative health care to reduce infant mortality rates.

This funding will help reduce youth violence. tackle crime hot spots controlled by gangs and rampant with gun violence. and reduce methamphetamine and heroin trafficking. There is additional funding for drug. mental health and veterans courts to break the cycle of drug use and criminal behavior.

He came home and started fighting for others who served. helping countless veterans through his work at DAV. Over the past 2 decades. he has played a role in crafting major veterans legislation. and his work has affected policies at the VA. the Department of Labor. the Department of Defense. and other Federal agencies.

This bill could not be more timely. given the depredations of ISIS that we see played out on our TV screens when we turn on the nightly newsthe horrific beheadings and killing of Christians and other religious minorities such as Yezidis by Islamist fanatics.

As millions of Americans remain without work. while others are underpaid or underemployed. it is imperative that we address the growing threat to our country that is income inequality. Since the 1970s. we have witnessed a dangerous trend develop where wage growth for middle and lower income households has become stagnant while incomes at the very top continue to rise sharply. From 1973 to 2005. real hourly wages for the top 10 percent rose by 30 percent or more. whereas the bottom 50 percent of all Americans experienced only marginal real wage increases of a little more than 5 percent. The income gap is further amplified when comparing races. Overall. Caucasian males earn a median income of more than $40.000 per year while African American males average roughly $30.000 during the same time period. Hispanic Americans average just over $26.000 each year. These discrepancies by race are particularly alarming. considering that these figures are even lower for women. The percentage of wealth controlled by the richest Americans is another disturbing fact that is often overlooked. The top 1 percent of Americans own 40 percent of our entire nations wealth. while the bottom 80 percent of Americans share only 7 percent of the nations wealth. In historical terms. the last time our nation faced such a wide income gap was during the 1920s leading up to the Great Depression. Mr. Speaker. while Congress struggles with raising the minimum wage. millions of working individuals and families across the country continue to struggle with stagnant pay and rising inflation. Until we take a serious look at comprehensive reform to curb income inequality. the consequences will continue harming our communities of color. and prove catastrophic for our nations economy.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. last night the Senate voted to advance the Housepassed FISA bill. We will have a vote on that legislation as soon as we can. On our way there. we should take some commonsense steps to ensure the new system envisioned by that legislationa system we would soon have to rely upon to keep our country safewill. in fact. actually work. The amendments filed last night would help do just that. For example. one amendment would ensure that there is adequate time to build and test a system that doesnt yet exist. One amendment would ensure that there is adequate time to build and test a system that doesnt even exist yet. Another would require that once the new system is actually built. the Director of National Intelligence reviews it and certifies that it actually works. I will say that again. The second amendment would require that once the new system is actually built. the Director of National Intelligence reviews the new system and certifies that it will actually work. Amendment No. 3 would require simple notification if the providers decide to change their dataretention policies. It will just require them to notify us if the providers decide to change their dataretention policies. Three amendments to improve the bill. These fixes are common sense. and whatever one thinks of the proposed new system. there needs to be basic assurance that it will function as its proponents say it will. The Senate should adopt these basic safeguards. I had hoped to see committees working hard to advance bipartisan. compromise FISA legislation this week. which is why I had offered several temporary extensions of the existing program to allow the space for that to occur. But these proposed shortterm extensions were either voted down or objected to. including a very narrow extension of some of the least controversial tools contained within the program that we are considering. So this is where we are. It now falls on all of us to work diligently and responsibly to get the American people the best outcome that can be reasonably expected in this reality with which we are confronted. That is my commitment. and I know many of my colleagues share it as well. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

That family has had more than its share of tragedy. but what it has produced is. in the case of Beau Biden. an extraordinary public servant who served his country not only by elected office but by serving in uniform as well. Most of us in this Chamber know the Biden family. The dad and the now moM. JOE and Jill. are extraordinary human beings who have contributed so much. It is not necessarily easy to be in public service as long as the Vice President has been and still raise a family that is so extraordinarily accomplished and contributes so much. Then to have that eldest son taken from him is like a dagger into our hearts. So we grieve with the family. We grieve for them and with the Nation. I just wish to put that on the record.",

Would any Member of the Intelligence Committee be on the floor battling to keep this program. if. in fact. in our oversight capacity. we had looked at a program that was absolutely worthless? Would we expend any capital to do that? The answer is. no. we wouldnt. We are down here battling on the floor. those of us either on the committee or who have been on the committee since 9111. because we have seen the impact of this program. We know what it has enabled us to do and we know what happens when we get a trove of technology in our hands that gives us the ability to see whether it was tied to somebodywhether we knew about them or we didnt. The fact is. when you have groups such as ISIL today. that are saying on social media: Dont come to Syria. stay in the United States. stay in Europe. go buy a gun. here are 100 law enforcement officers. here are 100 military folks. that is how you can carry out the jihad. it makes the use of the tool we are talking about even more important because no longer do we get to look at nofly lists. no longer do we get to look at individuals who have traveled or who intend to travel to Syria. It is individuals who grew up in neighborhoods that we never worried about. And the only way we will be able to find out about them is if we connect the conversation they have had or just the fact that a conversation took place. and then law enforcement can begin to peel the onion back with the proper authoritiesthe proper court orderto begin to look at whether this is a person we need to worry about.

Before I yield. let me just restate what the Senator from Florida asked me. which was. geez. we need a longer transition period and we need something addressed on the data that is held. I say for my colleagues that there will be three votes at some point. One will be on a substitute amendment. It has the exact same language as the USA FREEDOM bill. It makes two changes to the USA FREEDOM bill. It has a requirement that the telecoms notify the government 6 months in advance of any change in the retention program for their data. which I think is very reasonable. The second would be that it requires the Director of National Intelligence to certify. on whatever the transition date is. that the software that needs to be provided to the telecoms has been provided so that search can go through. In addition to that. there will be two other amendments. The first will deal with expanding the transition period from the current 6 months in the USA FREEDOM bill to 12 months. Again. I would have preferred 24 months. We have settled on 12 months. The last thing is that it would change the current amicus language in the bill to reflect something provided to us by the courts. It was the courts recommendation that we change it. This would be easier to fit within a program that has a time sensitivity to it. So as we go through the debate today. as we go through tomorrow. hopefully we will have three amendments that pass. and we can report this bill out shortly after lunch tomorrow if everything works well.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Medicare and Social Security are our nations sacred trusts with seniors and disabled Americans. Senior citizens in New Jersey and E952 across the county have worked hard throughout their lives to provide for their families and help build our communities. all while making their fair and full contributions of taxes into the programs. It is our duty to respect these sacrifices and ensure that programs continue to deliver on promises made. To that end. I was proud to cosponsor and support todays House passage of H.R. 1190. the Protecting Seniors Access to Medicare Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation would completely repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). an unelected and unaccountable board of fifteen bureaucrats who would possess the power to determine what to pay doctors who provide critical treatments and services under Medicare. Created under the fundamentally flawed and wildly unpopular Affordable Care Act (ACA)or ObamacareIPABs recommendations would be considered under fast track procedures that would limit critical Congressional input and oversight. Whether or not it is called rationing. IPABs mandated focus on shortterm savings could result in deep cuts to physician payments and ultimately lead doctors to stop seeing Medicare beneficiariesseriously undermining seniors healthcare decision making process and jeopardizing their access to lifesaving and quality care. The repeal of IPAB will allow Congress to continue focusing on policies to ensure that Medicare is sustainable for both current and future generations. Last week I was pleased to support four billsH.R. 2505. H.R. 2507. H.R. 2570. and H.R. 2582that strengthen and improve Medicare Advantage (MA). These bills will ensure increased transparency and accessibility to the popular MA program which provides millions of Medicare beneficiaries with affordable. comprehensive. and innovative care plans. Medicare is an absolutely critical component for the delivery of affordable. quality healthcare services for American seniorsand I will continue to advocate for legislation that properly supports Medicare. Seniors and disabled individuals deserve better than an unelected board of bureaucrats that will only serve to cut payments. ultimately resulting in the denial of certain treatments and services and reduced access to care. Congress must remain focused on solutions that ensure Medicare is sustainable for current and future generations. and the repeal of IPAB is critical first step.",

My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Charleston. South Carolina. the members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. pastored by the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. who was one of nine persons slain by a gunman motivated by hate. Although tragedy has found its way into the lives of the individuals murdered and the lives of their families there has been some good found in this tragic loss. Mr. Speaker. the legislature of South Carolina has decided to debate whether to remove the flag from the front of the State House building after public support from prominent legislators. community organizations. and the Governor of South Carolina have called for the flag to come down now. When considering the removal of the flag the people must remember the nine lives that were lost due to senseless. insensitive. and hateful feelings that were influenced by the traditions represented by the Confederate flag. The Confederate flag has been used as a symbol of hate. exclusion. and a brutally offensive past. South Carolina should follow in the footsteps of Texas which refused to authorize license plates with the confederate flag on them. a decision upheld last week by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker. Wal Mart. Amazon. Sears. and eBay all have made a decision to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise. The Confederate flag does not represent the future of our great country. We must embrace a spirit of inclusion and goodwill with a mission to eradicate hate and ignorance. We can no longer allow our past to dictate our future. and must use this tragedy as an opportunity to eliminate symbols of hate that permeate through our society. E954 Mr. Speaker. as a country we must recognize the emotional pain attached to the Confederate flag. stand strong together and not allow a symbol of hate continue to divide our nation.",

This March alone. the Bank financed over $1.1 million dollars in exports in my South Texas District. Additionally. the Bank has supported thousands of jobs in my district over the past five years. These are good jobs in a very highneed area that would not have been possible without the Bank.

He succeeded in everything that he touched. from neighborhood arbitration. to secretary of state. to Lieutenant Governor. and. of course. the Nation remembers him as Governor and as one who articulated the principles not of the Democratic Party. but of the entire country at a Democratic Convention.

I left to come to Congress in 1990. so I am fortunate to have served in the legislature 16 of the 20 years that he served in the executive branch. And in 1983. when I became chairman of the Education Committee. I really got to know him and to speak to him and to understand what everyone that has spoken has already said. Above all. this man never forgot. and he understood how important it was for him to be the son of an immigrant family. So he wanted everyone else to have the same opportunity. Yes. he was eloquent. Yes. he had to be a great human beingafter all. he was a minor league baseball player and was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates. I believe. to play ball. that alone makes him a great guy. But he was an eloquent man who also remembered his humble beginnings in the grocery store. having to work to get through law school. to be able to understand. So when I stood in front of him as one who had been born an American citizenbut a lot of people forgot along the way that we were and treated us in a different wayhe understood. There was that simpatico that he had with him. where he understood where we came from and what we needed. And I am just so honored to have served all those years with Mario Cuomo and to have considered him a friend. When I went to his funeral. Matilda was just so gracious because she wrote a book once where she asked people to write about who had influenced them. And I wrote about a certain gentleman in the Bronx who had played major role in my starting my public career. And she remembered that. And I. once again. offer my condolences to the Cuomo family.

At a time when our national dialogue was dominated by those seeking to leave working families to fend for themselves. Governor Cuomo outlined a different vision. Through his policies as Governor and his evocative speaking abilities. he articulated our moral obligation to care for one another while working toward a society that benefits all Americans. not only the affluent and powerful. All of us remember his famous words from the Democratic convention in San Francisco. Questioning conservatives rosecolored view of the Nation. he noted we were becoming too much a \"tale of two cities.\" rather than a \"shining city on a hill.\" That speech crystallized the differences in competing philosophies between those who believe Americans can do more to help one another and those who think our Nation has already reached its greatest heights and cannot further improve. However. just as he was serving as an intellectual lodestar for progressive and liberals nationally. Mario Cuomo remained dedicated to improving New Yorkers lives. A son of Queens. in many ways. he reflected the aspirations and dreams of that boroughs residents. Today. Queens is where families of all backgroundsLatinos. Asian. Italian. and Greek immigrantsconverge to secure a decent. affordable place to live. In todays political landscape. we could all benefit from remembering those words. In todays cynical environment. many have forgotten the tremendous good our government can achieve in pursuing justice. creating opportunity. and caring for neighbors in need. Governor Cuomo made many contributions. but that may be among his most important. He provided the intellectual framework to remind us that we have more to do. that our Nation can be better. and that we cannot afford to leave our fellow New Yorkers and Americans behind. For ensuring these ideas remain part of our national conversation. all of us owe him a debt and all of us appreciate his decades of steadfast service.

Mario Cuomo. Mr. Speaker. like many other members of the New York delegation. I also served in the New York State Assembly. But unlike most. I didnt get the opportunity to serve alongside Governor Mario Cuomo. I arrived several years after he had completed his three terms in office. So I speak today not from the perspective of someone who served in government alongside Mario Cuomo. but as a young man who grew up in Mario Cuomos New York. What an opportunity to be able to come of age in the 1980s with a Governor. a leader. who articulated such an eloquent vision of equal protection under the law for everyone. What an opportunity to be able to come of age under a Governor who believed in opportunity for everyone. who recognized that New York States greatest strength was our diversity from every community. every perspective. and every religious background. It was great to be able to come of age and look up at a Governor who. notwithstanding the political potential pitfalls. stood on principle. was ahead of his time as it relates to his firm opposition to the death penalty at a time when that was not a popular position to take. He was a great leader. a charismatic intellectual. a wonderful family man. a tremendous lawyer. and a wonderful statesman and Governor. I can only imagine that when Mario Cuomo arrived up in Heaven he was prepared to get to work. But I think that there was probably a greeting committee that was there at the gates of Heaven. one of whom was FDR. a former Governor of the State of New York. the other of whom was FDRs cousin. Teddy Roosevelt. two former great Governors of the State of New York. And I think they probably ushered Mario Cuomo to a place in front of the throne of glory where Almighty God Himself may have said to Governor Cuomo: Listen. you can take your suit off and put this robe on. Governor Cuomo. you can rest now. You have been faithful over a few things. You can rest now. Well done. My good and faithful servant. well done.",

Despite what some would have you believe. Mr. Chairman. this bipartisan bill is not about fundamentally changing the Clean Air Act. Nothing in this bipartisan bill changes any air quality standard or regulation. Nothing in this bipartisan bill puts cost before science when EPA sets a new standard. This bipartisan bill is about carefully thoughtout. commonsense reforms. It is about listening to State regulators who actually had to make EPAs rules work for the people. The people I work for back home are full of common sense. Common sense says that EPA should put out guidance to follow a new rule at the same time they put out the rule. Folks in Texas 22 and across America are puzzled. What is wrong with EPA putting out a complete package of rules and regulations together instead of a rule first followed by regulations 7 years later? That is not common sense. That is a road to failure. a road we are going down right now. As Dr. Bryan Shaw. the top regulator for air quality in my home State of Texas. said. provisions in this bipartisan bill will \"allow States to focus their limited resources\" to implement EPAs previous ozone rule. We can continue to improve Texas airand the air of every Stateif we let our regulators do their jobs. I carefully wrote this bipartisan bill to include more common sense. Let EPA consider achievability when issuing a new rule. This is not a mandate. I ask my opponents to read this bipartisan bill. Read the language. It clearly says the EPA may consider achievability when they set a new standard. This provision will never allow EPA to set an unhealthy standard. They cant use cost to ignore science.

I rise today in support of H.R. 4775. the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016. so States will have the flexibility and tools to reasonably and effectively meet the new EPA ozone standards. Since the proposal of EPAs 2008 ozone standards. States have continually worked to implement air quality standards to comply with EPAs clean air requirements. However. EPAs implementation regulations for the 2008 standards were not published until March 6. 2015. and then the revised ozone standards were issued in October of 2015. States now face the prospect of simultaneously implementing two ozone standards at the same time. H.R. 4775 remedies this problem by creating a phasein approach to the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards. extending the final designations under the 2015 standards to 2025. It would also make reforms to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards to provide flexibility and structure to actions taken to implementing and revising these standards. States should be given the flexibility to implement air quality standards in a way that is cost effective and efficient. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for introducing this bill.

I would like to focus. in particular. on what this bill really does for the timeline of implementing ozone standards. H.R. 4775 focuses on efficient implementation of ozone and other air quality requirements by making commonsense adjustments to facilitate how air quality standards are implemented. based on practical experience. Our legislation provides States with additional time to implement the 2015 standards which is needed to fully implement the 2008 ozone standards. since EPA only issued the implementing regulations in 2015. Further. H.R. 4775 allows EPA time to develop the new implementing regulations and guidance needed for the 2015 standards. and also allows EPA to clear its existing backlog of hundreds of implementation plans relating to other existing standards. Clean air remains our priority. and this legislation does not change the recent new ozone standard of 70 parts per billion. It does not change of the standards set by the agency for any other criteria pollutants. Instead. it ensures that hundreds of counties are not unnecessarily subjected to additional regulatory burdens. paperwork requirements. and restrictions. EPA projects that. based on 20122014 data. over 240 counties with ozone monitors would violate the 2015 standards. but they are already on track to meet those standards by 2025. It makes no sense to sweep these counties into unnecessarily burdensome \"nonattainment\" regulatory regimes. EPA has estimated compliance costs for 2008 beginning in 2020 of $7.6 billion to $8.8 billion annually. On top of these costs. EPA estimates compliance costs for the 2015 standards beginning in 2025. of $2 billion annually. including $1.4 billion outside California. and $800 million in California. However. EPAs own estimate may be too low. since they have admitted that in some places. most of or even all of the technology that will be needed to meet this rule has yet to be invented. What this legislation postpones is the diversion of State resources from the most pressing challenges to meet a standard that EPA projects will be met anyway through measures already on the books.

The proposed changes to the NAAQS review cycle would put lives at risk by permanently delaying updates to limits on not just ozone. but on every dangerous criteria air pollutant: carbon monoxide. lead. nitrogen oxides. ozone. particulate matter. and sulfur dioxide. Mr. Chairman. the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review the science every 5 years and to update the standards when necessary to protect the public health. It is important to note that the EPA isnt required to update the NAAQS every 5 years. but to just review the science. The 2015 ozone standard. Mr. Chairman. reflects strong scientific evidence regarding the harmful effects of ozone on human health and the environment. including more than 1.000 new studies. Scientists. Mr. Chairman. are constantly researching the impacts that air pollution have on human health. and have consistently discovered that ozone. particle pollutants. and other types of air pollution covered by the Clean Air Act are. indeed. harmful in more ways and at lower concentration than previously understood. Mr. Chairman. this bill would ignore all this scientific work and evidence by doubling the review period from 5 years to 10 years. delaying the review of science and potentially necessary updates to the standard. Mr. Chairman. 10 years is too long to wait to protect public health from levels of ozone. particle pollution. and other pollutants that the science shows are. indeed. very. very. very dangerous.

States will now have to deal with two regulations with overlapping implementation schedules. This is Federal bureaucracy at its finest. Mr. Chairman. Now that the EPA is moving full steam ahead on its regulatory freight train. in order to get States back on track. Congress must act to give them certainty. H.R. 4775 will phase in implementation of those ozone standards over a reasonable timeline. As ozone continues to fall to levels that reflect naturally occurring and even foreignsource ozone. we must also insist that the EPA report on how foreign pollution affects compliance with its overburdensome regulations. This legislation will do just that. Mr. Chairman. There is no denying that the EPAs regulations will be costly for the States and costly. in turn. for our economy. The lower ozone levels are mandated. the harder it is for economic development to occur. Thats just the way it is. as TED POE would say.

The second study relates to ozone formation and the effective control strategies for that. These studies will assist EPA and State regulators in better understanding background ozone and implementing ozone standards. In its estimate for H.R. 4775as you know. we must always consider costthe Congressional Budget Office estimated a cost of $2 million associated with the development of these studies. My amendment would clarify that no additional funds are authorized by this legislation. Developing the studies required by this bill is part of EPAs job and can be covered by the Agencys existing budget. I might point out that the Presidents clean energy plan. which was implemented by EPA. never passed the House of Representatives. never passed the U.S. Senate. and was never even considered by the United States Congress. Yet. EPA issued that clean energy plan without any additional appropriations. I can tell you. it cost millions of dollars to do it. This small amount to come up to reprogram funding within EPA to require these studies I do not believe is much of a burden on EPA. EPAs budget for regulatory activity is over $2 billion annually. These are analyses EPA should have already been undertaking as part of its existing responsibilities. This amendment simply says we are not appropriating additional money.

It has handled more than 750.000 complaints against big financial institutions. against payday lenders. and against college loan services that are cheating people and that are tricking people. So what is the response? Well. it is helping the American people. but it is costing a handful of the biggest financial institutions in this country real money. and they are trying to find a way to make sure the consumer agency doesnt do its job.

Since its founding. the United States has offered refuge and protection to the worlds most vulnerable. Time and time again. those refugees were Jews. Whether fleeing the pogroms in Tzarist Russia. the horrors of the Holocaust or persecution in Soviet Russia or Iran. our relatives and friends found safety on these shores. We are therefore alarmed to see so many politicians declaring their opposition to welcoming refugees. Last months heartbreaking attacks in Paris and Beirut are being cited as reasons to deny entry to people who are themselves victims of terror. And in those comments. we. as Jewish leaders. see one of the darker moments of our history repeating itself. They go on to talk about the United States turning away the SS St. Louis in 1939. and 900 Jews were sent back to Europe. The Holocaust Museum tells us that 200 of them perished in the Holocaust because the United States refused to accept them as refugees. They end by saying: As Rabbis. we take seriously the biblical mandate to \"welcome the stranger.\" We call on our elected officials to uphold the great legacy of a country that welcomes refugees.

Senator ERNST joined the U.S. Army Reserves as a second lieutenant upon her graduation from Iowa State University. After 9 years in the Army Reserves. she transitioned to the Iowa National Guard to continue her dedicated service to this Nation. As a logistics specialist. Senator ERNST has held numerous positions of authority throughout her career. culminating in command of the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion. the largest in the Iowa National Guard. On February 10. 2003. while serving as commander of the Iowa National Guards 1168th Transportation Company. Senator ERNST was called to Active Duty and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. For 14 months. Senator ERNST and her fellow Guard members delivered vital supplies to coalition forces in support of the war effort. Her combat service was a key element in enabling a highly mobile allied force to sustain combat operations. While this chapter of her career has come to a close. Senator ERNST continues her dedication to service. As the first woman elected to Congress from Iowa and the first female combat veteran in the Senate. Senator ERNST has fought tenaciously for our military and veterans through her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee and on legislation she has authored and sponsored over this past year. I have no doubt that she will continue to be a strong voice for servicemembers. veterans. and their families in the years ahead. Today I honor Lieutenant Colonel ERNST for her 23 years of dedicated service to the U.S. Army Reserve and the Iowa National Guard. Her service in support of this Nation has been exemplaryand her mission continues. I look forward to working with Senator ERNST for years to come as we tackle the many challenges ahead.",

The ExIm Bank is an independent. selfsustaining executive branch agency with one mission. to foster American job growth by helping American companies with the tools they need to compete in the global marketplace. In short. the ExIm Bank provides the business community the certainty it needs to compete in overseas markets and grow jobs at home. Why am I so supportive of the ExIm Bank and its reauthorization? In my district alone. in the month of May. the ExIm Bank provided $3.8 million worth of Nebraskas export goods into the global marketplace. companies as large as Valmont Industries. one of the largest manufacturers of center pivot irrigation systems in the world. and companies as small as Volcanic Peppers. that in a small kitchen produced hot sauce that is exported to Australia. In fiscal year 2014. the ExIm Bank supported approximately $107 million in Nebraska exports. 49 percent of which went to Nebraska small businesses. Since 2007. the Bank has supported $230 million in exports from 52 Iowa companies and $550 million in exports from 39 Nebraska companies. This translates into American private sector jobs in every district of this country. In real terms. the ExIm Bank helps to level the playing field for both large and small businesses who export products abroad. Simply put. there is no rational reason. Mr. Speaker. for allowing American products and American goods to have a disadvantage in the global marketplace. Congress must reauthorize the ExIm Bank immediately. and I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make this happen.",

Mr. Chairman. this is not just a political issue. This is not just a partisan issue. This is also a moral issue. Just last week. in a landmark encyclical. Pope Francis himself warned of the grave implications of climate change when he stated: Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental. social. economic. political. and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. There is an urgent need to develop policies so that. in the next few years. the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced. I urge all of my colleagues.

I would like to say that. obviously. you cant have a discussion about this regulation without climate change. and frequently. we hear that climate change is responsible for every extreme weather condition. I would point out that The Economist magazine. in its May 5 issue. stated that it is impossible to say categorically that climate change has caused any individual storm. flood. drought. heat wave. tornado. or hurricane. Scientists agree that it is impossible to say that. Mr. Chairman. I would like to make one other comment. The President of the United States believes that climate change is the number one issue facing mankind. All of us recognize that the climate has been changing since the beginning of time. but where we fundamentally disagree with the President is we think there are other. more pressing issues dealing with poverty. creating jobs. economic growth. access to clean water. access to health care. and fighting diseases like pancreatic cancer. We think those are more urgent. But this President has got 61 individual government programs and is spending $23 billion a year on climate change in addition to trying to push regulations like this without any involvement of Congress.

Ignoring the impact of climate change will heap huge costs on taxpayers. This bill is a disservice to America. And in addition to being very costly to consumers. it shirks our responsibility for addressing the costly impacts of the changing climate. The bill we are considering today shows that the Republicans plan is to just say no and to let our children and grandchildren suffer the consequences of the changing climate without doing anything meaningful to protect them. This position is indefensible. and it will prove very costly. indeed. Todays bill would essentially amend the Clean Air Act to give a free pass to States that refuse to comply with the requirements of the clean power plan. Unless we work together to meet the modern challenge of the changing climate. this is going to be very expensive for our friends back home. especially in States like mineFlorida. Here are some of the huge costs we are looking at already: rising property insurance rates and flood insurance rates because of extreme weather events. Federal emergency aid that we have to pay out for things like Superstorm Sandy and other storms. tornadoes. electrical storms. tropical storms. drought. fire. and extreme heat. In addition to property insurance and flood insurance. property taxes are going to go up because our local communities are going to be saddled with the cost of repairing storm water infrastructure and addressing drinking water. This is going to be very expensive. In Florida. we already see saltwater intrusion into our drinking water aquifers because of rising tides. There is a terrible drought in California. These are going to require very expensive solutions unless we tackle it on the front end. And I am fearful that there will be economic harm to coastal communities like mine in the Tampa Bay area where we will have to pay more to renourish our beaches and take care of the lifeblood of our economy. which is tourism. fishing. for a beautiful. healthy economy.

The clean power plan is an important step in that direction. It is very disappointing to hear such a \"cant do\" attitude. We have always been a nation that tackles big problems rather than denying them. Many States have already achieved significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions through regional carbon trading. renewable portfolio standards. energy efficient programming. and investments in clean energy. My home State has made great strides. And if there is a flaw in the proposed rule. it is that the proposal asked States that have already done a lot to reduce their emissions and modernize their electric grids to do even more. By contrast. the requirements on the States that have resisted change and have done far less. are asked only to get started. This bill invites some States to continue to avoid doing their fair share to address the serious environmental and economic threat posed by climate change. New York State will continue to work on this problem. as will a number of other States that have already taken the steps that I mentioned earlier. but it would be nice if our neighbors also helped to address the problem that we all had a role in creating. This bill should be defeated. It certainly will not go far in the Senate. and it would not get signed by our President. Its consideration is. indeed. a waste of time. We should be using our time to find real solutions to the problems we all face. This bill offers no solutions. just another way to avoid addressing our problems. With that.

As a result. the continued operation of this facility creates the impression in the eyes of our allies and our enemies alike that the United States selectively observes the rule of law. There is no reason that we should impose upon ourselves the legal and moral problems arising from the prospect of indefinite detentions at Guantanamo. Working through civil courts since 9111. hundreds of individuals have been convicted of terrorism or of terrorismrelated offenses and are now serving long sentences in Federal prison.

Since the passage of last years landmark VA reform legislation. the VA has demonstrated disturbingly little progress on addressing the emergency medical care claims processing backlog that is hurting our veterans. I requested data earlier this year on the VAs progress in fiscal year 2015. I was shocked to find that. as of late March of this year. only 14 percent of the claims originating from VISN 16. including my home State of Louisiana. have been processed within 30 days. That is abysmal. No employee at any business in Louisiana or anywhere around this country would be given a bonus with such a poor success rate. Mr. Chairman. it is high time the VA starts demanding a higher standard from its employees. My amendment is fairly simple. It prevents this agency from granting bonuses to its emergency medical care claims processing staff until the percentage of emergency medical care claims processed within 30 days reaches 90 percent. This is just unacceptable behavior. Time and time again. we have asked the VA and have worked and legislated to get them to clean up their act. Our veterans are suffering. and this is no way to treat them. That is why I have offered this amendment. Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Hofmann. a lifelong Californian. has spent most of the past three decades working to promote philanthropy. educational and artistic initiatives. and wildlife conservation. In 1990. Mr. Hofmann purchased Rancho Esquon. a sprawling agricultural property in Butte County. and began working to restore its natural habitat. Today. the ranch boasts over 900 acres of wetlands. is home to more than 20.000 trees and 173 species of birds. and serves as a valuable educational resource. Over 4.000 students have taken class field trips to Rancho Esquon. many of whom have returned to visit the sites egg salvage facility. Today. to further expose and educate regarding the importance of our wetlands. Mr. Hofmann is in the process of building the Pacific Flyway Center. a worldclass museum and zoo facility in Suisun Marsh. The Center is dedicated to inspiring conservation of the Pacific Flyway. a critical migratory route stretching from Alaska to Patagonia. Every year. at least one billion birds migrate along the Flyway. and its importance to waterfowl populations cannot be overstated. Upon completion. the Center will offer educational opportunities for local students and citizens. Mr. Hofmanns charitable organization. The Hofmann Family Foundation (HFF). has worked for over 20 years to help young people in need. In 1995. a $1 million donation from the HFF created the Concord Community Youth Center. which today provides educational and athletic opportunities for 1.900 underprivileged young people. And in 2014. Mr. Hofmann donated funds to create the De La Salle Academy. a division of De La Salle High School dedicated to providing highquality education for boys whose financial circumstances would otherwise prevent private schooling. By the end of 2016. the Academy will have 80 students enrolled in the fifth and sixth grades. Mr. Speaker. Kenneth Hofmann has dedicated his time and resources for nearly 40 years to enriching the lives of Californias young people and protecting its environment. Mr. Hofmanns efforts have benefitted our community enormously. and it is fitting and proper that we honor him here today.",

I represent coastal Alabama. and I have spent my entire life living on the Gulf Coast. Like many of my friends and neighbors. my family has always enjoyed fishing. swimming. boating. and spending time in the Gulf of Mexico. It is safe to say that living on the Gulf becomes a way of life. For some people. the Gulf also provides for economic wellbeing. whether through the commercial seafood industry. tourism. or something else. No one is a better steward of the shores and our waters than those of us who live and work in the Gulf. Since the water provides our way of life and our economic wellbeing. we are going to do everything we can to protect and preserve our resources. We dont need the Federal Government to tell us what to do. That is why I am so concerned by the National Ocean Policy. which was created under President Obamas Executive Order No. 13547 in 2010. The policy requires that various bureaucracies work together to \"zone the ocean\" and the sources thereof. largely affecting the ways in which we utilize our ocean resources. The National Ocean Policy is executive overreach at its very worst. The policy not only restricts ocean and inland activities. but it redirects Federal money away from congressionally directed priorities for over 20 Federal agencies that meet as part of the National Ocean Council. tasked with implementing the National Ocean Policya council that has no statutory authority to exist and no congressional appropriation. Numerous and varied industries will suffer as a result of this wellmeaning but illconceived policy. including but not limited to agriculture. energy. fisheries. mining. and marine retail enterprises. just to name a few. Those who are affected most by the policy dont have a say or any representation in the rulemaking process.

I do not think that this is Federal topdown. In fact. I think this is better decisionmaking. bottomsup. not topdown. It gives opportunities for local communities to have an input. I want to unequivocally state that we spend no money on ocean planning. The NOP does not create any Federal regulations or supersede any local or State regulations. But what it does do is it leverages taxpayer dollars to reduce duplication between Federal. State and local agencies. to streamline data collection. and to strengthen public involvement. That is exactly what we want to have happen in our coastal communities. Our oceans and coasts support 3 million oceanrelated jobs. generate $360 billion through tourism. development. commercial fishing. recreational fishing. boating. energy. shipping. and other activities. This is a very effective planning tool to reconcile and coordinate those activities. It does not prevent them. And just in closing. I will say that my colleague from Alabama may look at this one way. but I represent the State of Maine. which has a tremendous amount of coastline. I represent about half the coastline off the coast of Maine. and I have also represented many coastal communities prior to coming to Congress as a State legislator. I live on an island. I take a ferry for 1 hour to get home. unlike virtually any other Member of Congress. Everybody in my community is dependent on the ocean. Every island I represent is dependent on the ocean. Every coastal community has to have a working waterfront. fishermen. It has to have tourism. fishing. all of them working together. I dont think that in the State of Maine we dont understand ocean planning. We know our oceans are desperately troubled. They are in danger. They need our attention. and Congress has to pay attention to that. We cant do this in a haphazard way. We have to have it coordinated.

USDA actually studied risk of oil spills on farms. It determined that more than 99 percent of farmers have never experienced a spill. In the 2014 Water Resources Development Act. we made modifications to the exemption threshold and required EPA to go back to the drawing board and conduct a study to determine how to balance the needs of financial resources of small producers with their assessed spill risk. Instead. the EPA defied Congress wishes and hastily put together a study without evaluating risk specific to agriculture. It offered the same unsubstantiated conclusions that it found in the original SPCC rule and could not cite a single incident of a spill on a farm. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. this amendment prohibits the EPA from enforcing its Spill Prevention. Control. and Countermeasure rule against farms. giving special interest to one industry. The EPAs spill rule is not based upon the type of facility or type of operations. but upon the storage of oil or petroleum products. If you store greater than 1.320 gallons and if a discharge from aboveground storage would reach waterways. you fall under these regulations and must develop and implement a spill prevention plan. Now. some large farm operations store up to 60.000 gallons of fuel in one location. and it is reckless to not require them to have some sort of spill response plan. EPA has already made efforts to accommodate farms and made compliance with the rule easier. The Agency amended its rule to provide a selfcertification option for the facilities. including farms that store under 10.000 gallons of oil. thereby avoiding the expense of a professional engineer. EPA also provided a template for a spill control plan for farmers to use. Compliance with this rule is not difficult or costly. In fact. about 95 percent of farms subject to the rule are eligible to selfcertify their spill prevention plans. This amendment could have devastating consequences and harmful impacts on our Nations waterways. Mr. Chairman. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.

Opioid use disorder is a chronic disease that can be effectively treated. but it requires ongoing management. As the current epidemic has drawn sharply into focus. significantly more resources are needed to ensure availability of and access to evidencebased treatment. A public healthbased approach to drug abuse and addiction requires having broadbased treatment services available for those with opioid use disorders. including both behavioral therapies and proven medicationassisted treatment and insurance coverage for such treatment. Medicationassisted treatment is often in combination with behavioral treatment. which has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of opioid addiction. However. many patients in need of treatment face significant barriers. Physicians cite barriers finding and placing patients in addiction treatment and recovery programs. Current capacity of treatment and recovery programs is inadequate to meet the populations needs. There are too few physicians and programs offering treatment and recovery services. In order to address these shortages. better information and data is needed for our existing opioid treatment infrastructure. H.R. 4982. the Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act. will direct the GAO to conduct a study on the inpatient and outpatient treatment capacity of the United States. It instructs the agency to examine the capacity of acute residential or inpatient detoxification programs. inpatient clinical stabilization programs. transitional residential support services. and residential rehabilitation programs. The GAO is directed to report on geographic differences in the availability of treatment and recovery programs for substance abuse disorders. the availability of programs that offer evidencebased treatment options. including the use of FDAapproved medications. and the number of patients different treatment settings. Finally. the agency would include an assessment of the need for residential and outpatient treatment for substance use disorders across the continuum of care. We must face this crisis headon and address the serious gaps in evidencebased treatment. The Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act will help us do this. I want to thank the bills sponsor. Representative BILL FOSTER. for introducing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the act. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Unfortunately. for most communities. local treatment facilities are few and far between and many of them are full. As a lifelong healthcare professional.

We need data. and we need to know what capacity we have in place and what capacity we need to treat this epidemic so that we can make smart and adequate investments. which is why we need this bill. This important bill directs a study of the inpatient and outpatient addiction treatment capacity and availability throughout the U.S.. as well as an assessment of the needed types and numbers of treatment options. It seems simple. but there is no better place to start than at the beginning. with an understanding of the addiction treatment infrastructure that we have versus the need for that infrastructure. When I was first elected to Congress. I was not prepared to hear the stories from family members who had lost a loved one due to substance abuse. My office often gets calls from parents wanting to share their stories of the children they have lost to addiction. While opioid addiction may start in many ways. it ends with a scientifically understood. increasingly treatable medical condition in which the biochemical pathways necessary to normal decisionmaking in the brain have been hijacked. and the chemistry of the brain permanently altered. The more we learn about the science of addiction. the more convinced we become that the best path forward is treating addiction like the medical. biochemical condition that it is. To do this successfully. we need the correct number and types of addiction treatment facilities. That is why I introduced the Examining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act of 2016. with my friend from New Jersey . We know that opioid use and abuse has become an epidemic. and now lets make sure that we know the real numbers we are dealing with so we can allocate the necessary resources.

Despite the fact that we are in the middle of an unprecedented opioid and heroin crisis. we know that treatment gaps continue to limit our ability to address the growing crisis. Only 1 in 10 people struggling with addiction receive any form of treatment. despite the fact that we have evidencebased. medicationassisted treatment for those struggling with prescription drug or heroin addiction. One available treatment is buprenorphine. The medication is safely prescribed from an office setting similar to any other medication a patient might take. Unfortunately. in the midst of our current opioid epidemic. currently. physicians are restricted to how many patients they are allowed to treat with this medication. and nurse practitioners and physician assistants are not allowed to treat patients with this medication at all. As a result. many patients are placed on prolonged waiting lists with addiction specialists as they await access to this treatment. This is not acceptable. We must significantly increase the cap of the number of patients a physician can treat. as well as permanently allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to treat patients with this medication. Todays legislation is not perfect. but it is the first step toward reaching bicameral. bipartisan agreement on a package that meets these goals.

This bill highlights the abuse of opioids that has become a public health epidemic. Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium. such as heroin and certain pain medications. H.R. 4981 would encourage and train health care providers to prescribe overdose reversal drugs. such as Naloxone. when they prescribe common opioidslike pain medication to patients at risk of addiction. The plague of opioid overdose deaths across the nation is disturbing. but there are ways to combat this trend. Any party receiving treatment assessments under this legislation will be privy to the following. 1. A treatment plan and periodic assessments. 2. Will also be subject to medication adherence and substance use monitoring. 3. Treatment options. including all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid use disorder. including their potential risks and benefits. 4. Receiving regular counseling services is critical to recovery. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 259 million opioid prescriptions were written in 2012. more than enough for every adult in the United States. Enacting this legislation will implement a diversion control plan that contains specific measures to reduce the likelihood of the diversion of controlled substances prescribed by the physician for the treatment of opioid use disorder. In 2013 nearly 4.5 million people in the United States without a valid medical need were using prescription painkillers. Both states and the federal government have begun responding to this growing public health crisis. The Obama administration has awarded $94 million to community health centers to improve and expand the delivery of substance abuse services. Mr. Speaker. the mounting number of people adversely affected and the over 25.000 lives lost expressly demonstrates the need for this type of legislation.

Whether you are prolife or prochoice. we have always agreed you dont use taxpayer dollars for the controversial practice of abortion. It is up to us to continue to stand with those we represent who dont believe their dollars should go to this. We are going to stand with our constituents against this terrible healthcare law because they have been hurt by higher prices. fewer doctors. and less affordable medicine. Frankly. this healthcare law has hurt too many Americans. We know now the path to repeal. We know how to remove the laws mandates. tax hikes. and slush funds. Now we just need a new President.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am embarking on completing my fourth year here in the United States House of Representatives. Four years ago I ran for the Congress. in part. to support the Affordable Care Act. There is a group of beneficiaries of the ACA that is often not discussed. and it is hospitals. I come from a part of northeastern Pennsylvania where the hospitals bore the bruntand this is true all over Americabore the brunt of having to treat uninsured patients. People would show up on the doorsteps of the hospital and have to be treated. Well. the hospital has to absorb that when they treat uninsured patients. So what we saw over and over in my district in northeastern Pennsylvania was hospitals were closing. I know why. I sat on the board of directors of a small hospital. When you absorb it and you absorb it and you absorb the uninsured care year after year. eventually they start cutting back on nurses. start cutting back on essential services. Finally. there is nothing left to cut and they close the hospital. That is a terrible detriment to your health care when your hospital is no longer 10 minutes away and it is 40 minutes away. That can be the difference between life and death. That is why the Affordable Care Act is something that I supported. We should not dismantle it. I urge Members to vote against this bill.",

Chairman PRICE and I were in my district talking to a number of physicians at the emergency room. They said: Not a thing has changed. but we are still taking care of the people just like we did before this terrible bill. Ever since I came to Congress. I have consistently heard from folks in the 12th District of Georgia about the burdens of ObamaCare and that Planned Parenthood should not receive one dime of their hardearned tax money. I have heard from a family of five whose previous healthcare policy was terminated and buying a new plan means their premiums will go from $700 to over $1.000. Those seeking treatment could not even pay their deductible. A smallbusiness owners premiums more than doubled and benefits have been reduced. An individual projects 16 percent of his income will go toward health care this year alone. This law is killing the economy. This law is crushing. Even worse. it is crushing Americans and American families and their ability to earn a good living. Is the sake of a political legacy worth all of this? I think not. After 6 years of failed policy. Americans deserve better. That is why I am proud to cast my vote to override the Presidents veto of the Restoring Americans Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. It is time to move forward in finding a costeffective and patientcentered plan for our citizens.",

The dirty little secret. which every Member of this House knows or should know. is that premiums have been going up consistently for a very long period of time. The issue is: How fast do they go up? If you look at this chart. you will find that. for employersponsored insurance. which is what most Americans are on. premium increases were huge between 2000 and 2010. before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. 9.5 percent. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act. those premium increases have dropped substantially. 4.8. now 2.7. When Members of Congress get up here and talk about premiums going up. ask yourself the question: How fast are they going up? Because before the Affordable Care Act passed. it was through the roof. and they have dramatically slowed. I said our Republican colleagues did the repeal part. but not the replace part. So they want to take out the part that has slowed down the premiums and go back to the day when you had skyrocketing premium increases. So we need to talk in a factbased conversation here on the floor of the House of Representatives. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Margaret Sanger. the founder of Planned Parenthood. once wrote: \"We dont want the word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro population. and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.\" You can see that is a little bit out of context. but there is no doubt that Margaret Sanger is connected with some of the ugliest periods in our countrys history involving racism or eugenics. Her endorsements of promiscuity and opposition to Christian teachings and sexual conduct are well known. To this day. Planned Parenthood counsels minors without parental consent.

This approach to again try to take away from the millions of people in Texas who are uninsured the right to be insured. to have insurance with preexisting conditions. and this horrible provision to defund Planned Parenthood. which is a health prospect and a health project that gives good health care to women. is absurd. Let me also say. Mr. Speaker. that we face some troubling times when people are unemployed. and Planned Parenthood has provided resources to those vulnerable women.

I think this is the chart that gets to the issue that is before us today the most. and that is what is our responsibility to our constituents. As I mentioned earlier. when this bill passed on the floor of the House in March of 2010 in a hyperpartisan vote. the American people opposed it. The fact of the matter is the American people oppose it by greater numbers now than they did back then. It is because they have seen its implementation. They know that their premiums have gone up. They know that their healthcare costs more. They know that they cant see the doctor that they want to see. They know that they cant go to the hospital or the clinic that they want to go to. They know that the quality of their health care is actually decreasing if they talk to their doctor. and they know that their choices have been harmed in so many ways. So this is a little chart here that demonstrates that 52 percent. according to Gallup in November of last year. oppose this bill. According to Fox. in August of last year. 54 percent opposed this bill. According to Quinnipiac. in July of last year. 52 percent opposed this bill. Those numbers only increase. Our responsibility. as Representatives of the people. is to represent them. That is what we are doing today. The President is standing in the way of the peoples wishes on this piece of legislation. The President is standing in the way of patientcentered health care. It is our job and our responsibility to stand up for the American people and the will of the American people.

In New Jersey alone. the cruise industry has generated over 7.500 jobs and $451 million in income. Traveling by cruise has changed the way Americans vacation.

She retired from Congressman Porters office in 1996 as the supervisor of constituent services. I first met Margaret while we were both working for Congressman Porter. She taught all who worked with her the important commitment to constituent services and lived by the premise that the constituent was always right unless proven wrong. Congressman Porter was known during his time in office for his excellent constituent service. much of this is due to the hard work and dedication of Margaret. as well as the training she provided to the staffers who worked with her.

All of this work is offered at no cost for survivors. In addition to her service at the helm for TAPS.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my concerns with S. 1177the Every Student Succeeds Act. I cast my vote in favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act because I believe it is an improvement from No Child Left Behind (NCLB). our nations current law. However. I strongly believe this legislation falls short in many areasspecifically resource equity. federal authority. and data disaggregation for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. While I am pleased that S. 1177 requires schools where students are consistently struggling to report on resource inequities. it does not hold states accountable for these inequities. States with dramatic investment disparities will be required only to identify gaps. not necessarily to close them. Additionally. this legislation significantly limits secretarial authority by relinquishing much of the responsibility for monitoring and enforcing protections for vulnerable students from the federal government to the states. History shows us that strong federal oversight compelled states to identify and address achievement gaps faced by minority and lowincome students. Without this strong oversight. I am concerned that these vulnerable groups will once again fall through the cracks. Finally. I am very disappointed that S. 1177 does not require that data collected and reported on AAPI students be disaggregated by ethnic subgroups. As the Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC). I have worked to combat the socalled \"model minority myth.\" which leads people to believe that AAPI students are all highachieving and successful. In reality. the AAPI population includes over 40 distinct ethnic groups who speak over 100 different languages. However. this diversity in experience and success is often masked when data is not disaggregated by AAPI subgroups. As a result. many AAPI students fail to receive resources that would help them succeed academically. I believe that S. 1177 is an improvement over the patchwork system our country is currently operating under in the wake of NCLB. but it falls short on the promise to serve all of our children. I will continue to work to ensure that every child. regardless of economic background. race. gender. sexual orientation. family history. or ability receives a free. highquality education that enables them to achieve the American Dream.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). It has been 14 years since the last reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. and we have desperately needed an update to this critical law. The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act included unworkable provisions and led to the proliferation of highstakes testing. In order to manage the impact of the laws strict provisions. the federal government has granted waivers to 40 states. resulting in unpredictability and unequal application of the law. The ESSA will correct our previous mistakes by maintaining high standards while giving states and local school districts greater flexibility in achieving them with evidencebased strategies. At its core. the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is a civil rights law that reflects our societys consensus that every state and school district must provide a quality education to all children. In order to fulfill this promise. we must have sufficient information to measure inequities in educational achievement for all groups. and we must ensure states and local governments are taking the steps necessary to close those achievement gaps. For that reason. I am very concerned that the ESSA lacks data disaggregation for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students. The AAPI community is extremely diverse with over 48 distinct ethnic groups that face varying challenges in educational achievement. The lack of data disaggregation will prevent us from determining what gaps exist and how best to address them. Additionally. I am concerned by the lack of key provisions from the Safe Schools Improvement Act and the Student NonDiscrimination Act. I have cosponsored these important pieces of legislation because more must be done to address the harmful effects of bullying and discrimination. particularly for LGBT students. No child should be denied a quality education due to his or her race. ethnicity. sex. sexual orientation. gender identity. or socioeconomic status. This bill takes important steps in the right direction. but the lack of AAPI data disaggregation and important LGBT protections shows there is much work to be done to achieve this goal. I look forward to working with my colleagues to address these flaws.",

It is a product of compromise. but a product that did not require either side to compromise on our core beliefs. A core belief of mineand a core belief of my caucusis that Congress deems authority to the executive branch to interpret. implement. and enforce federal law. That is the foundational tenet of administrative law. Although some provisions included in the conference report seek to limit the regulatory power of the Department of Education. nothing in this conference report will inhibit or impede the Secretarys authorityas granted by the Constitutionto interpret. implement. and enforce compliance with the Federal law. including the Secretarys authority to promulgate regulations that clarify and interpret vague statutory terms. Those provisions were carefully negotiated between the Chair and me. The Every Student Succeeds Act provides states with new flexibility to design systems that hold schools accountable for improving student outcomes. but the Federal government is ultimately responsible for protecting the civil rights of all students. To fulfill that responsibility. the Secretary of Education will maintain regulatory. oversight. and enforcement authority sufficient to fully implement this new law.",

He retired on July 1 after 50 years of teaching at the University of Kentucky. College of Law. He advanced the lives of countless students through education and public service. A few of his students include U.S. Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL. Governor Steve Beshear. U.S. Representative ANDY BARR. and most of the Kentucky Supreme Court. He was also one of my favorite professors. and I have a great deal of respect and admiration for him. Professor Lawson was born in 1938 in a small coal mining community in West Virginia. His father. a coal miner. urged him to escape the coal camp through education. and Professor Lawson worked his way through tuitionfree Berea College and then went on to receive a law degree from the University of Kentucky in 1963. He practiced law for two years and then accepted an invitation to teach at his alma mater in 1965. He served as the Dean of the College of Law from 19711973 and again from 19821988. Professor Lawson is a Member of the University of Kentucky. College of Law Hall of Fame. and University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni. In addition to his impressive teaching history. Professor Lawson has many other significant accomplishments that contributed to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He was the principal drafter of Kentuckys Penal Code. and its rules of Courtroom Evidence. and led investigation into the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire in 1977 that killed 165 people in Northern Kentucky. Bob Lawson has tirelessly worked with the General Assembly to ensure that state jails and prisons are housing criminals and not people. such as the mentally ill and the addicted. who can be rehabilitated into productive members of society. Professor Lawson has written an important paper on criminal and evidence law. books that now occupy the shelves of law libraries and judicial chambers. The University of Kentucky and the entire Commonwealth have surely benefitted from Professor Lawsons time and service. His legacy will carry on as his students continue to serve in the legal profession and public service. and I personally thank him for his years of honorable dedication and tutelage.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce the Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act. known as the CLAIM Act to help consumers save millions of dollars in insurance costs and create more jobs. Under current law. independent claims adjusters face a hodgepodge of inconsistent state regulations that only serve to delay the prompt adjustment of claims for natural disasters. accident victims. and other tragedies in life. Independent claims adjusters must take a license examination in each state in which they work. This requires adjusters to take time off from their job and travel to each state in which they seek a license. This is a costly burden on the claims adjusters. the companies that employ them. and ultimately. the consumer. Sadly. it is the consumer who currently pays for these costs in higher premiums. Today. it is my pleasure to introduce a bill that would end this costly burden. The CLAIM Act would lead to a process that would provide independent claims adjusters licensing reciprocity so their homestate license is valid in any other state. This legislation builds upon the success Congress has already had in encouraging states to coordinate licensing for agents and brokers. and appropriately expands that precedent to claims adjusters. who face many of the same licensing issues. To be clear. the CLAIM Act does not create a new federal law and does not \"federalize\" the insurance industry. The CLAIM Act respects states rights to continue to regulate insurance. The CLAIM Act would make sure that each state keeps its independence to adopt rules as they see fit and recognizes that state insurance regulators are best situated to address insurance licensing standards. The goal of this bill is to streamline the claims adjustment process so that individual claims adjusters can respond in the fastest possible and most costeffective manner possible. I look forward to further discussing the issues of uniformity and reciprocity and the CLAIM Act as we move forward in the Committee process.",

Gastroparesis is a chronic medical condition where the stomach cannot empty properly in the absence of any observable blockage. Factors causing gastroparesis may include longstanding diabetes. complications from surgeries. or other illnesses. such as MS and Parkinsons disease. Gastroparesis is relatively common. affecting an estimated 5 million Americans including thousands in my district in Milwaukee. While it can strike anyone at any age. gastroparesis is four times more likely to affect women than men. Gastroparesis can be debilitating and sometimes life threatening. Symptoms (including nausea or vomiting. stomach fullness. inability to finish a meal. and others) usually occur during and after eating a normal sized meal and can result in problems. such as severe dehydration. difficulty managing blood glucose levels. obstruction. and malnutrition. There is no cure for gastroparesis. Treatments like dietary measures. medications. procedures to maintain nutrition. and surgery can only reduce symptoms and related problems with the hope of maintaining quality of life. Studies reveal a growing incidence of gastroparesis. as well as increasing rates of related hospitalizations and emergency room visits. However. as gastroparesis is a poorly understood condition. delayed diagnosis. treatment. and management of the condition are frequent challenges faced by this patient population. Gastroparesis creates a significant burden on individuals and families. It also places a burden of direct and indirect costs on the community. economy. and U.S. healthcare system. I applaud the efforts of nonprofit groups like the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) from Milwaukee. as well as other patient organizations. to provide education and support that will help those affected by gastroparesis.

Dr. Kirwan has been a strong and inspirational leader of the university system in our great state. and we are sad to see him go. Dr. Kirwan first left his mark on the University of Maryland when he served as an educator and instructor at our flagship campus in College Park for 25 years. When he left Maryland in 2002 to become President of the Ohio State University. he did so after having risen from an assistant professor in the mathematics department to department chair. provost. and eventually university president. When Dr. Kirwan returned to Maryland in 2002. to become chancellor of the University System of Maryland he quickly set to work. helping to shift the focus of the system and create innovative ways to support student development. To do so he often used technology and the unique resources of the state of Maryland and national capital region to do so. Since Dr. Kirwan became chancellor. enrollment has risen 24 percent and the number of students receiving bachelors degrees has also grown significantly. by 36 percent. When he retired on June 30. completing a proud career of public service. Dr. Kirwan had led significant improvements to our university system that will benefit both students and faculty for decades to come. Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank Dr. Kirwan for his dedicated service to our students and congratulate him on an impressive career. The entire Maryland congressional delegation is proud to have worked alongside him and we wish him well in his hard earned retirement.",

If we do not include consequences like these in the bill. how will we ever ensure that recalcitrant. footdragging Federal agencies will achieve the bills goal of streamlined permit decisions? The amendment. however. removes all consequences for agencies footdragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or threatened species. That is in the bill. The amendments sponsor offers no sound reason to do this. The bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be approved. It just requires that permitting decisions. up or down. be reached after. at most. 41/2 years of environmental review. Surely that is enough time to review all kinds of projects. including those that limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact endangered or threatened species. To make matters worse. the bill would allow agencies to drag their feet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on an endangered or threatened species.

Of course. those who support it use that as their main Rock of Gibraltar. if you will. their main point of argument that this is a good bill. A good bill in the face of terrorism? Director Comey has indicated that he has determined that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 States. Yet. we want to expedite this process when it is determining issues dealing with our national security to a certain extent. This issue deals with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process. Are you going to rush them along? The NRC has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its licenses through 10 CFR section 73. which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials.

Mr. Chairman. the Pope. right here in this very room. called on each of us to pursue a common good. which he told us requires a courageous and responsible effort.

I dont expect any opposition to this amendment. Mr. Chairman. Like a number of wellrespected environmental groups. I oppose H.R. 348. the socalled RAPID Act. which threatens public health and safety by putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector businesses in the project approval process. It is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to grease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are environmentally sensitive. Aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain to certain types of projects. the RAPID Act would also limit the right of the public to comment on these projects. This bill does that in two ways: first. by reducing opportunities for public input. and secondly. by fasttracking the approval process through arbitrary deadlines. Through an open. flexible. and timely process. NEPA empowers the public to weigh in on decisions. That means that the local farmer who owns land that would be affected by a Federal construction projectlets say a nasty pipeline like Keystoneit ensures that that local farmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the construction industry and with the Federal Government.

In fact. we know from some of the most recent statistics. that 14 of 33 officers saved by bulletproof vests. were purchased using funds from the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program. Since 1999. over 13.000 jurisdictions across the country have participated in the BVP program. I encourage those law enforcement officials and concerned citizens listening. especially those in South Jersey. to apply for this vital program. The deadline to do so. May 16th. is quickly approaching.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As we honor our law enforcement heroes for the annual Police Week. I rise in support of H.R. 2137. the Federal Law Enforcement SelfDefense and Protection Act of 2015. Federal law enforcement officers face potentially dangerous situations on a daily basis whether they are on duty or off duty. Accordingly. they are permitted to carry their governmentissued firearms on their persons even when they are not on duty. However. during the 2013 government shutdown. at least three Federal agencies forbade their law enforcement officers from carrying their governmentissued firearms or credentials during the furlough. This decision potentially endangered these officers lives by putting them at an unnecessary risk. Further. it prevented these highly trained officers from being able to respond to a critical incident or threat. The Federal Law Enforcement SelfDefense and Protection Act will ensure that officers are able to defend and protect themselves on and off duty by allowing all covered Federal law enforcement officers to continue to carry their governmentissued firearms during a furlough or a government shutdown. Allowing our highly trained and experienced Federal law enforcement officers to carry their firearms during a furlough not only ensures their safety and protection. but the safety and protection of their families and those around them. As we honor our Nations law enforcement officers this week during the annual National Police Week. lets ensure that the brave men and women of the Federal law enforcement community have the capability to defend themselves and others and to respond to threatening situations even in a time of furlough. I thank the bills sponsor. Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. for his work on this important measure. and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Members of the House. I rise in support of H.R. 2137. the Federal Law Enforcement SelfDefense and Protection Act. This bill would authorize Federal law enforcement officers to carry their governmentissued firearms during government shutdowns and administrative furloughs that result from lapses in appropriations. Essentially. this measure would help ensure that those who protect us are able to continue to do so even during an official furlough. The ability of our Federal law enforcement officers to respond to critical incidents should not be impeded. particularly when violent crimes are committed in their presence. H.R. 2137 does not expand Federal law enforcement officers authority to carry firearms. The bill merely authorizes these officers to continue to carry their federally issued firearms as if a furlough had not occurred. This legislation recognizes the very real threat of harm that many of our officers face. particularly special agents. on a regular basisa threat that does not simply disappear because of a government shutdown. In 2012. for example. more than 1.800 Federal law enforcement officers were assaulted and. of those. approximately 200 sustained serious injuries. Even when off duty. Federal law enforcement officers remain the target of assault. For example. between 2011 and 2014. 27 law enforcement officers were killed while they were off duty. Although this legislation only concerns Federal officers. I want to take a moment to recognize the State. local. and Federal officers who have sacrificed their lives in serving our communities. This week. law enforcement officers throughout the United States have come to Washington to show their support for our fallen officers during National Police Week. In the spirit of National Police Week. it is vitally important that our Federal officers are able to protect people in our communities. themselves. and their family members from the continuing threats they encounter. Given the fact that H.R. 2137 facilitates this critical goal. I am eager to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.",

Law enforcement officers were orderedand you have heard this beforeto lock up their governmentissued weapons and were prohibited from carrying their governmentissued credentials while carrying their personally owned weapon during the last government shutdown. This decision potentially endangered one female agent. We just heard that described. Thankfully. she was able to deescalate the situation and walk away unharmed. This incident serves as a reminder that criminals dont care if Federal officers are furloughed. and it highlights the very real need to ensure that law enforcement officers have the means to protect themselves regardless of their duty status.

Representative ERIK PAULSEN. for introducing it. It is strong. it is reasonable. and it is the right thing to do. Representative JOE COURTNEY has waited and worked for this legislation for a long time. As a father and a grandfather. I cant even begin to imagine what parents go through in the event their child goes missing. I cant imagine it. I really cant. And I certainly cant imagine hearing that law enforcement is handicapped in its ability to do everything possible to help bring their child back. Mr. Speaker. there are 200.000 kids that are abducted by a family member every year. That is something for another day perhaps. but it is part of this problem here. In 2007. a study by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. TIGTAwe use that term a lot in the Ways and Means Committeefound that tax return information could be helpful in many cases involving missing children. TIGTA reviewed whether IRS data would show addresses for persons claiming tax benefits with respect to those missing children after the time of the abduction or their suspected abductors. That sounds pretty bizarre. but that is happening. TIGTA looked at 520 missing childrens cases and found that the IRS data showed new addresses for 46 percent of the cases. Similarly. IRS data showed new addresses for 34 percent of suspected abductors. Federal law rightly prohibits the IRS from disclosing confidential taxpayer information except in a limited number of exceptions. For example. this information may be released to Federal Government employees if ordered by a Federal judge in preparation for a nontaxrelated criminal prosecution. H.R. 3209 would add criminal investigations related to missing or exploited children as one of these exceptions. We should be thankful to the author of this legislation because this is a critical exception that should have been done a long time ago. The bill would also allow this information to be released to State and local law enforcement officials who are working with the Federal agency in its missing or exploited child investigation.

    "speech": "Mr. President. when President Clinton proposed his health care bill in 1993. Republicans were so upset that they came up with a radical idea. This radical idea was to give tax credits to poor people to buy private insurance. to set up an insurance exchange where they could do that. to ban preexisting conditions. and to include an individual mandatein short. the Affordable Care Act. built by Republicans. many of them still in this Chamber today. At the heart of that proposal was the idea that people should get a tax cut in order to be able to buy private insurance. At the heart of the underlying Republican amendment is a gutting of that ability of individuals to go out and buy private insurance for themselves. This amendment is pretty simple. It says that at the very least we can come together on the idea that we should preserve those tax credits for the most vulnerablefor pregnant women. for victims of domestic violence. for people suffering from heart disease. cancer. and Alzheimers. At the very least. we can come together and decide to protect those tax creditsa Republican idea at the genesis for those vulnerable individuals. I urge adoption of the amendment.",

Under ObamaCare. health insurance plans are decreasing. they are narrower. and they are giving sick individuals fewer choices and fewer options over their health care. Repealing ObamaCare is the first step in moving toward health care that is better for all Americans. including those who Senators MURPHY and STABENOW intend to help. This amendment also again proposes the Buffett tax. taxing foreign inversion corporations as domestic. and expanding limitations on executive compensation deductibility. I believe the problem with Washingtons finances is that our government spends too much and lives outside its means. I am continually working to put our countrys finances on a sustainable path so that more Americans can keep more of their hardearned money. We dont need higher taxes. I urge my colleagues to oppose the upcoming motion to waive. Mr. President. the pending amendment No. 2918 would cause the underlying legislation to exceed the authorizing committees 302(a) allocation of new budget authority or outlays. Therefore.

We will vote to build a bridge away from ObamaCare and toward better care. We will vote for a new beginning. We hope the House will again do the same. and then President Obama will have a choice.

Now. although Mr. Romano is not originally from Texas. he falls into the category of people who moved there as quickly as he could. A man that cannot easily be entertained. Mr. Romano bounced around the country before making Dallas his home. and bounced through multiple successful business projects before settling with a selfproclaimed and modest title: entrepreneur. However. Mr. Romano is much more than an entrepreneur. He is rich in character. and Dallas is proud to be his home. Mr. Romano is best known for his successful career in the restaurant industry. His business ventures brought Texas as well as the nation beloved institutions such as Fuddruckers. Romanos Macaroni Grill. and Eatzis. These business ventures solidified his status as a successful businessman. but Mr. Romano helped satisfy much more than peoples appetites. When Mr. Romano was working with a small venture capital firm SHD Management LLC. he had the keen eye to spot a good product. After talking to a cardiologist named Julio Palmaz. Mr. Romano agreed to invest capital and run the business operations for the balloonexpandable heart stent. It ended up becoming over a 10 million dollar invention. but more impressively than that. it saved countless lives. including Mr. Romanos. who now uses a heart stent after he helped invent it. When he worked in the restaurant industry he touched peoples stomachs. and when he was a venture capitalist he touched peoples hearts. However. his success is most tangible in the impact he has on Dallas. His most recent project. Trinity Groves. will provide a community space for entrepreneurs to grow. businesses to invest. and people to enjoy. In addition to that. his affinity for art. embodied not only in his home but in his studio on Dragon Street in Dallas. will solidify his legacy as a brilliant and deep man. Mr. Speaker. whether it was with a burger. a heart stent. a community. or a painting. throughout his life. Phil Romano has left a Texassized impression on Dallas. the city he loves that loves him back.",

African Americans continued to face significant oppression and discrimination. In 1895. despite the adversity facing the Black community. African American Baptist Churches came together to form the National Baptist Convention of the United States to strengthen and unify Baptist Churches. Today. it is the largest predominately Black Christian denomination in the United States. The 31st Street Baptist Church grew out of this movement and was consecrated in 1915. The church quickly established itself as a leading voice in the Richmond community and its congregation rapidly grew. Members were active in the community and encouraged to attend the historic March on Washington in 1963. Sadly in 1966. the church structure was burned down. But out of the ashes. 31st Street Baptist Church persevered and its current sanctuary was built. From 1982 to 2007. Reverend Darrel Rollins led the church. Under his leadership the church prospered even further. The congregation grew from 150 to 1.300 and the church added more than 50 new ministries. These ministries included assistance to seniors. nutrition assistance. and a consortium of three sister churches. Today. the Church feeds 70 to 250 people a day during the summer in the East End community. The physical building of the church has also grown and has become accessible to all. More recently. the 31st Baptist Church was recognized by the Tricycle Gardens. a nonprofit working to expand access to healthy foods in Richmond. with the Golden Trowel award for the churchs community garden that contributes to the food available at their soup kitchen. The garden has continued to grow under Rev. Dr. Morris Hendersons leadership and has even received a farm serial number from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The First Ladys Lets Move! Initiative has also recognized the church and its urban farm for its positive impact on the community. This unique garden is just one of the many ways that 31st Baptist Church has served and enriched the Richmond community. Mr. Speaker. as the 31st Street Baptist Church of Richmond. Virginia celebrates this historic anniversary. the congregation can rejoice in 100 years of fellowship and service to the Richmond community. I wish them many more years of joy and dedicated service to the community.",

The Energy Information Agency (ETA) estimates that the U.S. has more than 354 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves. In Pennsylvania. Ohio. West Virginia and most importantly. Texas. we increased production by more than 4.2 billion cubic feet per day. While I am a big supporter of LNG exports. I also firmly believe we should consume as much natural gas here at home as possible. Natural gas has transformed our power sector. Today. for the first time in history. we use more natural gas for power production than coal. Natural gas is expected to fulfill almost 40% of our power needs in the coming decades. Our producers have become so efficient. Henry Hub prices sit at approximately $2.89 per BCF. We should drive demand for natural gas by encouraging natural gas vehicles. Our corporate and government fleets as well as our public transportation vehicles all run on natural gas but the largest segment of the market resides in personal vehicles. If we increase demand. we will resolve any environmental issues related to natural gas production. First. producers will reduce natural gas flaring because that product will have a market. Second. natural gas burns cleaner than gasoline which reduces carbon emissions. E1609 The EPA is tasked with protecting the environment and natural gas vehicles deserve the same opportunities as electric vehicles. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

Autism New Jersey has continued to evolve over the years to meet the changing scope and needs of the autism community. With an occurrence rate of 1 in 45 in the state of New Jersey. the efforts of Autism of New Jersey are vital to many of the states families and individuals.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for accepting two of my amendments in the en bloc amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 22. including an amendment exempting a narrow class of welders from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. The amendment at hand is a bipartisan. compromise effort that clarifies that transit agencies starting New Starts projects can utilize Federal funds. like CMAQ and TIFIA. to match the 50% funding provided by their New Start grant. I appreciate the Chairmans willingness to work with me on this issue and restore the Core Capacity and Small Starts projects Federal match limit back to 80% and allowing local agencies to flex other Federal funds to these projects. Without these funds. local flexibility would be greatly diminished and agencies would be forced to scrounge for funds locally. delaying many. many projects. including Chicagos Red & Purple Line Modernization. Still. this is a compromise amendment and this bill still restricts the use of STP funds for the remainder of the match and codifies the New Starts grant amount at 50%. both at the request of the majority. and I strongly disagree with this and hope we can work on this in conference. In support of my amendment. I submit letters of support for this amendment from the Chicago Transit Authority. the Regional Transportation Authority. and the American Public Transportation Association.",

Regrettably. selfless acts of valor and service by Americans in uniform are often taken for granted. They are not always reciprocated. and their vulnerabilities are often preyed upon by the despicable and unscrupulous. In those cases. it is our duty to come to their defense. We are all too aware of cases when abusive and predatory payday lenders target and entrap veterans. misleading and forcing them into downward spirals of high cost debt. While the Defense Department recently finalized rules to protect active duty military service members from tripledigit interest rates on payday loans. the job is not done. Veterans are not protected under the law and remain vulnerable. Therefore. I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting stronger consumer protections and to rein in abuses involving highcost lending to veterans while they struggle to make ends meet. Mr. Speaker. much more work remains to be done to raise the quality of life of our nations veterans. Let us resolve this Veterans Day to meet those challenges headon as we thank and honor them for their courage. sacrifices and service. E1612",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the onehundredth anniversary of the founding of the Borough of Woodbury Heights in Gloucester County. New Jersey. On May 25. 1915. the citizens of the future Woodbury Heights were formally recognized by the New Jersey Legislature as an independent borough out of Deptford Township. However. history for this small town did not begin in 1915. Settled in 1771. the area we know today as Woodbury Heights. New Jersey has a deep history of rich involvement in the South Jersey community. Indeed. many of the older homes can still be seen today. including the La Pann House. built in 1771. that is on the National Historic Registry. In 1892. six businessmen from Philadelphia and Camden: John Mayhew. E.R. Artman. Judge Pancoast. Howard M. Cooper. William Moland. and I.W. Wilson bought land from Deptford Township. There they laid out streets. built homes. and constructed a community hall in 1894. forming the nucleus of the future Woodbury Heights. In the 1900s. the once sparse town started to flourish when a train station was built. Later. Simon M. Snook donated Glen Terrace Lake to the borough and it remains one of the most popular recreation sites in the area. Over the next hundred years. the Woodbury Heights community thrived. and in the past century. the population of Woodbury Heights has quadrupled to reach over 3.000 today. Mr. Speaker. the character of the Borough Woodbury Heights and its emphasis on community engagement is best exemplified by three of the figures featured on its official seal: a scale of justice. a shield of safety. and two shaking hands. This weekend. as the people of Woodbury Heights celebrate their Centennial. I congratulate the citizens. Mayor Robbie J. Conley. and the Borough Council on the past one hundred years and wish them another hundred years of richness and good fortune.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the 250th anniversary of the New Jerusalem Lutheran Church of Lovettsville. Virginia. This past Sunday. New Jerusalem held a special anniversary worship service. led by Pastor Joel Guttormson and the head of the Washington Metropolitan Synod. Bishop Graham. who delivered the sermon. Following the service. over 200 people gathered for a luncheon at Lovettsville Fire and Rescue station in celebration. New Jerusalem traces back to 60 German families seeking fertile farmland who journeyed south from Pennsylvania. These early settlers came from the Palatine region of Germany. Alsace. and Lorraine. France and referred to their church as \"the new Jerusalem.\" where they could gather in fellowship and worship. The current structure has been in use since its consecration in 1869. but the original congregation first gathered for worship in a log structure which served as both a school and a church. New Jerusalem is recognizable by its distinctive bell tower that serves as a landmark in the Washington Metropolitan area. The original buildings sit on property granted by Lord George William Fairfax. while the nearby Lovettsville Union Cemetery acts as the final resting place of many of Lovettsvilles residents from over the last two and a half centuries. It is the oldest Lutheran church in the Washington. D.C. area and serves as an important landmark for its historic significance and contributions to the community. New Jerusalem has made a significant impact on the community for over two and a half centuries. and we join them in celebration of 250 years of worship. I am honored to recognize this momentous occasion today and wish New Jerusalem Lutheran Church all the best moving forward.",

    "speech": "Madam President. I would like to welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington. Todays visit between President Obama and the Prime Minister was the first time the leaders of our two countries have met in over a year. It was also their first time meeting since President Obama concluded his deal with Iran. We know that deal is likely to entrench Irans nuclear threshold capabilities while helping subsidize terrorist groups. such as Hezbollah and Hamas. that are dedicated to Israels destruction. We know that the Presidents deal does not even require Iran to recognize Israels right to exist. So I am sure these leaders had much to discuss. I am sure they engaged in a frank discussion. But a relationship based on frank exchanges of viewsa relationship centered on substance rather than just personalitiesis important for both of our countries. It is. in fact. healthy. That is certainly true when we hear Irans Supreme Leader reiterating calls for Israels destruction. That is certainly true when we hear him saying that change will never happen as he continues to rail against our own country. So it is good that Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama had a chance to meet today. It is good that the Prime Minister will have an opportunity to visit the Capitol again tomorrow as well. We appreciated his last visit very much. It was important to hear the perspective of a leader for whom threats from countries like Iran and terrorist groups like ISIL and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are hardly theoretical. That was made clear when I led a congressional delegation to the Middle East last month that included Congressman BARR and Senators from Arkansas. South Dakota. and Iowa. We met with leaders in Jordan. Iraq. and Afghanistan. and in Israel we had a chance to visit with the Prime Minister. It was productive. it was eyeopening. and it underlined a key point. Israels Prime Minister is a great friend of the United States. The bonds between our nations are strong. And I hope we can all find ways to strengthen them further because the threats facing both our countries are real. and they are certainly worrying.",

That is the issue that the Future Forum is going to address. We are going to address this issue. the American Dream of homeownership. and something very important to millennials. diversity and equality. Millennials make up about 75 million people of the American population. It is the most diverse generation in Americas history. We believe in the Future Forum that we are uniquely suited for this because we are a part of the future too. and it is time that the party of the future starts talking to the future. We will be taking time on the House floor and at events around the country to meet with and listen to younger Americans about how we in government can better ensure that younger Americans have the opportunities that will allow them not only to dream but to achieve. This is a twoway conversation. We will use technology and a collaborative approach in our communications and in our outreach. Our policy priorities are very simple: college access and affordability. job security and entrepreneurship. and equality and diversity. Many of the members of the Future Forum were called to public service because of what happened on September 11.

There is no agency that has a harder job or a job that is more important in protecting our homeland than the Department of Homeland Security. We should be here today. on our first evening of the Future Forum. talking about the rising amount of student debt that millennials carry. We should be here today talking about how hard it is to get a job if you are a young person and if you have just finished college. We should be here today talking about how hard it is to buy a home if you are carrying all of this student debt. We should be talking about the need for diversity and about having a pathway to citizenship for immigration. Instead. bizarrely. we are here talking about the real possibility that the Department of Homeland Security. created out of a bipartisan coalition in the early 2000s. could shut down and leave us more vulnerable. I hope that our better angels will guide us. I hope that the spirit that those House Members had when they stood on the steps of the Capitol after September 11 prevails. that we work more collaboratively. and that we remember. at the end of the day. we are charged with protecting the people.

    "speech": "Madam President. on another matter. last November the American people elected a new Congress to get Washington working again. Nearly every day seems to bring more signs that we are. Over the weekend. President Obama signed the FAST Act. a multiyear highway bill. into law. It represents a significant departure from years of shortterm extensions and congressional inaction. In fact. the FAST Act is the longest term highway bill to pass Congress in almost two decades. providing 5 full years of highway funding. Here is what Kentuckians for Better Transportationa top transportation advocacy organization in my Statehad to say about it: After many. many years of short term continuing resolutions we finally have a long term authorization that will give our states the opportunity to plan for and implement major road projects .... We can [now] plan for the future. That is because in a new and more open Senate. Senator INHOFE. a Republican. and Senator BOXER. a Democrat. were able to work together for its passage. Senator BOXER herself called it \"a major accomplishment.\" Here is another major accomplishment: the Every Student Succeeds Act. It is a bipartisan. reformist replacement for No Child Left Behind. Pundits in Washington could never agree on how to replace No Child Left Behind. The issue went unresolved for many years. but in a new and more open Senate. Senator ALEXANDER. a Republican. and Senator MURRAY. a Democrat. worked hard and found success in the bill before us. The House already passed it. 359 to 64. The Senate previously passed a very similar version of the bill. 81 to 17. Tomorrow we should work together to pass it for a second and final time and send it to the President for his signature. It will be the latest important achievement for the American people from a new Congress that is back to work and back on their side. Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

It is inconsistent with the vision of our Constitution. in which all came to the United States seeking to escape persecution and to be able to practice whichever religion they chose. The Founders of the United States did not seek to make our Nation one in which only a single religion could be practiced. They did not seek to establish one religion as a preeminent religion. They instead wanted a safe haven where people could worship as they pleased. which is the heart of our First Amendment. This idea is wrong and wrongheaded. It is wrong in the context that we are not at war with Islam. In fact. we are working in partnership with Islamic nations to take on a terrorist group known as ISIS. It is wrong in that all patriotic Americans of every religion are working together to take on this terrorist group known as ISIS. In addition to being wrong. it is wrongheaded in that making Islam the enemy is playing straight out of ISISs playbook. which wants to create a war between America and Islam.

The bill calls for a progress report on the knowledge the industry and FAA have gained about the operation and licensing of commercial human spaceflight. This allows the commercial space industry to develop standards and coordinate with the FAA so the industry can grow in a stable regulatory environment without the threat of arbitrary regulations that would adversely impact their ability to innovate. Mr. Chairman. international law places liability for damages that result from space accidents on the launching nation. All spacefaring nations require some form of thirdparty liability insurance for launching entities. The current U.S. risksharing structure expires in 2016. This act extends indemnification to the year 2025 and requires an update on how the FAA calculates the maximum probable loss associated with launches. Indemnification has never been utilized and is subject to future appropriations.

Now that NASA is allowing other astronauts access to the International Space Station. a new category is necessary to outline the roles. responsibilities. and protections for astronauts on a commercial human spaceflight launch. This bill also closes a loophole that carved out an exception for spaceflight participants from indemnification coverage. By including these individuals in the indemnification provision. spaceflight participants who may participate in a launch as a result of a contest or for other reasons are not burdened with financial exposure above the limits. This bill also ensures that Federal courts review lawsuits that result from accidents since the Federal Government is ultimately the responsible party. not the States.

The space industry is an engine of economic growth throughout the country. and our opportunity to do this right is vitally necessary to maintain American competitiveness as other nations begin to catch up. That is why I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2262. the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015. The SPACE Act facilitates a progrowth environment for the commercial space sector. It fosters a safety framework that will protect the American public. while encouraging the development of new space technologies. This will ensure Americas exceptional role is maintained as the most innovative Nation in the world. This legislation also extends the current risksharing structure set to expire next year and requires an update on how the FAA calculates maximum probable loss associated with potential spaceflight accidents. This ensures that U.S. space companies wont be forced to go overseas to compete.",

Between 1915 and 1923. approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed and over 500.000 more were exiled to the desert to die of thirst or starvation. The Armenian genocide was the first mass murder of the 20th century. a century that was sadly to be marked by many similar attempts at racial or ethnic extermination. from the Holocaust to the Rwandan genocide to Darfur. Sudan. As we solemnly remember the victims of this tragedy. let us also celebrate the extraordinary strength and spirit of the Armenian people. who have fought successfully to preserve their culture and identity for over a thousand years. They overcame the horrors of genocide. two world wars. and decades of Soviet dominance in order to establish modern Armenia. In addition. the vibrant Armenian diaspora continues to thrive and around the world. It is only by acknowledging and learning from the past that we can build a future free of racial. ethnic. and religious hate and violence.

I will give us a reminder of what this legislation does: It sustains critical capabilities to fight terrorism and counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is a separate bill. This is what we are going to be discussing. It has funds to assist our efforts to recover unauthorized disclosures of intelligence capabilities. It sustains activities in Afghanistan and Iraq to continue the fight against ISIS. al Qaeda. and the Taliban. It invests in the resiliency of our national security space architecture. It provides policy discretion on sensitive intelligence operations. It promotes intelligence integration and sharing through investment in intelligence communitywide information technology enterprises. It enhances investment in military intelligence. surveillance. and reconnaissance aircraft. It funds initiatives to thwart cyber attacks and insider threats. And it requires a report every 60 days on foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. This is the bill. the underlying bill that we are discussing. And I just wanted to make a reminder of that. As we have discussions on different parts of this rule. lets be reminded also that we are dealing with a standalone bill that we will work.",

Mr. Speaker. let me say to the gentleman from Georgia that he is quite right. There are very serious and important components of the intelligence bill covered by this rule. As many of us have experienced over the last couple of days. we are in and out of intelligence and security briefings because that is the era in which we live. And in most instances. Members draw their concern from the responsibility they have for protecting the American people. I am on the Homeland Security Committee and have continued on that committee since the tragedy. the heinous act of 9111. and before. when the select committee was in place. So I have no quarrel with some of the important elements of this legislation. But the gentleman from Georgia should recognize that this is an aberration. There are two or three points that I would like to make: First of all. we are long overdue for getting rid of the sequester. This joke was played on Members and the American people only because of the supercommitteenot because of any individual Members. but there was a supercommittee structure put in place. the time ran out. and they could not come to a budget conclusion. So this was the ultimate end. Members didnt vote on this. They voted on the supercommittee. and then this was the hatchet that fell when the supercommittee did not work. So sequester should be something that Speaker BOEHNER puts on the floor and immediately gets rid of. And the reason why I say that is because I am going to talk about the shenanigans dealing with the trade bill. But what I am going to say is that the overseas contingency fund is being used to bolster up this bill. the intelligence bill. But I cant get those resources to be utilized for infrastructure or summer jobs or fixing the education system that we have responsibilities for or providing opportunities for young people to finish their education or criminal justice reform. So this is being 43 percent pumped up when used by funds that are not in the stream.",

Alivia comes from a large and loving family. Her proud father and mother. Daniel and Rebekah. as well as her siblings Caroline. Christian. and Gabe. have been a constant source of support throughout her life. Tony Wood. art teacher at Stanton College Preparatory School. and a renowned artist himself. has paintings displayed in various art galleries around Jacksonville.

Head Start was designed to ensure that children from lowincome families had access to a quality early childhood education. This program has long served as a catalyst for longterm educational achievement and is considered the nations premier school readiness program. Head Start recognizes that parents are the initial and most important educators in their childs life and works to inspire and support affirmative parental involvement with their children. In addition to building strong parentchild relationships. Head Start along with Early Head Start. provides extensive services to promote strong mental. social. and emotional development in children from birth to age five. Head Start also provides children and their families with health screenings and nutritional education. among other integral services. The services offered to our communities by Head Start are copious and invaluable. Evidencebased studies have shown Head Start to be tremendously effective at promoting academic success in school. avoiding crime. and fostering the development of productive. successful leaders. Head Start is one of the longest running programs in the United States whose mission is to address systemic poverty. and it has indeed yielded impressive results. In just 2014. Head Start served over 20.000 children and families in North Carolina alone. E756 including nearly 5.000 in my congressional district.

My amendment would take further steps to support our allies in the region and crack down on Iranian aggression. By vocalizing our support for working with Israel. the Gulf Cooperation Council. Jordan. and Egypt. to build an integrated missile defense system. we can build off of the successes of Israels existing missile defense network. I support the funding authorizations included in this years defense budget that will continue to support Israels missile defense program. Through a smart. targeted approach with our partners. we can continue to counter Iranian aggression and promote security. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.",

I rise today in support of this amendment package. which includes my amendment that ensures the safety of Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. Home to the Atlantic ballistic missile submarine fleet. Kings Bays contributions to national security and to the nuclear deterrence capabilities of the U.S. fleet cannot be overstated. Just south of the installation is a lowuse general aviation airport called St. Marys Airport. The flight lines for their airport take civilian aircraft right over the base. raising a number of security concerns for the installation and for the weapons packages stored there. The dangers this poses to our nuclear stockpile is glaring. and this amendment is the first step in remedying that situation. This amendment would allow for the relocation of the St. Marys Airport service due to national security concerns posed to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. This amendment has been a major priority for the Navy. and provides muchneeded changes to security concerns that have been persistent for a number of years. With this amendment. we can protect our nuclear submarines while providing new economic opportunities. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.",

There is an important American company that is actively talking to the Iranians about the possibility of selling aircraft to them. Here is the problem with that.

Ramadi. and Hadithabattles that we fought and won a long time ago. But we did not have a strategy to ensure the peace. Mr. Clausewitz taught us about 200 years ago that war is an extension of politics. We have to have a political endgame for our fight in Iraq. or we will find ourselves continually going back there again and again. When Iraqi politics fail. a new terrorist group sweeps in. and American troops are left to pick up the mess. If you think about what happened when ISIS swept in from Syria and entered western. then northern Iraq. the Iraqi army wasnt just defeated by ISIS. The Iraqi Army put their weapons down and went home because they had lost faith in the Iraqi Government. We must have a longterm. comprehensive political and military strategy.

While not perfect. the bill funds the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at $300 million so that critically important work to clean up the Great Lakes can continue. My amendment would prohibit funds in this act from being used by States in violation of the Great Lakes Compact. an agreement among the eight Great Lakes States outlining how this precious and nonrenewable resource is to be managed. The compact prohibits water from being pumped to areas beyond the drainage basin. and sets strict criteria for any diversion request. To that end. a municipal government outside the basin recently had its application approved to divert up to 8.2 million gallons per day from Lake Michigan. most of which will be returned after being treated. This diversion request was only approved after conditions were met lowering the volume of water to be withdrawn as well as reducing the service territory it would be provided to. Going forward. it will be important to ensure that the approval of this request does not set a precedent that will threaten to deplete this resource by encouraging further diversion requests that do not uphold the strict water management standards outlined in the compact. As freshwater supplies in other parts of the country and the world dwindle. the desire to divert water by tanker or the construction of pipelines could become a greater threat to the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a nonrenewable source. Less than 1 percent of the water is renewed annually through rainfall and snow melt. The onslaught of climate change will likely cause water levels to decline in the future. Irresponsibly diverting water from the basin could threaten the fragile ecosystem. putting fish and wildlife at risk by degrading water quality and damaging habitats.

To help combat this growing threat. on February. 19. 2015. the President issued a historic executive order which requires that the Federal Government commit to key sustainability goals. This executive order builds off of ongoing lowcost efforts throughout the administration to reduce emissions. save energy. and achieve key sustainability goals. The efforts bolstered by this executive order have already helped Federal agencies save $1.8 billion in cumulative energy costs. Surely we can all agree that the Federal Government. as the countrys largest consumer of energy. should be a leader in cutting energy costs and saving taxpayer dollars. which is exactly what this executive order enables us to do. Specifically. the executive order directs Federal agencies to ensure 25 percent of their total energy consumption is from clean energy sources by 2025 and reduces energy use at Federal buildings by 212 percent per year between 2015 and 2025. These are worthy realistic goals to strive for because the consequences of not acting are dire. Unmitigated global warming will reduce our global gross domestic product by almost a quarter in the next 80 years. As a professor at Stanford University said. we are basically throwing away money by not addressing climate change. And to be clear. Mr. Chairman. this isnt something that only environmental groups are concerned about. Citigroup issued a report that found that minimizing temperature rises could reduce the global gross domestic product loss by $50 trillion. While climate change will have catastrophic longterm consequences. the effects of our warming planet are already being felt in our own backyards. Given the nature of this threat and the modest. yet worthy. goal this executive order sets to help combat the economic security and health risk climate change poses to us.

Environment. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to ensure my constituents and those who visit the Golden Gate National Recreation Area will be able to enjoy the park as it is intended to be enjoyed. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is in the bay area and was envisioned to have multiple complementary uses. This is enshrined in its mission statement \"to preserve and enhance the natural. historic. and scenic resources of the lands north and south of the Golden Gate for the education. recreation. and inspiration of people today and in the future.\" However. the National Park Service is moving forward on a severely restrictive rule on an activity that many bay area residents presently enjoy in the GGNRA. and that is dog walking. Dog walking off leash has been allowed in certain areas of the GGNRA for 40 years. but under a new proposed rule this amendment addresses. it would dramatically restrict access. While the NPS wants to treat all parks the same. the GGNRA has enjoyed offleash walking for decades with little or no problems. As one of our Nations few urban parks. it requires dog rules that fit the unique place in our community. I have heard from literally thousands of San Francisco and San Mateo County residents who oppose the rule. Dog owners certainly must act responsibly. As a dog owner myself. I understand that I must make sure my dog is well trained and safe for all visitors to the GGNRA. I dont think all of the GGNRA should be open to offleash dogs. only designated offleash areas that wont impact our native wildlife and flora and fauna. I love my dog. Buddy. a beautiful yellow Lab. I love walking him. and he certainly enjoys the fresh air and being off leash and free to roam. So this amendment is for Buddy and for all the \"Buddies\" in the bay area that enjoy the GGNRA. Buddy has been there for me. and. tonight. I am here for him and for all of his fourlegged buddies.",

This means that they are managed to support a wide variety of uses. including hunting. fishing. hiking. and other recreation activities. alongside responsible energy development. the preservation of historic and cultural resources. the conservation of some of our Nations most iconic landscapes. and wildlife habitat protection. The resource management plans that were recently finalized by the Bureau of Land Management to protect the greater sagegrouse and the broader sagebrush sea landscape strike the appropriate balance between the many uses of our public lands. The plans. which were developed in close consultation with the States and which reflect an unprecedented collaboration among stakeholders. allow for the responsible resource development. recreation. and preservation of the habitat which the greater sagegrouse requires to survive and thrive. Without these plans. it is highly likely that the greater sagegrouse would need to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. However. language in the underlying bill blocks funds from being used to implement the resource management plans. upsetting the carefully crafted balance that is required under the multiple use mandate. This harmful provision could also put the many other species that depend on this landscape at risk. including elk. mule deer. and pronghorn antelope. and it would deprive hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts of opportunities to use their public lands and enjoy the benefits of renewable wildlife resources. This is why hunters and sportsmen across the West support the sagegrouse conservation plans and strongly oppose any effort to block the plans from moving forward. including groups such as the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. the Archery Trade Association. and the Dallas Safari Club. just to name a few. My amendment would allow the BLM management plans to go into effect if failing to implement the plan would impact the multiple use mandate and. thereby. deprive outdoor enthusiasts of their ability to use these Federal lands. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. which protects opportunities for sportsmen and sportswomen and other outdoor enthusiasts. who depend on our public lands. Mr. Chairman.

Luckily. for the world. the USS Theodore Roosevelt. a Navy aircraft carrier. led a carrier group into the waters off Yemen and blocked the delivery of those weapons. It is the quintessential platform: an aircraft carrier that can respond to external threats. such as the one a few weeks ago. at a time when there is a resurgent Russian Navy that is back. intruding on the territorial waters of Scandinavian allies. when a Chinese PLA Navy is creating island military outposts in international waters. and. as was mentioned earlier. when ISIS advance is being confronted by U.S. airstrikes flown off U.S. carriers. Cutting our fleet to 10 from 11 will cripple our Nations ability to respond to these challenges and will reverse last years decision by Congress to refuel the George Washington ahead of schedule to ensure the capability of an 11ship fleet. Nothing in the testimony we have heard in the House Armed Services Committee suggests that the Navy can get by with fewer carriers. In fact. it is the exact opposite. Eleven is the minimum we need in order to meet the missions of today and in the future. The Seapower report on carriers is a balanced plan for Americas carrier fleet.

This is ridiculous to put the Navy through this political decisionmaking process rather than a military decision process about the number of carrier groups that exist.

Do we tell the Army. \"You need precisely X number of tanks for Desert Storm. therefore. you have to have this many tanks for the next 30 years\"? Do we tell the Air Force. \"You need this many helicopters for Somalia. therefore. you have to have exactly this many regardless of changing threats or challenges or budgetary realities\"?

A fleet of 11 carriers allows the United States to be a powerful force of stability around the globe. that keeps sea lanes open and protects our merchant fleet against hostile governments and piracy. They allow our troops to respond quickly to natural disasters and humanitarian crises all over the world. Reducing the number of aircraft carriers would have bad consequences. It would reduce our ability to protect ourselves and our interests abroad. It would have a dramatic impact on the morale of men and women who serve on them as longer deployments place an unfair burden on these sailors. and it would result in longer and more expensive maintenance to be conducted. reducing the time the vessels are able to react when needed.

The Department of Defense has created three procurement programs for Afghanistan. central Asian states. and Djibouti to support businesses and local economies in these countries and to cultivate positive relationships in the region and the world. The problem is. while I surely appreciate their intentions. there have been unintended consequences with this program in implementing these programs. The GSA has allowed businesses located in these countries to supply products manufactured by AbilityOne agencies. which employ blind and disabled Americans. The result of that policy has been devastating to many of these AbilityOne agencies across the country. We have seen job losses here in America in implementing this new policy by the Department of Defense. This amendment addresses the problem of these job losses by exempting those AbilityOne agencies from this Department of Defense procurement program. If you look at what has happened with this program. we have seen facilities not only in Louisiana but in States like New York. Texas. Ohio. Kansas. North Carolina. Nebraska. and Washington all experience job losses here in America from shipping those jobs over to foreign countries. Again. I thinkor I surely would hopethat that was not the intention of the program. Mr. Chairman. to take jobs away from disabled Americans and ship those jobs overseas. So what this amendment does is restore those jobs back here in America for those blind and other disabled Americans who have one of the highest underemployment populations in the country. Lets keep those jobs here. We can continue building relations with other countries. but just not at the expense of American jobs for disabled workers. That is what the amendment does. Mr. Chairman.

My second amendment would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on the way reductions in U.S. military readiness in Europe would affect NATOs core mission of collective defense. This report would be required before any reduction in Europe takes place. I view Vladimir Putins aggression as the greatest threat to European security since World War II. Today. NATOs article 5 must remain a credible deterrent. My amendment takes a step in that direction. Finally.

In my home State of Oklahoma. we have seen deaths from prescription drug overdose on the rise. In 2014. Oklahoma set a new record in the number of deaths by overdose. During that time. 864 people lost their lives and 510 of those people had prescription drugs as the cause. Oklahoma has continuously ranked near the top of the nation in narcotic prescribing activity and overdose deaths. In 2015. Oklahoma sought to address this problem by introducing House bill 1948 that requires doctors to check an online database before prescribing opioids. This law went into effect in November and was designed to help spot patients who are receiving prescriptions from several physicians at the same time. a practice known as doctorshopping. Oklahoma is taking an important step in addressing the opioid epidemic. but as we know. this does not just affect my State. but the entire Nation. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. CARA. will provide grants to States to fight the abuse of prescription pain relievers and heroin. as well as grants that address criminal justice activities. treatment of pregnant and postpartum women with substance abuse problems. first responder education and training and treatment and recovery programs. In addition. CARA addresses the opioid issue as it affects the veterans community specifically. Our veterans have put their lives on the line to protect our Nation. and it is our job to make sure that they are getting the treatment and prevention services they deserve. Many of our veterans come home with painful injuries that will alter their daily lives going forward. It is important that. through the Department of Veterans Affairs. we develop best practices for pain management that do not lead to addiction. CARA addresses this by requiring that all VA employees who prescribe opioids receive education and training on pain management and safe opioid prescribing practices. This truly is a comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic. and I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill as we take an important step in combating this addiction crisis.*",

It is a story that began in the tumult of World War II and still continues to this day. more than 70 years later. I speak of the loving relationship and marriage of Edward and Maxine Handziak. of Winchester. KY. In 1943. America faced the Axis Powers in World War II. Many Americans bravely wore their countrys uniform in the fight for freedom and democracy. Two of those Americans were native Kentuckian Maxine Hamon and her suitor Edward Handziak. Edward was in the U.S. military and stationed in Stillwater. OK. Maxine. who had volunteered for the Womens Reserve in the U.S. Navy. was also stationed there. The two met in a chance encounter at a roller skating rink. Edward was smitten with the young Kentuckian. and when he was sent abroad to serve in Europe he did not forget her. He wrote her letters faithfully. Even when shrapnel injured his writing hand. he wrote her with his left hand. He knew. when he returned to America. that he wanted to marry her. As soon as the war was over. Edward came home and proposed. And it turns out that. when he fell in love with Maxine. he fell in love with her hometown of Winchester as well and longed to return. A job with Gulf Oil delayed those plans. with his career sending him all over the country. The Handziaks finally settled down in Winchester in 1985. Today the couple has been happily married for more than 70 years. and they have three children. three grandchildren. and four greatgrandchildren. Maxines granddaughter still has her grandmothers roller skates from that fateful day when she met Edward. I am honored to represent the Handziaks here in the U.S. Senate and want to wish them every happiness and thank them for their service. I am sure my colleagues join me in expressing gratitude for their service as well. They truly represent the finest of Kentucky. Mr. President. an area publication. the Winchester Sun. published a compelling article on Edward and Maxines love story. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the RECORD.",

Clean water is the lifeblood of our society and the basic foundation of good public health. Our rivers. streams. and wetlands connect communities near and far through a common resource. For decades. the Clean Water Act has protected our waters from pollution so that Americans can rely on safe drinking water. can enjoy outdoor recreation. and can live in an environment that supports wildlife and a healthy ecosystem. However. for the last 15 years uncertainty has muddied the Clean Water Act. The lack of clarity for which bodies of water are federally regulated has led the Army Corps of Engineers to a backlog of 18.000 requests from landowners seeking help in complying with the Clean Water Act. The new clean water rule resolves this uncertainty for our local governments. our businesses. and our farmers by clarifying which waters should be protected so that all Americans can rely on clean water. The rule restores historic coverage of the Clean Water Act for streams and wetlands that provide drinking water for onethird of Americans. As one who has experienced the many benefits of the Chesapeake Bay my whole life. I know just how important it is to preserve and protect the world around us for future generations. The clean water rule would restore protections for more than half of Marylands streams and many of its wetlands. Clean water means healthy families. healthy marine life to support Maryland watermen. and a healthy environment.

These measures would block or nullify the clean water rule. which seeks to safeguard our water and restore protections to drinking water sources for one in three Americans. according to the EPA. under the authority of the Clean Water Act. The clean water rule helps to clarify ambiguities stemming from the 2001 and 2006 Supreme Court decisions that made the scope of the Clean Water Act uncertain. This lack of protection has taken its toll. especially for wetlands and intermittent and headwater streams. slowing permitting decisions for responsible development. and reducing protections for drinking water supplies and critical habitat. According to the National Parks Conservation Association. over 117 million Americans. including many visitors to national parks. get their drinking water from surface waters. This includes many Rhode Islanders who get their drinking water from sources that rely on small streams that are protected by the clean water rule. If Congress blocks the clean water rule. Rhode Islands streams and millions of acres of wetlands nationwide will again be at risk from pollution and degradation or destruction from development. oil and gas production. and other industrial activities. Blocking this rule would potentially imperil drinking water sources. as well as the small businesses and communities that rely on clean water. Thousands of acres of wetlands that provide flood protection. recharge groundwater supplies. filter pollution. and provide essential wildlife habitat are safeguarded under the clean water rule. including many of Rhode Islands streams. wetlands. waterways. and the bay. Additionally. the clean water rule seeks to protect small streams and wetlands that support fish. wildlife. and recreational areas. We depend on clean water to drink. and our economy depends on clean water from manufacturing to farming to tourism to recreation to energy production and more to function and flourish. We must make clean water a priority throughout the nation. I urge my colleagues to support the clean water rule and vote \"no\" on both S. 1140 and S.J. Res. 22.",

Unfortunately. the EPAs waters of the United States rule was written without sufficient collaboration with some of the people who care about this rule the mostour farmers. our small business owners. our cities and States. As a result. the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has blocked the implementation of the waters of the United States rule. known as WOTUS. nationwide.

Instead of further lengthy and costly court battles. Congress should act to clarify the coverage of the Clean Water Act or the courts will do that job instead of us.

The real tragedy we are confronted with today is that human beings have been reduced to mere commodities in this practice. and Federal dollars are contributing to it. I do not want to contribute to a system that profits from someones fate nor do I want to subject millions of taxpayers to supporting this violation of life. It is often a temptation to boil this argument down to medical terms and ignore the real losses our Nation faces when we choose to reject someone before he or she has been given the chance to live. For this reason. I do not support funding Planned Parenthood and its tragic influence on our Nations future. Defunding Planned Parenthood will have no effect on womens health. In the State of Idaho alone. there are 76 federally qualified health centers. and only 3 Planned Parenthood facilities. Women can and will receive health care in these facilities.",

House investigations are underway. and more needs to be done to protect our most vulnerable citizens. H.R. 3134 restores trust for American taxpayers.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. there has been a lot of talk about defunding Planned Parenthood. Some Republicans have made this such a priority that they are vowing to shut down our government. shut down our programs for veterans and hinder their ability to access services. WIC programs serving moms and babies. curtail services for domestic violence. and close our national parks and landmarks. The last Republican shutdown cost our economy $24 billion. but many of the GOPs Presidential candidates said in their debate just last night that defunding Planned Parenthood is a priority. We are not talking about abortion here. We are talking about access to health care. Under current law. Federal money cannot be used for the coverage for abortion except in the most extreme circumstances of rape. incest. or the possibility of the death of the mother. Even though most Americans disagree with that restriction and believe firmly that decisions surrounding pregnancy should be between a woman. her doctor. and her faith. that is not the law of the land currently. So if we are not talking about abortion. what are we talking about? What is this threat that will be stopped by cutting off all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood? What we are talking about is denying health care to the 2.7 million patients who received care just last year at Planned Parenthood. More than 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is preventative care. This includes wellness exams. cancer screenings. contraception. prenatal care. and testing and treatment for STIs. Just last year. Planned Parenthood had over 2 million contraception patients. performed approximately 3.7 million STI tests. 370.000 Pap tests. and 450.000 breast exams. These are the types of services patients receive at Planned Parenthood. and this preventive health care is what the majority would like to get rid of by defunding it. That is what is most important about this debate: the care that patients receive. the care that one in five American women will receive from Planned Parenthood at some point in their life. I would like to welcome my colleague. at this point. from New Jerseys 12th District. Congresswoman WATSON COLEMAN. She is a strong voice for women and families. I am proud to call her a friend and a colleague. and I yield to the gentlewoman.",

What we are talking about is exactly as the gentlewoman from New Jersey put it. We are talking about relitigating rights that are established under the law and that have really nothing to do with abortion. They are having everything to do with the way that one in five American women receives her health care. And Planned Parenthood not only has a huge reach in the patients that they serve. but they historically serve lowincome and underserved populations. For example. in 2013. 78 percent of Planned Parenthood patients had incomes of 150 percent of poverty or less. To put that in real terms. that is an income of a little over $36.000 dollars a year for a family of four. So not only does Planned Parenthood provide critical services to lowincome families. but they also have a geographic reach to help ensure all patients have a healthcare access point. Nationwide. they represent 54 percent of all health centers in rural areas. medically underserved areas. and health provider shortage areas. And in some areas. they are even a larger part of the healthcare system. In Alabama. Washington. D.C.. Delaware. Louisiana. Mississippi. Montana. Rhode Island. and Wyoming. they are 100 percent of the health centers in rural areas. medically underserved areas. and health provider shortage areas. That is why Planned Parenthood is so critical.

The last shutdown. which I think was in 2013it might have been 2011cost hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy.

In fact. we just saw real evidence of the success of the lawthe uninsured rate dropped to 12.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014. down from 17.1 percent in 2013. The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. but H.R. 30 is not the way to fix it. While it might seem like common sense idea to raise the threshold for ACA employer coverage to 40 hours a week from 30 hours a week. this misguided legislation would give employers a greater incentive to cut workers hours. Experts at UC Berkeley estimate that this policy would result in 6.5 million workers being vulnerable to cuts in their work hours. Furthermore. this legislation would increase the deficit by $45.7 billion. We need to build off the successes of the Affordable Care Act. not roll them back. I hope the 114th Congress can come back soon to consider real reforms to our health care system that increases access to care. reduces costs. and decreases the deficit.

The TransPacific Partnership is the biggest and the baddest of the trade deals that we have seen come before this country. It represents a dozen countries. From Chile to Japan. almost 800 million people are represented by countries that would be included within the TransPacific Partnership. and it represents 40 percent of the worlds economy. Yet the trade agreement has been drafted largely in secret. No one from the public has seen it. Quite honestly. Members of Congress havent seen it. But about 600 people in this country are involved with the drafting of this trade deal. It has great ramifications that go beyond trade. the 29 chapters that make up the TransPacific Partnership. We anticipate there also could be a move from leadership to introduce legislation to Fast Track the trade deal. What that means to Fast Track it is to really take away the publics ability. through their elected Members of Congress. to have a say. to be able to debate and to amend the trade deal.

We at the Progressive Caucus want to share with the public the various concerns that we may have about this very. very large. allencompassing trade deal that could affect American jobs. could affect food safety. could affect environmental concerns. could affect things like buy American laws. currency policy. and many. many more issues. I am joined by a number of Members of Congress today who would like to take part in this. and I would like to. at this time. yield to my colleague from the great State of New York. who has put a number of efforts towards this in working very strongly to make sure the public knows what is in the TransPacific Partnership.

As you mentioned. one of the concerns we have. not only in your region but in my district. is the loss of jobs that we have had because of some of these past trade deals that havent quite gone as promised. It has been estimated we have lost 4 million U.S. jobs due to just three trade deals. and threequarters of those jobs lost were in the manufacturing sector. I had mentioned earlier today at a press conference in Rock County. Wisconsin. a county that I share with Representative PAUL RYAN. we used to have Parker Pen. made good Americanmade quality pens. A thousand jobs at one time were in that community working at Parker Pen. In early 2010. the final jobs had moved to Mexico. That is just one example of the number of jobs that we lost just in south central Wisconsin. much less Flint. Michigan. and Los Angeles. California. and other parts of the country. So we appreciate your efforts and your comments.

American Motors was the company that ran the town. Almost everyone had a family member or a neighbor who worked at American Motors. Now. granted. we made Pacers and Gremlins. so there were some mistakes along the way. American Motors eventually went away to Renault. and it went away to Chrysler. It went away to nothing as well as the people who had the strong familysupporting wages from that auto industry. Now the companies that have replaced the auto industry are. quite honestly. jelly bean manufacturers and companies like that. It does not pay the same wage. It doesnt support the family in the same way. Just as we were promised with the Korean free trade agreement. especially around autos. in that 70.000 jobs would be created. instead. 60.000 jobs were lost. That is exactly why we have to be involved now while it matters. not after it has been negotiated. We dont have a debate. and we dont have a chance to amend it.

And I have to say. I am really glad you brought up the textile industry. because when we talk about the need to work together in this Congress. this is an issue where Democrats and Republicans can absolutely unite. About 12 years ago. I was on a delegation of the American Council of Young Political Leaders. And one of the people on the delegation was a very conservative judge from the State of Mississippi. She and I and the group had met with some sweatshop workers in Indonesia to talk about all the mills that have left. especially in the southern part of the United States. and those jobs are pretty much gone forever. I have been in business for 27 years. since I had hair. I have had a small business. And in that role. we screenprint on Tshirts. And I have watched over the years all of the mills that made Tshirts in the United States pretty much leave. It is pretty hard to find clothes still made in the USA. It is even harder to find them unionmade in the USA. And this is something that unites people of different political ideologies because we see those jobs leaving. It doesnt matter. It is not a Democratic job or a Republican job. These bad trade deals too often just cost us jobs. I appreciate you bringing that up. and thank you again for all that you do. Next I would like to yield to someone who has been an extraordinary leader in this area. She has helped to coordinate Members of Congress like no one else. not just on this issue but on many other issues. She is an absolutely tireless advocate for the American public and for making sure that Congress has the proper role when it comes to trade agreements.

I appreciate the opportunity to bring up H.R. 223. the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016. introduced by my Ohio colleague. Congressman DAVE JOYCE. on the floor today. The Great Lakes are an important resource for the United States. More than 30 million people live in the Great Lakes region. and the lakes help support over $200 billion a year in economic activity. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force of Federal agencies was created in 2004 by executive order to help ensure coordination between the Federal. State. and private parties protecting and restoring the Great Lakes. In 2010. the task force released an action plan as part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to accelerate efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes. Under the Initiative. the Environmental Protection Agency collaborates with other Federal partners. including the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force. to select the best combination of projects and activities for Great Lakes protection and restoration. In September of 2014. the Federal agencies released an updated Action Plan II. which summarizes the actions that the Federal agencies plan to implement during fiscal years 2015 through 2019. The Action Plan aims to strategically target the biggest threats to the Great Lakes ecosystem and to accelerate progress toward longterm goals. H.R. 223 will formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for 5 years and modifies the program based on recommendations that the Committee received from stakeholders. hearings. and the GAO reports on EPAs activities during multiple years of oversight. The bill is a positive step forward for the Great Lakes region and the United States as a whole as we continue to prioritize protection and restoration of one of our Nations most valuable resources.

BoB GIrns of Ohio. for helping me to shepherd this legislation through the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I also want to thank Chairman SHUSTER for lending a hand and providing guidance on this. Now. I know I may sound like a broken record. but one of the greatest natural resources and economic powerhouses we have in the United States and the world. for that matter. is the Great Lakes. I think the resource is incredibly important because. in the future. freshwater is going to be the new gold. And. if you believe that like I do. you understand why the Great Lakes are so important. Let me give you a few quick facts about this treasure. The Great Lakes contains onefifth of the worlds fresh surface water. The Great Lakes contain about 85 percent of the fresh surface water in North America. In the U.S.. the Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the fresh surface water. That is a lot of fresh water. If you took the water and spread it evenly across the Continental United States. the Great Lakes would submerge our country under 91/2 feet of water. These lakes provide more than 35 million people with their drinking water. These Great Lakes support more than 3.500 species of plants and animals. Studies have shown that more than 11/2 million jobs are connected to the five lakes. and they generate $62 billion in wages. Now. I know I have uttered those facts around the Capitol like a broken record since I got here. as have others. but these are powerful in telling our story. An investment in protecting this national treasure is a small down payment in protecting the drinking water for millions of people. This legislation will continue to make sure that we look at these Great Lakes as a national treasure and coordinate our investment in protecting them. Please stand with me today in sending a message to protect and preserve our Great Lakes.",

Congresswoman MILLER. who just spoke and who will be leaving Congress at the end of this year. She has been a defender of the Great Lakes for her entire time here. I think it is a fitting part of her legacy that this legislation. hopefully today. will pass this House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker. being from Michigan and being a part of the Great Lakes. really growing up around the lakes and in the lakes gives us a lot of pride in my home State. It is the greatest freshwater source. surface freshwater source on the planet. and provides drinking water to over 30 million Americans. It is a great economic resource as well with great benefits to our entire Nation. It supports millions of jobs. and billions of income every year is derived from the dependence that we have on this great resource. It supports commerce. agriculture. transportation. and tourism. It is home to over 3.500 species of plants and animals. It is an incredible ecosystem. But we know that the threat to the lakesthe threatsmultiple threats to the lakesare real. From invasive species like Asian carp to toxic chemical contamination and to habitat loss. we have to do everything we can within our power to protect the Great Lakes and combat these really clear present threats. So I am really proud in a very bipartisan fashion to support full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect and restore that which we have lost in the largest system of fresh water in the world. In the short time that the GLRI has been in place. we have made progressand we know that this is an effective programaddressing longstanding environmental problems confronting the lakes. Over 2.500 individual projects have already been implemented to improve water quality. to clean up contaminated shorelines. to protect and restore native habitats and species. and to control invasive species. Mr. Speaker. we are here because we know we have to do more.

Mr. POSEY. and Mr. MURPHY of Florida for helping to draft this legislation and reauthorization. We all share the hope that this is the last goaround to get this done. Estuaries across the country. including the Delaware Bay and Barnegat Bay estuaries in my district. have immeasurable economic. ecological. and environmental benefit. They deserve continued congressional support. This version of the National Estuary Program reauthorization is a bipartisan. fiscally responsible compromise with the Senate that reduces the authorization by $8.5 million. The important part is it ultimately increases the amount of money each estuary program will receive. Unlike many programs under the Clean Water Act. the National Estuary Program is a nonregulatory program. uniquely designed to support the collaborative. voluntary efforts of Federal. State. and local stakeholders to restore degraded estuaries. Unfortunately. the NEPs have been losing money due to increasing EPA administrative costs. We have heard that before. but. in this particular case. it is really hurting. To correct that. our legislation details precisely how the EPA is to spend the authorized and appropriated money. By setting limits of 5 percent for the EPAs administrative costs. we can guarantee 80 percent of the funding goes directly to the needs of the estuary and not bureaucratic salary and red tape. Also. in this years reauthorization. we have set aside 15 percent of the funding for a competitive award program. This program seeks applications to deal with urgent and challenging issues that threaten the ecological and economic wellbeing of coastal areas. By structuring how the money is spent and lowering authorization levels. this legislation strikes the right balance of fiscal and environmental responsibility.

H.R. 1684. the Foreign Spill Protection Act of 2016. clarifies that owners and operators of oil production facilities located offshore and outside the United States are liable for cleanup costs and damages from oil spills. These foreign entities are responsible for oil spills that originate outside U.S. waters if they threaten or cause damage in the United States. The foreign entities would be subject to criminal and civil penalties. Federal removal authority. and any Stateauthorized remedy currently allowed under Federal and State law. I would like to commend the cooperation shown by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman SHUSTER. Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee Chairman HUNTER. and Ranking Member GARAMENDI in working out the final details of this legislation. Mr. Speaker. the Deepwater Horizon disaster painfully reminded us of how catastrophic an offshore oil spill can be. both in its geographic reach and in its environmental and economic costs. The settled liability and enforcement regimes authorized under the Oil Pollution Act and the Clean Water Act have proven themselves to be comprehensive. durable. and effective. In the event of a spill. this response regime has ensured time and time again that the Federal Government has clear. unequivocal authority to respond to a spill. restore the environment and communities harmed. and recover damages for the harm caused. This legislation will in no way impede or change those indispensable authorities. In closing. it is a helpful enhancement to clarify that spills originating from foreign sources fall under this wellestablished legal regime.

This bill isolates the enemy to be those who are Islamist. those who are foreign. and those who are being radicalized by foreigners. How does this bill address the threat of terror from those who are not just jaded jihadists. like this bill was initially titled. but. rather. a part of domestic militia or part of a rightwing. ultraconservative. racist organization that wants to kill African Americans or other vulnerable populations? A recent study by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that State and local law enforcement personnel are almost twice as concerned about rightwing and antigovernment terrorism as they are about the threat from al Qaeda. ISIS. and similar groups. The concerns of State and local law enforcement about domestic terrorism are well placed. Within the last year. we have seen a rightwing terrorist kill nine people at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and an antiabortion terrorist kill three people at the Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado. Since the attacks of 9111. within the United States. domestic terrorists have killed 48 people. more than those killed by foreign terrorist -inspired attacks. Shouldnt we be concerned about those who have demonstrated the greatest threat to our homeland in the last 15 years? H.R. 4820 represents a marked departure from a national strategy to combat terrorism and that recognizes that individuals who promote and use violence against the U.S. are inspired by a range of religious. political. or other ideological beliefs.",

Mr. Liberatore was a former Burlington Township fire chief. and dedicated his life to emergency services and caring for his community. It is not often that we come across public servants who not only embody the spirit of service. but who approach that service with passion and excitement. Libby was truly one of those menhe began his career as a volunteer firefighter in 1971 and went on to fill countless positions and duties over the next 43 years. He spent six years as fire chief and received the State Firefighter of the Year Award in 1992. His friends and colleagues describe him as the key individual responsible for bringing people together. Mr. Liberatore organized educational trips to conventions. encouraged a spirit of healthy competition. and led fundraisers for the fire station. His devotion to those around him never went unnoticed. and the South Jersey community is greatly improved because of his life and work. It is my sincere hope that Libby will continue be an inspiration to those who knew him. and that we can all strive to reflect the same values of service. love. and dedication he personified.

When it comes to Yael Levy. who founded Riverdale Riverfest. the commitment to highlighting the need for expanded access to our scenic Hudson waterway has turned a simple passion into a community calling. Yael founded Riverdale Riverfest in June. 2010 in hopes of advancing the timetable for construction of the Hudson River Greenway Link. a waterfront park that would connect the Manhattan Hudson River Greenway to the old Croton Aqueduct Trail in Westchester County. The festival has become an annual tradition for many. bringing people from all over the Northwest Bronx to the campus of the College of Mount Saint Vincent. which sits on the Hudsons shores. The festival is a great time for the entire family. and offers everything from stage performances and local vendors to boat rides. By giving the community a taste of how wonderful year round public access to the waterfront would be. the festival has gone a long way toward building the public support necessary to make the Greenway Link a reality. When Yael is not working to expand river access. she is serving as Deputy Chief of the Appeals Bureau at the Nassau County District Attorneys Office. and teaching New York Criminal Practice at St. Johns University School of Law. A proud mother of three. Yael has loved raising her family in Riverdale. and hopes to someday be able to cycle with them along the Hudson without having to start by leaving the Bronx. This year. The Riverdale Jewish Community Relations Council is honoring Yael with the Community Builder Award at their annual Legislative Breakfast. I want to congratulate Yael on this wonderful honor. and thank her for all she has done to enhance and promote our beautiful community.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am encouraged that today the House will consider two E331 important public health bills that deal with traumatic injury. These two bills would reauthorize a number of important trauma programs to help equip states to deliver these critical medical services. Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death for children and adults under the age of 45. After an accident. the care received in the first hour presents the highest likelihood that the patient will survive rapid intervention after a traumatic injury. Without that immediate care. their survival rates decrease by 25 percent. Trauma systems not only provide rapid intervention at the time of injury but also include supporting equipment and personnel. and a continuum of care. including prehospital. hospital. and rehabilitation services The first bill. H.R. 648. the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act. which passed the House last year. allows for planning and implementing trauma care systems in the States. The bill would also establish pilot projects for innovative models of regionalized trauma care. The second bill. H.R. 647. the Access to LifeSaving Trauma Care for All Americans Act. reauthorizes two additional trauma programs that will increase the availability of trauma services. Trauma centers should be available for all victims of traumatic injury. Unfortunately. many trauma centers are at serious risk of closure and financial insolvency. In fact. nearly thirty trauma centers have closed in the past fifteen years. The programs included in this bill will provide critically needed federal funding to help cover uncompensated costs in trauma centers. support core mission trauma services. provide emergency finding to trauma centers. and address trauma center physician shortages in order to ensure the future availability of trauma care for all our citizens. Mr. Speaker. none of these programs have received funding during the appropriations process in recent years. I hope that our consideration of these measures signals the importance of these programs to Members of Congress. I would like to thank Mr. GREEN and",

This important bill protects the rights of women seeking family planning services. Women deserve to receive comprehensive. impartial. and medically accurate information when making personal health decisions. Unfortunately. there are socalled Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) that deliberately misinform or mislead women seeking information on family planning services. They pose as sources of unbiased pregnancy counseling. using deceptive propaganda to dissuade women from considering comprehensive birthcontrol options or legal abortion. These fake reproductive health clinics entice women through their doors under the pretense of providing the full range of reproductive options and services. and this bill would expose their deceptive tactics. The Stop Deceptive Advertising for Womens Services Act directs the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act. declaring it an unfair or deceptive act for an entity. such as a crisis pregnancy center. to advertise as a provider of abortion services if the entity does not provide abortion services. Clearly. deception and intimidation have no place when a woman is seeking information about her pregnancy. Working together we can help stop the fraud and confusion these Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) are perpetrating on the women of America. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislationbecause women deserve access to the best. most comprehensive healthcare information. Women need and deserve accurate and comprehensive information when making personal decisions about family planning. and socalled Crisis Pregnancy Centers provide neither.

The area that became Shenandoah was first settled in 1835 by Peter Kehley. who developed the land for farming. The settlement was maintained for two decades. After anthracite coal was discovered. the land was sold to the Philadelphia Land Company. Planning for the town began under Peter Schaeffer in 1862. Shenandoah was officially incorporated on January 16. 1866. Situated in the Middle Western Coal Field. the area around Shenandoah contained rich deposits of anthracite. As mining got under way. the boroughs population grew in response to the increased demand for labor. Shenandoah became a hub for business. attracting depots for three major railroad companies to ship coal to New York and Philadelphia. Immigrants came first from Wales. Ireland. and Germany. Later. immigrants from Lithuania. Poland. Ukraine and Slovakia arrived. With each new wave of immigrants. parochial schools and places of worship arose unique to their own ethnic group. By the 1920s. Shenandoah had developed a garment industry with 15 large factories at the peak of clothing production. Today. Shenandoah is experiencing a revitalization. People are moving into the region. some in retirement and many to raise their families. Houses are being restored. businesses are being opened. Shenandoah is now home to popular brands such as Mrs. Ts Pierogies. Lees Oriental Foods. Kowaloneks Kielbasy Shop. Luckys. and Capitols Kielbasy. It is an honor to recognize Shenandoah on its sesquicentennial. I am proud to represent a community so rich in history. May the people of Shenandoah be proud of their past and look forward to a bright future as they celebrate the citys 150th anniversary.",

The Douglass School celebrated this anniversary in Loudoun County last month on the 13th of August. and it is my pleasure to briefly highlight the impact this school has had on my constituents. The Douglass School has had a terrific history of success since first opening its doors in 1941. Named after Fredrick Douglass. the famous AfricanAmerican antislavery leader. the Douglass School has stood as a pillar of education for those it serves. Before its founding. AfricanAmerican families needed a place to educate their children. These parents worked tirelessly to raise the four thousand dollars necessary to purchase the land for building the school. Since the school was desegregated in 1968. it has provided high quality education to students from every race. background. and creed. Equipped with top tier teachers and staff. this school has produced countless student success stories. Coming from a family of educators. I understand how important a strong education is to the future of our nation. It is schools like the Douglass School that will continue to help shape the United States role in the everchanging global economy. while also producing many of our nations future leaders. Over the years. the faculty has shown an impressive dedication not only to its students. but to the Loudoun community as a whole. The success of this school is a tremendous accomplishment that should make past and present faculty proud. Mr. Speaker.

Oregon. and Utah to prohibit public land management agencies in this bill from making declarations under the Antiquities Act in counties where there is significant local opposition. Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin by stating my strong support for our Nations public lands. As an active hunter and an outdoorsman. I marvel at the beauty of our landscapes. our unique flora. and the abundant animal species that roam our terrain. With that being said. I also come from Nevada. a State where roughly 85 percent of the land is controlled by the Federal Government. Addressing this concentration of land use decisionmaking power in the hands of Washington bureaucrats has been one of the strong motivating factors during my time in this body. as I am sure that it has been for many of my colleagues in the Western States. While this concentration is certainly a topic that should be addressed by the authorizing committees. I believe that we can and should take an important step here today. A recent prominent example demonstrating the need for this amendment is the administrations draft proclamation to establish the Basin and Range National Monument on more than 700.000 acres of land in Lincoln and Nye Counties in my district. Not only is the sheer size of the proposed monument staggering. being nearly as large as many of the Eastern States. it also poses some significant risks. both local and national in scope. Nevadas economy was one of the hardest hit by the Great Recession. and far too many in our State are still struggling to get by. Nevadas rural county economies are particularly sensitive. and any decision that restricts ranching. recreation. and types of land use activities should have much of the local input as possible. Earlier this year I spoke on the floor of the House about the national security implications of designating the Basin and Range. given that most of the acreage in the proposed monument falls directly under the airspace of the Nevada Test and Training Range. one of the most heavily used military operating areas. or MOAs. in the United States. Establishing this monument could drastically impair vital groundbased training activities tied to the NTTR. Mr. Chairman. I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Arizona .",

I should add. that has been available to Presidents for 100 years. The Antiquities Act is an important tool that enables the President to protect and strengthen Americas heritage. Since Theodore Roosevelt first designated the national monument Devils Tower in Wyoming. 16 Presidents from both parties have used the Antiquities Act to protect more than 160 of Americas best known and loved landscapes. Only three Presidents have not. National monuments tell the story of the American people. Out of 460 national monuments and national parks. 113 reflect the diverse community that makes up our Nation. Nineteen recognize the achievements of the Latino community. twentysix of the African American community. and eight for women. It should be noted that an important factor in the designation process is the First Americans. the Native Americans. their legacy. their heritage. and their cultural and historic resources on the land. But with the Antiquities Act. the lack of diversity reflected in our public units. whether it is parks or national monuments. is changing. President Obama has been using the Antiquities Act to diversify the story of public lands with new designations such as the Cesar Chavez National Monument in Keene. California. which he recently designated. Since the beginning of his administration. the President used this authority to create national monuments that recognize the contributions of Africa Americans and other diverse voices in this country. The Center for American Progress published a report that found that 33 percent of presidential designations are inclusive of the American people. compared to only 20 percent of the designations done by Congress. Americas public places are becoming more inclusive. more representative of all Americans because of the Antiquities Act. This amendment would jeopardize that progress. I urge its defeat.

GOMESA was passed in 2006 and created a revenue sharing agreement for offshore oil revenue between the Federal Government and four States in the Gulf of Mexico: Texas. Louisiana. Mississippi. and my home State of Alabama. Under GOMESA. 37.5 percent of the revenues generated from selected oil and gas lease sales in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico is returned to these Gulf States. There is a reason the law was structured this way. These Gulf States not only provide the lions share of the infrastructure and workforce for the industry in the Gulf of Mexico. we also have inherent environmental and economic risks. The BP oil spill 5 years ago should tell us all what that means. Unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. in his budget proposal this year. President Obama has recommended that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. under the Department of the Interior. redirect the distribution of expanded revenue payments expected to start in 2018 for the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leases away from the Gulf Coast and instead be spent all around the country. Not only does this proposal directly contradict the current Federal statute. it vastly undermines the purpose of the law. to keep revenues from these lease sales in the States that supply the workforce and have the inherent risk of a potential environmental and economic disaster. My amendment today is simple. to protect the clearly defined statute and prevent the President from using these revenue sharing agreements as a slush fund for politically driven environmental projects across the country.

Mr. Speaker. in our multiyear effort to update the Communications Act. one of the most common themes we have heard is the convergence of the telecommunications marketplace. No longer are companies just one service over just one medium. Both technology and consumer expectations have completely changed the game. However. the agency tasked with regulating the communications sector still exists in the outdated and siloed structure that reflects decadesold assumptions. even how they evaluate and report on the industry. While that fractured approach will be a continued focus of our CommActUpdate process. this bill will take an important first step toward modernizing the way we look at this sector and its regulator. This legislation consolidates eight separate reports that require the FCC to evaluate the state of competition in various sectors and combines those eight reports into just a single biennial report to Congress on the communications marketplace as a whole. This bill also takes the important step of eliminating outdated reports that only serve to junk up the Communications Act and cause confusion. Reports like the ORBIT Actwhich I have a copy of hereare aimed at ensuring that satellites that were long ago privatized are procompetitive. an examination that the FCC and the industry recognizes as both outdated. unnecessary. and burdensome. There are still laws on the books that address such outdated technologies as telegraphs. This is a small but significant step toward cleaning up the act and modernizing the laws and the agency that control this very dynamic marketplace. Ensuring that all of the reports on the books are both necessary and effective helps to reduce the burden on the agency. It also helps the regulatory agency make more informed decisions. I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues. Representative SCALISE. Ranking Member ESHOO. and the ranking member of the full committee. Mr. PALLONE. for their work to make this bill a bipartisan success both today and. frankly. in the last two sessions of Congress.

The communications and technology sectors are driving economic growth across the Nation. connecting businesses to markets large and small and delivering innovative new products and services to consumers. As part of this critical mission. Congress has tasked the FCC with compiling reports to provide the public with information about these dynamic markets. Democrats and Republicans agree that the FCC needs to collect good data. Consumers and businesses rely on this information. and we here in Congress need this information. too. in order to make sound policy decisions and conduct effective oversight of the FCC. Mr. Speaker. by consolidating certain reports and eliminating references to other outdated reports. this bill allows the FCC to use the agencys limited resources more wisely and present a more holistic analysis of the communications marketplace. At the same time. we have worked together to ensure this effort to promote efficiency does not undermine important existing FCC obligations and authorities.

As part of the Committees markup of H.R. 734. two important clarifications were made. First. in our effort to consolidate reporting requirements. the legislation clarifies that the FCCs 706 Report does not in any way impact or alter the explicit grant of broadband authority that the court affirmed in the Verizon case last year.

H.R. 2347 was introduced by Representative CLAY to help improve the governance and transparency of the Federal advisory committees. Congress acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to acquire viewpoints from business. academic. and other interests when it passed the Federal Advisory Committee Act in While not necessarily well known. Federal advisory committees are small bodies of people who provide advice. guidance. or recommendations to Federal policymakers on a wide range of topics. All told. in fiscal year 2014. 825 Federal advisory committees held 7.173 meetings at a cost to the American taxpayer of more than $334 million. While these committees undoubtedly provided a number of valuable insights. it is important that we continue to work to ensure that these committees produce the best value for the taxpayer. Unfortunately. some agencies note that the FACA requirements are cumbersome and resource intensive. thus reducing the ability of the committees to focus on substantive issues in a timely fashion. Both governmental agencies and private groups say that the 1972 act does not do enough to require agencies to promote openness and transparency. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 2347 works to address these problems and bring transparency to Federal advisory committees and the Federal agency decisionmaking process. It also clarifies transparency of committee membership by requiring members to be selected without political affiliation. giving agency heads authorization to require members to fully disclose conflicts of interest and treating those individuals who regularly attend and participate in committee meetings to be considered as a member. even if they are not allowed to vote. H.R. 2347 classifies transparency of committee activities further by ensuring the committees advice. information. and recommendations are judgments of the committee and not the agency and. also. by requiring each agency to make available on their Web site the committee and its activities.

Let me first thank my colleague. the gentleman from Oklahoma . as well as the majority party for working with us to get this bill to this forum and to get it ready for passage. I rise in strong support of the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments. I have introduced this bill in each of the last four Congresses. and I am hopeful that this time the bill will make it to enactment. [ 1300 The Federal Advisory Committee Act is one of our core open government laws. FACA is intended to ensure that advisory committees provide objective advice and operate with transparency. Over time. however. agencies have implemented FACA inconsistently and judges have created loopholes in the law. This bill closes the loopholes that allow agencies to get around the Act. Currently. agencies can avoid FACAs requirements by conducting committee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that FACA applies to subcommittees as well as to the parent committees. The bill also clarifies that a committee that is set up by a contractor is subject to FACA if it is formed under the direction of the President or an agency. Under FACA. agencies would be required to disclose how advisory members are chosen. whether they have financial conflicts of interest if they are appointed to provide their own expertise. and who they work for if they are representing a specific interest. This bill includes changes to lower the cost of implementation based on discussions with the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically. the bill would include a more streamlined definition of what would be considered a committee under the bill. This bill will make the government more accountable by shedding light on who is advising the government and on how one is advising the government.

The shift of food safety oversight from FDA to FSIS for this specific product establishes a nontariff trade barrier against imported pangasius. Exporting countries will have to obtain an \"equivalency\" determination from FSIS if they wish to preserve their producers\" ability to export to the United States. Because the FSIS equivalency process routinely takes five years and sometimes over a decade to complete. this will create for those producers an insurmountable barrier to the U.S. market. Thus in a single stroke more than a fifth of the \"value white fish\" supply in the United Statesabout 250 million pounds a year will disappear. This reduction in supply will cause a dramatic increase in prices for our companies and our customers who rely on an affordable product for fish sticks in the freezer aisle and popular fish and chips menu items in restaurants. In addition. we are aware of persistent calls for expansion of the program to even more popular tilapia and shrimp. Such calls suggest that the existing USDA program is just the beginning. Nor is the program justified on a food safety basis. USDA concedes that not a single case of Salmonella has been attributed to pangasius (or. for that matter. to domestic catfish) since establishment of the current FDA seafood regulatory approach in 1998. The Government Accountability Office has concluded that the USDA program will harm Federal food safety oversight by fracturing seafood regulation between two different regulatory agencies. For that and other reasons. GAO on ten different occasions has identified the program as a waste of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars and has urged the Congress to eliminate it. The United States must have a rigorous. effective food safety system. That system. however. should not prevent retailers and restaurants from sourcing the seafood that meets the demand of middle class American families for affordable. accessible protein.

    "speech": "Mr. President. all of us mourn the passing of a distinguished former Member of this body. Senator Bob Bennett of Utah. who died of an illness on May 4. I doubt that there were any in the Senate who did not truly like and admire Bob Bennett. His gentle spirit. his kindness. his civility. and his empathy for others were reflected in his work here for the people of Utah and for the Nation. Marcelle and I are fortunate to have called Bob and Joyce Bennett our friends while we served together. Senator Bennett and I were poles apart on many issues that came before the Senate. but. as with many others in this body. we were able to work together in good faith to find ways forward through many issues. knowing how important it was to our constituents. to the country. and to the Senate for us to do that. He followed the tradition of other highly respected Senators when I joined this body: He always kept his word. At the very end of his life. as he lay in a hospital bed in Salt Lake City. we now have heard from his family of yet another sign of his decency and humanity. as he specially sought out Muslim members of the hospital staff to thank them and to personally apologize to them for what they have heard of the divisive and hateful messages and the pandering to fear that has spilled out from the current Presidential campaign. He wanted them to know that he and most Americans welcome them. appreciate them. and recognize the pain that these invectives have caused and continue to cause. Reading and hearing his sons description of his dads outreach in his final days touched me deeply. as I am sure is the case for all of us here and for all Americans of goodwill everywhere. All of us can learn from his poignant gestures. and we can resolve to deepen our own commitment to the eternal valuesand the American valuesthat motivated him. What a powerful lesson he leaves for us all. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Salt Lake City Deseret News about this remarkable and telling episode from the final days of Senator Bennetts life be printed in the RECORD.",

NRCAs 3.800 members. located across all 50 States. play a key role in the installation and maintenance of roofing systems.

National Roofing Week is a valuable reminder of the significance that quality roofing has on our communities and honors the thousands of contractors in the roofing industry across the United States. The NRCAs vast network of roofing contractors and industryrelated members handle a majority of new construction and replacement roof systems on commercial and residential structures across the United States. However. the organizations activities extend beyond its construction duties. National Roofing Week offers an opportunity to distinguish the thousands of NRCA members and their commitment to supporting their local communities.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I oppose Sec. 1094 of this bill. The language included in the underlying bill is dangerously vague. and allows contractors. or any entity that receives federal funds. to discriminate based on the faulty guise of religious exemption. Since \"religious corporation\" is undefined by the bill or by courts. this provision applies too broadly. Lets be cleara \"religious corporation\" could range from a religious institution like a church to a corporation with a religious CEO. Therefore. any vaguely religious organization or corporation receiving federal funds could legally discriminate against LGBT Americans if they feel like hiring them violates their religious beliefs. A corporation with a religious CEO could decide not to hire. or to fire. LGBT people. A religious university could fire employees with no religious job requirement. such as a scientist or custodial worker. simply because they are LGBT. Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund discrimination. Last year. I offered an amendment to the Transportation Appropriations Bill that affirmed President Obamas executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. My amendment passed with a near supermajority. including 60 Republicans. I believe all of my colleagues can agree on these two thingsthe federal government should not infringe on religious freedom. nor should we do business with groups that discriminate. No American should be fired. denied a job or a place to live because of who they are or who they love. I urge my colleagues to stand on the side of equality and against discrimination and oppose this provision.",

This amendment requires the Department of Defense to report on the structure and size of its civilian and contractor workforce. This reporting requirement is a continuation of misguided assaults on the federal workforce which delivers capabilities needed to build back readiness and support operations. Furthermore. it adds an unneeded layer of bureaucracy with redundant reporting requirements. The information called for in this provision is already provided in eight separate statutes and this additional burden is unjustifiable. Not only is the report duplicative and unnecessary. the \"findings\" section is littered with misinformation and subjective clauses. It is yet another transparent attempt to attack civilian and contracted personnel. who have borne a disproportionate share of the fiscal burden levied on the Department of Defense. The first \"finding\" states in no uncertain terms that the civilian workforce has reduced the Departments capabilities. a statement that is maliciously inaccurate. Civilian personnel provide a costeffective workforce and contribute unique capabilities to our national security at home and abroad. particularly in key areas such as intelligence and cyber operations. For these reasons I am strongly opposed. as is the Department of Defense. to the inclusion of the reporting requirement and hope to work with my colleagues in conference to address this biased and unnecessarily punitive amendment.",

Mrs. Duvall was known for her technological leadership and role in advancing free speech. but more than that she will be remembered for her kindness. her passion. and her love for life. Born and raised in New York. she moved to California after college. where she received a masters degree from Stanford University. began her career. and met her husband of 37 years. Bill. Together. the Duvalls helped found and run Surfwatch Software. the first program that allowed users to block explicit online content back in the nascent days of the internet. Surfwatch was later usedsuccessfullyas a linchpin in arguments to repeal the antiindecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act. seen as a victory for free speech advocates. While her professional accomplishments are impressive. Id be remiss not to mention her unyielding enthusiasm. thirst for adventure. and compassion for others.

A Francophile and avid backpacker. she and her husband hiked the entire GR10 trail in France. walking from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. But her gusto was not reserved just for herself. Following a bout with breast cancer. Mrs. Duvall worked as an advocate for other breast cancer patients. She had a way with people that left anyone she came across feeling welcomed and appreciated. Our community is a slightly darker place today without Ann Duvall lightening our lives.

It is therefore appropriate that we pay tribute to her today and express our deepest condolences to her husband. family. and friends.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. restoring. protecting. and preserving our vulnerable coastal habitats remain among the most important priorities for those of us in Louisiana. Coastal erosion has reduced our Nations largest marsh by more than 2.000 square miles since 1930. We need to work toward effective solutions combating coastal erosion because it affects our homes. businesses. and daily lives. That is why I would like to recognize Wetland Resources. LLC. of Tickfaw. LA. as Small Business of the Week. The threat of natural disaster will always remain for those of us living in Louisiana. and it is well known that coastal restoration goes handinhand with storm protection. In the 10 years since Hurricane Katrina. which flooded 80 percent of New Orleans and displaced thousands across the country. we as a State have made great strides to protect our homes and communities. and our future is brighter than ever. But we are not done yet. Husband and wife team Gary Shaffer and Demetra Kandelepas of Wetland Resources have stepped up to play a major role in coastal restoration and in 2009 began devising a way to rebuild and protect our coastline. Shaffer. a biology professor at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond. LA. and Kandelepas. an ecologist with a doctorate degree. have been growing hurricaneresistant plants. such as cypress and tupelo trees. along Louisianas receding coast. This creates a natural barrier of healthy flora more likely to sustain vulnerable coastal habitats during strong storms. In order to reinvigorate the vegetation along Louisianas coastline. Wetland Resources targets areas that are filled with treated sewerage and wastewater from nearby cities. These areas are nutrient rich and serve as ideal incubators for newly planted cypress and tupelo trees. These species of trees can live for hundreds of years. and their root systems grow laterally. which connect with adjacent trees to create an effective barrier from storm surges and gale force winds. Today. Shaffer and Kandelepas are developing new ways to plant and protect their seeds. In addition to their most recent development. a biodegradable protective casing for their seedlings that allows 4.000 trees to be planted each day. Wetland Resources. LLC. has received numerous awards. Congratulations to Wetlands Resources. LLC. of Tickfaw. LA. this weeks Small Business of the Week. I look forward to seeing the ongoing impact of your innovative ideas in restoring our coastline and protecting our families and homes.*",

Numerous Syrians travel to the Israeli border in their hour of need. and in an act of compassion Israeli hospitals have provided lifesaving medical treatment. Medical teams along the Syrian and Israeli border treat these Syrians in field hospitals. and those requiring more intensive medical treatment are transferred to one of four hospitals. Among the victims treated by these hospitals are innocent children who have been gravely injured by the violence. These heroic efforts may seem inconceivable considering the longstanding conflict between the two nations. However. these Israeli hospitals demonstrate that by welcoming Syrians in need humanity trumps politics and hostility. The impact of this generosity goes beyond that of medical treatment. As one doctor from the Ziv Medical Center stated. the compassion shown by the Israeli medical teams is \"planting the seeds of peace.\" In an area of the world that has been plagued by violence and destruction. the assistance provided by these hospitals offers a beacon of hope. It is my hope that the seeds of peace will grow and that future generations may live amongst each other. no longer in hostility. but in solidarity and friendship.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. every summer youth without access to books lose academic skills. while those who are reading continue to make progress in developing their proficiency. Studies show that summer learning loss is a significant cause of the achievement gap between lower and higherincome youth. Students from lowincome households learn at E968 the same rate as their peers while school is in session. but while middle and upperincome students show slight gains in their reading performance after the summer months. lower income students experience a twomonth loss in reading achievement. It is what teachers refer to as the \"summer slide\" or \"summer setback.\" This loss is cumulative: while teachers spend 46 weeks reteaching material to the students who have fallen behind over the summer. other students are progressing with their skills. The result? By the end of the sixth grade. children who lose reading skills during the summer are on average 2 years behind their peers. Even more startling is the conclusion of University of Nevada research. which has shown that students without access to books are less likely to complete their basic education. The simple fact is that there are fewer opportunities for daily summer reading when both parents are away at work. Without access to books. our kids fall behind. My daughter teaches English at Baylor University. She has dedicated her life to edifying the young people of this country by instilling in them a love for reading. and for the intellectual tradition it gives them access to. This love needs to start early. and the inheritance of that tradition should be accessible to all Americans. That is why I am proud of the efforts of KHOU and Star Furniture. who are rolling out a new community effort to increase the literacy rate in Houston.

The Farm Credit System was established by Congress through the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 which was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. Next month will mark the centennial of this vital network. I was pleased to cosponsor House Resolution 591. introduced by House Agriculture Committee Chairman MIKE CONAWAY and Ranking Member COLLIN PETERSONCommending the cooperative owners and employees of the Farm Credit System for their important contributions over the last century. Congress designed the Farm Credit System as a network of cooperatives that would be able to respond to the needs of farmers and rural communities. My district covers an important agricultural area in Central New York. The 24th District of New York is home to some of the most productive fruit. vegetable. dairy and diversified farms in the state. According to the census of agriculture. Cayuga County ranks second in the state and Wayne County ranks fifth in terms of the value of agricultural production. Farms in my district are served by Farm Credit East. which has over $4 billion in loan commitments to its nearly 9.000 customers in New York. As part of its centennial celebration. Farm Credit sponsored the Fresh Perspectives program to identify 100 leaders that are making a difference in rural America. Leaders were nominated in 10 different categories. From the top 100 list. a top honoree in each category was selected. Im proud to say that Christine Fesko. of Skaneateles. NY was selected as the top honoree in the category of Agriculture Education and Community Impact. In addition to running a 600 cow dairy farm with her family. Chris operates the Discovery Center where children. who wouldnt otherwise be able to see a working farm. can learn about agriculture. She has also produced a series of awardwinning educational videos to teach children about agriculture and modern farming practices. She was elected to the Farm Credit East board of directors where she served from 2003 to 2016. As the Farm Credit System celebrates its centennial. I want to recognize farmers like Chris who have made this cooperative system strong as it begins its next 100 years.",

The Constitution does not have a Burger King provision for the executive branch. The President cannot have it his way. Laws are written by Congress.

But the real threat is not from shadow banking. The real threat comes from the shadow regulatory system that basically operates outside of our system of checks and balances with absolutely no accountability to the public and with little or no input from the Congress to conduct our proper oversight. You see. the FSOC and the OFR are the embodiment of this shadow system. For years now. the FSOC has continuously denied our committees simple request for some information about how it operates and about its proceedings. Really. all we know about these meetings are a few sentences that it drops into their press releases. Meanwhile. even though the OFR embarrassed itself with its asset manager report that was issued back in 2013. that office basically still operates largely outside of the public eye. So it is time to shine the light of day on both of these bodies. Mr. Speaker. particularly in light of the recent invalidation of MetLifes toobigtofail designation by FSOC.

It is through these entities that the DoddFrank Act identifies risks in our financial systems and guards against another financial crisis. FSOC and OFR have been intentionally placed outside political pressure. They make our financial system safer and protect the American people from a future financial crisis. However. the bill we are debating today would cripple FSOC and OFR by subjecting them to unnecessary political influence. putting our financial system at risk. My colleagues across the aisle would have us believe that FSOC and OFR have free rein to set and approve their own budgets. and are. therefore. agencies that have run amok. FSOCs budget is approved by a majority vote of its members. FSOC does not have unchecked budget authority. FSOCs budget is similar to. and modeled after. the FDICs budget mode.",

I do not support the creation of FSOC and OFR and do not think that 10 unelected agency heads should be able to have such influence over the U.S. financial system. But H.R. 3340 doesnt even curtail any of FSOCs or OFRs powers. It simply provides greater accountability by making their budget subject to the annual Congressional appropriations process. Strengthening congressional oversight would force FSOC and OFR to address questions and concerns from both sides of the aisle. Requiring OFR to report quarterly to Congress and provide the standard public notice and comment period before issuing any report or regulation is just common sense. In fact. it would ultimately serve the public interest to provide transparency and diverse perspectives on issues affecting the financial services industry. The FSOC has the authority to declare large companies as \"systematically important financial institutions\" and then subject them to a new. costly regulatory regime that is designed for banks. I have serious concerns about their power. but this bill wouldnt even change that. It would only provide desperately needed transparency and accountability to the SIFI designation process. which was recently described by a Federal judge as \"fatally flawed\" and \"arbitrary and capricious.\" 2008 demonstrated that we need effective regulation of our financial system. but regulators need to be held accountable for their decisions. especially given the impact they have on the competitiveness of U.S. companies.

This bill represents another example of death by a thousand cuts from our friends on the other side of the aisle. It is another Republican attack on the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. After the catastrophe of the financial crisis and the near collapse of our banking system. Republicans are. once again. jeopardizing the stability of our financial system. How many times will Republicans waste taxpayer dollars with these partisan and dangerous attacks on the independence of our financial regulators? DoddFrank created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research to bring independent regulators together to monitor risk across our banking system and address threats to the American economy. Prior to the creation of FSOC. no single entity was accountable for monitoring our Nations financial stabilitynone. It was a mishmash. disparate mess. DoddFrank filled that void. Similarly. OFR works to support consumers by conducting critical research on our financial system and whether our regulatory systems are. in fact. working. Of course. if we dont invite the person who is the head of the Office to actually testify in front of the Financial Services Committee. how would we know? DoddFrank ensured that important regulators like FSOC and OFR have the independence they need to protect consumers outside of the political turmoil of Congress. My House Democratic colleagues are serious about reining in our Nations largest financial institutions. while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are playing political games at the expense of American consumers. I refuse to stand idly by and allow DoddFrank to be gutted and weakened. If this terrible bill got to his desk. President Obama wouldnt sign it. He would never allow it to become law. Nevertheless. congressional Republicans continue to waste taxpayers time and money with this legislation that would peel back DoddFrank and hurt American consumers. House Republicans need to instead focus on our Nations most pressing problems: public health crises like the Zika virus. which has ravaged my home State of Florida. the ongoing debt situation in Puerto Rico. and keeping Speaker RYANS promises to the American people that this body would pass a budget.

I am pleased to stand up in support of H.R. 3340. the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act. I want to congratulate Congressman TOM EMMER of Minnesota for his tireless work on this bill to come up with a commonsense piece of regulation that helps create jobs in this country. Mr. Speaker. I want to set the RECORD straight. There are some folks in this Chamber who continue to blame the economic problems we have had over these past years specifically on the financial services industry. Well. lets be honest here. There were D.C. regulators here in this town who put tremendous pressure on the banks to lend money at zero percent down and zero percent interest to folks who they knew could not afford these loans. When they were unable to repay these loans. the real estate market collapsed and brought the economy with it. Mr. Speaker. every business in America. every industry. should be fairly and predictably regulated. However. when the regulations are so intense and so complicated and so smothering that it kills jobs. then it is our responsibility to make sure that we give our small businesses in this country relief. Mr. Speaker. I have been here for a little over a year and I realize there is a fourth branch of government. Now. we all know what the Constitution says. It is that Congress. the legislative branch. creates the laws. The administrative branch. the White House. implements the laws that we create. If there is a question. then we get the referee involved. the courts. However. there is a fourth branch of government that is unconstitutional. It is called the professional regulator.

Mr. Speaker. the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act places the FSOC and the Office of Financial Research under the regular appropriations process and will require the Office of Financial Research to submit activity reports to Congress. Bringing FSOC under the appropriations process ensures greater accountability for a council that has continuously failed to fully disclose its SIFI designation methodology and that has yet to provide concrete guidelines for designated entities to lose their SIFI status. Most importantly. this legislation will bring muchneeded transparency to the Council. FSOC is intended to be a forum for discussion and analysis of financial regulator issues. but. unfortunately. the Council has continually failed to address the consolidation and failure of our Main Street banks. On its own. a single community bank failure will not pose a systemic risk to the financial system. However. losing these small banks at an accelerating pace is a clear warning signal that the financial system is not healthy. and losing community banks as a whole certainly qualifies as systemically risky. Instead of closeddoor deliberations. the Council. which is made up of financial regulators who have been acknowledging this exact problem. should be working to address this pressing issue in a transparent manner before it is too late. This legislation is a logical next step in reforming the Financial Stability Oversight Council to ensure that it actually addresses threats to our financial system. I am happy to lend my support to this bill. and I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense measure. Again. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his efforts on this legislation.",

Their argument is essentially this: that Federal regulatorsbanking regulatorscannot do their jobs if their funding is somehow held accountable to the American people. This argument ignores some important facts. While DoddFrank may well have been intended to protect consumers and end Big Government bailouts. FSOCs authority to arbitrarily designate nonbank financial institutions as systemically important undermines the original intent of the law. In fact. just last month. a U.S. court rescinded MetLifes SIFI designation. The opinion called FSOCs determination process \"fatally flawed.\" and it called the insurers designation \"capricious and arbitrary.\" Again. those are not my words. those are a Federal judges words. In effect. the judge confirmed what House Republicans have been saying for yearsthat the FSOC is out of control and requires additional congressional oversight. That is why I support this commonsense and. frankly. modest legislation. which subjects FSOC and the Office of Financial Research to the annual appropriations process and common practice reporting requirements.

I believe that we can harness the power of market forces and private capital to solve local problems. benefit American taxpayers. and uplift communities. This bill will encourage the private sector to invest in some of the most pressing challenges we face as a nation. I believe in the power of government to be a force for good. but after 30 years in business. I tremendously believe in the untapped potential of the private market to solve problems. The goal of this bill is to unleash that power of the private sector to work with local governments and communities. This bill is based on the pay for results model. in which Federal funds are only spent when measurable results have been achieved. Instead of simply creating more government programs. this saves taxpayer dollars by ensuring funds are only spent on successful programs. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Representative TODD YOUNG and my fellow cochair of the taskforce. Representative JOHN DELANEY. for introducing this important legislation.

Dr. BOUSTANY and Representative THOMPSON. for their leadership on this important issue. It is not very often that we have bipartisan legislation that will make a real difference in lowering healthcare costs for working families. and I am pleased to see this bill come to the House floor today. This legislation is a nobrainer. As a physician with more than 30 years of experience. I have personally seen the need for commonsense reforms that will remove barriers to lower healthcare costs and give Americans more control over their own healthcare decisions. Because of the Affordable Care Act. I constantly hear from families who are paying higher premiums and outofpocket costs for less coverage and lower quality of care. I hear from smallbusiness owners who desperately want to help their employees acquire health insurance. but face costly regulations that make it harder. if not impossible. for them to do so. Employers of all sizes are implementing innovative solutions to address the rising healthcare costs. and we should do everything we can to support those efforts. Unfortunately. misguided Federal rules too often stand in the way. Regulatory guidance issued by the IRS that penalizes small businesses who offer standalone Health Reimbursement Arrangements is a perfect example. HRAs are popular among both workers and employers. Employers offer HRAs to help their employees pay for health care. In return. families are provided greater flexibility and an opportunity to set aside pretax income for medical expenses. It simply doesnt make sense for the Federal Government to restrict a positive tool aimed at expanding access to affordable healthcare coverage. It is unconscionable that ObamaCare is penalizing small businesses for trying to do the right thing and alleviate the financial burden on working families. That is why this bill is so important. We need to encourage policies that empower every American with affordable coverage. provide more choice. and promote a healthy workforce. And I hope we can all agree that we should eliminate misguided rules that only make it harder for families and small businesses to obtain healthcare coverage they desperately need. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation which will restore the ability of small businesses to offer HRAs.",

I would not discount for a minute some of the activities that have been cataloged by the junior Senator from Texas when it comes to Iran. but if you think those were terribleand they wereimagine Iran with a nuclear weapon.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. we have heard a lot of charges and accusations that were made by some of my colleagues as they have chosen to describe the bill before us today. H.R. 7. so I want to be clear about what the bill before us does do and does accomplish. This bill follows a longstanding principle. as my colleague said. going back to 1976. the principle that the American people and Members from both sides of the aisle in both Chambers of Congress have supported for decades. and that is taxpayer dollars should not be spent on abortions and abortion coverage. The vast majority of my colleagues voted for this exact same principle in countless appropriations bills. including a bill that we passed out of this Chamber last month. Yet today. some Members are fighting the widely shared belief that taxpayer dollars should not be used to take an innocent life. The bill before us today also provides muchneeded transparency regarding which health plans on the exchange pay for abortions. The Obama administration promised to provide Congress and the American people a list of plans in ObamaCare that covered abortion. yet they refused to live up to that promise. They forced Congress to act. And. indeed. the GAO has informed us that 1.036 plans include abortion coverage. There is no excuseno excuseto hide information about abortion coverage from the American people. Madam Speaker. 68 percent. a vast majority of the American people believe there should be no taxpayer money used for abortion and abortion coverage. HHS has forced Congress to act on this issue. The commonsense transparency requirement that is in H.BR. 7 is needed. and it is supported by all Members. So that is what this bill is about. following an established bipartisan principle and providing transparency. I urge my colleagues. each and every one. to vote to protect life. to vote to protect taxpayer dollars. and to promote transparency by rejecting the motion to recommit and supporting the underlying bill. I urge a \"no\" vote on the recommittal. I yield back the balance of my time.",

Finally. Mr. Speaker. the House will consider H.R. 399. the Secure Our Borders First Act. authored by Chairman MCCAUL. which requires the Department of Homeland Security to achieve operational control of our border.

Every single Member on both sides of the aisle voted for it. That was bipartisan. I watched. Mr. Speaker. bringing up a bill from Mr. FITZPATRICK. where we had a bipartisan vote just a few months before. and the reason we brought it backcommittees were not organized yet. we were just inso we grabbed a bipartisan bill. but many Members on the other side of the aisleand we had it on suspensionchanged their vote just in a month before. but we were able to pass that. again. bipartisan. Earlier. in asking me what would come to the floor next week. you heard me say 12 bipartisan bills on suspension that deal with human trafficking. You bring up the border bill. It has been noticed for a weekremember. we have been here for 2 weeksit has been marked up in committee where both sides late into the night got to debate. where Members on both sides of the aisle got to express their opinions and their amendments the way the system should work. We have noticed that today. more than 72 hours of why it will go up on Wednesday and not Friday. both sides have their retreats. We already had ours. We left that Wednesday. yours going through there. So there has been more notice. There has been clear debate. There has been bipartisan bills here. I have no problem or qualm with a difference of philosophical opinion. The problem I have is when we misstate what history has shown. You asked me about the rule. Bringing up the bill. I will leave the type of the rule that will accompany the bill up to the Rules Committee and Chairman SESSIONS. I do expect. though. a robust debate and look forward to consideration participation on both sides of the aisle.",

I dont know that I have ever been here where a bill came up that had no time for debate. so I assume that. Mr. Speaker. to be the case. The question is: Will there be an opportunity for Members to offer amendments so that perhaps we can get back to the bipartisan bill that was reported out of the committee and leave the partisan parts of that bill for further discussion. debate. and amendment? We would like to have the opportunity to vote on such an amendment. I ask my friend again. there is no doubt. Mr. Speaker. that I believe there will be time for debate. It wont be very much time. I presume. but I presume there will be time for debate. But will there be time to offer alternative views and provisions to that bill as it is debated? I yield to my friend.",

The Regulatory Accountability Act. as the gentleman mentionedexcuse me. the Financial Servicesthat bill was changed. It was changed without a hearing. It was changed without public testimony. as I had a personal discussion. Mr. Speaker. with the majority leader about the change that occurred from the House bill that was passed. So that bill was made. again. a partisan piece of legislation. Unfortunately. it could have passed on suspension. I think. as it did the year before. had it not been changed. On the pipeline permitting legislation. again. not a bipartisan bill. This bill that we just considered. obviously very partisan. but no hearings and a closed rule. Again. very important issues brought up and. I would suggest to the gentleman. nontransparent. He mentioned the bill that was filed last Friday. the border security bill. which is coming up Wednesday. The committee organized at 10. This bill was passed sometime shortly after 2or thereafter. Debate started at 2. When we talk about transparency. when we talk about regular order. very frankly. on pieces of substantive legislation. regular order. I would suggest. Mr. Speaker. to the majority leader. is not introducing a bill. then we are off for 3 days. coming back. and the day after organizing the committee without hearings. without any testimony. then passing the bill. and bringing it to the floor. when clearly it is a partisan difference. We will move on. Mr. Leader. I know you are happy about that. As the gentleman knows. after next week. we have two 4day weeks scheduled in February prior to the Presidents Day recess. Can the gentleman give me a sense of what legislation will be on the floor in February. again.

Three days. I suggest. Mr. Speaker. can be 26 hours. That is the last hour of the third day and the first hour of the third day. I understand that. but that is not regular order. We have all breached that. We all understand that. Having said that. this Congress has started with closed rules. no hearings. and anything but regular order. I would urge. Mr. Speaker. that the majority leader try to adhere to that. As he has observed in the past. if we do that.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in honor and memory of Bill Kortum. regarded by many as the father of the environmental movement in Sonoma County. Bill grew up in a Sonoma County that was much more rural and undeveloped than today. By the early 1960s. he foresaw that a growing population could threaten the countys natural landscape. so he fought to protect the home he loved. He was singularly responsible for instituting lasting environmental protections throughout Sonoma County and California. though he would never claim credit for them. One of Bills first victories was to prevent the development of PG&Es nuclear power plant at Bodega Head. He helped create the California Coastal Commission. which continues to guarantee public access to the coast today. He established Sonoma County Conservation Action. helped create the Sonoma County Open Space District. and championed the Sonoma Land Trust and the SMART train. Bill illustrates the incredible impact one person can have in making the world a better place. His legacy in Sonoma County and beyond will not soon be forgotten. I extend my deepest condolences to his partner in much of this work. his dear wife Lucy. as well as his three children and grandchildren.",
