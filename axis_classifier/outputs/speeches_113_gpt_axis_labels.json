Since 1995. the second week in November has been designated as a time to encourage individuals to talk to their friends. loved ones. and health care professionals about bladder health and pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated that nearly onequarter of all women and more than onethird of older women reported symptoms of at least one PFD. As the population of older women increases. the national burden related to PFDs in terms of health care costs. lost productivity. and decreased quality of life will be substantial. It is critical to educate women about PFDs now. PFDs will impact one in three women at some point during their lives. yet most Americans underestimate or are unsure about their prevalence. The lack of awareness continues to affect the millions of women who remain undiagnosed. untreated and whose quality of life remains negatively impacted by these common disorders. Women need to understand the facts about PFDs and to feel empowered with information on how to pursue individualized solutions for improved quality of life. Unfortunately. we may not realize that someone we knowa sister. mother. daughter. aunt. or another loved oneis suffering in silence not realizing their condition is treatable. This week is the time to raise awareness and begin talking about pelvic floor disorders. Please join me in supporting National Bladder Health Week.",

Special Weapons Company. 29th Marine Regiment 6th Marine Division from 19421945. He enlisted a few months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Legend has it he only joined the Marine Corps to impress his girlfriend. and later. wife of over 60 years. who was far more impressed by the Marine uniform than the armysas she insisted he wear his dress blues on their wedding day. \"Jack\" as he was known by his friends and family. was a gunnery sergeant and marksman. He saw action in Okinawa and was responsible for 30 men who specialized in the operation of four 37mm antitank guns. He was called \"the old man\" because he was the oldest in his platoon24 and said he never thought he would make it home. A part of him. even late into his 80s always felt a sense of guilt for surviving when so many of his fellow soldiers did not. After the War. Jack and his wife built their own home in upstate New York. After the birth of their four children they moved to the 11th district where they lived for over 50 years. Although Jack never talked much about the war. it was obvious how much that time in his life affected him. Jack passed away in 2003 at the age of 86. He left behind a wife. four children. 11 grandchildren and four great grandchildren. His love of country transcended generations. His son Craig served in Vietnam and currently. his grandson Justin. is in the United States Air Force. His wife Betty. now 95. and daughter. a teacher in Farmington. Michigan. still reside in the 1 1th district. Jack was the type of man everyone loved and respected. Always the practical jokester. Jack left a smile on the faces of all he encountered and never missed an opportunity to express his love to friends and family. A man of courage. honor. loyalty. and kindness. Jack exemplified what it means to be a United States Marine. On this Veterans Day. the people of the 11th District of Michigan salute John \"Jack\" Edward Emmett for his sacrifice. dedication. and love of country. Thank you. Jack.",

Martyls legacy continues as members of the Bulletins science and security board annually assess the state of world affairs and use the hands of the clock to signal humanitys capacity to meet challenges of nuclear weapons and climate change.

Mr. Speaker. South Korea has become a major user of domestic nuclear power. with the partnership of American technology. Nuclear power provides about onethird of all of South Koreas electricity. and South Korea is looking to even further expand that percentage. They are looking to the United States and American businesses to help them achieve their goals.

South Korea is an example of how the free market brings about an increased quality of life. The Republic of Korea is Asias fourth largest economy and the worlds 12th largest economy. In the 1960s. South Korea was on par with levels of poverty seen in Africa. Fast forward to 2004. when South Korea joined the trilliondollar club of world economiesin stark contrast to its neighbor to the north. North Korea is one of the most oppressive regimes in the world. The U.S.-South Korea alliance is one that shows the world the promise of democracy and free enterprise. Today. we recognize just one partnership between our nationsthe civilian nuclear energy program. This agreement maintains a safe. secure nuclear program in a very turbulent international environment. Im grateful to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. Congress needs to continue to show how much it values our Nations relationship with South Korea. and a positive vote on this agreement will be a strong step in that regard.

I rise in support of this legislation because this legislation provides for a very needed Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East and in South Central Asia. This bill. introduced by the gentleman from Virginia . is substantially identical to one which we brought up last year and tried to get out of both bodies. it was H.R. 440. This body passed that legislation by more than 400 votes. Sadly. in the 2 years that have elapsed since then. the dangers motivating this bill have only grown more acute. In many areas of the Middle East. the first freedom. as we called it. the freedom of religious liberty. is disregarded. Minority communities are not merely under threat. those communities are now under attack. From Afghanistan. to Iran. to Syria. to Egypt and elsewhere in these regions. religious minorities have been increasingly subjected to unconscionableoften violentpersecution. These alarming trends are occurring in the midst of growing regional instability as brutal regimes and terrorists and insurgents seek to assert control over populations and seek to enforce their ideologies by use of fear. by use of brute force. As the bloody civil war rages in Syria. ancient Christian communities are being forced to flee the lands they have inhabited for centuries in the midst of this bloody civil conflict. In Egypt. Coptic Christians have experienced unspeakable abuses at the hands of radical Muslim groups and have been fleeing their country in droves to escape further violence. I have met with many from the vibrant Coptic Christian community in southern California. In Iran. more than 500 Bahais have been arbitrarily arrested since 2005 by the Iranian Government. In Pakistan. 80 members of the Muslim Ahmadiyya sect were killed by terrorists in their places of worship in 2010. in addition to consistent incidents of violence and even judicial persecution of Christians there. Many of us are aware of the violations of the rights and the deaths of the Shia minority there as well. For all of these alarming reasons. this legislation is at least as timely as it was 2 years ago. I commend our colleague. the gentleman from Virginia",

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 301. a bill that will create a Special Envoy to Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East and South Central Asia. This legislation responds. as has been said so eloquently by those that spoke before me. to the urgent needs of Christians and other religious minorities who are really under siege in the Middle East precisely because they are Christians and because they are minorities. In light of the ongoing events in Syria. this legislation could not be more timely. I commend Representative FRANK WOLF. whom I have worked closely with as cochair of the Religious Minorities Caucus. for his partnership in this effort. Most importantly. I thank him for his conscience. We first introduced this legislation in 2011 after Congressman WOLF chaired a hearing to review the violence and the hardship faced by Middle Eastern religious minorities. I testified that day about the plight of who I am descended from. the Assyriansthe worlds oldest Christians who have fled and continue to flee Iraq. We agreed to press forward with this legislation to create a Special Envoy at the State Department. the ambassador level. to elevate this issue for the attention that it deserves. The United States of America needs a highlevel official dedicated to religious freedom in the region and committed to addressing the concerns of minority communities. Appropriately. H.R. 301 has attracted solid bipartisan support. with 68 cosponsors calling for the State Department to elevate religious freedom in the Middle East as a diplomatic priority of our country. Just as Senator John Danforth served our Nation as Special Envoy to Sudan and Senator George Mitchell Special Envoy to Northern Ireland. religious minorities in the Middle East require and deserve a highlevel authoritative voice to address their situation. The history of violence against Christians in the Middle East must not be allowed to repeat itself. and it is. Notably. Syrias ancient Christian population. which makes up 10 percent of the country. has been forced to flee their ancestral homeland. as noted in todays New York Times in a lengthy article.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Oradell Public Library. On February 7th. 1913. a small group of community leaders met in Oradell to discuss the creation of a public library. A little over two months later. these individuals successfully opened the public library on April 19. 1913. The library was originally managed by its Board of Trustees and the president of the board. William Zabriskie. who served in that position for 25 years. The board dedicated their time and efforts to ensure the library continued to grow and serve the community. The examples of generosity that contributed to the development and evolution of the library are numerous. but some instances demand specific mention. The first librarian. Marie A. Skinner. worked on a volunteer basis for the first three months and thereafter received a mere ten dollars per month for her hard work. A local carpenter volunteered his time and materials to build the librarys first shelves. World renowned painter Charles Livingston Bull. an Oradell resident and an original board member. donated multiple works of art which reside in the library to this day. After ten years of occupying a room behind the local post office. the library moved to its own building provided by the BellisBlauvelt family. Residents later donated books to increase the librarys collection. A hundred years after its founding. the Oradell Public Library remains an exemplary model of what is possible when people come together for the betterment of their community. I congratulate the Oradell Public Library on this important and impressive milestone. It is an honor to represent the people of Oradell and to commend the hard work and personal sacrifice of so many that established the Oradell Public Library.",

In the wake of World War I. the Ottoman Empire launched a campaign of terror against their own Armenian citizens. From 1915 to 1923. forced deportations displaced 2 million Armenians. Unarmed men were separated from their families and were either forced into concentration camps or taken away to be executed. Innocent women and children were systematically stripped of their possessions and driven into what is now the Syrian Desert. During these \"Death Marches\" they were subjected to starvation. sickness. and abuse amid brutal conditions. In the end. nearly 1.5 million Armenians had lost their lives in what became the first genocide of the 20th century. Although these atrocities occurred almost a century ago. it is imperative to remember the suffering that was endured as a result of unrestrained human malice. To acknowledge this truth is necessary. not just out of respect for our fellow citizens of Armenian descent. but also in hope that we can prevent such heinous crimes from occurring in the future. Today. I call on my colleagues to join me in somber remembrance of the 1.5 million Armenians who perished during this dark period of history. and to honor the strength and resolve of the Armenian community still working to overcome this tragedy.",

Since 1989. thanks to earlier detection. increased understanding. and improved treatment. the death rates for breast cancer have continued to decrease. Yet breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women. with one in 36 women dying from the disease. While breast cancer used to be considered a disease of aging. recent trends show that more aggressive forms of the disease have been increasingly diagnosed in younger women. Just this year. it is estimated that 232.340 women will be diagnosed with and 39.620 women will die of cancer of the breast in the United States. We need to do more to tackle this disease. Each year roughly $16.5 billion is spent in the United States on breast cancer treatment. according to the National Cancer Institute estimates. While the federal government remains the largest funder of breast cancer research in the United States. in 2012. the National Cancer Institute reduced funding by almost $30 million and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program grants decreased more than 22 percent from 2010 funding levels. Additional private sector support will help us find a cure for breast cancer even faster. That is why my colleague Representative Aaron Schock and I are introducing the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act. Additional private sector support will help us find E1814 a cure for breast cancer even faster. Proceeds from the sale of the coin will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and Susan G. Komen for the Cure. These two organizations have spent more than $450 million and $790 million. respectively. on research funding. But more needs to be done to find better treatments and a cure. Our mothers. our sisters. our daughters. cannot afford to wait. I encourage you to support this new legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize the 125th Anniversary of the Lick Observatory. On January 3. 1888 the Lick Observatorys great refracting telescope saw \"first light.\" Its construction on top of Mt. Hamilton was made possible by a $700.000 donation from James Lick. By many accounts the wealthiest man in California. Mr. Lick gave almost his entire fortune to advance science and public welfare. When finished. the \"Lick Refractor\" was the largest. most powerful refracting telescope in the world. Today. it is assumed that an observatory should be built on a mountain. However. at the time most observatories were built in cities. It is easy to forget that when Mt. Hamilton was chosen as the build site. it was only speculation that the high altitude would reduce atmospheric interference. allowing for a clearer view of the night stars. Having proven the theory correct. Lick Observatory set the standard for building observatories on top of mountains. at high altitude. and away from potential interfering light sources and pollution. The Lick Refractor was a premier research telescope for nearly a century. Even now. this telescope is still used to wow visitors. to inspire scientific wonder. and as a teaching tool for local colleges and universities. While many scientific facilities of this age are no longer useful as tools of discovery. the Lick Observatory continues to upgrade its capabilities and produce ground breaking science. The Adaptive Optics project uses a unique. deformable mirror to cancel out atmospheric interference. It is capable of achieving resolutions comparable to the spacebased Hubble Telescope. but at a fraction of the cost. The Lick Observatory also houses the Automated Planet Finder. with the goal of finding Earthlike planets located within 100 light years. In partnership with NASA. this fully automated telescope makes its own decisions on where to look in the night sky and is capable of determining whether an Earthlike planet has been discovered. Even the 125 year old Lick Refractor is still occasionally put to use. In the fall of 2000. coupled with an automatic camera. it started photographing the star clusters in our galaxy. These photographs have provided valuable information for mapping these clusters star members. I wish to congratulate the Lick Observatory on its 125th anniversary. and commend not only it scientific achievements. but also its work in inspiring others to pursue the wonders of science.",

The Pirates won the State Championship on November 22. 2013 with a decisive 6732 win over Rapid River Rockets High School 8Player Football Team. capping a perfect 130 season. This championship game showcased the Pirates skills that carried them through the season. Their defense took charge executing key plays with tackles. sacks and a big interception before halftime. Their offense wasted little time getting points on the board. working together to complete drive after drive down the field. Both in defensive battle and offensively. the Pirates kept constant pressure on their opponent and making their claim to the trophy clear. The Pirates proved they had the skills. teamwork and fortitude to rise to the challenge and accomplish their ultimate goala State Championship! I am certain the community and the entire Thumb Region takes great pride in what these young individuals were able to achieve as a team. Mr. Speaker. it is my pleasure to honor the hard work and sportsmanship displayed by all of the members of the Peck Pirates team. I E1816 also wish to take a moment and acknowledge all the efforts and support by the coaches and parents. the cheerleaders. the school band. the teachers and administrators. and all of the students. fans. and community members who came out this season to support the Pirates.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. recently. the D.C. Circuit Court ruled in favor of Americas energy ratepayers. For more than 30 years. the Department of Energy has assessed a special tax and a special assessment on my constituents and the residents of 40 other States around the country who receive their electricity from nuclear power. Minnesotans have paid over $400 million alone. The stated reason for this tax: to pay for the disposal of used fuels generated from nuclear energy. To date. the total amount collected is more than $24 billion. but little of that money has even been spent. Since 1987. the law of the land remains that Yucca Mountain is the site for geological storage of nuclear spent fuel. Unfortunately for ratepayers. partisanship and bickering in Washington have nearly halted the program from moving forward. In classic Washington fashion. even with all of this inaction. the tax has continued to be assessed and the moneys have continued to be collected. Fortunately. this court action will bring an end to this. but just for now. I have long been an advocate of stopping these payments. The government is not doing what it promised to do with used fuel. yet millions of ratepayers are still being forced to foot the bill. Minnesotans and Americans should not be taxed for a service that the government is not providing. Mr. Speaker. we should be expanding the development of nuclear energy. It is safe. it is clean. and it is renewable. Storing these used fuels is a critical piece of that effort. and we need a permanent solution. whether it is at Yucca Mountain or somewhere else. It is reasonable and fair that if the administration is going to continue to drag its feet on a permanent storage site. as they have for several years now. then ratepayers and taxpayers should not be forced to fund inaction. Mr. Speaker. I applaud the courts decision to protect Minnesota ratepayers and stopping these payments. In addition. it is time to get serious about the future of nuclear energy and moving forward with safe and proper storage facilities for the waste.",

It didnt work. Government employees dont act nearly as responsibly as the private sector does. That comes with a cost. but the farmers like it. They get response from these folks that is appropriate. Secondly. we would go back to the possibility of days when we spent billions of dollars on unbudgeted. ad hoc disaster relief. And thats the least efficient way that we ought to go about this.

I believe its important that we offer the proper support for farmers. while ensuring that these support programs are responsible for the American taxpayer. As you may know. the Federal Crop Insurance Program is the most expensive government program supporting farm income and is the only farm income support program that is not subject to some form of payment limitation or means testing. This amendment. which incorporates the language in the AFFIRM Act that Representative KIND and I introduced last month. works to reform the crop insurance program. Capping crop insurance subsidies at $50.000 per person per year does not prohibit farmers from purchasing crop insurance. nor does it eliminate all taxpayer support for the program. In fact. most farmers would not be affected by this cap at all. According to the GAO. in 2011. only 4 percent of farmers would have been impacted by this $50.000 cap on subsidy for insurance. For 2001 to 2012. the total cost of premium subsidies jumped fourfold. from $1.8 billion to $7.5 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects even higher costs in the future. averaging $9.1 billion annually. The subsidy cap. combined with the $250.000 means testing requirement. will assist in preventing fraud. waste and abuse in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. The Acting CHAIR.

Adjusted gross income is different than farm profit. There are a number of expenses that must be covered. In addition to personal expenses. farmers must service debt. given the cost of todays machinery and land can easily reach into the millions. AGI rules penalize spouses who oftentimes take offfarm jobs to help make ends meet when farmers are struggling with their farm income. An unreasonable AGI means test creates uncertainty for growers and their lenders by creating a pingpong effect of being eligible one year and ineligible the next. making it difficult or impossible for lenders to measure. with any certainty. the future cash flow of thousands of farm and ranch families in order to make both short and longterm lending decisions.

Periodically. the USDA. through the Risk Management Agency. renegotiates its agreement with private crop insurers for the delivery and administration of Federal crop insurance. These negotiations. known as Standard Reinsurance Agreements. do not affect the premium subsidies paid to farmers and instead focus on the percent of gains or losses assumed by taxpayers and the level of crop insurance administrative and operating costs paid by the Federal Government. The most recent negotiation was finalized in 2010 and yielded $6 billion in savings. Of these savings. $4 billion was used to reduce the Federal deficit. and the remaining $2 billion was put back into farm programs to supplement conservation efforts and improve certain products provided through the Federal crop insurance program. Our amendment simply maintains current law by striking a provision in the bill requiring that any savings from future Standard Reinsurance Agreements be put back into the Federal crop insurance program. This amendment continues to respect the importance of a robust farm safety net while maintaining USDAs tools to improve Federal crop insurance. reduce the deficit. and strengthen conservation programs within the farm bill.

It also allows the Coast Guard and the TSA to continue their efforts to deliver the port security program that Congress enacted several years ago. Finally. H.R. 3202 requires the GAO to perform consistent reviews of the TWIC program and to follow the changes the department makes as a result of the required assessment. This added level of review will provide Congress. especially the members of our committee. with progress updates for future legislative action. The proposed rule and open GAO recommendations lead to some very basic questions about mitigating threats. risk. and vulnerability at our Nations ports and how the TWIC program should be used effectively to prevent a potential terrorist attack. We certainly have an obligation to get this right. Mr. Speaker. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3202. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

Rep. SHEILA JACKSON LEE. H.R. 3202 seeks to ensure that Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. as implemented by TSA and the Coast Guard. deliver the security benefits that Congress envisioned in the SAFE Port Act of We have worked hard. on a bipartisan basis. to make this program work. However. as documented in multiple reports on the program produced by the Government Accountability Office. TWIC has not lived up to our expectations. Meanwhile. workingclass Americans whose livelihoods depend on accessing ports and vessels have borne the costs of this troubled program. Longshoremen. truck drivers. and others are paying hardearned money for biometric cards that may offer only limited security value. The bill before us today would require an independent assessment of the TWIC program and mandate the Secretary issue a corrective action plan in response to the assessment. The required assessment should give Congress the information it needs to determine how best to proceed with the program. The bill does not. however. delay the longoverdue final rule for deployment of TWIC readers. which is expected to limit significantly the ports required to utilize biometric readers. If that is the case. and depending on the outcome of the assessment required by the bill. Congress may need to examine whether requiring workers who do not need to access ports with biometric readers should continue to be required to purchase a biometric credential. For today. I look forward to speedy approval of this bill by the House and hope it will be considered by the Senate and signed by the President in short order. With that. Mr. Speaker.

The program. which is intended to provide secure access control. uses biometric credentials to limit access to secure areas of ports or vessels only to those individuals that actually need access. Unfortunately. the TWIC program remains incomplete. which has resulted in significant uncertainty for our nations transportation and maritime industry. While regulations were in place beginning in 2007 for maritime workers to purchase the biometric credentials. regulations requiring the issuance of card readers remain incomplete. and have been significantly delayed. These delays come despite the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking more than a year ago to finally issue biometric readers. However. no final rule has been issued. The significant program delays have resulted in maritime workers having to pay to renew their credentials after five years. despite no biometric readers being required within that timeframe. These delays. coupled with a scathing GAO recommendation calling into question the underlying security value of the TWIC program. raise very serious questions about the future of this program. It is therefore important that Congress pass this legislation. which is responsive to the GAOs most recent recommendation on the program: an independent security assessment of the TWIC program. It is my hope that the Congress will observe the findings of this assessment. and consider reforming this program. if necessary.

When we are out there so frequently. what we hear from people is the concern: I have been attacked. What do I do to protect myself? And they turn to the Department of Homeland Security for advice. As I said at an earlier point. the reality is that. while the responsibility rests with the Department and in the government to be able to facilitate the protection of the homeland and our assets. the reality is that 90 percent of these assets are placed within the private sector. and it is. in fact. there where much of. as much of. in fact. maybe some of the most pioneering research and development is accomplished. One of the other realities we face. and I think the gentlelady pointed to it so well. this concept of innovation. when we often think of innovation in a positive way. It usually is a positive thing. It means somebody is always thinking of a new and better way to accomplish a task. But criminals do that. too. and so do those who want to do us harm. and no matter how good our protections are. there is the reality that somebody else. the moment that it goes online. is looking for a way to get around it.

Todays topic of income/economic inequality is one of the most critical challenges currently facing our country. For too many Americans. the barriers to economic opportunity and mobility have become insurmountable. Just last week. a Pew Research Center survey found that at least 60 percent of all Republicans. Democrats and Independents say the gap between the rich and everyone else has grown in the past 10 years. However. we do not need a survey to tell us what we already know to be true. According to the Census Bureau. 95 percent of all economic gains since the recovery began have gone to the top 1 percent. We also know that. since 1979. our economy has more than doubled in size. but most of that growth has flowed to a fortunate few. In the past. the average CEO made about 20 to 30 times the income of the average worker. todays CEO makes 273 times more. Meanwhile. a family in the top 1 percent has a net worth 288 times higher than the typical American family. the largest income gap ever for our country. This is simply egregious. We cannot continue to believe that a growing economy guarantees higher wages and income for all. Because it does not. We cannot ignore that in 2014. women continue to lag behind men in wages. with women making 77 cents for every dollar a man takes home. According to The Shriver Report: A Womans Nation Pushes Back from the Brink. women make up nearly twothirds of minimumwage workers. Given this statistic. its no wonder that a third of all American women are living on the brink of poverty. Americans are working harder than ever. for the smallest of gains. This is simply not acceptable. Congress must renew its focus on investing in the American people through quality programs that promote access to the middle class. equality and accountability. In order to help the working poor and middle class. we must raise the minimum wage. invest in education. improve our infrastructure. reign in Wall Street and return our focus to Main Street.

Even as the quality of free. public education in the Northern Marianas has continued to improveand I am sure that faculty and students in our fine public institutions would even proudly argue to surpass our Catholic schoolsstill have parents found something of extra value in those Catholic schools and continued to pay for their children to receive a Catholic education. And we have to thank the religious and lay teachers in our Catholic schools.

Often among the best educated members of our community. rather than using their knowledge to advance their own interests these teachers disseminate what they know. so that many lives may be enriched. Their service and sacrifice. too. we celebrate and recognize during Catholic Schools Week. Lastly. we congratulate the students in our Catholic schools. You are part of a heritage in the Northern Mariana Islands that we trace back directly to the founding of Mount Carmel School in 1952. but which certainly has its roots with the original Catholic missionaries of the 16th century.

They also include the brutal cold fronts that are sweeping the country. Some climate deniers have used this as an opportunity to assert that the overwhelming science behind global warming is wrong. The irony in this assertion is that while the U.S. has extreme unusually cold temperatures. current temperatures in the Arctic are above average. NOAA recently confirmed that 2013 was the fourth warmest year on record. All 13 years of the 21st century rank among the 15 warmest since records began 134 years ago. On average. spring weather arrives ten days earlier than it used to in the Northern Hemisphere. While many states in the Midwest and Northeast have exceptionally cold temperatures. Alaska is experiencing unusually warm weather and California is going through a recordbreaking drought. Average daily highs in Alaska are 11 degrees greater than the historical average for January.

Ms. Dominguez is in Washington D.C. to be honored as an American School Counselor Association (ASCA) 2014 School Counselor of the Year finalist. Ms. Dominguez has led Shook Elementarys efforts to close the gap in services for lowincome students through a counseling program that supports students academic. social and emotional development. By reaching out to students beyond the confines of the school day. Ms. Dominguez has earned respect from fellow educators. parents. and most importantly. her students. In addition. Ms. Dominguez has developed effective relationships with local agencies to support the overall wellbeing of diverse students and families in El Paso County. Before joining the staff at Shook Elementary. Ms. Dominguez served as the grants counselor for Project HOPE (Heightened Opportunities for Promoting Excellence) at H. D. Hilley Elementary School. which serves many students and families who experienced the negative impacts of violence in Mexico. Many of these families moved to El Paso to escape violence and the new students were in need of emotional and academic support. Ms. Dominguez set up Hilleys first datadriven. comprehensive school counseling program. where she maintained a low studenttocounselor ratio. decreased disciplinary referrals. increased attendance rates. and helped students and teachers succeed on state assessments. Horizon City and the entire El Paso community continue to benefit from the positive impacts that Ms. Dominguez has on her students in her third year as a counselor at Shook Elementary. Her leadership skills and comprehensive vision shape the lives of her students and their families. I join the ASCA and the El Paso community in honoring Ms. Dominguez for her dedication to serving students and for the inspiring example she has set for school counselors across the country.",

The United States and India share a very important trade and security relationship. But our trading relationship is being threatened by an alarming array of discriminatory and internationally inconsistent actions and decisions recently. This is particularly the case in the area of intellectual property. Intellectual property is the engine that drives the U.S. economy. The attacks on our IP not only harm U.S. job creation and competitiveness. but also chip away at the overall global IP framework that is essential to the innovation of new medicines. Since 2012. India has inappropriately revoked or denied patents on at least 14 lifesaving and lifeenhancing drugs. These decisions harm the R&D system. hurting patients and their families who rely on the development of new cures and treatments. That is why earlier this year Representative JOHN LARSON and myself were joined by 170 other Members of this body in urging the administration to raise these issues at the highest level of discussions with the Indian government. It is critical that we send a strong message to our trading partners that we will not sit idly by while India blatantly undermines intellectual property rights and discriminates against our businesses.",

In just a little more than over a week. many of us will spend time around our tables celebrating Thanksgiving dinner. And as we give thanks for the incredible benefits that we enjoy. there are many Americans who will go without. They will go without a nutritious meal. They will go without meals in the classrooms or after school. Many of our veterans will go without meals as well. And so tonight. the Congressional Black Caucus uses its hour in this Special Order to bring attention to these important issues. particularly at this time in the debate about our budget. Earlier this month. on November 1. the 2009 Recovery Acts temporary increase in funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. or SNAP. expired. resulting in an additional benefit cut to all households. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. this is approximately a $25permonth or $300ayear cut to nutritional benefit programs for a family of four. SNAP benefits will now average less than $1.40 per person per meal in 2014. down from $1.50 previously. Bringing attention to these issues is critical. particularly. as I said. when we are entering negotiation on the farm bill as well as negotiation on the budget. So tonight you will hear from members of the Congressional Black Caucus who see these issues as priorities in these negotiations.

Congressmen HORSFORD and JEFFRIES. for continuing to lead the Special Order and for tonight leading on a Special Order hour that addresses another important topic. and that is hunger in America. In 10 days. Americans will come together with family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving. but for many families around the country. their Thanksgiving tables will be sparse and some even bear. As one of the wealthiest countries in the world. it is shameful that this Nation has not and will not address the issue of hunger. As ranking member on the House Agriculture Subcommittee that oversees our countrys nutrition programs. I am working hard to end hunger in America. One in every six Americans struggle with hunger or food insecurity. This is an issue that plagues nearly every community. from our inner cities to our rural countrysides. While Americans are still struggling to rebound from the recent recession. many families have already seen a setback as they experience a reduction in SNAP. which my colleague talked to you about just a moment ago. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that this reduction is equal to the loss of 16 meals for a family of three. When children are hungry. they are not able to focus in school. When seniors have limited resources and limited incomes. they are forced to make the difficult choice between purchasing medicine and sufficient groceries. Mr. Speaker. when the House adjourns this Thursday. many of us will go home to spend the Thanksgiving holidays with our families. Some will serve the less fortunate in our communities. But lets all take the time to talk to workers at food banks and other charities. ask about the impact of Federal benefits cuts. the increased demand on charitable antihunger programs and what has been done to fill the gap. Just a short discussion with those who have fallen on hard times can be a sobering reminder of the impact a little help can provide. And to the American people who are struggling this Thanksgiving. please know that the CBC has not forgotten you. As the conscience of the Congress. we continue to fight for you every single day. The fight is far from over. but as long as one American is suffering. we will fight on. I thank the gentleman.",

Again. these are issues that are critically important to American families across this great country. They are issues that we are hearing about daily from our constituents. Many people dont realize that it is not only good for the individual who is on food assistance. but it is also good for our economy because this is money that goes back into our local grocery stores that keeps people employed and helps our local economy.

The first is the fact that this does disproportionately affect the poor and those who are striving to become a part of the middle class. At the same time. there are corporate subsidies. billions of dollars of corporate subsidies for the agriculture industry in the farm bill and in other legislation that has come before this House that they will move expeditiously and then leave the food behind in the farm bill. for the first time that I am aware of that we have approved a farm bill without also including the food assistance component to it. They later came back and included it. but with a $40 billion cut. And the positive economic impacts of this cannot be underscored either. I hear from representatives from the retail industry who tell me that SNAP creates some $340 million in farm production for each $1 billion of retail that is generated. There is some 3.300 farm jobs that are created for each $1 billion of funding that is provided for. that for every $1 billion of SNAP benefits. it also creates between 9.000 to 18.000 fulltime jobs. So not only is this the right thing to do. not only is it the morally conscionable thing to do. it is also good for the economy. And so as we make this argument. how important it is to debunk some of the myths surrounding SNAP. one of them being that there is fraud in the SNAP program and that is why the cuts arent going to hurt the poor or those who are striving to be part of the middle class.",

I have traveled all over the district that I represent. and I hear the arguments of some on the other side of the aisle that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. or SNAP. as it is sometimes referred to. is a program that creates dependency. Well. I havent met a single one of my constituents who chooses hunger as a lifestyle. It seems to me that is a rough style to choose. These individuals. for one reason or another. find themselves in a tough spot. and we in the Congress should be doing everything we can to try and help them out. to get them back on their feet. to put them in a position where they can move forward and make progress for themselves and for their families.

The debate surrounding cuts to nutrition assistance coupled with nationwide food insecurity is a recipe for disaster for our neediest citizens. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a vital tool that help feed Americans struggling economically. More than 90 percent of SNAP beneficiaries are children. elderly. veterans. or disabled. Four to six million lowincome people will be affected by cuts to SNAP funding. including the 450.000 residents in Dallas County. that are food insecure. 300.000 of which are children. The GOPs efforts to cut $40 billion in SNAP are unconscionable and we must stand strong for the 16.4 percent of our population that remains food insecure. According to the USDA. one in every five Texas households experiences food insecurity. Out of the estimated 1.8 million Texas children. one in four live in food insecure households. Approximately 3.6 million Texas residents receive some type of federal food assistance. In my district. I chair the Dallas Coalition for Hunger Solutions which is composed of organizations dedicated to fighting hunger and making Dallas County food secure. I strongly support the federal programs that work to support the needs of our citizens nationwide. I urge my colleagues to oppose any proposed cuts to nutrition assistance.

Over the course of the next 12 months. many families across my district will lose more than 24 million meals. Michigan families are already struggling to put food on the table. and the last thing we should do is take food away from those who need it most. Unfortunately. this has already happened. Theres no sugarcoating it: we have a hunger problem in Michigan and across the United States. The majority of households receiving SNAP are those with children. It is our responsibility to protectnot cutcritical programs like SNAP for the families and kids who rely on them. Thats why I introduced H.R. 3353. the \"Extend Not Cut SNAP Benefits Act\" which would extend the Recovery Acts 13.6% increase in SNAP for an additional year. This extraordinarily low level of SNAP benefits under the new levels will force families to find ways to stretch their already limited benefits even further at the grocery store in order to put healthy. nutritious food on the table for their kids. With less money to spend on groceries each month. the importance of nutrition education becomes even more real. Yet the House and Senate proposed deep cuts within the Farm Bill could cut SNAP by as much as an additional $40 billion (on top of the cut we just saw on November 1st) and would cut funding for SNAP Education (SNAPEd). Keeping SNAP and SNAPEd strong isnt just the right thing to doits also the smart thing to do. Children who get enough of the healthy food they need. as a rule. face fewer health problems. do better in school and grow up to lead stronger. more productive lives.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to bring attention to National HIV Testing Day. which takes place on June 27. This day serves as an important opportunity to urge everyone to get tested. I would like to thank all of the advocates. care coordinators. and healthcare providers. both in my community and around the country. for their tireless work in serving the HIVpositive community and raising awareness of HIV issues more generally. There are over one million people of all ages. ethnicities. and sexual orientations in the United States living with the HIV virus. and South Florida has one of the highest HIV infection rates in the country. Sadly. nearly one in six HIVpositive individuals do not know that they are infected. which means that they could be unknowingly spreading the virus. We simply must close this gap so that we may improve health outcomes for those living with HIV and protect against future infections. HIV does not discriminateit impacts people old and young. gay and straight. and of all nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. To highlight this critical issue. I will be hosting a call to action in my district. I hope that everyone will take this opportunity to get tested for HIV and to ask their friends and family to do the same. Again I would like to thank the advocates. care coordinators and healthcare providers in South Florida and around the country for their tireless work in preventing. detecting. and treating HIV. I wish them the best as they pursue this daunting but important endeavor.",

In a country where talk of a childs fifth birthday elicits happy memories of time spent with family and friends. we too often forget that in regions across the globe. many children never make it to their fifth birthday. Thanks to the support and generosity of the American people. U.S. aid programs have helped cut the number of child deaths. under the age of five. in half since 1990. The devastating and deadly effects of diseases like pneumonia. measles and malaria have been largely curbed across the globe with the support of Americans. These monumental advances are allowing millions more children to live the healthy. happy childhood that all kids deserve. It is important we recognize these advancements and honor the dedication and work of those that have made them possible. We must also continue to support efforts to improve childrens lives around the world and redouble our efforts and commitment to childrens health. It is my sincere hope the progress achieved by 5th Birthday and Beyond continues. and we can make this a world where no child unnecessarily suffers from. or ultimately succumbs to. a preventable or treatable illness.",

After boot camp and SOl training he was assigned to the 3rd Battalion. 4th Marines. which is a battalionlevel infantry unit composed of infantry Marines and support personnel. In February of 2004 his battalion was deployed in Iraq and was a part of the initial invasion of Fallujah. After his tour in Iraq. Curtis helped train new Marines for combat until he retired in 2007. The battalion which Curtis was a part of was the most deployed battalion in the Iraq War. At a young age Curtis AlIred showed an admirable commitment to serve our country and I am very thankful for patriots like him. It is my pleasure to recognize his efforts and achievements before the House of Representatives. I wish him all the joys in life he so rightfully has earned.",

Mr. Mora came from a very distinguished family who have committed their lives to public service in Santa Fe Springs. His father Armando Mora Sr. served on the City Council and was Mayor. and his brother Robert also serves in the Fire Department and is President of Local 3507 of the firefighters union. Armando J. Mora. Jr. began his career in the fire service of the City of West Covina and was hired by the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department on January 20. 1981. He served with distinction for 33 years as a firefighter. and was known as an extraordinary man of great character and generosity to all in our community. We owe a great debt of gratitude to Mr. Mora because he knew the danger he faced every day on the job. but would not be deterred from his duties in protecting the people of our region. We extend our sincere sympathy to Mr. Moras mother Alicia Mora. his loving and devoted wife Georgina Mora. his two children. Lauren and Anthony. stepson Jesse. two sisters Annie and Irene. his brother Robert. and to the extended Mora family and friends. including his brave brothers and sisters in the E1085 Santa Fe Springs Fire Department.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the right of all Americans to vote without fear of discrimination. no matter their race. color. or political beliefs. In 1965. Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act. The enactment of VRA fulfilled a century of work towards guaranteeing that our most fundamental rightthe right to votewould be protected for all Americans. including in states and local jurisdictions that had historically denied or disempowered minority vote rs. The protections provided in VRA ensure that historically disenfranchised communities in our country are now able to freely vote. The very chamber we stand in today is a reflection of the success of VRA. seen in the election of dozens of Members of Congress who come from these very communities. A year ago today. however. the successes of VRA became endangered when the Supreme Court ruled in a controversial 54 decision that the coverage formula in Section 4(b) of the Act. which had been used to determine the states and political subdivisions subject to Section 5 preclearance. was unconstitutional. As a result of the Courts opinion in Shelby. the right to vote for millions of Americans. including my constituents in Houston and Harris County. are now endangered. Immediately after the high courts ruling. the State of Texas announced that it would put into immediate effect a voter ID law that had been previously blocked by a federal court because the state laws restrictions target the very communities that are meant to be protected under Section Congress must act. The right to vote for all is at the very heart of our democracy. Bipartisan legislation. the Voting Rights Amendment Act. has been introduced in this Congress that would provide a new coverage formula based on current problems in voting and directly respond to the high courts concerns. This is not perfect legislation. but it would go a long way towards restoring the protections that my constituents had before the Courts decision. I urge my colleagues to bring the Voting Rights Amendment Act to a floor vote and ensure that our most sacred rightthe right to voteis protected for all Americans.",

Tonsich. the son of Croatian immigrants and a native of San Pedro who passed away on June 19. 2014 with his loving family by his side. Anthony always had an adventurous spirit. Whether he was sailing on his boat. Lady Bug II. or traveling around Europe. Anthonys life was constantly marked by movement. So it came as no surprise when Anthony developed a love for automobiles and spent over 45 years in the car business without ever taking a sick day over the course of his career. Anthony will most fondly be remembered for the lasting impact that he had on his family. friends. and community. He enlisted in the Army and served as a drill instructor until 1952. helping new recruits become accustomed to military life. Yet Anthonys ability to lead by example did not end when he took off the uniform in 1952. He continued to inspire others through his generous spirit. warm personality. and extraordinary work ethic. He served as a role model for people in San Pedro. especially his eight beloved grandchildren and his three children: Anthony. Suzanne. and my dear friend Nick. Mr. Speaker.

The onetwo punch of the Rim fire and now the closure of Yosemite National Park make this one of the most economically depressed summer seasons on record.

I bring to the floor today a continuing resolution which is narrow in scope and allows the District of Columbia to spend their own funds. As some of the Members may be aware. some may not be aware. due to the citys unique status as a Federal city. Congress must appropriate their locally raised funds before the city can spend them. And despite the multiple attempts by the House of Representatives to fund the Federal Government. were here in day one of a government shutdown. This continuing resolution provides that the District of Columbia. it gives them their funds through December 15. under the same terms and conditions that they have under the spending bill in 2013. So passing this bill today will allow the Appropriations Committee time to negotiate a full years funding bill with the Senate. Now. the District of Columbia has passed their own fiscal year 2014 budget. The Mayor presented a budget to the city council. The city council debated that. The city council approved. and the citys independent chief financial officer certified the budget as balanced. So. therefore. the Districts locally raised funds should not be withheld from them during this current Federal shutdown. This disagreement that the Republicans and the Democrats are having over Federal spending shouldnt stop the District from using its own locally raised funds like any other city in America. The District is currently using reserve balances to stay open. However. we cant expect the District of Columbia to deplete all of its cash reserves to make up for the Federal Governments inability to pass a Federal budget. Weve got school teachers out there. weve got policemen. weve got firemen. weve got garbage collectors. weve got librarians. weve got all these city employees. and theyre paid with D.C. local funds. and they should expect to be paid for their services.

This bill provides for the District of Columbia to use its money to provide the services that we all enjoy in this Capital City. I cant believe the gentleman would oppose this bill. This is a clean funding mechanism. nearly identical to what was included in the initial clean continuing resolution I introduced on September 10. This legislation gives the District access to local funding at the current annual rate of $6.8 billion until December 15 or until fullyear appropriations have been signed into law. This funding is solely local and does not come out of the Federal coffers. These funds will support critical District programs that its people rely onlaw enforcement. safety. schools. and other essential municipal activities. I cant believe that Im hearing opposition to this from that side of the aisleor any side of any aisle. This legislation will help clean up one portion of the difficulties caused by a shutdown. and it makes one more critical next step toward reopening the entire Federal Government.

The Senate said: No. we dont even want to talk to you. And so here we are. When the Senate said we wont talk. the shutdown took place. triggered by the Senates refusal to even talk to Members of the House.

This disease and its alarming statistics call for aggressive measures to develop early detection and treatment tools before its incidence increases dramatically. More advanced scientific research will give hope to those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. which is the only major cancer with a fiveyear relative survival rate of just six percent. Since there are no effective early detection tools or curative treatments for pancreatic cancer. it is expected to become the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths by 2020. I. therefore. commend the Fund a Cure for Pancreatic Cancer Organization. of Newtown. Bucks County. Pennsylvania. and its 2013 Run Over Cancer 5K that took place on July 6 with more than 250 participants. Congratulations for raising over $35.000 for the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals Pancreatic Cancer Research Team.

Entrepreneurs are truly driving growth in our economy. and the small businesses they create account for more than 97% of all employers in Connecticut. I had the honor of celebrating National Entrepreneurs Day yesterdaya day earlyback home in Connecticut. I visited iDevices. a local company in Avon that creates wireless connectivity for smartphones and tablets. The company builds apps such as the iGrill Bluetooth cooking thermometer. the iShower. and the iKitchen. The CEO. Christopher Allen. started with one product. the iGrill. and $150.000 of preseed funding through Connecticut Innovations. He used that money to grow his business and take his product to market. partnering with key tech players like Apple and receiving a major endorsement from Mark Zuckerberg. Last summer. the founder of Facebook. \"liked\" iDevices iGrill. and his endorsement went viral sparking major traffic on iDevices website and demand for their product. Since their launch. iDevices has grown from a small staff of 3 people to a company that now employs 28 people. And theyre still growing. Yesterday. Christopher told me they expect to have 40 employees by the end of the year. He has built a campus in Avon the likes of what one would expect to find in Silicon Valley that provides a nurturing environment for his engineers and employees to innovate and create new products. The company has also invested in our local studentsthey hosted four interns this past summer from local colleges. and those interns will be returning as fulltime employees upon graduation. With all apologies to my colleagues in Northern California. Christopher has created a business in my district that attracts the talent and minds that would typically go to Facebook and Google. He and his team are providing a way to keep our homegrown New England talent in Connecticut for generations to come. iDevices and Christopher are just one of many entrepreneurs making a difference in Connecticut and across the country. I am proud and grateful that they call Connecticut home. I look forward to continuing to work with my friend Rep. Scott Peters on issues to improve our economy and support job creation.",

The Affordable Care Act is working for many of my constituents on the central coast of California. like Danna in San Luis Obispo County. who tells me she will be saving 40 percent on her familys premiums. It is working for the Pacelas in Solvang. who tell me they now have better coverage while saving $8.000 a year on their premiums. It is working for the thousands of families whose young adult children can continue on their parents plans. and for everyone who has a preexisting condition who now cannot be turned down for coverage. I know that this is not the case for all central coast residents. especially those who may have received cancelation notices this year. either because their insurer is only selling in the exchanges. or because the insurance companies have stopped offering plans in our area all together. Cancelation of these plans has caused real pain and confusion for our constituents in California who are faced with Covered California marketplace options that have different provider networks or different premium costs. After hearing numerous stories from the families I represent. it is clear we must address this problem with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act so we can protect all California families and businesses. The President has offered an administrative fix to this issue to allow insurance companies to offer plans to those already enrolled for the next year. but States will be the final decisionmakers. That is why I led a letter. with Congresswoman ZOE LOFGREN and 22 of our California colleagues. to Covered Californias leadership asking them to implement this administrative fix without delay. Covered California has led the way in bringing new. quality health care opportunities to millions of Californians. The Web site is working. and enrollment is steadily increasing. But with over 1 million Californians receiving cancelation notices of their current plans. we must and we will do more to ensure that no one is left without the opportunity for affordable coverage. These families were told that if they liked their plan they can keep it. and that is a promise we must keep for them.",

The 25th District of Texas contains the Barnett Shale. a major job creator. energy provider. and economic driver in the oil and gas industry. Reports this month showed that 825 out of the 1.762 active rigs in the United States are located throughout the State of Texas. That is almost half the Nations active drilling rigs. The shale oil boom in Texas contributes to our Nations overall ability to cut reliance on foreign oil and get one step closer to energy independence. I will tell you one thing that can stop this progress dead in its tracks. however. and that is red tape and Federal bureaucracy. For 60 years. States have regulated their own hydraulic fracturing operations. but the Obama administration is attempting to step in and add duplicative and costly regulations. For example. on average. it takes a State 30 days to approve permits for drilling. The Federal Governments Bureau of Land Management takes an average of 228 days. Subjecting States to this is senseless. harmful. and unnecessary. H.R. 2728 will prevent this and many other destructive regulations from stifling energy production and job creation.",

Because of this continued uncertainty in contracts and the militarys ability to make commitments. thousands of jobs in the Dayton area are at risk as we head into the second year of sequestration. Many of these subcontractors are critical to the training and further education of our military personnel. As a result of these cutbacks. our readiness and the ability to deal with global conflicts are greatly diminished. Hundreds of hardworking civilian employees are struggling to pay their personal bills as a result of furloughs. and many more will suffer in 2014 as reductions in force will be necessary if the burdens of sequestration are not lifted. I encourage those members of the Budget Committee to find targeted and meaningful spending cuts that will alleviate the pressure that sequestration is having on Dayton and similar communities across the country that serve as strong supporters of our military.",

To no ones surprise. he finished his tenure there at the top. as commander. But we knew retirement would not last long for a man of his talents. In 2010. Jim Baker answered the call to step in where he was most needed. taking the helm of the Rutland City Police Department when the department and the community were beset by turmoil. Chief Bakers leadership and loyalty was infections. and his plan to serve for only a few months turned into a few years. During that time. Chief Baker pulled together a team of committed neighbors. businesspeople and community organizers to face the challenges headon. They tackled blighted neighborhoods and encouraged new investment. They sent a strong message to drug dealers: NOT in our community. And they developed a statistical mapping system to reduce crime in the citys worsthit blocks. This effort. known as \"Project VISION.\" has shown great success.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in June of this year the Senate passed by unanimous consent. S. 2270. urgent legislation I introduced with Senators BROWN and JOHANNS to address the capital requirements that apply to insurance companies under Federal supervision pursuant to the DoddFrank Act. This legislation clarifies the Federal Reserves authority to recognize the distinctions between banking and insurance when implementing section 171 of the DoddFrank Act. ensuring that bankcentric capital standards are not applied to such companies regulated insurance activities. One of the central elements of the DoddFrank Act was stronger capital rules for both banks and certain nonbank financial institutions. Two sections of the DoddFrank Act accomplished thissection 165. which applies to large bank holding companies and to nonbank systemically important financial institutions. SIFIs. and section 171. which applies minimum capital standards to insured depository institutions. depository institution holding companies. including insurance savings and loan holding companies. and to SIFIs. Insurance companies. specifically insurance savings and loan holding companies. are different from banks. Insurers must match longterm obligations to their policyholders with longterm assets. mostly bonds. while banks have more callable obligationssecurities and loans and mortgagesand fund them with deposits as well as a mix of debt and equity of varying maturities and durations. The DoddFrank legislation reflected this reality. both in its text and in the legislative history. which repeatedly recognizes that the business of insurance is unique and presents different risks.",

We continue to believe that the regulators could solve this problem using their existing authority. This legislation shows that there is strong bipartisan support for addressing this issue. As you know. 31 of your colleagues and I cosponsored the bill. and the legislation passed the Senate with unanimous support in early June. S. 2270 is narrowly crafted to only address this issue as it relates to insurance companies and insurance savings and loan holding companies. If you are a bank. or another entity that owns a bank. you will be subject to the full force of the Collins amendment for your banking activities. At the same time. if you are a financial organization engaged in insurance which is also engaged in bank activities. including derivatives market making. those activities would be subject to the Collins amendment. To accomplish the goal of directing the Federal Reserve to tailor rules for insurance. our legislation permits the Federal Reserve to create a nonBasel III regime for the insurance operations of supervised entities. The legislation allows the Fed to work with State insurance regulators to develop appropriate insurancebased capital standards for insurance activities.",

    "speech": "I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and appreciate your longstanding partnership on this issue. The bill clarifies that. in establishing the minimum leverage capital and riskbased capital standards under section 171. the Federal Reserve Board is not required to include activities or companies that are engaged in the business of insurance and are subject to State insurance regulation. including State insurance capital requirements. Similarly. regulated foreign affiliates or subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance and subject to foreign insurance regulation and foreign insurance capital requirements that have not been deemed to be inadequate also may be excluded from section 171 capital standards. We believe it is worth noting that the Government Accountability Office found that the State riskbased capital rules performed well during the financial crisis. The bill allows the insurance capital requirements that have been effective to continue to determine the capital requirements for the activities of insurance companies and groups that are supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. Furthermore. activities of a holding company supervised by the Federal Reserve Board that are not the business of insurance would remain subject to the capital standards under section 171. In determining insurance versus noninsurance activities of a supervised entity. the legislation provides regulators with the flexibility to tailor the rules for certain affiliates or subsidiaries of insurance companies that are necessary to the business of insurance. including. for example. affiliates or subsidiaries that support insurance company general and separate accounts. Our legislation defines \"business of insurance\" by reference to section 1002 of the DoddFrank Act. and under this definition the business of insurance means \"the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks by an insurer. including all acts necessary to such writing or reinsuring and the activities relating to the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks conducted by persons who act as. or are. officers. directors. agents. or employees of insurers or who are other persons authorized to act on behalf of such persons.\" The reference to this definition of the \"business of insurance\" will help ensure that insurance activities of federally supervised companies are subject to tailored capital rules. whether those activities are undertaken by the insurance companies themselves or by their affiliates or subsidiaries on their behalf.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me begin by commending Congressman GREEN for his leadership in helping to highlight the tragedy of domestic violence in our country and for arranging todays Special Order. While it is true that we have made some progress toward addressing violence against women. the fact remains that nearly onethird of women in the United States still report being physically or sexually abused by a partner in their lifetime. Domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault. and stalking lead to severe social health and economic consequences for women and our communities. with the estimated cost of violence exceeding $70 billion each year. Our Nations economic crisis has hammered home the sad truth that financial concerns often keep victims in abusive relationships. Studies indicate that economic independence is a key predictor of whether a victim will be able to break the cycle of violence and leave her abuser. Far too often. it is difficult for victims to maintain employment in the aftermath of domestic violence. especially if they require time off for medical appointments. court appearances. and for their own safety. As a result. women who experience domestic violence are more likely than other women to be unemployed. to suffer from health problems that impact employability and job performance. to report lower personal income. and to rely on welfare. These poor economic outcomes often perpetuate the abuse. For the last 16 years. I have introduced legislation that would help ensure victims of domestic violence. sexual assault. and stalking have the financial independence they need to break free from their abusers. The Security and Financial Empowerment Act. or SAFE Act. would allow survivors to take unpaid time off from work to make necessary court appearances. seek legal assistance. and get help with safety planning without the fear of losing their job. The SAFE Act would prohibit employers or insurance providers from basing hiring or insurance coverage decisions on an individuals history of abuse. and ensure eligibility for unemployment benefits should a survivor be forced to leave her job due to circumstances stemming from domestic violence.",

Congressman GREEN. I am not going to relate all 25.000 of them. but I would like to mention another one. When we think of domestic violence. we need to remember not only the spouse. but we need to think about the children that are involved. too. because many times they are the victims of domestic violence. There was a young girl who was a secondgrader. and. like a lot of kids today. she rode the bus back and forth to elementary school. I will call her \"June.\" One afternoon. she is riding the schoolbus home. and she wouldnt get off the bus. She just sat there. and she was literally gripping that bar that is on the seat in front of you. Finally. the schoolbus driver came back and tried to talk to her and asked her. Why wont you get off the bus? This is your home. This is where you live. June replied. I dont want to get off. because I am only safe when I am on the bus going to school. at school. and when I am on the bus going home. Bad things happen when I get off the bus. You see. she went back into a situation where she was constantly battered by the \"livein boyfriend\" is what I am going to call him. Because of the bus driver and doing what she did. they called the police and an investigation took place. That person was prosecuted. but. more importantly. June is safe and her mother is safe. We need to understand that victims of domestic violence live. many times. quiet lives of desperation and fear. It is our responsibility as Congress to eliminate that the best we can. to provide services for victims. to let them understand that crime is not their fault. that it is the fault of the perpetrator. On the other end. we need to make sure those perpetrators get the justice that they deserve at the courthouse and they are held accountable for those actions that they commit against someone in their family.

The unfortunate reality is that domestic violence is something that affects every community in America. as it touches every race. class. gender. and sexual orientation. Millions of domestic violence incidents are reported each year. and many more go unreported. Too often. domestic violence remains within the confines of the household. as many victims do not contact law enforcement or go public. often out of fear. When it was first observed 26 years ago. Domestic Violence Awareness Month sought to shine a light on this tragic reality by educating the public. empowering the victims. and punishing the offenders. And in the 26 years since. we have made great progress. partly due to the Violence Against Women Act. which provides critical support to programs for victims and their families. as well as resources for law enforcement and community organizations. With a 51 percent increase in reporting by women and a 37 percent increase in reporting by men. the results have been nothing short of incredible. Domestic violence is wrong. and no victim should be hesitant to report it.

Because although these are best practices. they are too often honored in the breach or not at all because they are not yet written into statute.

Millions of people cant find fulltime work. millions more have given up looking for work. and our local businesses are just drowning in red tape. They often ask: Doesnt anyone in Washington consider the impact on our local businesses and the economy from all this new red tape before they put it in place? Well. sadly not often enough. In 2012. the Federal Government imposed 3.708 new Federal rules. Guess how many of them had a cost benefit analysis? Simply ask the question: How does this affect the economy? The answer is 1414 out of more than 3.000. I applaud Chairman GOODLATTES commitment to reforming the way this government conducts red tape. I have an amendment that complements his efforts. one drawn from my own Sound Regulation Act. which I think is helpful as we move this reform through. The point here is this: When a Federal agency sets out to adopt new rules and red tape. the agency has a responsibility to state clearly the achievable objective of those rules or regulations. After all. our citizens have the right to know what their Federal Government intends to accomplish with this red tape. The agency also has the responsibility to tell the American people up front what metrics it is going to use to measure the progress toward that objective. No more manipulative statistics. No more fuzzy math. When the agency publishes the final rule. it has the responsibility to certify to the American people that the rule actually meets the objective the agency originally identified. It is just common sense. My amendment says to regulators: Tell us your objective. Tell us how you are going to meet it and measure it. Then tell us you actually did what you promised. It is common sense. and it may just help put this painful recovery behind us. Madam Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia . the chairman of the committee.",

I would put the TV on and watch my program in peace. So it gave them some busy work. That is pretty much what this amendment does. It creates an additional requirement in the rulemaking process for an agency to articulate achievable objectives and metrics indicating progress toward those objectives. This amendment piles on the bills numerous mandatory new rulemaking requirements. and it implies that agencies issue rules that lack an achievable objective. notwithstanding the fact that regulations already go through an extensive public notice and comment period as well as being subjected to judicial review. The bill would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities. It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty. increase costs for businesses and State. local. and tribal governments. and it would impede commonsense protections for the American public.

Space. and Technology Committee. I have been a longtime supporter and advocate for making the R&D tax credit permanent. The R&D tax credit promotes innovation and encourages the creation and retention of jobs in the United States. Unfortunately. since being created in the early 1980s. the R&D tax credit has been allowed to lapse and has needed to be extended year after year. The business community needs certainty when planning longterm research and development investments. and many have called for this important tax credit to be made permanent. In the famous National Academies \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\" report. making the R&D tax credit stronger and permanent was one of their 10 recommendations on congressional actions to improve our Nations competitiveness. Private sector leaders also agree that there is a clear and necessary role for government in all aspects of our innovation ecosystem. from the direct funding of fundamental research. to incentives for the private sector to increase their R&D investments. Often. private sector R&D investments are built upon years of direct government research funding. For example. the Internet and the GPS were developed with DARPA and National Science Foundation funding. but private sector innovation carried these technologies to their full commercial potential. with immeasurable benefit for our Nation. However. the conversation about how best to modify the R&D tax credit and make it permanent should be part of a larger conversation about tax reform and tax extenders. and that conversation should include other tax provisions that are important for millions of working families and students. including the earned income tax credit. the child tax credit. and education tax credits. Further. we should be debating how to offset this tax credit. instead of ignoring how it would add $156 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.",

How much is $310 billion? That is five times what we spend on services to our veterans. We have over 21 million Americans who have served in uniform who are veterans of this country. That $310 billion is three times what the Federal Government invests in education. job training. and social services for an entire year. It is over 10 times what we spend annually on medical research to come up with the innovations and the lifesaving treatments that Americans rely upon. We hear from our colleagues on the Republican side that they are fiscally responsible. that they are fiscal hawks. but they pass these severe budgets that would cut schools. that would cut medical research. that would cut Medicare funding for our seniors. that would cut Social Security. but they have to do it because we have to get rid of that deficit. Here we have the fiscal pretenders. In this bill. H.R. 4438. our Republican colleagues propose to blow the deficit wide open by adding $310 billion to that deficit by passing these unpaidfor tax breaks.

Surely we dont need any more research this afternoon to know that such an irresponsible approach is the wrong way to go. In January of last year. Republicans came to this floor and they told us that they had reserved H.R. 1 for a bill that would do it all. It was going to simplify the Tax Code. it was going to lower the rates. and it would not add a penny to the debt because it would all be financed by closing loopholes. Where is that bill? It is still reserved. and it will be reserved until the end of this term because the truth of the matter is Republicans could not stand up to the special interests that like those loopholes. that like the complexity of the Tax Code. that benefit from that complexity. They would not stand up to pass a bill that was fiscally responsible. Both parties. as the chairman has indicated. have repeatedly supported temporary extensions. but neither has had the audacity to come to this floor and say we are going to borrow enough to make it permanent without closing a single loophole. They are doing exactly the opposite of what they have repeatedly promised us and the American people that they would do. I support a permanent research and development credit to incentivize research for new products. It has never been a question of whether to support research. but how to do it and how to pay for it. And if the only goal is to encourage more job growth. there are ways we can redesign this credit to get even more growth than it does now. The Government Accountability Office said the credit in its current form is a windfall for some corporations. and some multinationals have used it as a way to get the taxpayer to subsidize research here and then shift the benefits overseas.

While the U.S. was the first nation to offer a tax incentive for research and development in 1981. according to a study by the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF). we now rank 27th out of 42 countries in terms of the generosity of the R&D incentives we offer. Congress needs to do so much more to improve our national economy. and updating the R&D tax credit is an important policy that will encourage businesses to invest in new technologies which in turn will create jobs and shape a better economy in our future. Nearly six months have passed since the R&D tax credit expired. To maintain our nations competitiveness. lets not wait another day to give businesses the certainty they need to continue innovating and investing in Americas future. I thank Representatives KEVIN BRADY and JOHN LARSON for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4438.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I want to thank Ranking Member MILLER for allowing me to speak in support of this important bipartisan legislation. First. I want to take a moment and also thank my good friend. Mr. ROKITA. for his great work and leadership on behalf of our students and the educational system. It has been a pleasure working with you. sir. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4366. the Strengthening Education Through Research Act. Now. I firmly believe that. in order to successfully prepare our students for the workforce. our Nations educators must be able to identify and have access to successful and proven techniques. In 2002. I proudly supported the passage of the Education Sciences Reform Act which. among other things. ensured that education research be conducted free of political bias and focus on improving student achievement. Last year. the Government Accountability Office released a report highlighting the successes of the law. but also detailed several areas that could be improved to better impact outcomes for our students. Today. along with Mr. ROKITA. we have built upon the success of that bill through H.R. 4366. The Strengthening Education Through Research Act is a perfect example of what bipartisanship and a commitment to good government can yield. and I am proud to support this legislation today. The bill improves. among other things. the quality of education research by enhancing the timeless and relevancy of research. limiting duplication and overlap. improving accountability. and refocusing our commitment to equity in education for our most vulnerable student populations. The bill also provides critical funding to strengthen special education research. which has been unfairly cut in recent years. Moreover. the bill meets one of my top priorities by reaffirming a Federal commitment to States and localities to provide teachers. principals. and educational leaders with the latest research products to improve educational equity and effectiveness for students without bias. Especially under difficult budgetary circumstances. this Congress has an obligation to explore opportunities that will most effectively deliver results for our students and our taxpayers. and this bill does just that. I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4366. as it represents another strong step toward improving our Nations educational landscape and preparing our students with the necessary skills to compete in the global economy.",

Ridgecrest embodies what makes America exceptionallove of country. hard work. and dedication. The roots of Ridgecrest began much earlier than 1963. when the city was incorporated. In 1912. local dairymen James and Robert Crum established a small farming settlement named Crumville. As more farming families settled the Naval Ordnance Testing Station was created. the community continued to grow. By 1963. the town was officially incorporated as Ridgecrest and experienced exponential growth as the demand for expertise in the naval stations programs for weapons development increased during the Cold War. Today. the Naval Ordnance Test Station is now the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake (NAWS) and home to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division. Growing together with China Lake. the Ridgecrest community also grew. supporting the tireless mission of our nations defense with zeal. One of the most patriotic communities in America. Ridgecrest remains dedicated to the defense of American ideals and helping members of the armed forces. Ridgecrest boasts a rich historic and educational history. The city has many cultural and recreational activities. such as the Maturango Museum. the China Lake Naval Museum of Armament and Technology. and the Petroglyph Canyons. Boasting National Blue Ribbon and California Distinguished Schools. Ridgecrest schools. served by the Sierra Sands Unified School District. consistently perform at the highest academic levels. Additionally. with the establishment of Cerro Coso Community College in 1973. Ridgecrest carries a statewide reputation for hosting one of the top community colleges in California. serving over 8.500 students. Over half a century. Ridgecrest remains a California jewel. honoring and supporting Americas great warfighter. and sharing in the success of one of the Navys premier research. testing. development. and evaluation installations. Such success cannot be replicated without the hardworking people and the closeknit community that is unique to Ridgecrest. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to join me and my friends in the Ridgecrest community as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of its incorporation as a city in the great state of California.",

Don Tuttles long career with the Humboldt County Public Works Departments Natural Resources Division and his deep involvement in key resource. energy and historical issues has been a great benefit to Humboldt County and Californias North Coast. His expertise and meticulous chronicling of events continues to be an asset on which the community relies. Don Tuttles positions as administrator of the EelRussian River Commission from 1978 to 1988. and as a member of the Trinity River Task Force Technical Advisory Committee. helped shape the recovery of two essential North Coast rivers.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I would first like to commend the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for working together on this bipartisan legislation. The collaboration between Chairman SCHUSTER. Ranking Member RAHALL and the rest of the committee demonstrates that we can work together to invest in our nations infrastructure to make the U.S. more competitive and grow the economy. The backlog of unfinished water infrastructure projects and maintenance is hindering economic recovery and hurting small businesses by slowing trade. This bill helps address the backlog by updating critical infrastructure to allow goods to move more efficiently across our nations waterways. ports and coasts. However. like most pieces of legislation. this bill is not perfect. Although this bill makes some critical improvements to current law. I continue to be concerned with changes in environmental assessments and public comment periods in the U.S. Army Corps project approval process. That is why I supported Rep. PETER DEFAZIOs (OR04) amendment requiring the Army Corps to decrease their backlog of water infrastructure improvements to under $20 billion before the modified environmental assessment process can go into effect. There are currently over $40 billion in projects that have been authorized under the current approval process. but they lack sufficient appropriations to actually complete them. While I understand the need to improve the Army Corps project approval process. it would be helpful to start addressing the lack of appropriated funds for previously authorized projects. Although Rep. DEFAZIOs amendment failed. I still supported this legislation because it makes many important improvements to the Great Lakes water infrastructure that will improve transportation and trade as well as protect against invasive species. I will continue to fight for policies that help the Army Corps decrease its backlog of construction and maintenance projects and protect our precious natural resources.",

But its practical effect would be just the opposite. The bill would impose onerousand unnecessarynew requirements on the Securities and Exchange Commission from imposing a common fiduciary standard on brokerdealers and investment advisers alike. DoddFrank directed that the Commission study this matter. and it did. The Commission found it necessary in a 2011 report and stands ready. willing. and able to complete a rulemaking. Whats worse is that the bill would also prevent the Department of Labor from moving forward with a fiduciary duty rulemaking for employee benefit plans until after the Commission has acted. In the simplest of terms. the Commissions and Department of Labors common intention with these rulemakings is to protect investors. H.R. 2374s practical effect would be to prevent both from doing so. This is another example of not having learned the lessons of the past. Investor abuses in part precipitated the 2008 financial crisis. Passing H.R. 2374 would be a terrible step backward and a validation of the practices that nearly brought this country to its knees.

Instead. theyve launched an attackon the working poor. veterans. children and seniors who rely on the nutrition programin a desperate attempt to win political points with their conservative base. After an embarrassing. chaotic defeat of their last proposal. theyve decided to make a bad situation even worse. This proposal strips out the entire nutrition title. putting families and children at risk of going hungry. They made a clear choice to protect generous subsidies for agriculture corporations at the expense of the hungry and the working poor. Make no mistake: today. House Republicans are telling hungry children. food banks struggling to meet the needs of their communities. and lowincome seniors who depend on food assistance that their needs dont matter. And I urge my colleagues to understand that for 180.000 Rhode Islanders who benefit from this nutrition program. they are not extraneous. This is disgraceful. its immoral. and its contrary to our values as a Nation. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this shameful proposal.",

This farm bill does all of those things.

The farm bill also does a couple of other things. It is being considered separately on its own merits. as many in this body have called for. and it replaces antiquated permanent law so that we dont face things. like the dairy cliff. at the end of the year anymore.

Yet. time and again. we have reaffirmed the principle that every eligible American has an equal right to cast a ballot without facing discrimination. A 3hour wait is discrimination against those who have to work. those who have to take care of their kids and those whose health prevents them from waiting in line for such a long time. Long lines are the 21st century version of poll taxes and literacy tests. disenfranchising the least advantaged and the most vulnerable citizens. We have an obligation to ensure that every American has an equal opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to vote.",

I would say that JOHN BOEHNER. our great young Speaker. is energized to look at all of the ideas that might come from legislation. would be pleased. as I would. to make sure that we look at these. because the integrity of who serves in this House and the ability that people have back home to go vote is important.

Don Gean took over as director of the York County Alcoholism Center. which was housed in a crumbling former jail. Today. that organization is called the York County Shelter Programs. an innovative network of facilities and services that serves 400 clients. Among its facilities are a bakery where clients learn vocational skills while preparing the food served at several shelter sites. a working farm that produces eggs for the bakery and houses one of the largest solar arrays in the state. and 36 residences for transitional housing. Under Dons leadership. the organization has come a long way from a condemned jail. Early on in his tenure. Don resolved that his organization needed to do more than provide beds and meals if it was going to make a lasting impact on its clients. To that end. he developed a range of vocational. medical. mental health and substance abuse programs to give people the support. tools. and selfconfidence they needed to turn their lives around. Today. the shelters recidivism rate is an astonishingly low 5.3 percent. It has become a model program for dealing with the challenges of homelessness. But the best way to mark Dons legacy is in the words of the people he served. One man who first came to the shelter in 2007 now owns his own home and regularly volunteers for the organization. \"This is a lifesaving organization.\" he said. \"Don is a big part of saving peoples lives. but he wont tell you that. Hell take no credit.\" I had the pleasure of serving with Don in the Maine State Legislature in the early 1990s. where he became a statewide leader on the issue of homelessness. He was then and continues to be a practical. shrewd. and effective advocate. but above all a kind. goodhearted person who reminds us that no one in our society should ever be written off. I wish Don all the best in his retirement and thank him wholeheartedly for his incredible work. E504",

For example employers in many sectors. from farmers to municipalities. face unacceptable uncertainty surrounding the definition of seasonal and part time workers. The federal government needs to provide clear guidance to these employers. As some Senators have proposed. I also support giving businesses with between 50 and 100 full time employees the option to either provide employer sponsored insurance or have their employees buy plans on the individual exchange. Instead of focusing on reasonable reforms like these. Republican House leadership today brought up H.R. 2575. a bill that the President has already promised to veto. H.R. 2575 would not provide any more certainty to employers with seasonal workers. It would not give businesses with between 50 and 100 full time employees any more flexibility with regard to how their employees get insurance. What it would do. according to the Congressional Budget Office. is increase the deficit by $73 billion. It would also increase the number of uninsured Americans. For these reasons. I voted against the bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass real fixes to the ACA that will make the law work better for consumers and employers alike.",

One particular troubling issue is the predefinition of \"actively engaged in farming.\" My good colleague should know that this will alter. fundamentally. the normal operations on a farm. Take two quick examples. a brother and a sister. The sister runs the tractors. plants the crops. harvests the crops. the brother. on the other hand. does all the bookkeeping. files tax returns. works with FSA. arranges the loans at the bank. He would no longer be actively engaged in farming. That makes no sense whatsoever. The broader spread one. though. is the generational shift in farming operations. As parents and grandparents age. they take less of a physical role in farming operations and hand that off to the younger generationthe folks that my good colleague was speaking to. This redefinition would say that as they age out and quit doing the actual physical labor. and yet their wisdom and knowledge and vast experience has added to the success of those farming operations. they would no longer be considered actively engaged in farming and would be excluded from the program itself. This is wrongheaded. It adds additional regulatory burdens on family farms across this country in an unnecessary manner and doesnt get to what my good colleague is trying to get to.

I would like to offer another example regarding direct engagement in farming that helps clarify the issue that my colleague just raised. A farm in the Deep South recently received $440.000again. none of it to someone actually working the farm. but to six general partners and five spouses. all of whom claim to be providing the management needed to running the farm. What this bill does. in addition to capping payments. it provides a more enforceable working definition for those actively engaged in farm management. and thats an important reform as well. Again. this has been worked out in the other legislative body from Members who represent diverse agricultural districts all over this country.

This is largely due to the high cost of production. expensive machinery. and razorthin margins. In order to remain economically viable. a midSouth farmer must produce a high quantity of crops and then sell that crop at an adequate price. which doesnt always work out so well. Some years in Arkansas a farmer might do very well if conditions are right and the prices dont drop too low. but in other years times can be absolutely brutal. This amendment takes the wrong approach because it adds even more uncertainty to the farmers operation. Most farmers go to the bank for loans to pay production costs and purchases of new technology and machinery. Once you introduce a restrictive AGI. it becomes much more difficult to obtain the financing necessary to sustain an operation and stay in business. Through a careful approach. the Ag Committee has already brought significant reforms to AGI eligibility. which has already been difficult on some of my producers. We certainly dont need to go a step further. Additionally. requiring active. onfarm labor is counterproductive for two reasons: one. it discourages farms from improving and becoming more efficient. and. two. it discourages the participation of young farmers. and that could mean that theyre out of a job. Farm owners and operators need to focus their attention on the management of the overall farm and key management decisions. I strongly urge defeat of this amendment. with all due respect.",

For example. there are many farmers in my district who farm thousands of acres that they dont own. They might grow cotton. peanuts. grains and specialty crops. They need a whole fleet of different equipment for each one of these crops. Theyre probably irrigating a whole lot of their crops. They likely employ dozens of people. These might be multimilliondollar enterprises. and yet they still fit in the definition of a family farm. For these kinds of crops. it simply takes that kind of scale to be sustainable. Many farmers simply cannot afford to farm on that scale unless they have a safety net that can cover their risk. This bill includes sustainable reforms of our farm safety net to make sure its available to the people who need it most. Its not fair. nor in our best interest. to limit the participation of these larger family farms by undercutting their safety net. as this amendment would do. We need these farmers and they need us.

I would be hardpressed to figure out how many pages of regulations theyre going to come up with to try to figure out whether youre actually a farmer or not. Were changing this \"actively engaged\" definition. which weve been struggling with for years. and which I think we did a pretty good job with in 2008. putting in new requirements. new tests. stuff that we really dont understand how its going to work. I think it is just going to totally screw up the safety net. especially for our friends in the South that have a different situation than we do up in my part of the world. This is an overreach. Its getting into areas that weve never done before with payment limitations at a time when were changing these programs. We dont really even understand how this would work. other than to know its going to really screw things up. I would strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.",

As a result of the bipartisan work reforms in the TANF program in 1996. after that period we saw a 57 percent reduction in the number of people on TANF. This amendment would take the most successful welfare reform in the history of this country. signed into law by President Bill Clinton and passed by a Republican Congress. and apply it to now the largest meanstested assistance program we have. Thats what that amendment would do. In addition to applying that successful work requirement. we would have additional reforms in terms of LIHEAP and a few other items that would provide additional savings in the food stamp program.

I think most Americans agree. lets help folks that are in need. but we probably shouldnt help those who dont actually qualify for food stamps. With the adoption of this amendment. it will require folks that would like to receive food stampsSNAP benefitsto actually have to qualify for them instead of being qualified through another program. It was also noted about the impact of these reforms and their potential impact on cuts. Lets look at a little history of this particular program. In 2002. in the 2002 farm bill. $270 billion was the spending level-$270 billion. In the 2008 farm bill. it was approximately $400 billion. If this amendment is adopted. the spending level would be $733 billion. Only in Washington could you say going from $270 billion to $733 billion is a cut. These are commonsense reforms. These a few decades ago were considered bipartisan reforms to encourage people to look for work. to encourage people to get a job. I agree with my colleagues: there isnt a person in America I dont think that wouldnt rather have a paycheck rather than a SNAP check or a SNAP card. or a Vision card if youre in the State of Kansas. These are very commonsense reforms. They will work. They are good for Americans. They are good for our taxpayers. They are good for the people receiving benefits.

There are more Americans living in poverty today than when the war on poverty was launched a half century ago. Instead of incentivizing work. we are reinforcing the same government dependency and cyclical poverty that we all wish to eliminate. It is clear that an important variable has been missing from Americas antipoverty equation. and that is the element of work. History has proven that work is the surest way to empower ablebodied Americans to advance from welfare to selfsufficiency. When a Republicancontrolled Congress and a Democrat President joined together to pass welfare reform requiring work. the results were dramatic. Nationwide. welfare rolls dropped by 67 percent. In my home State of Florida. the number was higherapproximately 85 percent. Work participation by nevermarried single moms and household earnings skyrocketed. Child poverty rates plummeted. This true bipartisan success story is what my amendment is based upon. My amendment empowers the States to require work for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. or SNAP. benefits. We apply the same sensible work preparation. job training. and community service activities that are at the heart of welfare reform. Our plan is endorsed by several States Human Services Secretaries who approached us because they understand how important work can be for individuals truly in need. The simple fact. Mr. Chairman. is that \"work\" works. We must have a system in place that provides a helping hand to the most vulnerable among us. By requiring work for ablebodied SNAP recipients. we can ensure that the resources get to those in need more effectively and efficiently. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting my amendment and in renewing the Godgiven opportunity for earned success in America. Mr. Chairman. with that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

We just rejected an amendment in our last series of votes that would have allowed people to get toothpaste and toothbrushes with SNAP benefits. but what this amendment does is allow the States to pocket these sanctions and use them for whatever they want toto balance the budget with it or to convert SNAP benefits into tax breaks for corporations or for wealthy people.

Justice Crawford is an experienced and wellrespected jurist. He is known for his modesty and humanity. notwithstanding his elite educational background and intellectual heft. He was a successful plaintiffs attorney before he was appointed to the Vermont Superior Court in 2002. ThenJudge Crawford served on the superior court in our State for more than a decade. earning a reputation for his skill in working with juries and handling a wide variety of litigation. Attorneys who have appeared before him. on either side. have found him to be an engaged and careful jurist who treats everyone in the courtroom with respect. I have talked with a number of those lawyers. and they speak of his respect and abilities. As a lawyer. I wanted to hear this. and although I did not know Justice Crawford before interviewing him for this vacancy. the Vermont legal community repeatedly told me of his intelligence. warmth. and unwavering commitment to the highest calling of public service. When I met Justice Crawford. I found him to be well deserving of these accolades. and I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and pragmatic approach to the law. as was the chief counsel of the Judiciary Committee. Kristine Lucius. and the state director of my Vermont offices. John Tracy.

On Tuesday. for the first time in their lives. for many of them. theres a chance to do something about that. A great number could enroll in Medicaidtheir whole families. Others were able to buy health insurance for $10 or $15 a week to cover themselves and their families. This whole government shutdown is about shutting down that opportunity for them to buy health care.

Ive heard some of my colleagues across the aisle say they believe WIC has been underfunded. I do want to point out that all eligible participants are being served. and to my knowledge. no one has been turned away from the program. The FY 13 Ag approps conference agreement provided more than $7 billion for the WIC program. After sequestration and rescissions. the total equaled $6.5 billion. At the end of FY 13. WIC had carryover funds. or remaining funds. totaling nearly $300 million. Even with sequestration. WIC has been able to serve all eligible participants and still have funding left over for the end of the fiscal year by $300 million. Clearly. the program has received suffi cient funding. and we have certainly made sure that to be the case. In closing today. I would hope that my colleagues would join me in support of this resolution. Theres nothing cynical about what were doing here. You can read the resolution. I have it right here. It simply continues to provide funding for the WIC program. and it provides certainty. It ensures that WIC clinics will be open. appointments will be kept. and food benefits will be provided. Theres nothing. again. cynical about this. The only thing thats cynical about this is if you decide to politicize this bill. Its interesting that those who claim to be the defenders and supporters of this program are the very ones actually coming here this afternoon that are opposing the bill. My colleagues will have a chance to be cynical and vote \"no.\" but I hope they will not turn their backs on providing certainty for lowincome women and children.

    "speech": "Madam Speaker. it is not surprising that the WIC program is the latest subject of the majoritys ploy to use lowincome mothers and children as political pawns. WIC enjoys bipartisan support. A bipartisan poll in 2012 found the program enjoyed 67 percent approval among the American people. including 53 percent of conservatives. By providing things like fresh fruits and vegetables. lowfat dairy and salmon. tuna for breastfeeding mothers. every dollar spent on pregnant women in WIC produces $1.92 to $4.21 in Medicaid savings for newborns and their mothers. That just makes common sense. On Wednesday. the USDA estimated that WIC would continue operations for a week or two. thanks to a small contingency fund. In Arizona. 29 percent of children are food insecure. and over 36 percent of Arizonans live in WICeligible households. In my district. the Arizona Department of Health Services in Apache and Navajo Counties says 70 percent of families were WICeligible in 2010. We need this program. But the bill before us is not meant to relieve needy families. It is only a tool meant for partisan gain. The Republican budget proposal would cut WIC 22 percent. The National WIC Association estimates that the sequester has resulted in nearly 12.000 deserving families in Arizona dropped from the rolls. yet now the majority reverses itself to fund this program. Beyond the cynicism of this tactic. WIC cannot stand alone. It is a gateway to health care and social services for families. services that will remain unsustainable due to the shutdownservices like low energy assistance through the Department of Energy. immunizations through Health and Human Services. and early childhood education programs like Head Start. Where is the funding for these programs? The majority proposes a fragmented program that would be crippled. My motion to recommit would open up the entire Federal Government for funding so that were no longer picking and choosing the needs that we are going to meet. Can the Chair explain why it is not germane to keep all of the Federal Government open instead of just a tiny slice? Stop these political games. Lets get serious about helping the American people.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the passage of the Government Reports Elimination Acta bill that will eliminate or modify 53 Congressionally mandated reports. In 2010. we passed the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act. which added several new reporting requirements for Federal agencies. Too often. we add these new reporting requirements without looking back to see if there are any outdated reports that could be eliminated. So we asked Federal agencies to identify any duplicative or outdated reports that we could cut. In response. the administration published its first list of more than 300 reports from about 30 agencies and we turned this list into the Government Reports Elimination Act. Senator AYOTTE and I introduced this bill in the Senate and Congressmen DARRELL ISSA and GERRY CONNOLLY introduced the companion in the House. The final bill will eliminate or modify 53. In doing so. we are removing real barriers to productivity across the government. This represents a real step. albeit a modest one. toward making our government work better. If these reports are not being usedand are simply collecting dust on a shelfthen they are wasteful. and we cannot afford that kind of waste Eliminating a handful of reports wont solve our budget challengesbut every hour and dollar saved helps. This bill helps free up time for our Federal employees to focus on priorities. The passage of the Government Reports Elimination Act makes a small down payment on the broader problem. which is why Im also working on another bill to make further reductions in Congressionally mandated reports. In June. the administration sent over the second list of outdated reports for elimination and our new bill will include their recommendations and reflects my ongoing commitment to eliminating these outdated reports. I wish to thank Senator AYOTTE for being my partner on this work. It has been an honor to work with her on our Budget Committee Government Performance Task Force.

From humble beginnings as the Silver Cornet Band in 1854. the DeKalb Municipal Band has a history as interesting and unique as its many members. In its early years it was the official band of the Third Regiment of the Illinois National Guard. and was later renamed the DeKalb Military Band following the return of musicians who served in World War I. In the 1930s. Hopkins Park was built and the band found a permanent home for concerts. Since then. Hopkins Park has been outfitted with a wooden shell. funded by the band members themselves. which was eventually upgraded to the current concrete and steel band shell that includes seating for 3.000 to enjoy todays concerts.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is an exciting and historic time for selfdetermination in Scotland. Scots (and others) are voicing the pros and cons for Scotlands vote this week on independence. To go it alone or not from the United Kingdom is the question before the feisty Scots. Thousands of Scots came to the United States for a new life over 300 years ago. My own family line traces back to Scotland and the Weems (Wemyss) clan. (Some would say it explains my personality.) The Weems castle. built in the 15th Century. still proudly stands in the town of Fife. Scotland. My ancestors fought with Robert the Bruce in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. The King of England. Edward II. invaded Scotland with the largest English Army to ever attack Scotland. His army outnumbered Robert the Bruces common Scot army 4 to 1. But the Scots are fearsome warriors. After days of hand to hand combat. the Scots beat the English and declared Scotlands de facto Independence. However. Scotland and England were joined under the United Kingdom 400 years ago. Texas Weems came by way of the Carolinas in the 1700s then they moved to Tennessee and finally settled in early Texas in the 1800s. From Americas struggle for Independence and Texass successful fight for Texas independence from Mexico (Texas was a sovereign republic from 18361845). such causes are noble but difficult. During the Texas War of Independence. at least four Scots fought and died at the cradle of Texas libertyThe Alamo. If government truly is of the people. by the people and for the people. then people that E1411 are ruled over by a government should be the ones to choose that government. Selfdetermination is a natural right. Scotland will have that peaceful choice this week. and do what is best for \"Scotland the Brave.\" And thats just the way it is.",

The other body just passed this bill last week. We have had no hearings on the bill. no committee meetings. no markups. I understand that several general aviation groups have expressed concerns about the bill. and I would have liked the opportunity to hear from them and study their specific reservations. Each of the Nations federallyassisted airports is part of a systema national systemthat is greater than the sum of its parts. The Federal Government invests $3.35 billion a year in airport improvements because each airport in the system not only drives economic growth. but also is a safe harbor for a pilot in distress. For those reasons. the general rule is that we invest in airports. not close them. nevertheless. I understand that the airport in St. Clair. Missouri. which this bill would allow to close. presents some unique circumstances. Although the Federal Government has invested almost $1.1 million in the airport since 1963. the airport has not received a Federal grant since 2006 when it received $300.000. There are now only about eight aircraft movements at the airport a day. Community leaders believe that there are simply higher and better uses for the airport land. Based on these extraordinary circumstances. this bill would allow the city of St. Clair to close the airport and would release the city from its obligations as a recipient of Federal airport improvement funds. provided the city transfers remaining grant funds and the market value of the land to the Missouri Department of Transportation. While I have serious reservations about the precedent that this bill could set. I recognize the unique situation in this particular case. Going forward. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about what it means for our national system of airports when we start permitting airports to shut down without working through the Federal Aviation Administrations administrative process.

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from Arizona for yielding time. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to support the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act. which would designate the Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial currently under construction at March Air Field Museum in Riverside County as a national memorial. Established by Congress in 1926. the Distinguished Flying Cross has been awarded to tens of thousands of Americans and gives recognition to members of our Armed Forces for heroism in aerial flight. This legislation could not be more important as there is no national memorial for these brave men and women. I believe that it is our duty to properly honor our heroes for their service. In addition to its bipartisan support. this legislation also has the backing of countless veterans and military organizations. including the Distinguished Flying Cross Society. the Military Officers Association of America. the Air Force Association. the Air Force Sergeants Association. the Association of Naval Aviation. and the Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association. I was proud to introduce this legislation with my Republican colleague from the Inland Empire. Representative KEN CALVERT. and hope we can continue to work together on issues such as this because our region has deep military roots. I would also like to express my gratitude to California Senators BARBARA BOXER and DIANNE FEINSTEIN. along with Senator BILL NELSON of Florida. who introduced the Senate version of this bill. Lets honor these heroes. Mr. Speaker. and pass the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. it has been 4 years since the recession ended. yet economic growth is still anemic. job creation remains sluggish. and wages are flat. With each passing day. countless Americans feel they are falling further behind. In these difficult times. working families shouldnt need to fear yet another regulatory scheme that will make it more difficult to rebuild their retirement savings. That is why I support the Retail Investor Protection Act. legislation that will force the Department of Labor to hit the brakes on sweeping changes to the way workers save for retirement. For many Americans. investing in a retirement plan can be confusing and. frankly. intimidating. Workers want to know their hardearned dollars are managed wisely and in a way that could lead to financial security in their retirement years. Investment professionals provide a crucial service to those who want to plan for their retirement yet lack the time and expertise to manage an investment portfolio. All investment advisers should be well trained. adhere to the highest ethical standards. and promote the best interests of their clients. Rules governing the actions of particular investment advisers. also known as fiduciaries. have helped provide workers with certainty for decades. However. since 2010. the Labor Department has tried to expand the definition and duties of a fiduciary and. in the process. diminished that certainty. While we support looking for ways to modernize current fiduciary regulations. the Departments recent proposal threatens to drive up costs. restrict investment opportunities. and harm efforts to educate workers about responsible retirement planning. Despite bipartisan concerns. Department officials are still pursuing this flawed approach behind closed doors. H.R. 2374 will force the Department of Labor to abandon this misguided effort and help ensure any future attempt to redefine \"fiduciary\" promotes the retirement security of Americas workers. I want to thank Representative WAGNER. Chairman HENSARLING. and members of the House Financial Services Committee for their strong bipartisan leadership on this important issue.

The Department of Labors efforts to redefine the fiduciary standards is classic Washington. It is a solution in search of a problem. The DOL has yet to present tangible evidencebeyond anecdotesthat workers are being hurt by current law. nor has the Department conducted a sufficient costbenefit analysis. This is not to say that the fiduciary standards must never be changed. All of us. Republicans and Democrats. want to strengthen workers retirement security and perhaps need to modernize the longstanding fiduciary standard. but instead of working with Congress. the Department of Labor has singlemindedly pursued a course that would actually drive up the cost of retirement planning and restrict access to important investment advice. Millions of Americans could potentially be left to prepare for retirement on their own. How on Earth could this be a good thing? The 2007 recession wreaked havoc on the retirement savings of American workers. We should work together on responsible solutions that will help workers enjoy their retirement years with financial security and peace of mind. I am privileged to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. Employment. Labor. and Pensions. and that is precisely what we are trying to do in the area of multiemployer pension reform. The subcommittee has convened numerous bipartisan hearings to closely examine the problems plaguing the multiemployer pension system and potential solutions. In fact. we held such a hearing earlier today. Will we all agree on every point? Of course not. However. we remain committed to working together on real solutions that will promote the best interests of American families. I hope the Department of Labor will reconsider its illconceived approach to revising Federal fiduciary standards and work with Congress. interested stakeholders. and other Federal agencies to strengthen the retirement security of hardworking Americans. Until the Department does what is right and changes course. I urge my colleagues to support the Retail Investor Protection Act.",

    "speech": "I thank the ranking member for yielding and for all her hard work. and I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2374. The bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct yet another costbenefit analysis of a fiduciary duty rule. apparently in the attempt and hope of derailing a new fiduciary duty rule to protect consumers. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already completed a lengthy study on whether or not to propose a fiduciary duty rule for brokers. That study included an extensive costbenefit analysis. So. my colleagues. outside of trying to derail a new consumer safeguard. what could possibly be the purpose of requiring the SEC to do yet another costbenefit analysis on the exact same issue again? How about we just take the first one and make two copies? The rule also prohibits the Labor Department from even proposing a rule until 60 days after the SEC finalizes its final rule. And what is the harm. my colleagues. in allowing an agencyin this case. the Labor Departmentto release the proposed rule for public discussion. for public input? Since when has Congress been afraid of a debate? If my colleagues believe that the proposed rule gets it wrong. then they have every opportunity to say so. as does the public. as do businesses. and that is exactly what the public comment period is for. That is what happened the last time the Labor Department proposed a fiduciary rule. there were questions raised. They have recalled it to reconsider it. and they are withdrawing that proposal and working on a new one. If the SEC has a better idea for a fiduciary duty rule. then lets debate that one and have that released. but preventing an agency from even putting out a regulatory proposal for public debate is flatout dead wrong. This bill would delay and possibly derail important rulemaking at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department to protect retirement security and investor protection rights. This is a transparent attempt to slow down the rulemaking process and possibly derail the whole rulemaking process for protections for consumers. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to vote \"no.\"",

President Obama is choosing the wrong locals to support. With this vote. Congress approves the arming and training of the Free Syrian Army. which is riddled with radical Muslims. In short. we may again be arming insurgents who will end up our enemy. We are told that the Free Syrian Army has been vetted and that we can trust them. This is wishful thinking. not realistic planning. The President wants to send more equipment and supplies and weapons to the Kurds. That is certainly a good concept. but proposes to send our assistance via the Iraqi Government in Baghdad. Rest assured. Baghdad will pass on whatever it doesnt want to keep for itself. And remember. they wasted most of what we have already given them. Arming radical Islamists is bad enough. depending on Baghdad to distribute our military equipment to the right people makes even less sense. We should arm the Kurds directly. then. instead of relying on an unknown and perhaps radical force. we should instead reach out to the Assad regime and enlist his support in a fight against the common enemy. Perhaps we should consult President Putin in Russia about this issue rather than consult the mullahs in Iran. The Presidents proposal will not work. I will not support it.

Earlier this summer. I served as a member of the VA Conference Committee. My fellow conferees and I were able to work together and again prove that helping vets is not political or partisan. it is American. When that legislation was signed into law. I said it was the first step toward reforming the VA. Todays legislation is yet another step in the right direction. H.R. 5404 would extend the number of important veterans service programs to vets in rural areas. homeless vets. vets with mental illness. all in an effort to improve their quality of life. Of the 8 million veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. roughly 3 million live in rural areas. These vets live 30 or more miles from their nearest VA and must travel long distances to receive care. This legislation would give more funding to VSOs to drive their vets to doctors appointments. increasing their access to care. This bill also funds programs to help our homeless veterans get back on their feet and reduce the number of homeless veterans. It also helps to fund job training. counseling. and placement services for those vets so they can find a goodpaying job. Additionally. and just as importantly. this bill also addresses suffering from mental health issues. This legislation will help fund programs to help vets with mental illness with greater outreach. rehabilitation services. care. and treatment.

Mr. Speaker. it is no secret that VA has a poor track record in managing major medical facility projects. Major construction projects are routinely completed years late and tens of millions of dollars over budget. Unfortunately. the critically needed VA hospital being constructed in Aurora. Colorado. for instance. has run into major problems. as have a handful of others around the country. This legislation would direct the inclusion of an outside entity. the Army Corps of Engineers. which has a record of ontime. onbudget completion of projects. to assist in the management of VAs major facility construction efforts. No longer can veterans afford to wait years for needed facilities to open. This bill finally would move VA away from the status quo. which clearly has not served veterans or the taxpayers well at all. I would like to commend my colleague and friend. Representative MIKE COFFMAN. and applaud his leadership on this important issue. With that. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased that we are bringing up a bill that I introduced. along with the chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. Representative COFFMAN. This bill takes aim at two of the VAs most chronic problems: accountability and efficiency. It is also an attempt to make real reforms in the VA construction process. This bill may not have all the answers. but it is a step forward in a discussion we must have on addressing the facility needs of the VA and ensuring that we are addressing the access requirements in a timely and costeffective manner. We have seen time and again how VA has underperformed in the management of its multibilliondollar construction budgets. Last year. the Government Accountability Office testified to the committee on a number of significant cost overruns and completion delays. There may be some disagreement on the metrics and the magnitude of VA shortcomings in this areaand I do wish to note that VA has made steps in the right directionbut in the end. we are faced with a very real issue that VA needs additional expertise with construction management and the acquisition of major medical facilities. I believe that asking the Army Corps of Engineers to provide the expertise they have to the VA is a step we should explore. I am hopeful that we will pass this bill today and continue the discussion with the members of this committee. the VA. and the Army Corps of Engineers. This legislation shows what we can do by working across the aisle. It would codify some of the GAO recommendations from 2013. as well as other industry best practices. H.R. 3593 would also provide technical assistance to the VA in the form of special project managers and design construction evaluations on. particularly. troubled major construction projects. While I recognize the Corps of Engineers and VA have some reservations with the bill. I believe we can work within the confines of the legislative language to ensure a positive outcome for all parties. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3593 as part of our role as watchdogs on behalf of veterans and taxpayers. I reserve the balance of my time.",

You have too much to drink and you write a bad check. Part of being a commander and a first sergeant is the paternalistic aspect of the job. How many of us have made mistakes at 18? Instead of going to college. you are going into a military unit. You bounce four or five checks. Has that ever happened? Under this proposed system. the military commander no longer has the ability to deal with it in the unit. He sends that case off to Washington. The ability to give an article 15a lesser punishmentis taken off the table. So we are taking an 18yearolds mistake and potentially turning it into a felony. Does that help sexual assaults? Our commanders can send you to your death. but we dont trust them to deal with manslaughter cases? All I can tell you is that for 30 years I have been a practicing military lawyer. From my point of view. our commanders take the responsibility to impose discipline incredibly seriously. They are skilled men and women. We have let the soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines down when it comes to sexual assault. All of us are to blame in the military. We are going to fix that. But the problem. my colleagues. is not the military justice system. We dont have a military justice system where commanders say to the lawyers: Go to hell. we are not going to deal with that. That is not the way it works. This new proposed system takes a portion of offenses out of the purview of the commander and sends them to somebody in Washington whom nobody in that unit will ever get to see. That will delay justice. and it will take tools off the table to make sure that is an effective fighting force in terms of dealing with the barracks thief. in terms of dealing with the bounced check. but it will also take young people who make mistakes and put them in an arena where the only avenue is to potentially charge them with a felony.",

Unfortunately. while so many of my colleagues across the aisle talk about the need to address our debt to avoid burdening future generations. too many of these same Senators refuse to take action to address the climate debt we are passing on. Most frustrating of all. we know what can be done to fix this problem. We know the solutions to reduce pollution and emissions that cause climate change create goodpaying jobs. Jobs that put money back in families pockets through lowcost energy sources and increased efficiencies in homes. These solutions make our Nation more energy independent. and our businesses more globally competitive. They give us cleaner air and water. and protect the health of our children and grandchildren. I know that we can take these steps because I have seen it in my home State of Washington. In Washington. our biodiesel producers are replacing imported oil with clean. renewable. homegrown fuels. Companies like McKinstry. who have made a home in the Northwest. are leaders in helping cities. hospitals. and others create energy efficient. sustainable buildings. In the past. the United States has led the world in innovative ways to create energy. but recently we have ceded our clean energy leadership to countries like China and Germany because too many have stood in the way of making necessary investments. When we passed the Bipartisan Budget Act this past December. we proved that Democrats and Republicans can put ideology aside and work together to make progress on our Nations challenges. Climate change is no less a challenge than any of the other issues we face. and we have a moral obligation to address it. As I have said. addressing this challenge will create goodpaying jobs here at home in fields like pollution management. energy efficiency. and renewable energy goods. And best of all. we can pass a healthier planet on to our children. Im hopeful that Republicans and Democrats can find common ground and come together to move us forward.",

A bullet struck his left leg below the calf. And as the group tried to run away. Lawrence heard a scream and turned around to see his friend. Hadiya Pendleton. falling to the ground. Hadiyas murder has become a rallying cry in Chicago to give law enforcement the tools they need to reduce gang and gun violence.

I just feel like its just the right thing.\" In a community torn apart by gang violence. it is not always easy to do the right thingor to always know what the right thing is in the first place. That is what makes groups like the Boy Scouts and other community youth groups so important in a holistic antigang violence strategy. I am proud to join the Boy Scouts of America in honoring Lawrence Sellers.

Even if a conference committee has not been formed. there are discussions that go on. Then. eventually. there will be a conference committee. and things work out. but it doesnt necessarily mean that nothing is happening. I think things are happening. I think they are working on solutions. We have to have a solution at some point in time. and thats happening. This resolution provides for an open rule to allow all Members to offer their ideas and to debate them through regular order. Two underlying bills fund necessary programs that train. equip. house. and support the brave men and women who sacrificially defend our freedoms. and the bills also support their families. Our debt of gratitude to these individuals does not expire when they retire. as the legislation also funds important programs to provide benefits and medical care for our veterans. Additionally. the legislation equips our Coast Guard and supports the individuals who guard our borders. secure our airports and seaports. and who respond to natural disasters. However. we would be doing a great disservice. Mr. Speaker. to future generations if we were to fail to consider the effect our current spending will have on the future fiscal health and safety our Nation. For that reason. these bills reduce costs. require the coordination of medical care and ensure the efficient operation of those critical programs so that we may continue to support those who protect us. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this rule and in the passage of the underlying bills.",

I would like to thank all of the outstanding staffs for putting together a really good bipartisan bill. Its an important bill. and I know how hard you worked together to produce a really good product. and we thank you. This bill does represent a reasonable approach and continues a long commitment to our veterans and our military facilities. It continues the bipartisan tradition of providing funding levels that Members on both sides of the aisle could agree are appropriate while avoiding contentious legislative riders that complicate passage. However. the Republican majoritys refusal to go to conference to forge a bipartisan agreement on the budget resolution is really unacceptable. This imperils this years appropriations process. making it nearly impossible to move all 12 bills. Instead. it is likely that we will consider in the full House only a few bills with reasonable allocations. including MilConVA. while others are left in limbo indefinitely until we pass a continuing resolution. I am optimistic that this bill has a good chance of enactment as long as we dont attach any controversial riders. but other important priorities will assuredly suffer. While veterans programs are exempt from sequestration. $73.3 billion provided in the bill largely mirrors the administrations request and does not reflect sequestration even for the portions of the bill that were not exempted. In fact. the differences between this bill and the administrations request are relatively small: an adjustment of $1.05 billion. due to bid savings and other project adjustments. and the misguided decision not to provide $185 million for the requested 2014 civilian pay raise. If the MilConVA bill assumes the sequester cuts have been replaced. why cant we join with the administration and the Senate and assume it will be addressed for the other bills? On a positive note. this bill would better support our female veterans who are struggling with the trauma of sexual assault and would support those in need of prosthetics.

While Congress is stuck on certain areas. this bill takes a bipartisan step forward in defense of our country and in service to our veterans. This bill says \"yes\" in a bipartisan manner to meet our Department of Defense infrastructure needs and to properly care for those who have served us so well. our veterans. The bill spends a little bit less than the President asked for and a little bit more than last year. Projects that are not justifiable are removed. but others receive increases. The bill also pushes forward. as weve heard. a seamless transition of care when our warfighters leave active service by integrating their medical records and expeditiously dealing with a very serious claims backlog. I am pleased as well that my colleagues have continued funding for the headquarters construction of the United States Strategic Command. STRATCOM is an important force in protecting our Nation from nuclear threats. Madam Chair. we need to continue to work hard and smart to reduce budgets while also delivering essential policy services that are necessary and fundamental at the Federal level.

I rise today in qualified support of the fiscal year 2014 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. I want to thank Chairman CULBERSON and Ranking Member BISHOP for their leadership and commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for a cordial. timely. and deliberative process. I have to caution. however. that this bills relatively generous allocation must be viewed in the context of the overall fiscal year 2014 appropriations process. To get workable allocations for the two appropriations bills we will consider this week. the majority has drastically underfunded other critical appropriations bills. from educational research. to health care. to repairing and maintaining our Nations crumbling infrastructure. Earlier today. I joined with many colleagues to vote against the rule providing for consideration of the bill before us. because the resolution requires this body to carry out the fiscal year 2014 appropriations process within the framework of the socalled \"Ryan budget.\" which doubles down on sequestration and will have devastating consequences as our Nation continues its economic recovery. So the overall appropriations process is in deep trouble. But the bill before us gives the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs adequate resources to address several critical challenges faced by our military and veterans community. Im particularly pleased the bill would fully fund the Presidents request for military construction projects at Fort Bragg. which is adjacent to my district. The bill also provides critical funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs to assure that those who have served our country receive the benefits and services that they need and deserve. Our subcommittee paid particular heed to the ongoing disabilities claims backlog issue at the VA. The bill provides nearly $300 million for the continued implementation of electronic management systems and improved processing of both new and existing claims. Im also pleased the bill provides robust funding for medical and prosthetic research. suicide prevention and mental health treatment. addressing unacceptable levels of unemployment among veterans. and pressing to end veteran homelessness.",

Madam Chairwoman. this bill includes almost $10 billion for critical military construction projects. as well as imperative funding for the NATO Security Investment Fund. Our bill fully funds the fiscal year 2014 National Guard and Reserve construction programs as requested. by the way. as well as fully funding the family housing construction program. The bill also includes $55.6 billion in fiscal year 2015 advanced appropriations for VA medical care. the level approved in the House budget resolution and the same. by the way. as was actually requested. This bill provides targeted funding for various information technology programs to ensure that the VA can tackle the enormous backlog of compensation claims. something that this chair and Chairman ROGERS have already talked about. These funds will provide the resources that the VA indicates it requires to meet its goals of ending the disability compensation claims backlog by 2015. Additionally. it includes stringent reporting requirements for the VA so the Members of Congress and the American people can have direct oversight on the progress of the claims backlog. The committee also included report language to address the issue of prescription painkiller abuse. This important bill also funds critical programs like the American Battle Monuments Commission. the United States Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims. as well as cemeterial expenses. including Arlington National Cemetery.

I rise today to talk about an issue that maybe is unknown to many Members and many citizens but should be known. which is the reduction of forcesthe reduction in the capability of our military services across all branches. across the whole spectrumand how that process is going. It has been my studied opinion at this point that the process is what we should discuss at this timea process that has lacked transparency. a process that has lacked deliberation. Now. while it is this Members belief that the chiefs at the DOD are under significant pressure from an administration to defend this Nation. they are also under significant pressure to make cuts. not only to make those cuts. but to make those cuts in a very particular way. That is part of the discussion todaythe cuts to the reserve forces. Before I recognize some of my colleagues. I just want to provide from the Joint Chiefs the definition of the operational reserve. which is your Guard and Reserve: As such. the services organize. resource. equip. train. and utilize their Guard and Reserve components to support mission requirements This is important: to the same standards as their Active components. To the same standards. which is interesting to me because some of the recent reports and quotes that I have heard are things like it is structured to be complementary. and capabilities in its three components are not interchangeable. So that statement flies in the face of the original definition of what Guard and Reserve forces do. And things like saying that Guard and Reserve members only train 39 days a year. which. again. I think the Chiefs are under considerable pressure. DOD is fighting for its lifenot among its members but. in my opinion. against an administration. and they are doing what they have to do. I am an Army soldier. I joined an Army of one. not an Army of some of us get this and some of us get that. We all do the same work together at the same level. and that is the expectation. as it should be. But that is what we are going to discuss for the next hour. At this time.

Weve done a number of projects with the earthmoving side of this thing. working in conjunction with dredge contractors. Ive been up and down every mile of this river for decades now. Ive watched what theyre doing. They would never let a private interest do what they are doing. They wouldnt let a public interest do what they are doing. Only the Corps of Engineers can do what theyre doing. And Ive not reviewed these numbers closely. but I did hear that it could be a 300 percent increase in the cost. Id like to look at it more closely. Im pretty confident King Construction can bid that substantially cheaper. However. were not in the business of advocating what we do here in this Congress. The Corps of Engineers has often put out numbers that have been much higher than the actual cost necessary. And its pretty simple to me that if you could see what I saw last week. a 20inch pipe pumping out water and dredge spoil thats churned up by the beater effect of the dredge. pumping that out into the middle of the river where the sediment. the heavy stuff drops out right away. it starts to fill the channel. The lighter stuff goes down the river and gets settled out. And then the river has to be dredged again by putting that sediment into the river. It ends up having to be treated. Theres plenty of places for them to do this. They are contradicting their own policy. And so I urge the adoption of this amendment. and lets hold the Corps of Engineers accountable the same way they hold everyone else accountable.",

The amendment is not in order under section 3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5. 113th Congress. which states: It shall not be in order to consider an amendment to a general appropriation bill proposing a net increase in budget authority in the bill unless considered en bloc with another amendment or amendments proposing an equal or greater decrease in such budget authority pursuant to clause 2(f) of rule XXI. The amendment proposes a net increase in budget authority in the bill in violation of such section. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that this amendment has costs associated with it. The Corps current pricing policy is based upon \"updated cost of storage\" which reflects todays value (indexed to current price levels) rather than at the original construction cost price level. So reverting to construction cost levels will unavoidably have a cost. with the net effect of increasing the level of budget authority in the bill. Under section 3(d)(3). an increase in budget authority must be accompanied by an equal or greater decrease. This amendment does not contain an equal or greater decrease. and so violates section 3(d)(3). I ask for a ruling from the Chair. The Acting CHAIR. Does any Member wish to be heard on the point or order? If not. the Chair is prepared to rule. The gentleman from New Jersey makes a point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma violates section 3(d)(3) of House Resolution 5.

    "speech": "In a couple of hours we will vote on whether to begin debate on our plan to keep loan rates low for students for an additional year. Last month Republican obstruction forced interest rates to double from 3.4 percent to 6 percent for about 7 million college students. If we fail to roll back this increase. those students will each pile on lots of new debt to get a college education. These rates will be particularly harmful to low- and middleincome families that rely on these Federal loans more than anyone else. We have the Pell grants. which go to lowincome people. but people who are middle class have to do these loans. schools have become so expensive. States have cut back on the support they give to colleges. so this is a very difficult situation. Students shouldnt suffer because some Senators are standing in the way of that compromise. That is why we have proposed a 1year extension of last years 3.4 percent rate. We dont want it to double. The extension will allow us to craft a longterm solution to mounting college debt without harming students in the short term. However. a number of Senators met at my direction this morning at 9 oclock. and there is progress being made. Maybe we can come up with a compromise. It will be imperfect. like a lot of things that happen legislatively. but it will be a way for us to move forward. The meeting went very well. It was done in Senator DURBINS office. Democrats and Republicans attended that meeting. I think we are making some progress.",

This bill has been described as belonging to one party or the other. and that is wrong. Senator BURR. Senator ALEXANDER. Senator COBURN. Senator KING. Senator CARPER. and I sat down and looked at how we could fix something. We looked at it from the standpoint that this deadline has hit. One year ago we extended it. They said it was the political atmosphere and we had to extend it. We knew that year would come and. similar to everything else that has happened here for the last 2 or 3 years. nothing gets done. We just said: Enough is enough. It has to be fixed. and if we want to fix it. to understand the program. we have to look at the whole program. I think now they are making accusations that students are paying profits so we can pay down the debt. Whether there is profit built in depends on the accounting procedures used by our Federal Government. It was built in. You can blame whomever you want to blame. but it is built into it. We have to deal with the facts in front of us. What I would ask the Senator. all of us have agreed in a bipartisan manner that no profit will be made on the backs of students. what we can determine through the bill we are working on. right?",

So if it is at 3.66 this year and I am able to qualify and I am subsidized at $3.500 of a subsidized loan the taxpayer will be paying. that 3.66 is fixed for the full life of the loan.

I might be poor. but I cant make it on just what you give me because I am poor. I have to have a little more help. Then. on top of that. I want to go to graduate school after I get my college degree. So then I am at 6.8 again. Ours brings it down to 5.21. which is more savings. which I know the Senator agrees to. If I may ask my colleague from Tennessee. right now we know we have a consolidated cap at 8.25 percent. Lets say I graduate and I went to school during the high recession times. At the end.

If for some reason 10 years from now somebody got out of school and their combined interest rate was 9 percent. we give them the option of going back to 8.25. I think the Senator from West Virginia made an extremely good point. For the most subsidized students. they can only borrow $3.500. Think of the institutions that are out therenone of them have an annual tuition of $3.500. We know they are going to borrow out of the 6.8percent pot. What we are offering is that the pots are the same and that the subsidy is thatfor students who qualify for the subsidythey are not responsible for the interest rate while they are in school.

Since its founding by German settlers in 1863. the church has served as a center of faith and community. E1704 The founding families of Saint Peter Lutheran Church of Afton held tightly to their faith and. as their numbers grew. they recruited a travelling missionary. Reverend Horst. to conduct services from the homes of worshipers. Shortly thereafter another clergyman. Pastor Rolf. took over duties. regularly travelling 15 miles from Saint Paul by foot to preside over the parish. On December 27th. 1863. the congregation was formally organized into the \"The Evangelical Lutheran Saint Peters Church of Afton Township. Washington County. Minnesota.\" During the next two years. three acres of land were purchased and on it built the first church from a reconstructed mill that had been abandoned in the area. The first service in the new Saint Peters church was held on August 12. 1865 and it stood intact for nearly sixty years. Ultimately. the original structure was converted into a schoolhouse in 1898 and a replacement church was erected beside it. both remaining until they burned down in 1924. The following year saw the completion of a replacement building on the grounds. today known as the old church. Saint Peter Lutheran Church continues to play a central role in the lives of many Afton families. serving both spiritual and physical needs. Through its strong support of local food shelves and clothing drives. the congregation is directly helping to feed and clothe families in need. The congregations growth is a tribute to the generosity and commitment of six generations who have built on the foundation laid by those early German settlers. Saint Peter Lutheran Church has blessed the Afton area with its dedication to good deeds for 150 years. Mr. Speaker. in honor of the 150th Anniversary of Saint Peter Lutheran Church of Afton.

I believe it is important that Congress works together to give Michigan residents certainty and stability in their healthcare choices while the Administration works out the problems in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I want to emphasize my support for health care reform. I voted for this important law in 2010. and have voted 40 times against efforts to repeal and dismantle health care reform. However. many of my constituents have called my office confused by the cancellation letters sent by insurers. Compounding this confusion is the ongoing technology glitches that are keeping people from signing up on the exchanges and learning about new options for health insurance. At a time when too many Michigan families are still struggling economically. it is important that we keep our promises that the law would allow you to keep your insurance and doctor if you want to. The President announced his plan to grandfather in health care plans that have been recently canceled. but I believe that Congress must also vote to support that decision legislatively. I believe that this temporary. one year extension of health care plans is necessary while people can get the information they need to make the right choices for their family on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. I support the Presidents requirement to have insurers disclose better information about these grandfathered plans and new plans that might be available. That is why I also joined in sending a letter to Secretary Sebelius stating that we must require insurers to explain to policyholders what benefits they would be losing under the grandfathered plans. and the tax credits and subsidies they could be eligible for in the new insurance marketplace. We must ensure that insurance companies provide a clear explanation when any future changes to plans are not a requirement of the Affordable Care Act. As I have always said. I am willing to work in order to make improvements to ACA as they are needed. Clearly a fix is needed to ensure that people can keep their insurance if they like it. It is important that we work together to give certainty on this issue. and Congress should pass a bipartisan bill to achieve this goal.",

H.R. 3530 is a comprehensive. multipronged approach to address the problem of human trafficking in the United States. The sponsor of this legislation. Congressman TED POE. is a friend. colleague. and kindred spirit to me on the issue of human trafficking. As a former judge. Congressman POE has drawn from his experience on the bench to craft a bill that would provide support and aid to victims of trafficking. as well as training for law enforcement and other first responders. Madam Speaker. H.R. 3530 is one of the most comprehensive and inclusive human trafficking bills proposed to date. H.R. 3530 provides grants to help State and local governments offer services to victims in order to give the survivors of human trafficking the sanctuary and counseling they so desperately need after suffering through and surviving this brutal crime. Perhaps most importantly. H.R. 3530 addresses the demand side of human trafficking by clarifying that buyers should be prosecuted along with pimps. Madam Speaker. for too long those who patronize child prostitutes have been overlooked. H.R. 3530 encourages law enforcement to target and punish persons who purchase elicit sexual activities from trafficking victims not as petty criminals but as serious offenders. the serious offenders that they are. For these reasons and others. Madam Speaker. I support H.R. 3530. the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.",

I am a proud cosponsor of this bill because I know it will play a vital role in our fight against child trafficking. First. I would like to commend Judge POE for offering the bill and for his ongoing commitment to end child trafficking and fighting for victim rights. I would also like to commend Chairman GOODLATTE. the ranking member. and Representative MALONEY for their long work on this issue. and in the case of Representative MALONEY. she has worked on this issue for many. many years. Unfortunately. hundreds of thousands of American children are trafficked each year. Our kids are robbed of their innocence and coerced into a life on the streets where they are repeatedly abused. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will provide muchneeded grants to help provide necessary services to prevent exploitation and rebuild the lives of trafficking survivors. Specifically. the grants will be used to establish a variety of new programs. such as education. housing. job training. and placement for survivors. victims services programs. such as a 24hour emergency social service response system and counseling. and specialized training programs for law enforcement officers. first responders. health care officials. and child welfare officials. Innovative and specialized courts with wraparound services like the STAR Court in Los Angeles County. which specifically focuses on girls and boys who are trafficked. will also be eligible for the grant funding. By reinvigorating the Crime Victims Fund. this bill also helps survivors recover from their trauma and develop normal. productive lives. Furthermore. the bill tackles demand by holding the buyers accountable for their actions. No longer will the perpetrators get away without a serious punishment to fit their crime. I personally refuse to call them \"johns.\" a term which provides cover. Instead. they are child abusers who are committing rape. This bill will help to ensure their charges reflect the horrific nature of child trafficking. Lastly. this bill will help protect our foster kids.

I rise today in support of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. H.R. 3530. and commend my colleague. Representative TED POE. for introducing this critical legislation. I am a proud cosponsor of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act because it represents an allencompassing approach to combating the scourge of human trafficking. It amends the Federal criminal code to impose penalties for crimes involving trafficking and preemptively provides for deterrence by reallocating existing grants for victim support. It affords additional enforcement and prosecution mechanisms for authorities fighting against traffickers. Nearly 150 years ago. Congress ratified the 13th Amendment. setting in stone these timeless words: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Today. human trafficking is modernday slavery. It is a global crisis that victimizes an estimated over 20 million children and women worldwide. Yet \"global\" doesnt just mean overseas. Human trafficking remains prevalent here in the United States in our cities and our communities. Our country is the second highest destination for women trafficked worldwide. An estimated 100.000 children are trafficked here every year. In my home State of Illinois. the National Human Trafficking Resource Center estimates that 25.000 women and girls are exploited by sex trafficking every single year. This number continues to grow. As a member of the Congressional Human Trafficking Task Force. we are working to coordinate the efforts of the congressional leadership and international antitrafficking groups to punish perpetrators. rescue and bring hope to victims. and assist nations in their fight against the global epidemic of trafficking in human beings. Human trafficking targets the most vulnerable in society. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act reflects a comprehensive effort to strengthen opposition against culprits and offer hope to victims. I support this bill and urge its passage.",

Human trafficking. which includes labor and sex trafficking. is the secondlargest and fastestgrowing criminal industry in the world. Trafficking may seem like an international problem. but there are 300.000 children at risk of sex trafficking here in the U.S. The State of Indiana has formed a cutting edge. antitrafficking task force that involves both public and private groups. This task force. called IPATH. has investigated more than 200 cases in Indiana. and continues to rescue children and adults from involuntary servitude in commercial sex trafficking. Great work is being done in the Hoosier State. but antitrafficking advocates agree that much more is needed. That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act and proud to support the bills being voted on today. This bill will provide law enforcement with necessary tools to address the problem of trafficking by helping tackle the demand issue itself and improve services for survivors. It also protects foster children by requiring that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children be notified when children are missing from foster homes or child care institutions. Madam Speaker. protecting people trapped in trafficking situations is not a partisan or a political issue. It is not an issue that only happens overseas. It happens on American soil. and it happens every day all across this country.

Her organization gives hope and opportunity to women and girls who are at risk or have been forced into the commercial sex trade in India. Women helped by Rahabs Rope in India have the opportunity to produce items that are then sold at the organizations store in Gainesville. Proceeds from those sales go to help even more women and girls in India. The Rahabs Rope store also serves the important function of raising awareness of the sex trade in India and worldwide.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today Senator MERKLEY and I are introducing the Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act. This legislation enables the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reinvest recreation fees to improve facilities where the funds are collected. Our bill creates an incentive for the Corps to maintain good facilities and provide quality recreational opportunities on our public lands. The Corps currently collects recreation fees at many sites. This legislation would not change the way the Corps determines use fee rates. Existing law provides that users of specialized sites. facilities. equipment. or services provided by Federal expense shall be assessed fair and equitable fees. Section 210 of the Flood Control Act of 1968 also provides that no entrance fees shall be charged by the Corps. Our bill is not intended to and does not make any changes in that regard. In Arkansas. recreation on our public Corpsoperated lands is an important driver of economic activity. job opportunities. and tourism. In fiscal year 2012. over $4.2 million in revenue was collected at Corps recreation sites in Arkansas. When citizens spend money at Corps recreation sites in Arkansas. Oregon. or other States. many of them expect that their money will be invested onsite to improve facilities and create recreation opportunities. Our bill would ensure those expectations are met. The Corps of Engineers Recreation Improvement Act would also enable the Corps to participate in the interagency America the Beautiful Pass program to allow customers an alternative payment option at sites where entrance or amenity fees are charged. This includes the distribution and sale of the passes and the retention of a portion of the revenue for the sales of those passes. It would also allow the Corps to distribute Military Passes. This will make it easier for our men and women in uniform and their families to acquire passes. The Corps currently honors these passes but the Corps is not allowed to distribute the passes.

    "speech": "applauds your efforts to support our small businesses which make up the backbone of the American economy. As a regional economic development organization promoting North Louisiana. NLEP often works with businesses impacted by natural or manmade disasters. The impact of these disasters can temporarily or permanently shut down small businesses. leaving both small business owners and their employees without a livelihood. The SBA disaster programs offer a real lifeline to these impacted businesses which have very few options available to them. The proposed amendment to Section 1 of the bill regarding collateral for business disaster loans would allow more small businesses to utilize the disaster loan programs. If approved. small business owners would no longer have to use their primary residence as collateral toward a SBA disaster business loan of less than $200.000. if other assets are available. During a widespread disaster. the primary residence of business owners may also be impacted and requiring them to use their home as collateral would create an onerous burden and/or be financially unfeasible. Eliminating this collateral requirement opens up assistance to those businesses most impacted by disaster. speeding recovery for businesses and a regions economy. The second proposed change to Section 2 of the Small Business Act would allow Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) to provide technical assistance to impacted small businesses beyond the current 250 mile limitation. The Louisiana Small Business Development Centers (LSBDCs) have successfully worked with countless small businesses devastated by Hurricanes Katrina. Rita. Gustav and Ike. and most recently the BP oil spill. The experience and expertise that the LSBDC could have shared with the SBDCs in the New York and New Jersey area would have enhanced their capabilities to cope with Superstorm Sandy. In times of disaster. it is essential to collaborate and pool resources in order to speed up delivery of much needed assistance. For these reasons. the North Louisiana Economic Partnership fully endorses the proposed amendments to the current SBA legislation that would open up. enhance and efficiently deliver disaster assistance to small businesses.

WIC provides care for women with low to medium income. who are pregnant or have a child who is less than five years old. In 1968. CBS aired a documentary titled \"Hunger in America.\" that shed light on widespread malnutrition across low income communities. The following year. the White House formed a council to address the issue and a recommendation stemming from the council was to focus on providing nutritional food and education to low income pregnant women and children. When the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 was amended in 1972. the WIC was authorized as a pilot program for two years. The EOC was one of the agencies participating in the WIC as a pilot program. and they issued the first WIC vouchers in the state of California. In 1975. the EOC established WIC as a permanent program based on the premise that early intervention during critical times of growth and development can help prevent future medical and developmental problems. The Women. Infants. and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program is a federallyfunded health and nutrition program for women who are pregnant. breastfeeding. postpartum and children under 5 years. Throughout the years. the caseload of the EOC WIC has steadily risen to its present high of 37.500 participants. WIC consists of 72 staff members made up of Registered Dieticians. WIC Nutrition Assistants. Local Vendor Liaisons. Breastfeeding peer counselors. and administrative support staff. The goal of WIC is to enhance the quality of life for women. infants and children by providing them with healthy food and the knowledge and opportunity to make healthy choices in an atmosphere of dignity and respect. Women. Infants and Children has provided support for pregnant women. nursing mothers. and children under five years of age and their mothers for nearly 40 years. and they will continue to give them physical aid and knowledge to help improve the quality of their lives.

    "speech": "Another important provision of our legislation addresses the issue of insurance accounting for a small number of nonpublicly traded insurance companies. While every publicly traded company in the United States is required by the Federal Securities laws to prepare consolidated financial statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. GAAP. all insurance companies in the United Stateswhether in mutual or stock form of organizationare required by their State insurance regulators to utilize an accounting method known as Statutory Accounting. Indeed. most mutual insurance companies only use Statutory Accounting in preparing their financial statements. Statutory Accounting Principles. SAP. are generally more conservative than GAAP because they are specifically designed to promote insurer solvency and the ability to pay claims instead of measuring an insurers value as a going concern. SAP does not allow a number of nonliquid or intangible assets to be included on an insurers balance sheet and provides less favorable accounting treatment for certain expenses. In both the text of the DoddFrank Act and its legislative history. Congress recognized the acceptability of SAP for holding companies engaged in insurance activities coming under Federal Reserve jurisdiction. Specifically. Congress 1) directed the Federal Reserve to rely on existing reports and information provided to State and other regulators (which for insurance companies would have been prepared according to SAP). and 2) included Senate report language stating that Federal Reserve assumption of jurisdiction over savings and loan holding companies engaged in the business of insurance did not reflect a mandate to impose GAAP. However. in proposed rulemakings. the Federal Reserve expressed its intention to require all companies to eventually prepare GAAP financial statementsconsistent with their existing model for all bank holding companies. Imposing such a mandate on companies using only SAP would cost insurers a substantial amount to take on multiyear financial projects yielding minimal. if any. supervisory benefit to regulators. S. 2270 makes clear that under Section 171 of the DoddFrank Act and the Home Owners Loan Act. such a mandate is inappropriate where the holding company is a nonpublicly traded insurance company that is only required to prepare and file SAP statements. Nothing in this provision prevents the Federal Reserve from obtaining any information it is otherwise entitled to obtain from a SAPonly insurer.",

Across the United States. newborns are screened routinely for certain genetic. metabolic. hormonal and functional disorders. Most of these birth defects have no immediate visible effects on a baby but. unless detected and treated early. they can cause serious physical problems. developmental disability and. in some cases. death. Fortunately. most infants are given a clean bill of health when tested. In cases where newborns are found to have metabolic disorders or hearing impairment. early diagnosis and proper treatment are crucial in making the difference between healthy development and lifelong infirmity. Newborn screening has been saving lives for more than 50 years. but programs vary from State to State. To address disparity among States newborn screening capabilities. Congress passed the original Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. P.L. 110204. legislation I sponsored with Senator Chris Dodd. The law established national newborn screening guidelines and helped facilitate comprehensive newborn screening in every State in America and the District of Columbia. Before passage. some States offered as few as only four of the recommended tests. and only 11 States and D.C. required the recommended screening for all disorders. Today. 42 States and D.C. require screening for at least 29 of the 31 treatable core conditions. and both parents and physicians are more aware of the availability and necessity of newborn screening. To maintain the important work of newborn screening programs. I am a proud sponsor of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today Senators have finally come together to pass the Death in Custody Reporting Act. which will provide important transparency to law enforcement efforts and our prison system. At a time when our Nation is having an important conversation about police encounters that result in the loss of life. we know that hundreds of policerelated deaths are unaccounted for in Federal statistics. The Death in Custody Reporting Act will require that State and Federal law enforcement officials report deaths in their custody. including those that occur during arrest. The Justice Department will then have the opportunity to analyze the data and see what we can learn from it. The American people deserve as much. Too many communities across our country are losing faith in our justice system. This bill provides a step toward accountability. and it is my hope that it may ultimately lead to restoring some measure of trust in these communities. If we are ever able to truly embody the words engraved in Vermont marble above the United States Supreme Court building. \"Equal Justice Under the Law.\" then more of course must be done. I look forward to continuing these efforts in the next Congress. The prior authorization for the Death in Custody Reporting Act expired in 2006. and after too many years of inaction. I am glad that Democrats and Republicans have come together and sent this reauthorization bill to the President for signature. My appreciation goes to Congressman BOBBY SCOTT. who sponsored and has long championed this legislation. as well Senator RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. who sponsored a Senate version. This has been an important week for transparency. On Monday. the Senate came together to pass my bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act and I hope the House will soon take up this bill. On Tuesday. I spoke on the Senate floor in favor of the release of the executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee Study of the CIAs Detention and Interrogation Program. Both of these actions did not come easily. but in both instances the interests of the American public and our values as a democracy prevailed. Today. we have again come together in the interest of transparency for the betterment of our Nation.",

Marin French Cheese operates in the same location. making it the longest continually operating cheese company in America. The company still creates the same classic styles of Brie and Camembert. crafting cheese in small batches using traditional cultures. coaxing the distinctly coastal California character and flavor into every cheese. An internationally respected cheese maker. Marin French Cheese products have been honored with numerous welldeserved national and international awards over the years.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 2860. the OPM IG Act. which is a successful product of the bipartisan efforts of Federal Workforce Subcommittee Chairman Farenthold and Ranking Member LYNCH. and I applaud them for their efforts. I thank my distinguished colleagues for their work and commitment in sponsoring legislation to provide the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management with critically needed funding to perform audits. investigations. and oversight of OPMs revolving fund activities. Through the revolving fund. OPM provides approximately $2 billion in services to agencies on a feeforservice basis. These services include background investigations. leadership training. and human resource management. H.R. 2860 would fix the loophole in the current law which prevents this $2 billion revolving fund from paying for the costs of the OPM Inspector General to properly oversee the funds activities. This legislation would allow the OPM Inspector General to use a very small portion of the revolving fund budget. up to a maximum of onethird of 1 percent of the fund. to pay for audit. investigative. and oversight work. The recent Navy Yard shooting and the Edward Snowden leaks of classified information have highlighted the importance of comprehensive oversight of the Federal Governments background investigation and security clearance process. During last Junes Federal Workforce Subcommittee hearing on OPMs revolving fund. the OPM Inspector General expressed substantial concerns about the falsification of background investigations. The OPM Inspector General plays a crucial part in ensuring that the background investigation process used by the government to determine whether individuals should be trusted with our Nations classified and sensitive information is properly conducted. This legislation would give the OPM Inspector General the funds and resources needed to conduct the necessary oversight activities to help safeguard our government against national security risks. The Senate has already passed a substantially similar bill. and I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 2860. With that.

Equal Pay Day symbolizes when more than 3 months into the year womens wages finally catch up with what men were paid in the previous year. Its unconscionable that women today continue to be blatantly discriminated against in the workforce in terms of their pay and the treatment that they receive. In 2011. women working full time made only 77 cents to every dollar made by men over the course of a year. The landscape is even worse for women of color. In 2011. African American women earned 64 cents to every dollar earned by white males. and for Latinas it was only 55 cents and 42 cents in my home State of California. On average. the wage gap costs women roughly $11.000 annually. and at this rate the wage gap will not close until 2057. Can you imagine that. 2057? We must support Congresswoman DELAUROS Paycheck Fairness Act. This addresses the serious economic disparities which women still face. Women and their families cannot afford to continue paying the cost of our inaction in the face of injustice. I hope the Speaker will bring this bill to the floor right away.",

Despite the hard work of countless folks to make pay equality a reality. women today still earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men doing the same kind of work.

In 1963. women were earning an average of 59 cents on the dollar compared to men. I rise because today on average women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. In 2013. a study by the United States Census Bureau in Columbus. Ohio. demonstrated that women are paid 81 cents for every dollar paid to men. This amounts to a yearly gap of some $9.261 between men and women who work full time. Equal work? Its simple. It deserves equal pay.

It would also block new and innovative ways to move more people from welfare to work. At a time when Congress confronts so many pressing issues. not the least of which is preventing the misguided cuts in the sequester from hurting our economy. H.R. 890 is a step in the wrong direction. H.R. 890 prevents the administration from pursuing flexible. innovative ways to return people to work. As Health and Human Services Secretary Sebelius informed our committee. \"the Department is providing a very limited waiver opportunity for states that develop a plan to measurably increase the number of beneficiaries who find and hold down a job. Specifically. Governors must commit that their proposals will move at least 20% more people from welfare to work compared to the states past performance.\" The Congressional Research Service (CRS). in reviewing the administrations authority to permit demonstration projects. found that the current waiver initiative is \"consistent\" with prior practice. The CRS review found that dozens of waivers for demonstration projects have been approved in the past when their subject matter has been referenced in Section 402 of the Social Security Act (just as the administration currently proposes). CRS also found nothing in the law bars Secretary Sebelius from providing waivers related to employment activities in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. H.R. 890 seems more focused on politics than on policy. On that basis. and because it would impede progress in helping more welfare recipients move into work. I oppose this legislation.",

It also reauthorizes the TANF program through December 31. 2013. In Texas over 68.000 families receive TANF benefits. TANF is a block grant program to help move recipients into work and turn welfare into a program of temporary assistance. In order to receive the maximum TANF benefit. families must be in compliance with work requirements and no one may remain on TANF for more than 60 months. Federal TANF law requires states to penalize families that fail to meet these requirements. In response to a request from a bipartisan group of governors for more flexibility. the Obama Administration said the federal government would consider waiving existing work participation requirements for states that were experimenting with \"new. more effective ways\" of helping welfare applicants find work. \"particularly helping parents successfully prepare for. find. and retain employment.\" The Administration hasnt gotten rid of the work requirement or laid out a new theory of what it ought to include. It has given states the ability to seek executive branch approval for new methods. This legislation is not needed. for no state has requested a waiver.

In contrast to prior Republican support for such TANF waivers. in contrast to longstanding Republican advocacy for greater state flexibility. and in contrast to the reality that the TANF waivers would actually accelerate job placements and dramatically improve work outcomes. the current Republican rhetoric jettisons past support for state flexibility to improve TANF outcomes and disingenuously charges the Administration with gutting welfare reform. It is in states best interests to improve the work outcomes of their citizens. which is why Republican and Democratic governors have asked for the type of flexibility provided by the Administrations waiver. Under current rules. a state can meet its work requirement even if no recipient finds a job. In contrast. approved demonstration waivers explicitly would focus on improving employment outcomes. Under current rules. states spend very little of their TANF funds on work activities and substantial resources monitoring participation in activities. In contrast. approved demonstration waivers would help states make more effective and efficient use of limited resources. Under current rules. people are discouraged from getting a high school diploma or GED. even though theyre more likely to find good jobs with such education. In contrast. approved demonstration waivers would allow states to focus on building a better skilled workforce. Under current rules. people working in subsidized jobs dont count toward the states work rate. In contrast. Illinois boasted one of the most successful subsidized employment programs in the nation while using TANF Emergency Funds. The program directly placed almost 30.000 unemployed and underemployed adults in jobs that paid approximately $10 per hour. putting almost $9 million dollars into the pockets of hard working Illinoisans and into the economy. Almost 5000 employers in Illinois benefited. Why Republicans would oppose innovative programs to help the unemployed get solid jobs is simply puzzling. Rather than advancing political theatre. the Republicans should be working with Democrats to replace the acrosstheboard spending cuts. strengthen the middle class. create jobs. expand our economy. and responsibly bring down the deficit.

Several states have requested this flexibility. including some states with Republican governors and legislatures. This is a politically disingenuous bill which only prevents Congress from devoting our time to finding actual solutions to lowering our unemployment rate. As a condition of receiving federal TANF funding. states are required to document the number of hours that welfare recipients spend in paid jobs. voluntary work. or other activities directly related to finding employment. Many states have argued that the current laws requirements are onerous and counterproductive to helping welfare recipients find work to lift their families out of poverty. In response to state feedback. the Administration proposed a program to allow states to use alternate. outcomebased measures for job placement. rather than relying solely on numerical work participation standards. This waiver would give states the flexibility needed to improve the effectiveness of TANF programs by focusing on the outcomes that matter to our families. The Administrations waiver program has strict requirements to hold states accountable for making measurable progress in job placement. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 890. which would hinder states autonomy and flexibility in finding solutions that work for their residents.

It seems totally political and completely unnecessary. None of these groups mentioned in this motion to recommit are excluded from receiving TANF benefits. What this is about is not weakening the work requirement. I understand why the administration may want to weaken the work requirement since their record on job creation is so atrocious. But the fact is that States have tremendous flexibility here. Half of the caseload doesnt have to meet the work requirement. They can be engaging in whatever activity or no activity the State determines. The other half has 12 different categories. including vocational training and other job readiness activities. that will qualify as work. This is a straight extension of current law.

Four years. thats how long my constituents and Americans across this country have had to wait for the Senate to perform its most basic function as a legislative body. Before today. the only thing certain was that the Senate would not consider a budget. Today. the Senate Democrats introduced a budget. and Im glad they did. Its about time. Unfortunately. after reviewing their proposal. today the only thing certain is that their budget will never balance. We owe the American people a responsible. balanced budget. The House budget introduced yesterday balances the budget in 10 years. The Senate Democrats proposal never balancesever. A balanced budget will foster a healthier economy and create jobs. Madam Speaker. The American people elected us to lead and put forward solutions. not hide from challenges and posture for the next election.",

In my home State of Georgia. we have come to know Mars as a great place to work through its merger with Wrigley. Since joining the Mars family in 2008. employees at the Wrigley manufacturing plant in Flowery Branch. Georgia. have benefited from being part of the Mars community. Mars employees are given wonderful opportunities for growth and advancement. As a result. the company boasts a low turnover rate. Mars strategies have resulted in diversity that strengthens its business model by mentorship opportunities which are built into the companys structure. including a \"reverse internship\" in which a younger employee introduces an executive to social media. Like Wrigley. Mars is truly an American success story. Mars remains a familyowned company that places high value on its human capital. which it demonstrates through significant investment in its 72.000 employees. Through innovation and creativity. Wrigley continues to identify new markets and growth opportunities. such their new Alert chewing gum line. I want to congratulate the hardworking Mars workforce throughout the United States. and especially the Wrigley employees in Georgia. for building a great company.

    "speech": "I thank you. Congresswoman MALONEY. for the chance to speak about the damage that the Ryan budget would do to women and to families. There are a couple of points. The new Ryan budget and the cuts to discretionary programs and the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid guarantees would disproportionately affect the women and children who are already suffering this year because of the sequestration. The Ryan budget would dismantle the SNAP food program just like it does Medicare. About twothirds of the SNAP benefits go to families with children. They rely on this. The Ryan budget would roll back affordable health care provisions. bringing back genderrating and allowing preexisting conditions like pregnancy and domestic violence. Discretionary spending programs have already seen sequester cuts that will force women and families in need off of programs that help them. The Republican budget would further decimate these programs. The special supplemental nutrition program for Women. Infants and Children. the WIC program. is one of our most successful and essential nutrition programs. Sequester will drop about 600.000 women and children from this program. Under the Republican budget. even more babies and mothers would be kicked off. The new budgets enormous cuts would do even more than the sequester has done to destroy jobs and hurt our economic recovery. At a time when women are making unprecedented gains in higher education and the workforce. a war on jobs is a war on women and their families. A budget is a moral document. and the Ryan budget fails this basic test of morality. This is wrong for women. and it is wrong for families. and we just reject this.

Across the country. one of every five children is at risk of going hungry. In Nevada. more than 233.000 children qualify for free or reduced lunch. That means that 54 percent of Nevadas students come from lowincome households that struggle with hunger. While these children can eat free and reducedprice lunch during the school year. the vast majority are left without adequate nutrition during the summer. The Summer EBT program is a pilot program that helps fill this gap by providing eligible families with additional SNAP benefits during the summer months. It works. In 2012. it served almost 67.000 children who might have otherwise gone hungry. The participation in this program is dramatically higher than in other programs. serving up to 75 percent of eligible children.

The Economic Research Service makes social science inquiries into the nutritional choices of citizens. as well as farmers decisions to participate in risk management programs.

I was disappointed to find that our government has done virtually nothing to update these regulations in the last two decades. APHIS. the agency charged with this responsibility. has not updated the Animal Welfare Act regulations since 1995. and these rules should have been updated 10 years ago. when APHIS opened up a rulemaking process.

We have had no response to that letter. so today. we are offering an amendment to provide APHIS with the funding needed to start that process again and ensure that our regulations for captive orcas and other marine mammals are based on modern science.

That debate came to a head last year in which it was decided that we ought to continue with the longstanding appeal for a Food for Peace program. with some modifications. My concern here with this particular amendment is that it may open the door for a continuation of that debate and ultimately lead to the demise of the P.L. 480 program. which has extraordinary political support as a result of the combination of American farmers. the merchant marine industry. as well as many NGOs around the Nation. I recognize that. in many places. it is necessary to have local purchases of food. and the chairman actually cited a couple of those examples. It turned out that the local purchase of food was accomplished through an existing program that USAID presently has. and that program is the international disaster assistance program. where money is available for the local purchase of food. The bottom line is that this $10 million really doesnt add anything that isnt already available in the current appropriationin the current bill. so I would say lets not go down this road right now.

More importantly. this amendment would use taxpayer dollars to purchase commodities from foreign countries rather than right here at home. Unlike other foreign aid programs. the Food for Peace program is Americanmade through and through. It was designed to take American commodities on American ships overseas to feed those in need. The Food for Peace program supports American agriculture. exports. and jobs while increasing goodwill overseas and helping those in need. The USDA estimates that for every $1 billion in U.S. agricultural exports. 8.400 American jobs are created.

The Distance Learning and Telemedicine program was reduced from FY14enacted levels. and my amendment restores some of the funding to improve access to health care and education for rural areas. Rural areas are typically areas where they have local primary care physicians who perform routine checkups and primary care. But what if a patient requires a specialist or has a more complicated medical condition? My hometown of Yuma. Colorado. is more than 2 hours from a number of specialized medical services. complex trauma centers. or oncology centers.

IS or the Assad regime? I also have very serious reservations about including this expanded military authorization in the continuing resolution. a shortterm funding bill. This authorization raises very serious issues. Make no mistake. It will ultimately involve United States servicemembers. men and women from our cities. towns. and countryside. who will leave their families behind at home. Such a measure deserves consideration in a completely separate resolution. The President should never have asked for such a serious matter to be added to a shortterm spending bill. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment under consideration.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. we will be debating an amendment which would not guard our Nation from terrorist infiltration nor even authorize our Armed Forces to eliminate ISIS personnel. equipment. and bases. Instead. the amendment authorizes President Obama to train and equip. with U.S. weaponry. members of the Syrian mujahideen. the socalled moderate rebels. The amendment states that training and equipment can only be provided to \"vetted\" rebels. but who are those rebels? It says they cant be affiliated with ISIS. alNusra. and al Qaeda. which is good. but it would allow President Obama to arm other Islamist fighters who do not meet the threshold of being terrorists. including Harakat al Hazm fighters from the Muslim Brotherhood. the Syria Revolutionaries Front. and the Army of the Mujahideen. Now. Mujahideen fighters in Syria are not moderates nor are they proAmerican. They will take our arms and use them as they see fit. most likely to fight Assad in pursuit of installing a Sunni sharia state in Syria. They cannot be counted on to vindicate our interests. which is why it is a mistake to subcontract out American national security to Islamist fighters. Half measures like this. will not suffice. There are no shortcuts when it comes to our national defense. So I constantly hear people say that Americans are war weary. and I disagree with that. I think Americans are willing to do what it takes to defend our people and our Nation. I think they are weary of missions launched without a coherent strategy and are sick of seeing engagements that produce inconclusive results rather than clearcut victory. I think they are weary of a President that consistently proves himself unwilling to do what is necessary to win. I have heard some colleagues say that arming the Syrian Mujahideen demonstrates strength and resolve. I think it is evidence of a lack of resolve. The Presidents strategy rests on wishful thinking. It is not sufficient to defeat the Islamic State.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the amendment is to train and equip Syrian rebels. Well. let us see how that has worked in the past when America has trained and equipped individuals. The United States has spent billions of dollars in Iraq to train and equip Iraqi soldiers. The first time they came in contact with the ISIS members. they cut and ran. This is ISIS propaganda that was on the Internet. This is an American tank now in the possession of ISIS when the Iraqis cut and ran. This is a Humvee going through a parade. also. four Humvees that. apparently. have never been used that are now in the possession of ISIS when the Iraqis cut and ran. Now we want to arm Syrian rebels to keep them fighting for America. Well. let us see how that has worked in the past. In September 2013. The Wall Street Journal reported that ISIS raided a Free Syrian Army weapons depot. taking small arms and ammunition provided by the CIA. In December 2013. Free Syrian Army weapons warehoused on the SyrianTurkey border were seized by the Islamic Front. They. like the Iraqis. cannot keep up with American arms. Second. some say in this amendment we will support the Free Syrian Army because they are going to be examined and we will make sure that they are vetted very well. But let us understand and see how that is working out. What is a Free Syrian Army rebel today is an ISIS member tomorrow. It looks like. in December of 2013. Saddam alJamal. the northeast commander of the Free Syrian Army. announced his defection to ISIS and condemned those who worked with the West. A Washington Post article. August 18: A highlevel security commander of ISIS said that there is no more Free Syrian Army in eastern Syria because they have all joinedyesISIS. Isnt that lovely? It is not a good strategic plan to arm Syrian rebels. If ISIS is a national security threat. then relying on rebels in a Syrian civil war will not protect American security interests. The United States should have a strategy to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. but we should have that debate on this House floor and not rely on mercenaries to fight American national security interests somewhere overseas.

Remember. it is not just ISIL that is the threat. The threat extends from Damascus to Tehran. it threatens Lebanon and Jordan. it threatens all the Middle East. and. indeed. if that territory is allowed to remain inflamed. will threaten us here in the United States. Today. we take a very small action. a measured action. one that is necessary but hardly sufficient.

In fact. have we not had 13 years to debate this very subject internally. externally. on the floor. in committee. and off the floor? We certainly have had a lot of time for deliberation on this.

I think one of the things that makes this difficult is there are so many issues swirling around here: the desire. the need that I think. as Mr. THORNBERRY said. that everyone agrees on to confront and contain ISIS. Their savagery is just unimaginable. They are clearly a threat to us and to the region. and we need a plan for confronting them. for stopping them and. hopefully. ultimately defeating them. Now. part of that plan is what we are doing in Iraq. Part of that plan is trying to figure out how to deal with them in Syria. But aside from all of that. this amendment is far more basic and simple. and I think Mr. THORNBERRY explained it. It is a trainandequip mission. This is something that the Department of Defense does all over the world in a variety of different places. We have had a great deal of success training armies in Ethiopia and Kenya and Uganda to help deal with the situation in Somalia. We have had considerable success training forces in Yemen to help confront AQAP. The goal of this is to reduce the requirement for a robust U.S. military presence to advance our interests. I have heard a number of folks. particularly on my side of the aisle. express that concern. that we dont want to go down the slippery slope of committing U.S. forces to a largescale war. and I completely agree with them. But this amendment does not authorize military force. In fact. it is quite the opposite. It authorizes us to train local forces so that they can do the fighting. I have also heard a number of people express the frustration which I share: we shouldnt be over there fighting these battles. we need the local populations there to stand up and fight for themselves.

The reason why this is important as it relates to water law is simply because water law has always been the province of the States. There have been Federal courts that have said that over and over and over. Yet. when we come to the floor here. we hear constantly from the other side that there should be conditions on certain rights. This falls into that category. The debate we had on the floor earlier was that there is acknowledgment that the Federal Government was taking water rights as a condition for permits. Their answer from that side of the aisle was. well. lets let the process go. our side was. lets respect the law. Big difference. So now we have this motion to recommit. and if you look at the motion to recommit. it conditions. again. State water law.

I rise today as a founder and cochair of the Congressional Childrens Caucus and indicate to my colleagues that I believe we are overdue for naming children as our number one priority. Working with First Focus. I intend to introduce a childrens budget for the needs of our children. We have left children behind. Many times. the issues around children are discussed in a partisan way. Who wants early childhood education? Who wants universal preK or aroundtheclock child care? In actuality. the consumers and beneficiaries of funding for those very important issues are our children. We should give them the security. protection. and resources to prevent child abuse and for bringing families together and providing intervention for families that are troubled that result in not only child abuse. but violence against these children. What about the best education they can have? What about the best health care they can have? Mr. Speaker. children are our number one priority. I truly believe that a childrens budget in the United States of America is long overdue. Join me on the childrens budget.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am glad to be here on behalf of the Progressive Caucus today for the Progressive Caucus Special Order hour. We want to talk about the need to extend unemployment benefits in this country. Since the end of December. millions of Americans have lost their extended unemployment benefits and are struggling just to get by in this economy. We have had two really positive developments this week. One. the House Democrats have an initiative. led by Representative BRAD SCHNEIDER of Illinois. to do a discharge petition. which is a procedural motion to force the leadership of this body to let us vote on extending unemployment benefits. which it refuses to do. We have to get 218 signaturesa majority of the Houseto sign the discharge petition. If that happens. we can force a vote and make sure that people who have lost their benefits since the end of December get their benefits. That is the first important thing that has happened. The second important thing is. today. just this afternoon. it was announced there is a bipartisan agreement in the Senate by several senators to make sure that we can extend benefits through the month of May of this year. We need to do everything possible not only to make sure that the Senate passes that. but to make sure that this House takes up that action. Because if we dont. millions of peopleand many more every single weekwill not get access to unemployment benefits. So the Progressive Caucus is here today to highlight this issue and to raise awareness and explain why it is so important that we pass these benefitsand we pass them nowon behalf of the millions of people in this country that need those. I am joined by several of my colleagues here today. I would like to make sure that they have a chance to talk about the unique situations in their area and why this is so important. I would first like to yield to my colleague from the great State of Oregon. Representative SUZANNE BONAMICI.",

A majority of Americans support renewing unemployment insurance. but the majority here in the House continue to show that they are out of step with American families by refusing to extend unemployment insurance for the 2 million Americans who need it. and the families of my home district in Massachusetts are left to suffer because of it. This outoftouch majority has invested billions of dollars in tax breaks for the ultrarich and for wealthy corporations that have often shipped our jobs overseas. Yet. they are refusing to help those who are looking for work. our jobseekers who are struggling to care for their families and put food on the table. I cringe when I hear some of the Members of the majority blame poverty on the poor. and then vote to give tax breaks for the wealthy. It is the same majority that looks to slash the budget and put that burden on the backs of our children and seniors. Some have said that Democrats want to give children a full stomach and an empty soul. but I would say. people who would deny a hungry child lunch. they are the ones who need to worry about the condition of their soul. In Massachusetts. more than $100 million has been taken out of our economy as Congress has failed to act on this issue. I signed the discharge petition to force a vote on unemployment insurance on behalf of the nearly 80.000 workers in Massachusetts who have lost their unemployment benefits. They cannot afford to wait for the majority to catch up with the rest of the country. who know this is the right thing to do. Again.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today with Senator GRASSLEY to introduce the Medicare Data Access for Transparency and Accountability Act. I would like to begin by thanking my friend and esteemed colleague for his unwavering commitment to greater transparency and accountability in government. This Medicare DATA Act advances that goal. Sunshine continues to be the greatest disinfectant. In that light. the Medicare DATA Act ensures all taxpayers have access to Medicare Claims Database. both to aid them in making medical decisions. and in understanding what their money is paying for in this vital. yet enormous. health program. The Medicare Claims Database is an important resource for public and private stakeholders as it captures healthcare provider payment and claims information for roughly onethird of the United States healthcare system. But why isnt this information already available? In 1978. the Department of Health Education and Welfare attempted to release this information. upon request. under the premise that accessibility to the source data was in the public interest and therefore should be made available for public consumption. An injunction by a Florida court. however. ordered otherwise. I am pleased that the Florida court has reevaluated that decision and recently lifted the injunction. This is a step in the right direction. but the decision still leaves access to this data \"opaque.\" Data requests are still subject to the Freedom of Information Act and can be denied by Health and Human Services. Passage of the Medicare DATA Act would put an end to that loophole. Information affecting the American taxpayer should be part of the public domain in a free society. With this principle in mind. I join with Senator GRASSLEY in changing \"business as usual.\" I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that Medicare data is finally fully transparent and available to Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers alike. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this effort. By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself. Mr. WYDEN. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. BEGICH. Mr. MERKLEY. and Mr. LEE):",

Mr. Drummond has been an invaluable member of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) most notably while developing. supporting and maintaining the Legislative Information System (LIS). a vital legislative branch partnership. The Congress. the Library of Congress and the public have greatly benefited from his outstanding work. Mr. Drummond came to the Library of Congress from library school in June 1983 for the ninemonth Library of Congress Intern Program. After the Intern Program. he worked as a reference librarian in the Main Reading Room for two years. Due to his interest in automation and his work on the new optical disk program. he then moved to CRS. His career at CRS has been notable for innovation. responsiveness to the needs of Congress. and his willingness to share his extensive knowledge with others. He was a leader in the introduction of the Internet into the services of the Library. He coordinated the planning. policy and development of CRSs first home page as well as the Librarys first website. Mr. Drummond was a critical player in the Librarys ability to adapt. master. and eventually take an international leadership role in the Internet. Other accomplishments include the development and support of SCORPIO. a 1970s mainframe program that retrieved legislative and public policy information. and MARVEL. the Librarys first Internet Gopher system. Mr. Drummonds devotion to the needs of congressional users for legislative information has defined his career. In 1996. Congress directed CRS to coordinate the creation of a single integrated legislative retrieval system (the LIS) that would serve the House. the Senate. and other congressional agencies. Mr. Drummond took responsibility for that directive and not only coordinated the development of the system. but also ensured that over the years it met the needs of the user community. Finally. he participated in the Legislative Branch XML Working Group which has been charged with improving the availability and exchange of legislative data amongst agencies and the public by publishing it in XML format. On behalf of the entire congressional community. we extend congratulations to Mr. Louis Drummond for his many years of dedication. outstanding contributions. and service to the Congress and we wish him the very best in his retirement.

The legislation will increase the number of available organs and will help all of those who are awaiting a transplant. In 1984. Congress enacted the National Organ Transplant Act. NOTA. The purpose of NOTA was to guide organ donation and transplantation. In 1988. Congress amended NOTA to ban the transplantation of HIVinfected organs. Today. HIV treatments have extended and have improved the lives of countless HIV patients. This. in turn. has increased the need for organ donations. This bill would allow research to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of organ transplantation between individuals with HIV. Specifically. the bill would permit research on transplants involving HIVpositive individuals by eliminating the restriction on acquiring HIVpositive organs. The legislation also would direct the Secretary of HHS to develop and implement standards for research on the transplantation of HIVinfected organs.

I rise in strong support of the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act. commonly known as the \"HOPE Act.\" The HOPE Act is a critical step towards improving the health and wellbeing of persons living with HIV and AIDS and of strengthening our Nations organ transplant system. Many of us remember the fear and worry that surrounded AIDS in the 1980s. At first. no one even knew what caused AIDS. and the diagnosis was considered a swift death sentence. In that time of fear and the unknown. a blanket ban was placed on transplanting any HIVpositive organs. even for the purposes of research. However. in the last 25 years. medical research and technology has transformed HIV/ AIDS care and treatment. Now. thanks to these breakthroughs. HIV is a more chronic condition. This has led to improved life expectanciessomething we can and should celebratebut it also means that HIVpositive people are more likely to encounter medical complications as they age. They face unique complications as the powerful drugs that keep their HIV at bay often take a hard toll on their bodies. putting them at increased risk for ailments like kidney and liver disease. and for some of these problems. the only treatment is to wait on the same long waiting lists. as all Americans do. for an organ transplant. There might be a better way. According to transplant experts. each year. we toss out hundreds of HIVpositive organs that could otherwise be viable for transplantation into other HIVpositive people. These organs have the potential to save lives and lessen the transplant waiting lists for all Americans. but. instead. they are wasted because of the archaic. blanket ban that prohibits even the research to see if they could be used by those who already are HIV positive. That is why we need to pass the HOPE Act today.",

As HIV treatments have advanced over the last 30 years. many HIVpositive individuals are living longer lives. but they are also more likely to experience conditions. such as kidney and liver failure. which necessitate a transplant. This bill provides a potential path to a separate organ donation pool for HIVpositive organs. hopefully increasing the overall number of organs available for transplantation.",

Mr. Speaker. we havent found our way out of one of the great disparities in medical science: the difference between the 100.000 patients seeking organ transplants and the mere 30.000 who get such transplants annually. The HOPE Act provides a possible breakthrough. one that I dont think we can refuse. It is a breakthrough for many whose condition would make them hopeless in waiting for an organ transplant. The regular reviews to evaluate medical research that are mandated by this bill could allow transplants from HIVpositive donors to HIVpositive recipients if the procedureand this is important. the safeguards are tightly woven into this billif the procedure is shown to be both safe and effective. No wonder the BoxerCoburn HOPE Act was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. The wholesale ban in 1988 did not even allow research on HIVinfected organs. I am not sure I understand that since in this country we usually do not take research out of the picture. Today. medical science has come a long way. allowing many to live with HIV. We save many lives but then lose them to chronic conditions such as kidney and liver damage. often caused by the very HIV medications that have saved their lives. If they go on dialysis. there is virtually no hope for a transplant today. The way out of this conundrum is the way we have understood since the Enlightenment: \"Look for the evidence.\" Who can know where the science will take us or whether it will take us anywhere? With estimates of as many as another 600 organ donors who could be helpful annually. who would not want to try to find if this could be accomplished? Again. I thank the sponsors of this bill. which I think is rightfully named the HOPE Act.",

    "speech": "I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker. this bill before us tonight is a commonsense policy that will remove some barriers in the law and ensure that patients who are suffering from life -threatening illnesses can access vital treatments. We have heard the numbers discussed tonightover 100.000 patients currently awaiting lifesaving organs. That number grows by thousands every year. coupled with the fact that our current organ donation policies are outdated and do not reflect the most current research in clinical developments. The bill before us tonight corrects this. allowing organs from HIVpositive donors to be transplanted into HIVpositive recipients. This has the potential to save over 1.000 HIVinfected patients every year with liver and kidney failure. Allowing these HIV positive donations increases the organs available to HIVpositive recipients. More importantly. it actually grows the overall pool of organs that will be available. Furthermore. transplant surgeons already have experience with the transplantation of infected organs. Today. surgeons perform organ transplants on patients who are infected with hepatitis C. a disease with similar transmission methods as HIV. I would reassure my colleagues. I have taken the time to speak with transplant surgeons for the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. and I have spoken with doctors at the National Institutes of Health. This does not pose an increased health risk for the already HIVinfected patient from an organ donated by an HIVpositive donor. but it will provide the potential for increasing the number of organs available for transplant. Anybody who works in transplant surgery knows this is the number one issue that they face on a daytoday basis. This legislation is sound. sciencebased policy. It is also good fiscal policy. It increases the options for safe transplantation. eliminating the need for patients to receive costly recurring treatments. and instead allows patients to receive viable organs to live fuller. more productive lives.

The armistice was signed marking the end of World War I. The next year we saw the first commemoration of Armistice Day. which became Veterans Day in 1954. Every Veterans Day since then has been a day of remembrance and commemoration for all of our veterans. Today. we have the opportunity to put the thoughts and feelings of Veterans Day into practical action. Today. with the agreement of the House. we will ensure that veterans continue to receive the support they need. On October 28. the Senate passed S. 893. the Veterans Compensation CostofLiving Adjustment Act of 2013. which provides that veterans receive a projected 1.5 percent costofliving adjustment beginning in January. This bill directs the VA to increase the rate of basic compensation for disabled veterans and the rate of dependency and indemnity compensation for their survivors and dependents. Since 1976. Congress has acted annually to increase these benefits by an amount estimated to keep pace with inflation. This years increase is the same as that provided to Social Security recipients. Without this annual COLA increase. veterans. their families. and survivors would see the value of their hardearned benefits slowly erode. Many of the millions of veterans and survivors who receive monthly benefits depend upon these payments in order to make ends meet. For some. it is their only source of income. Providing for a costofliving increase is an important thing that we all can do to help veterans and ensure that the value of their benefits does not decrease over time due to inflation.

Then later on we can ask questions about what happened. why it didnt work. why wasnt implementation of the exchanges as good as a lot of us would have liked it to have been.

One. it will deny people having health insurance. people who otherwise would get health insurance. If you delay the individual responsibility requirement. it is going to cause a delay. People will not have insurance. Second. it is going to increase the cost of health insurance for a lot of people. Why? Because fewer people will be signed up. The individual responsibility requirement will not be followed as much as otherwise would be the case. The result is fewer people will be in the insurance pool. and therefore prices will be higher. Another consequence is it lowers the quality of health insurance. especially for those individuals who are seeking to be insured. They are going to have a lower quality product as a consequence of this request. It is an attempt to destabilize. it is an attempt to undermine the ACA.

While the consequences are tragic and profound. they are also preventable. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. prescription drug abuse is our Nations fastestgrowing drug problem. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that over the past decade. the nonmedical use of prescription drugs among persons 12 years or older rose from 1.9 million in 2002 to 11.1 million in 2011. The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that the abuse of prescription medications such as pain killers. tranquilizers. stimulants. and sedatives is second only to marijuana. the No. 1 abused drug in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control have classified prescription drug abuse as an epidemic. To combat the epidemic of prescription drug and over the counter medicine abuse. many community antidrug coalitions are working to raise awareness about the negative consequences associated with the misuse of these drugs. The North Coastal Prevention Coalition in California is just one example of a coalition pushing back against this problem. Together with San Diego Countys Prescription Drug Task Force. the Coalition has worked to create countywide Pain Prescribing Guidelines. They have helped facilitate National Take Back Days during which individuals are able to turn over unused prescription drugs. They also developed and disseminated a brochure on \"Safe Pain Prescribing\" to emergency room physicians. I would like to acknowledge the critical efforts of the North Coastal Prevention Coalition and other antidrug coalitions throughout the country in raising awareness about and combating the misuse of prescription medications.

We have facts. we have statistics. and we have issues that face our indigenous peoples. most particularly our indigenous children that. truth be told. are not what we want to write home about. In fact. in many. many cases. these statistics are shameful. The effort and the initiative to make a difference in the lives of the children of our first peoples is an effort I want to speak to today. and I join with my colleague from North Dakota in addressing this issue. I want to help shine a light on the conditions facing indigenous children in our country to whom the United States has a legal commitment. This is a Federal trust responsibility that is owed to these children. I thank Senator HEITKAMP for her commitment and for her compassion to address these issues facing our Nations indigenous children by introducing legislation to establish the Commission on Native Children. I will defer to my colleague so we can have a conversation about this. but it is important to note that the very first time I had ever met Senator HEITKAMP. we literally exchanged handshakes. introduced ourselves. and within 5 minutes we were talking about childrens issues. Native childrens issues in our respective States. That little 5minute discussion led to much further discussion later on and a commitment to work to address these issues. I do have many remarks I would like to make this afternoon. but I would like my colleague from North Dakota. who has worked so diligently on this issue. with her staff working with my staff. to describe to our colleagues the legislation that today we are both introducing establishing the Commission on Native Children.",

The despair my great friend from the great State of Alaska has just outlined for usit seems there is no way out. that no one is looking. they are invisible. that their problems are inconsequential and no one cares. Yes. I thank my colleague from Alaska for that wonderful vision that this commission tells them they are not invisible to us. they are not invisible to the Congress. they are not invisible to the administration. that people are there and they care. Maybe it offers that hope. Maybe it offers that opportunity to tell more of these stories and to shine a greater light of awareness onto this problem. It is a national disgrace. If we continue to do what we have always done in housing. education. health care. and public safety. if we continue to do what we have always done. we will lose yet another generation to despair. It is time for Congress to step up. honor our treaty obligations and recognize that if we cannot protect the smallest among us. the most vulnerable. the most remote among us. that we arent worthy of this body. We arent worthy of this government. I invite all of our colleagues to join with us and send a message loudly and clearly to Native children in our country that they matter. they matter at their homes. in their communities. their States. their clubs. and their schools. but they also matter in the halls of the Senate.",

    "speech": "So today were talking about flood insurance. The job creators in our community are getting nothing. We. as an institution. come together when there are natural disasters across this Nation. My constituents deserve nothing less. Hurricane Sandy has devastated New York and it is a shamean embarrassment for this institutionthat the House Republican leadership continues playing games with this essential assistance more than two months after the storm struck. It is indefensible that as Americans continue to suffer from Sandys impact that the House majority could not get their act together to bring the entire aid Senatepassed package to a vote. Talk about \"fiddling while New York City burns.\" And this is also the case with todays legislation. While I fully support providing FEMA with additional funding for the National Funding Insurance Program. it is just another sign of the majoritys dysfunction. With FEMA just days away from being unable to pay flood claims. the Republicans argued among themselves about what to do. This is a sad situation for those Americans that count on their government to have their backs after a disaster. While this bill will help homeowners insured through the Flood Insurance program. it does nothing for our small businesses and infrastructure needs. Providing this broader assistance is so overdue that it is a disgrace. and even more so now. we are in the dawn of the 113th Congress. and about to vote on just a sliver of what was promised. To many who are already suffering from the impact of Sandy. this feels like a punch to the gut. And while I would have rather voted earlier this week on the entire $60 billion package approved by the Senate. the House majority has given us no choice. I hope that the additional funding to help our residents and small businessesand to repair our infrastructurewill be brought to a vote as quickly as possible.",

He came to Midland Beach and was in one of the homes. several of the homes. that were completely devastated. pulling out moldy sheetrock and bringing a little hope to people in complete despair. For that. I will eternally be grateful. And I really do thank my chairman for that compassion in letting the people. even outside of his own district. know that hes there and he cares about them. I would also like to share with you: I called someone this morning from Staten Island that lives in New Dorp Beach. They have a teenaged son named Dylan. And they havent been back in their home since the storm. And I asked. \"How are your two sons doing?\" And they said. \"They are doing great. but Dylan. he hasnt gone back to the house to help with the construction because he gets choked up.\" And its that that I want to emphasize here. These are human beingshuman beings. childrenthat have been completely displaced. And its up to us to get them back on their feet. So today is one of those steps that Im proud to be a part of and tell Dylan that hes going to be okay. were getting him back in his house. And I would ask that as we go forward with the other parts of Sandy relief that my colleagues will stand with me and tell Dylan that hes going to be okay and were going to get him back in his house.

I rise in strong support of this legislation. and I would like to thank Chairman GARRETT for introducing this legislation and for his efforts to bring it to the floor with bipartisan support. The National Flood Insurance Program has hit its limit. Without an increase in borrowing authority. it will be unable to pay for claims as early as next week. And that means that 120.000 flood insurance claims payments will be delayed. nearly all of which are due to Hurricane Sandy. However. this bill is just not enough. Its not adequate. In December. the Senate passed an emergency assistance package to aid in the Sandy recovery. which included this legislation. Earlier this week. I expected. as did my colleagues. that the House would vote on a complete emergency assistance package to aid those in Connecticut. New Jersey. and New York who have lost homes. businesses. and their livelihoods. Sadly. the 112th Congress ended without action. and now we are starting over on important legislation which is absolutely critical to help stormaffected areas that should have and could have been signed. We know that theres no reason it wasnt signed in 2012. However. we have now been promised a vote on the Sandy emergency assistance package by January 15. and families in my district and throughout the region are looking to Congress and asking. \"Why are you making it so difficult for us to rebuild? Why are you making us wait to rebuild?\" Todays legislation is a start. but only a first step. toward providing relief for those who suffered as a result of Hurricane Sandy. We dont need a piecemeal approach. That is not the way that Congress acts. We need a comprehensive Sandy recovery bill passed today. We hold you to your commitment of January 15 and not a day later.

Lavallette and Silverton. and I can honestly say that these places look like war zones after the storm. Whole communities have been wiped out.

I just want to say that I support this bill not because I support the increased borrowing that we are doing for our flood insurance program of $9.7 billion. but it is a contractual agreement that we owe to these policyholders to pay these claims. Its not their fault that we in the government are not good managers of our money. In 1968. when this policy and this program was put into place. it had a borrowing authority of $1.5 billion. It wasnt until Katrina that we raised that borrowing authority up to $20 billion. We still owe $20 billion. Were now raising that borrowing authority to $30 billion. In 2017. which is 412 years away. the borrowing authority goes back to $1.5 billion. Now Im sure well address that at 11:59 on September 30 of 2017. But Id like to ask both sides. on both sides of the aisle. lets start working on that now. This cost to the government is $17.063 for every policyholder who has flood insurance. The average premium is about $600. We have paid people 10 and 20 and 30 times for claims that live in the same house in the same floodplain. I had an amendment to the flood insurance bill that said if you had two claims due to flood and you did not take the payout. then you would have to pay a ratebased premium. It didnt pass. Weve got to get into reality what this flood insurance program is for. Its mandatory. If you have a governmentbacked loan and you live in a floodplain thats likely to flood in 100 years. you have to have the insurance.",

Sheetz. Inc. was founded by Bob Sheetz in 1952 when he purchased one of his fathers five dairy stores in Altoona. In 1961. Bob hired his brother Steve to work parttime at the store. It was not until 1963 that the second store was opened under the name \"Sheetz Kwik Shopper.\" In 1972. the brothers literally doubled the size of the company. expanding from seven to fourteen stores. One year later. Sheetz added gasoline pumps and introduced selfserve gasoline to Central Pennsylvania. By 1983. Bob and Steve had opened 100 stores. The following year. Bob retired and handed over the leadership of the company to his trusted business partner and brother Steve. In 1995. Stan Sheetz. Bobs son. became president and Steve assumed the position of Chairman of the Board. To this day. Sheetz maintains a unique and successful family business with five family members serving on the Executive Committee. Since 1952. Sheetz has grown from a small dairy/deli in Altoona. PA. to one of the fastest growing familyowned convenience stores in the world. with more than 437 locations across six statesPennsylvania. Maryland. Virginia. West Virginia. Ohio and North Carolinaand more than 14.500 employees. The company manufactures its own unique Sheetz brand food products. it consistently is listed as one of the \"Best Places to Work\" in state surveys. and it donates hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to programs like the Special Olympics and MakeAWish Foundation through its corporate Sheetz Family Charities organization. The Sheetz Family will be honored February 23. 2013 with the Respected Citizen Award by the Central Blair Recreation Commission and the Booker T. Washington Revitalization Committee in Altoona.

In 1973. Mr. Jerome Brennan. the Honorable James Munley. Attorney Robert Munley and William Pryle founded this Chapter and dedicated it to charitable works. the preservation of Irish culture in America. and the education of the next generation of students about the contributions of Irish immigrants throughout our nations history.

The organization provided invaluable support to the vast influx of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Hunger in E178 the late 1840s. offering both economic aid as well as an introduction to a new culture of opportunity in America. The members of the Order were among the first to welcome new immigrants to their communities. preserving many of the old traditions of a faraway homeland while simultaneously introducing new traditions that were part of a uniquely American experience.

This bill will close a gap in current law by requiring universities and colleges to spell out their policies on sexual assault. stalking. dating violence. and domestic violence generally. By requiring transparency out of these institutions. this bill will increase awareness for the victimization students face every day on our college campuses. Sexual and dating violence is a serious problem on our college campuses. Over 13 percent of female undergrads have reported being stalked while at school and one out of every five women in college have reported being sexually assaulted. While these statistics are shocking. whats even more shocking is that only a fraction of these incidents are reported. When these instances of abuse go unreported. our nations female undergraduate victims never get the support they need. The Campus SaVE Act would close the gap in current law by requiring institutions of higher education to clearly explain their policies on dating violence. sexual assault. stalking. and domestic violence. Institutions will be required to include in their annual security reports statistics on domestic violence. dating violence. and stalking that were reported to campus police or local police agencies. It will also promote prevention and bystander responsibility by requiring these institutions to develop clear statements of policy regarding domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault. and stalking prevention programs. Campus SaVE ensures that victims get the help they need by requiring schools to provide clear statements regarding their procedures followed when a case of domestic violence. dating violence. sexual assault. or stalking is reported and provide victims an explanation of their rights in writing. Young people should be able to focus on finding their intellectual passion during these years. not dealing with the mental and physical exhaustion of abuse.

Azerbaijan shared in our grief and pledged to stand by the United States as we brought the perpetrators to justice. True to their word. Azerbaijan has supported allied efforts against international terrorism by allowing unrestricted access to their territory for aircraft. troops. and supplies. as well as committing their own troops to fight alongside our own. Just as Azerbaijan has supported our nation in its time of need. so too must we not let the massacre of the 613 Azerbaijani men. women. and children drift into the dim memory of history. I urge my colleagues to commemorate this terrible tragedy and continue our nations support for the people of Azerbaijan. our partners in peace and prosperity for the Caspian Region.",

The extra training can be challenging and there are always new technologies that you must master. Again. the job is both physically and mentally demanding.

In this true spirit of friendship. it seems appropriate for Congress to commemorate the victims of the Khojaly tragedy as Azerbaijani people mark the 21st anniversary of this event. The town of Khojaly is located in the NagornoKarabakh region of Azerbaijan and was home to some 7.000 Azerbaijani citizens during the ArmenianAzerbaijani war. On February 25 and 26 of 1992. in a period of less than 12 hours. 613 citizens. including women and children. died at the hands of Armenian forces and Russian military troops. Human rights organizations described the advancing forces as having committed unconscionable acts of violence against civilians as they fled. The bodies of fallen men. women and children were observed by foreign journalists who visited the region in the wake of the tragedy. Given our deepening ties with Azerbaijan. it is important for American citizens to remember this event. Twentyone years later. the ArmenianAzerbaijani conflict has not yet been fully resolved. The anniversary of this horrible tragedy is an appropriate time to honor the victims of these atrocities and reflect on the need for all parties to work together to bring a swift end to this conflict. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with Azerbaijanis as they commemorate this tragedy.",

This is agreeing to pay the bills weve already accrued. Senator Alan Simpson said it best: If youre a real conservative. an honest conservative without hypocrisy. youd want to pay your debt. Eight days ago. a minority faction of the Congress chose to shut down the Federal Government. This was touching the fire. To refuse to lift the debt ceiling is to place our entire hand into the fire. A Reagan economist called this debate \"playing with matches around gasoline.\" Yes. thats the same President Ronald Reagan who raised the debt ceiling 18 times without the accompanying brinksmanship. And lets remember. during the 2011 debt ceiling debate. the mere threat of a default scared the markets and drove up interest rates. Retirees lost $800 billion in assets as markets tumbled. Home buyers lost $100 a month as rates spiked. The harm this time could be much worse. We need to pay our bills so we can start solving the real problems facing this country rather than fixing ones we caused ourselves. And. Mr. Speaker. what is most extraordinary about this fiasco is this: I thought budget negotiations were supposed to be about funding levels. but this Nations most contentious budget fight in nearly 20 years isnt about funding levels at all. its about using the budget as leverage to repeal or delay an existing law. Despite the destructive effects of sequestration. in an effort to compromise. we gave in to the demands to the majority and accepted their $986 billion spending limit. Just put this into context. The $986 billion level is 17 percent below fiscal year 2010 spending and 10 percent less than the original Ryan budget. It is below SimpsonBowles. If thats not compromise. I dont know what is. Those on the other side of this aisle dont know how to take \"yes\" for an answer. We agreed to deeply slash government spending.

    "speech": "If I could respond to the Senator who suggested that.the answer is yes. I think it is fair to say that the consolidation option that a student has in case the rates go up. at 8.25 percent can be called a cap. It is not a hard cap. but it is a cap. And the second cap is the income repayment provision of which the Senator speaks. If you are making $40.000 a year. after they apply the formula you probably are not spending more than about 10 percent of your incomeit is something called disposable incometo pay for your student loan. Loan repayment then continues for about 20 years. If at the end of 20 years you have not paid your loan off. the loan is forgiven. Any student who has a loan has that opportunity. They can consolidate at 8.25 percent. and income repayment limits the amount they have to pay each year. So they have that. One of the things I noticed about the ManchinBurr bill that I would like to ask the Senators to talk about is that you have come up withwhat I am beginning to understand. as I study this more and morea very significant contribution: the idea that all of the undergraduate student loanswhich. as I understand it. are about two out of three of the loansshould have the same interest rate. First. it is confusing the way undergraduate loan interest rates are now. but the other reason is that about 80 percent of the people who have subsidized loans. the lowincome students. also have unsubsidized loans. So your contribution is to say: Lets simplify it. provide certainty over a long period of time. and treat all undergraduates the same. Otherwise. it seems to me. you are leaving 7 million middleincome students who have unsubsidized loans high and dry. and the 80 percent of the lowincome students who also have these unsubsidized loans. you are not helping them either. I wonder if the Senator could comment on this idea? I notice. without a cap. you are able to get the interest rate for all undergraduate loans down to about 3.66 percent. which is a pretty low rate.",

I understand that it is close to about 40 percent of the students who participate in borrowing money. but the volume of money is about 25 percent. onefourth of the money that is loaned out. So if we are keeping the rates low on onefourth of the money. that means we artificially have much higher rates on threefourths of the money students need to get an education. What we are saying is that we are going to bring a larger majority of that down to the lowest rate. We think it is a good policy that we should be discussing and talking about. That is where we are. That is why we came up with the plan we did. but we reduced all the rates. The PLUS loans I think went from 7.9 to 6.21. yes. and then the graduate loans went from 6.8 to 5.21. But if you do all of the undergraduate. it would go from 3.4 to 3.66. a quarter and a point-.26.",

If this is about affordability. if this is about what provides the greatest flexibility for students to afford it. then the answer is clear. It is on the chart.

The fact is that for a typical student in their first year. taking $5.000 out. $3.500 comes from the subsidy-$5.500 out. $3.500 comes from the subsidy. $2.000 comes from the 6.8 rate.",

The reality is that if you are going to move to a marketbased system. the question we have as Senators is. How do we drive interest rates the lowest for our Nations students? If you put a hard cap of 8.25. then all of a sudden this interest rate goes up. if we are getting to a zero surplus. It is not going to cost us anything. not going to make anything. 3.66 goes up. it doesnt go down. So by having the flexible cap at 8.25. where anybody can consolidate at any time. we are able to do it at the 10year bond plus 1.85. And this is all CBO numbers. We are using the same source for this. But I think at the heart of this. and I say to my good friend from West Virginia. the real question is.

Most undergraduates have the hardest times. Once you get your undergraduate degree. you have a much higher percentage of making it.

It was called the National Defense Education Act or the Eisenhower bill. I went back and looked to see what the 10year Treasury note was at that time for those 3 years that I borrowed. The 10year Treasury note at that time ranged between 4.2 percent and about 4.8 percent. I borrowed money at 2 percent. I say to my friend. that is not a market rate. Not only did I borrow the money. but all the time I was in college I paid no interest charges. I spent 5 years in the military with no interest charges.

This important legislation provides a necessary clarification to Section 1902 of the Social Security Act. The legislation provides that Medicaid designated health services claims are subject to the same requirements as Medicare designated health services claims are under the Physician SelfReferral Law. Health care providers subject to the Physician SelfReferral Law should not be able to avoid penalties under the law simply because a claim is a Medicaid claim rather than a Medicare claim. Both programs involve taxpayer money and we need to ensure the longterm solvency of the Medicaid program. just as we do with the Medicare program. The Department of Justice. mindful of this. has worked to bring causes of action against providers under the False Claims Act involving violations of the Physician SelfReferral laweven in the Medicaid context. In one recent case. the Department of Justice relied on 42 U.S.C. \ufffd 1396b(s). which provides that a state shall not receive federal reimbursement for a claim submitted through the Medicaid program if the same claim would be rejected under the terms of the Medicare program. had the service been covered by Medicare instead of Medicaid.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground and its Commander. Colonel Reed F. Young. Ph.D. The U.S. Armys presence in Yuma dates back to 1850. when Fort Yuma was constructed on a hill overlooking the Yuma crossing of the Colorado River. Soldiers at Fort Yuma maintained peace with the local Indians and protected the important Yuma crossing. That fort operated until 1883. In 1865. a second facility known as the Yuma Quartermaster Depot was constructed in order to supply Army posts throughout Arizona and western New Mexico. That depot was also closed in 1883. and the Army would not return to Yuma on a permanent basis until the Second World War. Beginning in 1943. the area was host to various bases. depots. and training grounds. In 1950. the mission of the facility changed drastically to become the nations premier artillery testing site. hosting the longest overland artillery range in the country. The installation was renamed Yuma Proving Ground in 1963 during the reorganization of the Army. The Yuma Proving Ground has since been home to tests of longrange weaponry. the Apache Helicopter. M1 Abrams tanks. Bradley Fighting Vehicles. rockets. mortars. parachute and airdrop technologies. global positioning systems (GPS). and even automobiles. The Yuma Proving Ground contributes directly to both Americas national defense and its national economy. I must also thank and congratulate Colonel Reed Young. the Commander of the Yuma Proving Ground. He assumed command in May 2011. He leads over 2.700 military. civilian. and contractor personnel. Colonel Young is responsible for research and development of highlyadvanced technologies valuable to the military. many of which also have civilian applications. Before taking command of the Yuma Proving Ground. Colonel Young served as a Program Manager and Chief of the Technology Integration and Outreach Division for the U.S. Army Research Office in Durham. NC. He is also a member of the Arizona State Council on the Education for Military Children that helps remove barriers for children of military families. He is always quite courteous to my staff and me each time we visit. taking time out of his day to interact with us. His service to our country is exemplary. On behalf of the State of Arizona. I want to recognize the Yuma Proving Ground for its rich history. and I want to thank Colonel Young for his hospitality and dedication to this nation. E762",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of my amendment. which will strengthen small business participation in government contracts. In my district and across the country. small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Small businesses innovate. know how to operate on a tight budget and know how to create goodpaying jobs. I want small businesses in places like Elgin. Illinois. to be able to win government contracts from the Department of Defense because I know they will do more with taxpayer dollars and provide superior products and services for our men and women in uniform. However. the government is lagging behind on awarding contracts to small businesses. We are not meeting our goal of 23 percent of contracts going to small businesses. and 23 percent is a pretty low bar that we should be raising even higher. not be struggling to meet. It is even more unfortunate that we are also failing to award enough contracts to women- and veteranowned small businesses. My amendment seeks to remedy this problem by asking the Small Business Administration and Federal agencies to include remediation plans in their annual reports on small business contracting goals. The government should explain why it is not meeting its small business goals. It should identify faulty past practices and propose new practices to increase small business participation. We need an action plan to support our small businesses. and my amendment will do just that. I thank Chairman MCKEON and Ranking Member SMITH and the committee staffs for their help on this amendment. and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and our small businesses.",

The first is my amendment to protect military tuition assistance. an important tool for members of the armed services to obtain the necessary professional development education and to prepare themselves for the civilian job market upon leaving the service. Last year. approximately 300.000 servicemembers used tuition assistance to pursue their educational goals. Unfortunately. last March. the administration chose to end this program. and it took congressional action to overturn that decision. This amendment would prevent even the specter of ending this benefit from ever happening again. Our soldiers. sailors. airmen. and marines deserve better. Second. included in this package is an amendment requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on veteranowned small business contracting and to examine the feasibility of putting a priority on meeting veteranowned small business contracting goals first. similar to a successful program in the VA. They will be examining how fair contracting practices for veteranowned small businesses could positively affect veteran unemployment. homelessness and even suicide. Mr. Chairman. the fact is there are 250.000 servicemembers transitioning each year from military life to civilian life. One in seven is selfemployed or is a small business owner. and about a quarter of our veterans say they are interested in starting or in buying their own small businesses. They play an important role in our economy. This Congress needs to help them in the transition and in getting America back to work. So I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member on the bill. and I urge support of these amendments.",

That hope quickly turned into humiliation and sorrow as her company commander became her enemy. First. he ordered her to clean his office. and he later harassed her with sexual innuendoes and advances night after night. Feeling hopeless and fearing retribution. Elisha stayed silent until the commander became more emboldened. He again ordered another female recruit to his office at night. This time. he ordered her to remove her clothes and engage in unwanted sex. Thankfully. the victimized servicewoman was brave enough to pursue charges. but because it was determined that she was not under physical threat and that she did not fear for her life. her assailant got away with the lesser offenses of cruelty and maltreatment and adultery. instead of being charged with rape. This is not full justice. When our daughters and our sons put on the uniform to protect us. the United States. they must be protected to the utmost extent from such an abuse of power.

The Department of Defense has hundreds. possibly thousands. of buildings and structures that it has rated at zero percent utilization. This is an incredible number of useless facilities that taxpayers are paying to maintain. The extent of this wasteful spending. however. is not currently known. even by the Department itself. My amendment would fix that. requiring the Department of Defense to disclose just how many of its facilities are unused or underutilized and how much it is costing American taxpayers to maintain these facilities. The Department of Defense would be required to report back to Congress in six months. explaining what they are doing either to dispose of these wasteful facilities or increase their utilization. By forcing the Department of Defense to take a serious look at its facilities. gather data on how these facilities are managed. and develop a coherent plan for reducing costs and improving efficiency. my amendment seeks to eliminate this wasteful government spending. Unfortunately. the Department of Defense is not the only federal agency that is currently wasting taxpayer money on maintaining unused or underutilized facilities. As a whole. the federal government must do a better job at managing its facilities. At times of record debt. taxpayers should not continue paying for unused and underused buildings. That is not good government. and that is not smart spending. That is why I recently introduced the SAVE Act to root out up to $200 billion in wasteful and duplicative government spending over the next 10 years. This amendment is an extension of one of the 11 commonsense solutions included in the bipartisan SAVE Act. holding the Department of Defense accountable for spending taxpayer money on facilities the Department itself has found to be unused or underutilized. We all agree that we need to reduce government spending. We should also all agree that the best place to start is by rooting out waste. This is a commonsense solution to do just that and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. The Acting CHAIR.

Right now. 22 States have mandatory minimum sentences for those convicted of rape and sexual assault. My State. Indiana. is one of those States. In Indiana. theres a mandatory sentence of not less than 6 years for rape. Its inexcusable that servicemembers guilty of the most heinous crime should be allowed to remain in the military. allowing them to coexist with victims and potentially commit repeated offenses. Criminals must receive the full weight of justice for their wrongdoings.

Protect our Defenders. which has been a very strong advocacy group for victims. worries that when a jury knows that a perpetrator will automatically be dishonorably discharged. that the jury will be less likely to assign confinement charges in addition.

I value my partnership with Congressman TURNER as cochairs of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus and with the legislation we have crafted on combating the horrific crime of sexual assault in the military. This year. our work together on the Better Enforcement for Sexual Assault Free Environments Act. otherwise known as BE SAFE. led to its incorporation into the NDAA before us today. However. I must take exception to the amendment before us. I do agree that we must make sure that all individuals who are convicted of sexual assault in the military are punished with confinementabsolutelybut there are many different ideas about the best way to do that. Some argue that a better approach would be a system similar to Federal sentencing guidelines. and thats why Mr. TURNER and I wrote a provision in the defense authorization before us that requires the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with a report on sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimum sentencing provisions under the UCMJ. Before we make additional changes to the UCMJ. we need to see this report. Since weve introduced the BE SAFE Act. we have heard from many groups. One letter from the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence says: Long mandatory minimum sentences can have a chilling effect on reporting and prosecuting sexual assault in the civilian system. and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence does not recommend them. We have to listen to these various voices. We cannot afford to take this risk in the military. Reporting of sexual assault in the military already happens at abysmal rates. We need more reporting. not less. Less reporting equals fewer prosecutions. which ultimately will fail to deter the perpetrators from carrying out this heinous crime.

And yet the world has not become a safer place. So whats clear is we have a duty. an absolute duty. to invest each and every dollar of our defense dollars wisely. and thats exactly what my amendment does. It does that by eliminating a regulation thats holding back competition. and in doing so. its hurting the American taxpayer. When it comes to understanding the value of introducing competition into things. the American people get it. From groceries to computers. we know when competition is introduced. good things happen. The prices go down and the quality goes up. The same is true. or it should be true. when it comes to the Department of Defense and the ability of the private sector and the public sector to compete. President Obama put it this way. He said: Taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if not inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition. In my service to my district. Im always looking for commonsense ideas and common ground. On this particular issue. I see both in the Presidents statement. My amendment moves competition forward by eliminating a full moratorium that Congress has put in place. The Department of Defense said in 2011 that it wanted that particular moratorium removed so it could meet its statutory obligation. What is that statutory obligation? Its this. and this comes right out of their own report and recommendations: The Secretary of Defense shall use the least costly form of personnel consistent with military requirements and other needs of the Department. Well. we know that some activities are inherently governmental. For example. criminal investigations. My amendment has nothing to do with those types of activities. They should be performed by the Federal Government. But other activities. Mr. Chairman. for example. janitorial services. thats not inherently governmental and should be subject to competition.

Publicprivate competitions are one such tool. Publicprivate competitions are an effective way of injecting performance and accountability into government operations. The private sector constantly competes for new business opportunities. When the Federal Government performs commercial functions. they. too. should be required to compete. Unfortunately. Congress has placed a moratorium on publicprivate cost competitions. effectively granting monopoly power to the Federal Government when it comes to providing commercially available goods and services. We all know that without competition. both innovation and quality suffer. The amendment does not mandate the use of publicprivate competitions.

Punishing these families by taking away unemployment benefits is a terrible mistake. The absence of unemployment insurance is jeopardizing the economic progress that we are making. By removing the benefits to 80.000 Illinois families. we are taking more than $25 million out of our economy every week. Lets put partisanship aside and extend unemployment insurance now for our families and our businesses. I thank the gentlelady from California again for her leadership on this issue.",

I come before you today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty. Our Nation has had many successes over the last 50 years. Medicaid. Medicare. SNAP. and Pell Grants are incredible programs that help our entire country. However. even with these successful programs which deserve our recognition. this is not a time for celebration. After five decades. many would think that our congressional leaders were still committed to fighting poverty and reducing the gap between the haves and havenots. I would still think that we are committed to helping hardworking Americans who have fallen on rough times through no fault of their own. The war on poverty is far from over. Instead of pressing the issue. we are retreating from it. 1.3 million Americans just lost their unemployment insurance and are suffering from longterm joblessness. If we dont renew the program. 383.000 New Yorkers will lose access to benefits over the next 12 months. We would also be responsible for preventing an increase of GDP by 0.2 percent and the blocking of 200.000 jobs. For me. and I know for many in this Chamber. inflicting avoidable pain on this country is unacceptable. With no political gimmicks. we must vote to renew unemployment insurance now.",

The war on poverty. they thought it was the war for poverty as they are dismantling one by one the most important programs that help lift and keep people out of poverty. like extended unemployment insurance. Let me read a few subjects here. Roseburg. Oregon. A 61yearold woman working since she was 14: I dont know if it is my age. but I am having great difficulty finding a job. A 62yearold woman from Coos Bay. Oregon. went back to her former employer and said: \"Are you hiring?\" He said: \"You cant be serious. Not at this time of year. Come back in the spring.\" Unfortunately. she cant make it until spring. A Eugene veteran. A twoincome family. but she lost her job: Since I havent been able to find a job. we are close to losing our house and declaring bankruptcy. I am actively seeking employment every day. Then we go to Springfield. Oregon. my hometown. We have a woman whose son is in the Army. She says: I cant find a job. I have been looking. I have to give notice to my landlord and become homeless. Then Corvallis. Oregon. A 54yearold man. He had been working his whole life since 17. In his last job. he was there for 13 years. but he cant find a job and he is going to be forced into homelessness. Then. finally. another gentleman from Springfield. Oregon: $330 a week I received wasnt much. but it helped keep me from having to go to food banks and asking for help. We went just before Christmas. The food bank had run out of food. I have to decide now whether to buy medicine or food or heat my house. That is the legacy of the cruel cuts of these Republicans. These are people. hardworking Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own and they want to work. If they fall into poverty. they lose their home. they lose their cell service. their telephone. their car. How are they ever going to get a job? We need to help them now before they fall even more off the cliff. Extend unemployment benefits today as a celebration that we. as the American people. do not tolerate poverty in this country.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentlelady for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker. when President Johnson stood in this Chamber 50 years ago and declared war on poverty. the richest country in the world had a poverty rate of 19 percent. President Johnson cautioned us on that evening that the war on poverty would be a long one and not an easy one. Yet. 9 years later. in 1973. the poverty rate in this country had dropped to 11 percent. We were most definitely winning the war on poverty. Unfortunately. after its initial success. many politicians found success running down the achievements the war on poverty had on many Americans. Politicians scapegoating socalling \"welfare queens\" furthered a narrative that the war on poverty was not worth fighting. Yet. I can show you firsthand examples in my home State of South Carolina where the war on poverty did. in fact. succeed. For example. Medicare and Medicaid. both war on poverty initiatives. have made a tremendous difference in the health security of older Americans and those of modest means. In fact. at the time of the institution of Medicare. the poverty rate among seniors was over 30 percent. Today. the poverty rate among seniors has dropped to beneath 10 percent. It is important to remember that. a year after President Johnson made that speech. we passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That. to me. was to empower poor people. to empower people of color to go to the polls. to get registered and to vote to make their own statements as to how to fight the war on poverty. Today. we in the Congressional Black Caucus have been calling for our government to do across the board what we did in our socalled \"stimulus bill.\" and that is to institute a 102030 initiative to direct funds to targeted areas so that 10 percent of all of this money can go into those communities where 20 percent or more of the population have been locked beneath the poverty level for the last 30 years. If we were to begin to target these persistent poverty counties. we would. in fact. eliminate poverty. and we would see all of our people who are living in poverty get beneath the 10 percent that we think will be tolerable over the next 10 years.",

I served on the board of the Gulfcoast Legal Services. and we say to our colleagues: if you would look at the red that is on these sheets. you will know that poverty does not belong to any one Member.

I understand that there is an irrational fear of bringing Guantanamo detainees into the United States. even though we would only do so to bring them to justice. In contrast to the military commissions at Guantanamo. which have not reached one verdict other than by plea. the Federal Court system in the United States has been extremely successful at prosecuting terrorists and safely imprisoning them for long periods of time. One of the 9111 terrorists is in a U.S. prison. The shoe bomber is in a U.S. prison. The underwear bomber is in a U.S. prison. The Times Square bomber is in a U.S. prison. One of the Boston Marathon bombers is in a U.S. prison. We have tried and convicted terrorist masterminds in U.S. courts in my own district. But others are being held at Guantanamo without any prospect of a trial. Ever since Magna Carta. we have denied the government the power to imprison and punish people on mere accusation. Just because the government labels someone a terrorist doesnt make him one. The government must be asked to prove the accusation in court. That has always been a bedrock American principle until we opened Guantanamo. Now we imprison people indefinitely without trial. By what claim of right do we do this? How can we be sure we are punishing actual terrorists and not actual people when we hold no trials? Mr. WOLF said someone may be acquitted. If he is acquitted he should be released. That is our basic principle of justice for the last thousand years. Guantanamo should be closed and its inmates either tried or released. It is beyond time to close Guantanamo so it can no longer be used to rally our enemies to recruit terrorists. to undermine our ability to bring terrorist suspects to justice. and to violate bedrock American principles of due process of law. I am astonished. frankly. that I would hear on the floor of the United States Congress someone say that people might be acquitted. therefore. they should be held in jail forever because maybe the evidence doesnt exist because someone in the government in the all powerful. almighty. all knowing bureaucracy says that if someone is a terrorist that person must be held in jail indefinitely because maybe we dont have the proof.

In fact. in the first 8 months after the rule was enacted. more than 100 criminals and traffickers were identified for prosecution. Mr. Chairman. it is clear that the reporting requirement is keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. and the ATF must be able to continue to do this important work. I thank my colleagues who are in support of our gun violence prevention efforts. today and every day. I reserve the balance of my time.",

I dont understand why they want to take the people who stand on the border and take this onslaught of the failure of the administration to defend and prosecute those who violate the laws of our country. and they want to have something that imposes upon our right to privacy and our right to exercise our Second Amendment rights. Law enforcement tools are not taken away by the fact that we have limited this intrusion upon the rights of the people in the States that are on our southwestern border. In fact. law enforcement has the right to at any time walk into a Federal firearms dealer and request any sales records. and they mandatorily must provide them. A bouncer can walk into a Federal licensed firearms dealer and get these records every day. The amendment doesnt prohibit gun dealers from reporting multiple sales of purchases. It just doesnt mandate on four States of this Union a violation of their right to privacy. The playing field should be level in anything we do under the law. But the fact is we are unleveling the playing field for the very people that stand down in the direct onslaught of the invasion coming across our southern border as a result of this administrations failure to properly enforce immigration policy. This is something that we shouldnt even be discussing. limiting the ability and making reporting requirements on four States and involving their right of privacy contrary to the rest of the union. I dont understand why this is even being discussed. I oppose the attempts to toss out the Second Amendment rights of the people of the State of Texas. New Mexico. Arizona and California.

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in support of Congresswoman ESTYs amendment. which strikes a dangerous rider that would bar the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco. Firearms. and Explosives from enforcing a reporting requirement on certain semiautomatic weapons in four southwest border States. It is over 16 months since the tragedy in Newtown. Connecticut. where six adults and 20 children were murdered in cold blood. It has been almost a week since the latest mass tragedy that occurred in California. Nineteen people were shot. and four were killed in New Orleans last weekend. Even before what happened at UC Santa Barbara. over 80 Americans were killed by guns last week. and all of the families who have lost loved onesthe families in Newtown. in Santa Barbara. and all across Americaare still waiting for Congress to act. It is no secret that the appropriations bills have been used to incrementally chip away at the Federal Governments ability to enforce the gun laws and to protect the public from gun crime. This is yet another example of the same bad behavior. Currently. licensed gun dealers in Arizona. California. New Mexico. and Texas are required to report to the National Tracing Center when a dealer sells multiple assault rifles to one individual. just as all dealers have reported multiple handgun sales for over 20 years. This requirement is narrowly tailored. applying only to the sales of rifles that are semiautomatic. that are greater than the .22 caliber. and that hold a detachable magazine. Multiple assault rifle sales reports help law enforcement crack down on gun trafficking along the southwest border. where dealers are disproportionately fueling Mexican cartel violence. This reporting requirement is effective. During the first 8 months it was in effect. the ATF initiated 120 investigations based on reports of multiple sales of assault rifles and recommended the prosecution of more than l00 defendants in 25 separate cases. Furthermore. every Federal court has addressed this issue and has found that requiring dealers in these four border States to report multiple assault rifle sales is well within the ATFs authority. This requirement is critical to identifying straw purchasers who put guns in the hands of criminals. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that will continue to give ATF the tools it needs to combat gun trafficking and to keep the public safe.",

It becomes a habit around here to call anything that will fire six shots when you pull the trigger an assault rifle. In fact. this requires the reporting of semiautomatic shotguns. as well as of semiautomatic rifles. People all over the United Statesand particularly in our Statehunt every day with these weapons. Families have these weapons in their homes. They are not assault weapons. They are semiautomatic shotguns and rifles. This reporting requirement is on those weapons. and it doesnt say anything about assault weapons. I question the logic of this whole thing when we are talking about the privacy of the individual under the Second Amendment and about the right for Americans to keep and bear arms. Therefore.

The long gun rider currently in this bill makes it easier for drug cartels to smuggle weapons across the border and more difficult for law enforcement to identify straw purchasers and get weapons out of the hands of dangerous people. The reporting of multiple purchases for powerful semiautomatic firearms is the same policy we have had for handguns for decades. and it saves lives. Let me be very clear. my friends. The long gun reporting requirement would not stop a lawabiding person from purchasing a firearm. It only allows the reporting of multiple sales of powerful. semiautomatic riflesgreater than the .22 caliberand only if they can hold detachable magazines. The Justice Department found that more than half of the guns recovered in Mexico in connection with drug cartels originated in the United States of America. A case study of firearms trafficking by one drug cartel found that. during a 15month period. the cartel purchased 251 assault rifles from U.S. gun dealers. all but one of which was purchased as part of a multiple sale.

For the past 15 years. a large part of the success of the salmon recovery in the Northwest and in other States has been through locally driven solutions funded through the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. and I continue to support this program. This amendment will ensure. however. that these funds continue to benefit salmon through ontheground projects. but without questionable buffer guidelines imposed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. or NOAA. as a condition of their use. Agriculture is the background of my central Washington district. and it is estimated that these and other similarly imposed land setaside guidelines by NOAA could restrict the use of vital crop protection tools on as much as 50 acres of farmland per mile. I am not alone in my concern about NOAAs use of unverifiable salmon buffer requirements in other instances. Last year. the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found similar NOAA salmon buffer requirements in a biological opinion that were based on scientific standards that \"did not always appear to be logical. obvious. or even rational... In my home State of Washington. over two dozen agricultural associations strongly oppose NOAAs recommendation of large buffers on agricultural lands. and one local recovery board group that has successfully used these funds to improve salmon survival in the upper Columbia River opposes mandatory buffers tied to these important salmon grant funds. Let me be very clear. This amendment wont cut Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery funds. nor will it prohibit riparian buffers where they are appropriate. but it will ensure that NOAA does not make them a prerequisite for these funds to be awarded for ontheground projects. respecting unique geographical priorities of agricultural areas and locally driven solutions to salmon recovery. So. Mr. Chairman. I ask that this amendment be approved. so that the Federal Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery funds. which have been proven effective over the years for farmers and local projects. will not be used as a backdoor way for NOAA to implement other controversial guidelines for these buffers.

By helping to educate and provide valuable employment opportunities for these men and women. The Lords Place provides a path that has already allowed hundreds of formerly homeless Floridians to reenter society and lead independent and selfsufficient lives. In 2012. The Lords Place provided these support services to hundreds of people in need. More than 400 men. women. and children were offered supportive housing. and remarkably. by the end of the year. 92 percent of these individuals were no longer homeless.

I think the PortmanAyotte amendment. which is cosponsored by several other colleagues as well. provides a very important protection against retaliation for those religious organizations that are legitimately exempted under ENDA. I also salute them for broadening the purposes section of the bill to recognize not only the need to address a widespread pattern of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. but also they have added a new subsection to recognize that another purpose is to help strengthen civil society and preserve institutional pluralism by providing reasonable accommodations for religious freedom. I think both of those changes strengthen the bill. and I wish to commend the Senator for her leadership on this issue. Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

His amendment is a very important amendment. What it simply says is that if an organization is exempt from ENDA for religious reasons. then government cannot turn around and somehow retaliate against this employer based on his claiming or her claiming a legitimate religious exemption as provided by ENDA. That means that if the business or organization is entitled to compete for certain grants or contracts from the Federal. State or local government. that there cannot be this subtle discrimination against the employer for claiming the religious exemption. legitimately conferred. upon the business under ENDA. I think that is really important. We do not want retaliation or discrimination or unfair treatment on either side. I commend Senator PORTMAN for coming forward with this amendment. I believe that it is consistent with the bill and that it strengthens the bill. I congratulate him for his initiative. It has been a pleasure to work with him.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise to thank the Senator from Alaska for her powerful endorsement of this bill. She is a member of the HELP Committee. Along with Senators MARK KIRK and ORRIN HATCH. she led the Republican support for this bill when it was being considered by the HELP Committee. I believe the Senator from Alaska did an extraordinary job of outlining why this bill should pass and why it must pass. It is a matter of fairness. and it is a matter of demonstrating that there is simply no place in the workplace for discrimination. It is significant that most of our large businesses and many of our smaller ones have voluntarily adopted antidiscrimination policies. They have done so because they want to attract and retain the best and brightest employees they can find. They know that sexual orientation and gender identity are irrelevant to an individuals ability to do a good job. What counts are qualifications. skills. hard work. and job performance. The legislationwhich I am very hopeful we will pass tomorrowwill help ensure that is the focus in workplaces throughout America. As the Senator from Alaska has pointed out. however. we were also very careful to respect religious freedom and liberty in this bill. I agree with her assessment that the amendment offered by Senator PORTMAN and his colleagues helps strengthen that part of the bill by prohibiting any retaliation against religious organizations or employers who legitimately qualify for an exemption under ENDA. We want to make sure those employers receive and are able to compete for Federal grants and contracts just as those employers and businesses which are not exempt under this bill can compete for Federal contracts and grants. So I believe the Portman language does strengthen the bill. I hope we are on the verge of making history tomorrow by passing this bill with a strong vote. I then hope our colleagues on the House side will follow suit. and that we can see this bill signed into law. But my purpose in rising once again today is to thank the Senator from Alaska for her strong support. and for making a very powerful argument and for sharing the experiences in her State. I am sure her words help reinforce the support for this highly significant legislation.",

I sponsored this legislationthe Digital Accountability and Transparency. or DATA. Actbecause it will significantly reform the way agencies report Federal spending. and for the first time provide checkbooktype spending data from across the Federal Government. The Federal Government spends more than $3.7 trillion each year. with more than $1 trillion being distributed as awards. However. the public cannot clearly track where this money goes. We currently have a Web siteUSASpending.govthat is supposed to show taxpayers and policymakers where the money goes. but it is not accurate. Most States already have an online portal so that taxpayers can track where their dollars are spent. and it is long past time for the Federal Government to move into the 21st century and adopt a similar system. At a recent hearing of the Budget Committee Task Force on Government Performance that I chair. it was reported that over $900 billion of direct assistance data on USASpending.gov was misreported in 2011 alone. No wonder the public has such little confidence in governmentwe cant even tell them where their tax money goes. It seems to me that the data collected by the budget shops. the accountants. the procurement offices. and grant makers all needs to be combined. reconciled. and then presented in a relevant and transparent way. These various systems should be able to work together based on financial standards so that policymakers and the public can track the full cycle of Federal spending clearly.",

There has been bipartisan support for curtailing and controlling and eventually eliminating the Iranian nuclear program. There has been bipartisan support for our friends in Israel. and we want to keep it that way. We want to make sure Congress speaks with one voice. that we are helpful when we can be. and that we offer criticism at an appropriate time. I guess the concerns we have about this agreement are that it is getting to be more like North Korea in a fashion that makes us all uncomfortable. If you interject billions of dollars into the Iranian economy now. without dismantling the centrifuges. I think you have made a huge mistake. What are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to make sure the Iranians do not have the capability to develop a nuclear weapon. The first question you have to ask: Are they trying to build a nuclear powerplanta nuclear infrastructure for commercial purposesor are they trying to create capability to produce a weapon? Trust me on this: Nobody goes about building a commercial nuclear program this way. They are trying to build a nuclear weapon. Why? Because that would give them influence in the region they have never had. It would give Iran a strong standing in the historical SunniShia conflict between the Persians and the Arabs. And as a consequence. it would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Mid East. because the Sunni Arabs are not going to allow the Shia Persians to have a nuclear capability. They also believe. fairly rationally so. if they get a nuclear weapon. the regime is probably home free. that the West is going to back off. much as we did in North Korea. So the decision of how to handle this program is probably the most important decision President Obama will make in his second term and will be one of the most important decisions the world makes for the future of our planet here going into the 21st century.",

The idea of containing a nucleararmed Iran is not a good idea. We fear they would share the technology with a terrorist group that would wind its way here to the United States.

I dont mind the Iranians having a nuclear powerplant for commercial purposes as long as the international community controls the fuel cycle.

Twice they have had to do that in order to prevent in one case Syria and another case Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons which would threaten them with extinction.

Local authorities estimate as many as 10.000 people may be dead in the Leyte Province alone. one of the hardest hit regions. The State Department has said roughly 3.000 Americans were impacted when the storm hit. Our Embassy in Manila is coordinating with U.S. agencies to locate these Americans and bring them home. The United States and the Philippines share a special bond. rooted in strong cultural and historical ties between our two countries. In Hawaii. where more than 197.000 Filipinos have made their home. we know this bond well. Our Filipino community has been a part of the islands for more than 100 years. and many at home maintain close relationships with family and friends in the Philippines. My deepest condolences go to those who have lost family and friends in this tragedy. Although the storm is over. our work has just begun. Millions of survivors are without clean drinking water. food. shelter or power. Rescue workers are attempting to reach isolated coastal communities. but debris and downed power lines are blocking road access. The U.S. Government is helping the Philippines to recover. We have provided $20 million in humanitarian aid and deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team to support the Philippine Government. These experts will help to assess the extent of the damage and determine what resources remain to be added.",

Alaska has over 20.000 Filipinos living in our Statean incredible group of individuals. people I have known in the business world. as individuals. and family members. The devastation is unbelievable as you look at the photos and see the devastation of the typhoon and the impact it has had on families there. Even though it is thousands of miles away. I can tell you. in Alaska. we feel it. we see it. Our Filipino friends there have many relatives on the islands. and the impact is just unbelievable. I was in Alaska this weekend and met with members of the leadership of the Filipino community. as well as members from the Red Cross and others to see what we can do from an Alaskan perspective. because Alaska knows what disasters are like. From earthquakes to floods. we seem to have them quite often. We know what type of impact these events have on families. so I was very happy to support the resolution my friend from Hawaii submitted. but also want to recognize the 20.000 Filipino community members in Alaska who are suffering and thinking about their families and friends overseas. We want to do everything we can. I know our country is there and ready and moving a lot of resources to assist. So I wanted to put that on the record and give my condolences to families who have lost loved ones. but also to Alaskans who are grieving for family and friends who may have been lost in the typhoon. I know personally I have done my own contributions. whatever I can to assist in moving operations forward and bringing resources to the islands.",

The Senate unanimously confirmed Judge Wald to this post on August 2. 2012. The President renominated Judge Wald to this position in March. and the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the nomination without objection months ago. During her tenure on this important oversight board. Judge Wald has served with great professionalism and dedication. And next week. she will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. the highest civilian honor that the President can bestow. For the past several months. we have been engaged in a national debate about the evergrowing need for limits on the governments surveillance powers. In the coming weeks. the House and the Senate will consider bipartisan legislation to rein in those expansive powers in an effort to protect Americans privacy and to increase transparency and oversight. While I look forward to that debate and consideration of this important legislation. it is urgent that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board continue to operate at full strength to safeguard our constitutional rights. The PCLOB has held two all day hearings on these surveillance matters in recent months. and plans to issue an important report to the President and Congress. Judge Wald has been a key participant in these proceedings. Should the Senate fail to confirm her nomination before we adjourn. however. Judge Wald would be forced to step down from the PCLOB at a critical time when the board is conducting its work to evaluate the privacy and civil liberties implications of the Nations surveillance programs. Democrats. Independents. and Republicans alike have supported the important work of this nonpartisan board. Unfortunately. a secret objection on the Republican side is needlessly delaying Judge Walds confirmation. I urge the Senate to promptly confirm this well qualified nominee. so that the PCLOB can carry out its important responsibilities. If a single Republican Senator has a concern about Judge Patricia Walds impeccable credentials. they should come forward with the reason they are holding up her confirmation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Cigarette trafficking is a very lucrative crime both here in the United States and abroad. It is estimated that illicit cigarettes account for over 10 percent of the more than 5.7 trillion cigarettes sold globally each year. Here in the United States alone. approximately 4 billion of the cigarettes sold each year are illicit. Cigarette smuggling is generally carried out by large criminal organizations that take advantage of the significant disparity between the taxes levied on cigarettes across the States. These differences create a highly lucrative market for individuals to evade State and local sales taxes by purchasing cigarettes in one locality and transporting them to another for resale below market value. It is estimated that criminals can make a profit of as much as $1 million on just a single truckload of illicit cigarettes. Cigarette smuggling is not just profitable for criminal networks. this crime also harms State and Federal revenues. According to the Justice Department. this illicit activity costs the States and the Federal Government an estimated $5 billion each year. This is money that could and should be put to better use. In 2009. Congress took steps to curb contraband cigarettes with the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking. or PACT. Act. The PACT Act prohibits the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products over the Internet and made changes to the criminal anticigarette smuggling statutes. H.R. 338. the Stop Tobacco Smuggling in the Territories Act of 2013. provides a technical correction to ensure that the criminal prohibitions against cigarette smuggling apply to the U.S. territories of American Samoa. Guam. and the Northern Mariana Islands just as they do in the rest of the country. Without this fix. cigarettes sold in these territories without evidence that taxes were paid do not fall within the definition of \"contraband cigarettes.\" This is a modest but important change that will help to discourage crime and increase tax revenues in these United States territories. I want to thank Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA for his work on this issue. as well as the ranking member on the full committee and the subcommittee for their support of this effort. and the chairman of the Crime Subcommittee. Mr. SENSENERENNER. as well. and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 338. the Stop Tobacco Smuggling in the Territories Act of 2013. This bill is simple and straightforward. It amends the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act by including American Samoa. the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. and Guam in this act. Currently. the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act makes it illegal to knowingly ship. transport. receive. possess. sell. distribute. or purchase 10.000 or more contraband cigarettes that do not have a State or territorial tax stamp. The act similarly applies to the sale of contraband smokeless tobacco in excess of certain specified quantities. With respect to both activities. the act authorizes the imposition of criminal penalties and fines. As drafted. however. the bill does not apply to American Samoa. the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. and Guam. Thus. the Bureau of Alcohol. Tobacco. Firearms. and Explosives is prohibited from investigating Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act violations in those territories. H.R. 338 will cure this obvious oversight. Mr. Speaker. cigarettes are believed to be the most illegally trafficked product in the world. In 2006 alone. more than 10 percent of worldwide sales. or 600 billion cigarettes. were counterfeited. Contraband cigarettes actually present numerous issues. Legally manufactured cigarettes are diverted from legal trade channels in the underworld for resale. evading the imposition of appropriate taxes. costing territorial governments a significant amount of cigarette excess tax revenue each year. They also facilitate unfair competition that hurts the bottom line of legitimate businesses. Counterfeit cigarettes are also not subjected to any manufacturing safeguards. therefore presenting the potential for products containing toxic ingredients that can seriously jeopardize the health and safety of the smoker. The lower price also facilitates easier affordability for our youth. resulting in addiction at earlier ages. The illicit trade therefore adds steadily to the health care costs of worker productivity losses and the growing death from tobacco use. Currently. the use of tobacco claims 5.4 million lives a year. This number is projected to rise to 8 million by 2013. For these reasons. I strongly support H.R. 338 and thank our colleague from American Samoa. Delegate FALEOMAVAEGA. for his leadership in spearheading this issue. Accordingly. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

    "speech": "the senior ranking member. for their support of this proposed bill. I would especially also like to thank JIM SENSENBRENNER. the chairman of the subcommittee. and the gentleman from Virginia. my good friend. for their support in the subcommittee. I also want to acknowledge Speaker JOHN BOEHNER. Majority Leader CANTOR. and our Democratic leader. NANCY PELOSI. for their support. Mr. Speaker. my district faces a serious problem with tobacco smuggling. According to a recent study. in 2010 alone. as many as 5.8 million cigarettes were smuggled into the territory. The study found that tobacco smuggling resulted in the loss of about $725.000 in revenues to the territory. If continued undeterred. tobacco smuggling in the territory will lead to heavier losses in local tax revenues. especially if the cigarette excise tax rate were to be increased. Mr. Speaker. securing and sustaining stable sources of local revenue stream is essential and must be encouraged for the territories. as it has already done for the States. It was for this reason I began to look into this important issue. I was disappointed. however. to find that under the current law prohibiting cigarette smuggling. not all the territories were included. Under the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act that Congress passed in 1978. it is illegal to ship. sell. transport. or possess more than 10.000 cigarettes per month not bearing the tax stamp of the jurisdiction in which they are found. Violation is a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and seizure of the contraband cigarettes and/or both. The Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act currently. however. does not apply to American Samoa. the territory of Guam. and the Northern Mariana Islands. Historically. when Congress considered the bill in 1978. the Senate version defined \"State\" to include the 50 States. the District of Columbia. Puerto Rico. or a territory or possession of the United States. however. the House provision excluded the smaller territories. For some reason unbeknownst to me. the conference substitute adopted the House provision. The conference report describes the House provision as \"more accurately delineating the practical scope of the legislation.\" Mr. Speaker. the bill before us today will correct this oversight under the current law. This important piece of legislation will amend the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act to include these territories. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.",

Specifically. H.R. 338 provides that American Samoa. the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and Guam will be covered by the current Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act. which makes it illegal to knowingly ship. transport. receive. possess. sell. distribute. or purchase 10.000 or more contraband cigarettes that do not have a state or territorial tax stamp. Currently. only the 50 states. Washington. DC. Puerto Rico. and the Virgin Islands are covered by the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act. We all understand the dangers associated with cigarette smoking and its prevalence in the United States. This bill seeks to treat the aforementioned territories like any other state when it comes to trafficking. Roughly 23 percent of American adults and 30 percent of adolescents are current smokers. Every day. 3.500 minors try smoking for the first time. one thousand of whom go on to become regular. daily smokers. Moreover. more than 15.5 million children are exposed to secondhand smoke at home. Smoking kills more people than alcohol. AIDS. car accidents. illegal drugs. murders. and suicides combined. with thousands more dying from spit tobacco use. About one of every five American deaths is related to smoking. or about 400.000 Americans each year. Tragically. about 50.000 adult nonsmokers in the nation die each year from exposure to secondhand smoke. More deaths are caused each year by tobacco use than by all deaths from HIV. illegal drug use. alcohol use. car accidents. suicides. and murders combined. More than 8.6 million Americans currently suffer from smokingcaused illness. and over six million Americans under the age of 18 who are alive today are estimated to ultimately die from smoking. In addition. smokers lose an average of 13 to 14 years of life because of their smoking. We must do more to dissuade people from smoking.",

Ohio as it celebrates 110 years of worship in the historic Birmingham neighborhood of Toledos East Side. Worshipers will come together in a special celebration on Sunday. September 29. 2013. Toledos Birmingham neighborhood was established and grew when Hungarian workers were relocated from Cleveland to Toledo to work in foundries. More and more Hungarian workers came to Toledo and the neighborhood E1402 quickly established itself. In 1891. these immigrants founded the Magyar Reformed Church. The building was designed by local architect T. W. Matz and was completed in 1901. Echoing features of Hungarian village churches. its design is that of Hungarian NeoBaroque church. with a tower. four round arched windows and roundshaped clocks pointing to each cardinal direction. The Hungarian coatofarms can be found on the bottom of each of the stained glass windows. The church stands still at its original location at the corner of Bogar and Bakewell Streets in Toledo. The church was incorporated by the State of Ohio as the Hungarian Church of Toledo on June 16. 1903. The name was changed to Calvin United Church of Christ in 1962. Since its beginning. Calvin United Church of Christ has been an anchor of Toledos East Side and its Birmingham neighborhood. Its members are community leaders and the church is a good neighbor. Following the Scriptures call in 1 Chronicles 16:9 to \"Sing to Him. sing praises to Him. meditate on and talk of all His wondrous works and devoutly praise them!\" Calvin United Church of Christs faithful have lived Christs Word across three centuries and continue a proud tradition in its neighborhood. We are pleased to congratulate the congregation as it approaches its 110th anniversary. and look forward to its efforts in Christs service for years to come.",

It is the primary responsibility of governing bodies. no matter how big or small: to pass a budget and appropriate tax dollars so the government can function. As a government shutdown is unacceptable to me. its important to let the American people know that should it happen. Members of Congress wont continue cashing in while Americans pay the price. Americans know that getting paid should be tied to getting the job done. This legislation. like No Budget. No Pay says its time lawmakers be held accountable.

    "speech": "seeks to end that stalemate by putting a new idea on the table that respects the equities and responds to the arguments of all. This bill creates an AM/FM performance right. to match the digital right that already exists in law. This would jumpstart meaningful private negotiations for all. The FMRAs solution for royalty setting is the one the broadcasters have called for: let the market decide. But it also provides equal rights and bargaining power to both sides by allowing recording artists to reject offers they find unacceptablesomething they currently cannot do under the copyright laws because the compulsory license requires them to make their music available. To implement this free market approach. the bill would repeal the existing compulsory license. Internet radio says it pays too much. that the current \"willing buyer. willing seller\" standard results in rates that are too high. Under this bill. they may negotiate any rates they can. While Congress will establish a right. it will get out of the business of essentially establishing a price for that right. The value of music will be determined by the market. There are of course many useful features of the current system that we should retain. Radio services have been able to use the compulsory licensing as onestop licensing. allowing them to get access to any music they wish to use at an established price. To preserve that convenience to radio. the bill empowers broadcasters. and rights holders with SoundExchange as their agent. to collectively negotiate a onestop licensing rate that will be available to all. Broadcasters and music creators are also free to negotiate separately alternative arrangements on top of those backstop terms. Current law also contains critical protections for artists requiring that they receive a statutorily mandated fair share of performance royalties and that those royalties be paid directly to them through SoundExchange. The bill retains those requirements. In 2009. we hoped all stakeholders could reach an agreement that would end the years of waiting for fair pay for airplay. This proposal makes it in everyones interest to reach such an agreement.",

And whatever we imagined would pale by comparison to reality. Kirk Nobel Bloodsworth. who I am privileged to call a friend. was the victim of such a horrific miscarriage of justice. He served 9 years for the rape and murder of a young girl he never met. based on the mistaken identification by one of Kirks neighbors. Eyewitness identifications. assumed to be among the best evidence. are notoriously unreliable. Case after case demonstrates this. Take the massive search currently underway for Christopher Dorner. the former Los Angeles police officer suspected in three killings. The police have been inundated with numerous false \"sightings.\" Kirk Bloodsworth is a free man today not because the justice system worked. For 9 years it failed miserably. and during that time the real killer was free. Rather. he had to prove his innocence thanks to DNA evidence. which is not available in most cases. One shudders to think of the number of factually innocent people who may be serving long sentences for whom exoneration through DNA testing isnt an option. A February 5. 2013. article in the New York Times quotes Kirk: \"The adversarial system doesnt know whos guilty or whos innocent. The millstone doesnt know whos under it.\" That article. entitled \"A Death Penalty Fight Comes Home.\" is notable because it describes the campaign Kirk is helping to lead to abolish the death penalty in Maryland. the State where he was convicted and sent to death row. Kirk is an example of someone who was subjected to the basest indignities and humiliation. and who then came back to inspire others to prevent future unjust convictions. It is the mark of a man of extraordinary character and courage. who deserves our praise and admiration. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the RECORD.",

There is no need to blame any more about this terrible fiscal policy which we are about to sustain. You see. acrosstheboard cuts that the looming sequester will implement in a couple of weeks are bad policy and a result of bad politics. I believe that we must cut spending. and I rise here in support of careful. targeted cuts.

Its a shame that more than 26.000 special education students will see cuts to their education in Florida while government agencies are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on conferences in Las Vegas. Nevada. And it is a shame that more than 35.000 health care workers in Florida are projected to lose their jobs while more than $115 billion was lost in improper payments from this government in just one year. We must ask ourselves. for every $1 that we are going to spend. is it worth mortgaging and borrowing our childrens and our grandchildrens future for 41 cents for every one of those dollars. I submit to you that it is not. Lets rectify this situation.

That shock wave may not have been so destructive if credit rating agencies like Standard & Poors did not create fraud. Rather than assessing real risk and due diligence on the securities. Standard & Poors invented a system of defrauding investors by providing the highest rating as long as the clients paid Standard & Poors enough money. If Standard & Poors actually rated the mortgage securities for what they were truly worth. our entire banking system and economy may not have collapsed. While the Department of Justice should be praised for taking some action against Standard & Poors. other rating agencies were left out of the case. And the fact is Justices case is only a civil one. not a criminal one. That tells you who really holds political power in our country. Thanks to Wall Street. America lost over 8 million jobs. American households lost over $19 trillion in wealth. Yet no major Wall Street executive has ever faced the threat of jail time.

In addition to that. she is never been reluctant to gather donations in that same way for families who cannot afford to pay for the funerals and burials of their loved ones.

Their names have become synonymous with statesmanship and a deep commitment to public service. These two giants leave behind legislative records that are unmatched in scope and length. When HENRY WAXMAN served as Chairman of the Energy and Commerce CommitteeI had the good fortune of working closely with him on so many of the issues we care about. Whether it was expanding access to affordable healthcare. or ensuring that our environment is protected. HENRY was at the forefront of so much important progress. His leadership on the Affordable Care Act and his championing of Medicare and Medicaid improvements will be remembered as some of his greatest accomplishments in this body. While he has certainly been a friend to us. he has also been a friend to so many who he has never met: the elderly. the infirmed. and those most vulnerable to whom he has dedicated his career. Few people in this country have done more for Americas children than GEORGE MILLER. With a special focus on children from underserved and lowincome communities. GEORGE fought tirelessly to fight economic inequalities and to expand opportunities for young people who otherwise would not have had them. From fighting for a stronger k12 education law to ensuring that people can live on a meaningful minimum wage. GEORGE MILLER has dedicated his career to giving voice to the American worker. Both of these leaders are proud sons of California. and throughout their careers they have truly lived up to the term \"Representative.\" I look forward to seeing how they will continue to use their talents. knowledge and passions to better serve our nation in the years ahead.

Under this system. some PEOs claim the credit themselves as the statutory employer. others administer the credit for the restaurants which they serve. and some restaurants claim the credit directlyonly to be challenged in IRS audits.

One hundred years ago this month. soldiers on the Western Front came together to unofficially pause hostilities and celebrate the Christmas holiday without regard for country lines or battle lines. The truce gave armies on both sides an opportunity to bury their fallen comrades. as well as share some festive cheer while far away from their homes and families. Reports from soldiers on the front lines were that soldiers engaged in singing carols. sharing food and other provisions. and even lighthearted games. One of the most wellknown aspects of the Christmas Truce is the impromptu football game that took place among the men. Many football clubs to this day recognize the Christmas Truce by holding commemorative games. and this years historic anniversary will feature a number of recognitions in the sporting world. The Christmas Truce has always inspired me as a reminder that it is possible for opponents to look beyond their differences and see each other as people. but I have a more personal connection as well. My greatgrandfather was one of the soldiers present during the Christmas Truce. and his story and his experiences have been passed down as family lore. Ive also been drawn to this years commemorations by my good friend Don Mullan. an Irish author who has been championing worldwide celebrations of this proud moment in world history. Don has been developing a Christmas Truce and Flanders Peace Field Project in Messines. Belgium in partnership with the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace and UNESCO. This project has gained the support of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. and will help ensure that the Christmas Truce. and more importantly. the lessons it has taught us. will always be remembered. I hope that this holiday season. wherever we are. we can all take a moment to remember the Christmas Truce and to remind ourselves of a time when soldiers laid down their weapons and recognized how essential it is to value humanity. The Christmas Truce is a symbol of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. and reminds us that even in the darkest times. we should always strive toward peace.",

I am concerned that requiring government law enforcement agencies to show foreseeable harm that is not \"speculative or abstract\" when invoking FOIA exemptions for attorneyclient. workproduct. and deliberative process privileges will undermine law enforcement efforts. Hundreds of years of American legal tradition has generally protected workproduct documents and attorneyclient communications from the discovery process in civil litigation. Further. the deliberative process privilege has allowed government agencies law enforcers to freely exchange ideas and legal strategies as part of their internal decision making process. I am concerned that the bill could have a \"chilling effect\" on internal communications and deliberations of agencies law enforcement personnel who are preparing law enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers. in order to avoid the prospect of increased litigation. We do not want to hinder the robust. internal exchange of rigorous ideas and legal strategies within government agencies when they are bringing enforcement actions.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I ask consent to engage in a colloquy with Senator LEAHY. chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. regarding important aspects of S. 2520. the FOIA Improvement Act of While I support the ultimate goal of this legislation. which seeks to increase government transparency. as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. I am also mindful of the need for government agencies to dutifully and carefully fulfill their oversight responsibilities of our Nations financial institutions and the health and welfare of our financial systems atlarge. Financial regulatory agencies are tasked with ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system. compliance with Federal consumer financial law. and promoting fair. orderly. and efficient financial markets. A critical component of effective oversight is the ability of a financial regulator to have unfettered access to information from a regulated institution. A financial institution should not have to fear that its regulator will be unable to protect the institutions confidential information from disclosure. Since the passage of the Freedom of Information Act. Congress has recognized the importance of protecting this type of supervisory information as evidenced specifically in 5 U.S.C. \ufffd 552(b)(8). commonly referred to as Exemption 8. and more generally in other exemptions. It is my understanding that nothing in S. 2520 is intended to limit the scope of the protections under Exemption 8. or other exemptions relevant to financial regulators. nor is the bill intended to require release of confidential information about individuals or information that a financial institution may have. the release of which could compromise the stability of the financial institution or the financial system. or undermine the consumer protection work by the regulators. Given that the release of confidential or sensitive information relating to oversight of regulated entities could cause harm to such entities. individuals. or the financial system. a financial regulatory agency could reasonably foresee that disclosure of such information requested under FOIA may harm an interest protected by Exemption 8. This is precisely why Congress continues to provide these statutory exemptions.",

    "speech": "I thank Senator JOHNSON for his remarks and for his interest and support for this legislation. I agree that it is important to ensure that our financial regulators are able to do the work required to maintain the safety and soundness of our financial institutions. I also agree that the free flow of information between regulators and financial institution is important to this process. Exemption 8 was intended by Congress. and has been interpreted by the courts. to be very broadly construed to ensure the security of financial institutions and to safeguard the relationship between financial institutions and their supervising agencies. The proposed amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. FOIA. are not intended to undermine the broad protection in Exemption 8 or to undermine the integrity of the supervisory examination process. Moreover. much of the information that the government is permitted to withhold under Exemption 8. is also protected under Exemption 4. which exempts from disclosure commercial and financial information that is privileged or confidential. Exemption 4 covers information prohibited from disclosure under the Trade Secrets Act and similar laws. and as such does not provide for discretionary disclosure under FOIA. As with other exemptions that are based on separate legal restrictions. it is understood that the foreseeable harm standard will not apply to most of the information falling under Exemption 4. I will address these concerns. and I appreciate all the time and attention the Senator from South Dakota has given to this important legislation.",

Senator FEINSTEIN and the members and staff of the Intelligence Committee have provided that. The findings of this report are truly remarkable. laying bare that the CIA interrogation program was simultaneously far more brutal and far less effective than previously claimed. This 600page report is long overdue and makes clear that the CIAs socalled \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" failed to produce any otherwise unavailable intelligence that saved lives. At no time were these coercive interrogation techniques effective. But more critically. this report makes clear to all Americans that what took place was not in keeping with our ideals as a nation. We have no greater duty than to protect the American people and our national security. But the single best way to do that isand always has beento do that in a manner consistent with our laws and our traditions.

Ms. Clemencia Spizzirri was recently announced as the 2015 Iowa Teacher of the Year. This award honors the great work she has done as a foreign language teacher at Merrill Middle School in Des Moines. IA. Ms. Spizzirri has been teaching Spanish to eager young minds at Merrill Middle School for 5 years. Despite her relatively short time there. her profound impact is evident. The high praise she receives from her students. colleagues. and community members are a testament to the work ethic and passion she displays in her classroom every schoolday. As an immigrant herself. Ms. Spizzirri embodies the importance of a broadbased education that helps students understand the world beyond their own country. Born in Quito. Ecuadors capital city. Ms. Clemencia was the youngest of seven children. She learned quickly that success was nearly impossible without a quality education. This drove her to become a teacher. She witnessed firsthand the struggles that accompany poverty and knew she could make a difference through teaching. She started her career teaching English in Quito. When the conditions in her country began to worsen. she obtained a visa and moved to the United States. After immigrating to this country. Ms. Spizzirri received a bachelors degree in New York. She then moved to Des Moines. IA. where she received her masters degree from Drake University. Ms. Spizzirri attributes her passion for educating young minds to unfortunate circumstances she has witnessed in her own life. This passion ensures a quality education for all her students and contributes wellrounded citizens to the community. Great teachers are an invaluable resource to all of our communities and Ms. Spizzirri deserves nothing but praise for her tremendous work. I thank Ms. Spizzirri for her service to the people of her community and wish her nothing but the best in her future school years and beyond.",

Since its inception. this program has offered the opportunity for schools in every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments in closing the achievement gaps among student groups. Recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education is based on a school being measured as either an \"Exemplary High Performing School\"-where schools are among the States highest scorers in English and mathematicsor as an \"Exemplary Achievement Gap Closing School\"-where schools with at least 40 percent of their student body coming from disadvantaged backgrounds have reduced the achievement gap in English and mathematics within the last 5 years. St. Patrick School has made great strides in the area of improved proficiency in both English and mathematics. As a Four Star School. St. Patricks takes great care to integrate elements of Catholic faith into its curriculum. Consisting of strong morals. a deeply rooted faith in community. and a strong sense of respectful conduct. the staff at St. Patrick challenges its students to put their faith into action through community service and social engagement on global issues.

This bill drastically underfunds critical transportation and housing programs. The bills cuts to the TIGER program are particularly egregious.

The Republican bill cuts TIGER from the 2014 level of $600 million down to a mere $100 million in 2015. Moreover. the bill includes restrictive language that limits TIGER grants by excluding public transit. passenger rail. bicycle. and pedestrian projects. Public transit is an essential part of a modern transportation system. A previous TIGER grant helped the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accelerate the construction of the Crenshaw/LAX Transit Corridor. a light rail project that will reduce traffic congestion and improve transportation service in my district. Under the bills restrictive language. this innovative project would never have qualified for a grant. TIGER needs to be expanded. not restricted. not cut.

TIGER grants have invested. as my colleagues have pointed out. in road. in rail. transit. and port projects that achieve vital national objectives all across this great Nation. Yet. the bill before us not only imposes a savage cut to the program. it restricts the use of these grants to highway. bridge. port. and freight rail intermodal projects only. It says that these are the only projects that can get done. meaning that transit. passenger rail. bike and pedestrian paths would no longer be eligible. Mr. Chairman. we face an infrastructure crisis in this country. The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that we need to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020 to bring our Nations infrastructure back to good condition. We also face a job crisis in this country. and TIGER creates jobs. A study last year on the Economic Impact of Public Transportation Investment found that every $1 billion invested supports 21.800 jobs. and these are jobs that cannot be outsourced. It generates $3 billion of additional business sales. and $432 million in Federal. State. and local tax revenues. We need to invest in our national infrastructure. We need to support projects that make our communities more livable and sustainable. In this projects history. we have found that so many of our colleagues in Arkansas and Illinois. Ohio. Minnesota.

Since its formation in 1974 as a member of the North American Soccer League (NASL). the Sounders have consistently brought worldclass soccer to our region. After decades of play in other leagues. Sounders FC was added as a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion team in 2007. As a nod to the teams history. the notoriously loyal Sounders fans voted to keep the traditional team name alive even after changing leagues. Since joining the league. the Sounders and their fans have set MLS records year in and year out. In every season of their tenure in the MLS the Sounders have led the league in both average attendance and number of season tickets sold. This loud and passionate fan base at every game has spurred the Sounders on to stellar play. and they have reached the playoffs in each of their four seasons as a result. The soccer pitch is not the only place that members of Sounders FC have achieved excellence. Many members of the organization have undertaken efforts to better the community they call home. Through partnerships with organizations focused on youth and sports. and through a 2013 trip by team members to Tanzania with the Washington Global Health Alliance. the Seattle Sounders have done much more than just play outstanding soccerthey have made a difference in our region and across the world. Mr. Speaker. it is with great admiration that I recognize the Seattle Sounders FootballClub on forty years of excellence. both on and off the soccer pitch. E1506 Friday.

Gruber. a key architect of the legislation. called the lack of transparency involved in passing ObamaCare \"a huge political advantage.\" President Obama has claimed that his administration is the most transparent administration in history. but statements like Grubers indicate otherwise. It is long past time for Congress to require transparency from the executive branch. Earlier this year. a bipartisan majority in the House passed my bill. H.R. 899. the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. which we call UMITA. This bipartisan legislation would improve transparency and public disclosure of the true costs in dollars and in jobs that Federal dictates pose to the economy. Asking the Federal Government to disclose the cost of a mandate in addition to its benefits should not be controversial. It is just plain common sense. Mr. Speaker.

I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of H.R. 4194. the Government Reports Elimination Act. as amended. I also want to thank my good friend. Chairman DARRELL ISSA. for his bipartisan approach to this bill. This bill will bring greater efficiency to the overall government of the United States. Congress often requires reports from executive branch agencies. and these reports can be a valuable tool to scrutinize performance and assess agency goals. However. with the passage of time. reporting requirements can become outdated. unnecessary. or duplicative. Congress and the executive branch have recognized that improved coordination across the Federal Government benefits both the taxpayer and the government. In 2010. Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act. That act requires the Office of Management and Budget to publish a list of plans or reports that are produced by the executive branch pursuant to congressional mandate. The act also requires the administration to identify potentially outdated or duplicative plans and reports. and to provide views on whether they should be eliminated. In January 2013 the Office of Management and Budget produced a list of more than 300 plans and reports that are potentially outdated or duplicative. Majority and minority staffs of our committee worked together to review this list. During this process. the views of all other committees of jurisdiction were also considered. A similar process occurred in the Senate. H.R. 4194. as amended. would eliminate the statutory requirements to prepare reports that are produced by 17 different Federal agencies. Implementing H.R. 4194 would reduce the administrative costs of these agencies by reducing the number of reports that must be prepared and printed. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementing the bill would save about $1 million over the next 5 years. H.R. 4194 provides for greater efficiency and a more effective Federal Government. Mr. Speaker. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time.",

I think that is exactly the situation we have here. I look forward to working with the majority and minority leaders offices to make sure that this is an annual event until we reach a point where there are zero pieces of reports coming to the Congress that are unread. unused. or unnecessary.

Nearly $104 million in food stamps were redeemed at military commissaries in fiscal year 2013. yet the majority has repeatedly failed to bring the extension of unemployment insurance to a vote. Since it expired last year. more than 2 million individuals. including 200.000 veterans. have been cut off from this vital lifeline. I know firsthand how important this program is for hardworking veterans. After I completed flight school and returned home to Illinois. I relied on unemployment insurance to help me transition back to civilian life. The unemployment rate for veterans recently separated from the military is now sitting at 10 percent. 246.000 veterans who served since 9111 are now out of work. For those coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan. this transition has been especially challenging. They have enough to worry about without suffering from cuts to unemployment insurance. Taking an upordown vote on extending unemployment insurance is the right thing to do. Mr. Speaker. We need to renew this for those searching for jobs and those who are getting back on their feet. Our veterans and unemployed have not given up on finding work. and we cannot give up on them.",

Some want to drastically change them. and others want to eliminate them altogether. Over the past 6 months. we have seen $19 billion in cuts to SNAP alone. our Nations premier antihunger program. Participation in SNAP reached an alltime high a few years ago because of the Great Recession. the worst economic period since the Great Depression. That is because people were either unemployed or underpaid. If you want to reduce SNAP participation. it is simple: put more people back to work and better paying jobs. Yesterday. the Center for American Progress released a report showing how easy one step is. They found that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 would move about 3.5 million people off of SNAP. simply because they wouldnt need it. We shouldnt arbitrarily cut antipoverty programs like SNAP. We must make commonsense changes like increasing the minimum wage if we are truly going to end hunger in this country.",

I chaired the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe from 1985 to 1995. It was an extraordinary era. where the Soviet Union crumbled under the weight of its bad economic system and its political terrorism. It is starting to rear its ugly head again. President Obama and Secretary Kerry have made it very clearand we need to make it very clearthat Russia cannot interfere in Ukraine without serious costs. and when I say. \"serious costs.\" I mean exactly that. it cannot be empty words. It cannot be \"you ought not to.\" It needs to be \"you must not.\" and \"we will not allow.\" Last week. the President proposed sanctions and travel bans against Russian leaders complicit in their militarys intrusion into Crimea. If Russia were to annex Crimea. those costs would rise. A referendum has no legitimacy when there are military forces in the streets. In any event. as I said. I chaired the Helsinki Commission. The Helsinki Final Act. passed in July of 1975 and signed by President Ford. said emphatically and explicitly that borders cannot be changed other than by political and peaceful means. Military incursion is not an option. This resolution will send a powerful message on behalf of the American people. The people of Ukraine who want to build a future based on democracy and freedom will hear us and be strengthened by our support. How do I know that?

With this right comes also the freedom from persecution and different treatment under the law. This body has long recognized the freedom of religion and has worked to ensure individuals of all faiths are treated fairly under the law. Even the Affordable Care Act. which imposes the burden of mandating the purchase of insurance. includes a religious conscience exemption from that individual mandate. However. this exemption is not fairly distributed to all Americans. While covering many faiths. it doesnt cover all who seek protection. What the EACH Act does is to ensure that this exemption equally applies to every American who wants it. It also protects individuals First Amendment rights from being placed in jeopardy because of a requirement to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. This is commonsense fairness legislation that extends a fundamental right to all Americans that have religious objections to standard medical care. This is a chance for us to right a wrong that I believe was just a drafting oversight. Of course. we ensure that the government doesnt impose a $1.5 billion tax on Americans simply because of their religious beliefs.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of the EACH Act on behalf of my constituents in Massachusetts that are seeking to continue to take advantage of the religious conscience exemption to the individual mandate that is currently provided to them under the 2006 Massachusetts health reform law. Since the individual mandate went into effect in Massachusetts. Donna Smiley. a Christian Scientist from Centerville. has taken advantage of the religious exemption provided in the law that prevents her from being penalized for her religious beliefs. Each year on her state tax return. the form has included a section for her to attest that because of her sincerely held religious beliefs she has chosen not to purchase medical health insurance. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Donna would no longer be able to take advantage of the Massachusetts religious conscience exemption and would be penalized by the federal government for not having insurance. The EACH Act. modeled after the process that has been in place in Massachusetts for the past seven years. would ensure that a fair solution is reached so that Donna and other Americans are not penalized for their religious beliefs next year. The legislation would modestly expand the religious conscience exemption in the Affordable Care Act to certain individuals who have sincere religious beliefs against medical insurance and related medical care. As we saw in Massachusetts. which served as the model for the Affordable Care Act as well as the EACH Act. it is clear that a similar exemption in no way adversely affected the risk pool or generated a rise in abuse or fraud. According to the most recent report from Massachusetts health insurance exchange. approximately 0.1% of the population or 6.500 residents apply annually for a religious exemption. Allowing for this narrow exemption to the Affordable Care Act is the fair and equitable path forward to ensure religious diversity.

I rise today in support of H.R. 3474. the Hire More Heroes Act. introduced by Representative RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. The Hire More Heroes Act will help ease the burden on small businesses while incentivizing them to hire veterans who have found themselves out of work as they return home from overseas. President Obama has repeatedly said: If youve got good ideas. bring them to me lets go. Well. Mr. President. here is a really good idea. So lets go. Our veterans have sacrificed for our country. and as they return home they deserve opportunities and they deserve a job. One thing I routinely hear from my communities back home is that entrepreneurs want to invest in America and they want to grow their businesses. Well. here is an opportunity to do both. Too often. we use the term that something is a winwin. Well. I can think of no better term. This is a win for businesses who need workers with outstanding skills and ethics. and a win for veterans who just want a job. The Hire More Heroes Act allows businesses that hire a veteran enrolled in TRICARE or through the VA to not count that veteran towards the 50employee threshold for triggering the ACA employee mandate. The 50employee threshold has been a big disincentive for small businesses to grow. If they have more than 50 workers. they fall under that mandate. and their costs go up. So firms with 45. 46. 47 workers are very reluctant to grow any bigger. but if they hire a veteran. under this legislation. that wont count for purposes of determining if they have enough workers to trigger the mandate. If that isnt an incentive to hire more veterans. I dont know what it is. These are veterans who already have health care. They just want and deserve a job.

Books for Africa shipped more than 2.2 million books to 22 African countries. Ending the book famine in Africa is the mission that led Thomas Warth to found Books for Africa. Troubled by a chronic shortage of books in Africa and the reality that 40 percent of schoolage children do not attend school. Mr. Warth put his vision and enthusiasm into an ongoing commitment to transform lives by facilitating the shipment of container after container of books that put real books in the hands of real people. By sending textbooks to areas with empty shelves and into the hands of children eager to read. learn. and explore the world of literature. Books for Africa is making a difference in the lives of young people. Books for Africa is promoting literacy. and empowering the next generation to break the endless cycle of poverty that will improve quality of life. This success would not have been possible without the joint partnership of public and private sectors. Books for Africa frequently works with USAID. Peace Corps. and the Sir Emeka Offor Foundation to deliver books. Together with the generous support of publishers. schools. libraries. organizations and individuals who donate books. Books for Africa is making a positive impact in the lives of people in African countries. Mr. Speaker. in honor of Thomas Warth and the dedicated staff. partners. donors. board. and volunteers. I am pleased to submit this recognizing the 25th anniversary of Books for Africa.",

This does not call for a declaration of war or any kinds of the. I think exaggerated responses Ive heard in favor of this amendment. This says that the President should have a course of action. The President earlier stated that there are red lines concerning weapons of mass destruction. I believe. if the news today is correct. then belatedly maybe there is a step toward recognizing that and taking some action for red lines just in the last few hours. But weve been working on this amendment. we debated it in committee. because up until now. and even going forwardIm not sure how muchthere hasnt been very much planning. There hasnt been a stated plan or a course of action by the administration. We need to have that in place. We can and should and will debate this further. But the administration. I believe. has been lacking in leadershiptoo much leading from behind. as weve seen in other places. There needs to be leadership. This is a volatile area of the worldtheres no question about that.

This bipartisan amendment will end the permanent basing of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment in Germany and return that brigade combat team to the United States. without permanent replacement. There is no longer a strategic reason to maintain our current troop numbers in Europe. This action will still leave one brigade combat team and one combat aviation brigade in Europe. Nothing in this amendment demands the removal of our European medical facilities or rapid response forces. Should a crisis occur. it is not the BCTs that will be called to respond. In fact. just last month. the U.S. moved marines from a crisisresponse force to Italy in anticipation that it could be needed to respond to growing unrest in Libya. In an emergency. expeditionary forces. such as the Marine Corp Special MAG Task Force and FAST teams. or even the Armys 82nd Airborne. would be called to action. not the BCTs in Germany. Only 4 out of 28 NATO allies spend even the required 2 percent of their GDP on defense. The U.S. spends 4.7 percent. Our allies keep defense spending low because they take for granted that we will guarantee their security. This is an unfair burden to U.S. tax payers.

First. the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty undermines our Second Amendment rights by omitting the fundamental. individual right to keep and bear arms and imposing a national responsibility to prevent firearms diversion. thus opening the door to new gun control measures. Secondly. the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty undermines our sovereignty by imposing vague. readily politicized requirements on the United States and inviting United Nationsled investigations into what U.S. policymakers knew or should have known regarding arms transfers that allegedly violate the United Nations arms trade treaty.

Madam Chairman. was taken in Tahrir Square a few years ago now when the people were peacefully demonstrating to overcome the Mubarak regime which had oppressed them for so many years. Theyre holding up tear gas. and it says \"Made in America\" on it. When our government transferred those riot and antiriot materials to that government. I believe we didnt have any reason to know that it would be misused by a tyrannical regime to oppress and down press peaceful demonstrators. I propose. though. that when our government has reason to know that there is a tyrannical regime using repressive techniques to put down their peaceful demonstrators. that our government should withhold exports of that nature. The fact is that the tyranny that people lived under under Hosni Mubarak was not made in America. It was made by Hosni Mubarak. But we should not be implicated in the kind of oppression if we know about it. and therefore I think we should have the authority in our government to withhold those kinds of transfers when they come to our attention. So the young man holding up this tear gas canister that police fired at the prodemocracy demonstrators is labeled \"Made in the USA.\" This is a misrepresentation because it was Mubarak who oppressed his own people. but we should not be implicated in this. particularly if we have reason to know. Madam Chairman. this is not the message we should be sending.

Unfortunately. the Obama administration has failed to proceed on Taiwans top request: the F16/CD aircraft. Taiwan has an aging fixedwing aircraft fleet. and with the growing military gap across the Taiwan Strait. it is critical that we sell them this aircraft. Our bipartisan amendment does just that by requiring the President to move forward on the sale of no fewer than 66 F16/CDs.

Mexico. as they celebrate fifty years of mutually beneficial cooperation and friendship through the Sister City Program. Officially chartered by the United StatesMexico Sister Cities Association in 1964. the partnership between Oxnard and Ocotlin is one of the longest continuous Sister City relationships. As we reflect on fifty years of harmonious interaction. it is clear that the cities have been successful in their original mission to promote good will. friendship. and mutual understanding. These many years of welcoming cooperation between the two cities have built a strong foundation of reciprocal admiration and respect between people and communities of different countries. Throughout the last fifty years. the Sister City program has established strong economic. educational. and cultural bonds. benefitting the people of both Oxnard and Ocotldn alike. The Sister City Committee has facilitated many donations of safety equipment. medical supplies. library books. and even three fire trucks. which provided the City of Ocotldn with the ability to establish its first fire department. When disaster struck Ocotldn after the 1992 earthquake. the City of Oxnard gladly assisted in emergency fundraising efforts. The Sister City program has also extended many opportunities benefitting students from both cities. Ocotldn students participated in the Oxnard Union High School Districts baseball tournaments in 1988 and 1989. and students in the Oxnard High School Band traveled to Ocotldn in 1993 and 1996 to help the city establish its first marching band. The program certainly deserves commendation for the investments it has made in the futures of these students. I would like to recognize all members of the Oxnard Sister City Committee. including Officers: Mary Anne Rooney. President. Debra Cordes. Vice President. JoAnn Oliveras. Secretary. and Teresa Ramos. Treasurer. and Directors: Allison Cordes. Marsha Cordes. Dorian Guerrero. Priscilla Herrera. Adela L. Lambert. and Ben Wada.

Turkey has taken little action to bring peace and stability to the island. In fact. they have done just the opposite. bringing tens of thousands of settlers from mainland Turkey to live in the homes of Greek Cypriots and further complicate any solution to the Cyprus Problem. The Turkish government has been complicit in the destruction of Greek churches and the systematic demolition of Greek culture in the northern areas of Cyprus. Time after time. the Turkish Government has stood in the way of a mutually agreeable resolution. Despite the lack of commitment from the Turkish authorities. Cyprus remains committed to finding a settlement to reunify Cyprus in a manner that respects the rights of all inhabitants of the island. It is far past time for Turkey to seriously work on finding a solution to this problem. Cyprus is a strong ally of the United States in an area of the world that can be unstable and unpredictable.

Mr. Haske served as a head varsity boys basketball coach in Northern Michigan since moving to the area in 1998. He initially coached at Charlevoix High School. where he compiled a tremendous record of 239 wins and just 78 losses. In these thirteen years he also amassed 10 district titles. 6 regional titles. 4 semifinal appearances. and 2 state runnerup titles. On top of that. he served as coach for the varsity girls program from 2004 to 2006. guiding them to a state title berth of their own. Following his time at Charlevoix. Keith became the varsity boys coach at Traverse City St. Francis where he continues to find success. He recently led the team to a state runner up title in 2012.

The young women and men he has mentored over the years have looked to him for leadership and guidance. and his impact is seen all over the Northern Michigan community.

Cyprus has been wrought with conflict and tension between the northern Turkish Cypriot population and the southern Greek Cypriot population. This conflict has left Cyprus divided. Although I am encouraged by the recent support shown for Cyprus by my fellow colleagues in Congress and by Vice President BIDEN. who recently visited Cyprus and helped facilitate dialogue between both sides. only a Cypriotled resolution can bring lasting peace to the country and region. Cyprus is an important economic and geopolitical strategic partner for the United States. With its recent discovery of offshore gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. a stable. unified Cyprus can be an important economic and strategic ally for the United States and neighboring European countries. As such. it is important for the United States to continue to express its support for a reunified Cyprus. Moving forward. I hope that Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders can peacefully negotiate a just and enduring resolution to this conflict. I know that it wont be simple. I understand that given the situations complexity. there is no silver bullet to a solution. A sustainable resolution will require patience and a genuine willingness from both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leadership to seek a secure and stable reunified Cyprus.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is one of the most important laws enacted in this country. President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2. 1964. signed this critical piece of legislation into law. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is recognized as one of the most significant turning points in Americas political and social development. In a country divided by racism and bigotry. the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made discriminatory practices in education. public establishments and by employers. illegal. This historic legislation served as a catalyst for efforts towards equality across the country. In addition. the Civil Rights Act of 1964. along with Freedom Summer marked the climax of intensive voterregistration activities in the South that began in 1961. Prior to 1962. Mississippi faced significantly low levels of AfricanAmerican voter registration. In fact. less than 7% of AfricanAmericans were registered to vote within the state. In order to increase those numbers and register voters across the state Freedom Summer was born. While serving as an expanded voter registration project. Freedom Summer also helped to address the issue of the separate and unequal public education system. Efforts enacted during Freedom Summer established over 41 Freedom Schools attended by more than 3.000 young AfricanAmerican students throughout the state. Despite major challenges. Freedom Summer left a positive legacy. The wellpublicized voter registration drives brought national attention to the subject of black disenfranchisement. leading to the 1965 Voting Rights Act. federal legislation that among other things outlawed the tactics Southern states had used to prevent blacks from voting. Freedom Summer also instilled among African Americans a new consciousness and a new confidence in political action. Mr. Speaker.

Officer Perry Renn protected the citizens of Indianapolis for 21 years as a member of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. A career police officer. Renn made the conscious decision every day to place himself in harms way to make Indianapolis a safer and more prosperous city. It was in this pursuit that he ultimately gave his life. On the night of his passing. Officer Renn was responding to a call of shots being fired in a residential neighborhood. Day after day. Officer Renn displayed the compassion and integrity of a true public servant. After graduating from East High School in Phoenix. AZ. he began a 10 year enlistment in the United States Armys 82nd Airborne Division. During this time. Renn served his country as a paratrooper and jumpmaster. He served two tours in Korea and also helped to restore constitutional government to the island nation of Grenada during the 1983 liberation of the country. Operation Urgent Fury. Yet another example of Officer Renns heroism was shown in 2003 when he received the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Departments Medal of Bravery for preventing an armed man from taking his own life. Every single day. Officer Renn displayed his admirable character and passion for helping others. Few men and women are brave enough to answer the call of duty like Officer Renn.

As a former Deputy Mayor of Indianapolis and a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security. I am forever grateful to Officer Renn and to police forces all across the nation who work tirelessly to protect and serve their fellow Americans. Officer Renn is a hero.

Puerto Rico. which was used as a military training range for decades. Under the FUDS program. the Army Corps of Engineers is decontaminating limited areas of Culebra. However. DOD asserts that a 1974 law prohibits the use of Federal funds to decontaminate land that constituted the bombardment zone. Approximately 400 acres of this land were conveyed to the government of Puerto Rico in 1982 for use as a public park. DOD contends that the 1974 law has not been superseded by Federal cleanup authorities enacted in 1986. As a result of this rigid interpretation. Culebra is the only former defense site of several thousand across the United States that DOD claims it is barred by statute from decontaminating. The resulting state of affairs poses a direct threat to public safety. since this land encompasses popular beaches. campgrounds and a trail. In a congressionallyrequired study. DOD reported that there have been many incidents where members of the public encountered unexploded munitions that could have caused serious harm. My amendment would authorize the Corps of Engineers to decontaminate those areas within the 400acre parcel where the risk to public safety is the greatest. It will ensure that the 1974 Act ceases to serve as an obstacle to implementation of current Federal policy. which provides that the federal government is responsible for cleaning lands that were contaminated as a result of its actions. The amendment ensures that Culebra will be treated the sameno better and no worsethan other formerly used defense sites. The U.S. citizens living in Culebra sacrificed so that our military could receive the training it required.

First. let me thank BUCK MCKEON for doing a great job as the chairman. and I know as Adam will do. will recognize his years of service. and this is a great bill. Adam. thank you for your friendship and support. Part of this en bloc amendment is the Black Ribbon Day. I worked really closely with Congressman ENGEL to make sure that it was vetted and cleared. The basic premise is the country has to understand the importance of knowing the past to survive in the world of the present. Shimkus is ethnically Lithuanian. I deal with the Baltic issues and Eastern European causes. and the world has significantly changed. as I said earlier in this debate. about the threat from Russia. So the Black Ribbon Day recognizes the victims of communism and the Holocaust and the gulags and the deportation and the Russification. So when Vladimir Putin makes a claim protecting the Russian minority. it is because what they did postWorld War II was they removed forcefully to Siberia ethnics and moved in Russians. The world is not a safer place today. It is important for us to remember the events of the past so we can defend the freedoms of the future. Mr. Chairman. thank you for including this in your en bloc amendment. To my friend Adam from Washington State. thank you for your support. I dont get a chance to talk about defense and NDAA. As you all know. I served in the military. I have great respect for what you have done in trying to strengthen the force and protect freedom. So thank you for the work you do. It is just an honor to get a chance to work with both of you.",

AIQaeda continues to threaten the security of the U.S. and our allies. both at home and abroad. Our intelligence services and our military have scored some real gains against alQaeda. but al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is still able to provide tactical and ideological direction to its affiliates around the world. AIQaeda has gone from \"on the verge of strategic defeat\" to a serious and growing threat. depending on who you ask in the Administration or intelligence services. Today alQaeda controls more territory than ever. The fight against alQaeda is far from over.

The amendment is simple. it urges the Secretary of Defense to make a reasonable effort to make excess intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance equipment. night vision goggles. and tactical wheeled vehicles returning from abroad available to State. Federal. and local law enforcement agencies for the purpose of strengthening border security along the international border between the United States and Mexico. This amendment is common sensewhy not allow excess military equipment to be used by state. local. and federal law enforcement for border security? Our border sheriffs say they are outmanned. outgunned and outfinanced by the drug cartels. This is not a new idea. DOD already has a program for distribution of surplus DOD equipment. This program has transferred 6 used Humvees to Texas Border Sheriffs in 2010. The purpose of this amendment is to urge DOD to make more equipment available through this existing program. So lets put that veteran equipment to work on the border to help fight the drug cartels. America has done our part over the past 10 years to bring safety and security to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. and now it is time to bring that same safety and security to Americans living along our southern border.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise today in support of my simple amendment to ensure fairness in how we treat military installations after they are closed. Most military installations are closed through the BRAC process. As such. they are granted certain legal protections. including indemnification from claims arising from environmental hazards created by previous DOD operations. However. some installations can be closed unilaterally by the Defense Secretary outside of the normal BRAC process. In these instances. the facilities are not granted the same protections. As it turns out. many former Army ammunition plants were closed outside the normal procedure. As you might imagine. facilities where chemicals for ammunition production were once mixed and discarded tend to pose some risk to the environment. and yet. merely because of the way they were closed down. cities and towns which later try to redevelop that property must assume the risk for any lingering environmental hazards. My amendment would simply extend the same protection enjoyed by most closed installations to all closed installations. Two years ago. I offered a similar amendment that was added to the Housepassed NDAA. but it was not included in the Senatepassed version nor was it included in the conference report. That version would have retroactively applied this protection to properties which have already been transferred. I have heard the concerns from the DOD and from others about adding this benefit on top of previously negotiated contracts. I am sensitive to those concerns. so this updated language only applies to those properties which are still under DODs control today. I think this adequately addresses those concerns. and it still ensures that there is equity in how we handle these properties in the future. I would like to thank the gentleman from California. Chairman MCKEON. for his work once again in putting together this NDAA.

I offer this amendment in response to the Presidents recent address in Berlin in which he outlined his plan to further reduce the United States strategic nuclear arsenal below acceptable levels and in contravention of current law. The Presidents latest proposal would once again call for unilateral reductions in our strategic nuclear arsenal at a time when countries like Russia and China continue to expand and modernize their nuclear capabilities. To make matters worse. the President has undertaken this most recent effort without the consent of the United States Senate. as required under the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. which states international agreements cannot limit or reduce the military forces of the United States unless enacted pursuant to a treaty or congressionalexecutive agreement. Not only do the Presidents continued calls for weapons reductions jeopardize the safety and security of the United States. but he compromises the safety of our partner nations. It is unacceptable that the President continues to make secret deals with countries like Russia while at the same time breaking promises with the American people and our allies. The current threat environment around the world is very real and should not be underestimated. A robust nuclear arsenal is critical in deterring against emerging threats like Iran and North Korea.

President Obama issued a memorandum on Federal fleet performance that requires all new light duty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternate fuel vehicles. such as hybrid. electric. natural gas. or biofuel. by December 31. 2015. My amendment echoes the Presidential memorandum by prohibiting funds in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2014 from being used to lease or purchase new light duty vehicles except in accord with the Presidents memorandum. Our transportation sector is by far the biggest reason we send $600 billion per year to hostile nations to pay for oil at everincreasing costs. But America doesnt need to be dependent on foreign sources of oil for transportation fuel. Alternative technologies exist today that. when implemented broadly. will allow any alternative fuel to be used in Americas automotive fleet. The Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light duty vehicles in America. According to GSA. there are over 660.000 vehicles in the Federal fleet. with over 14.000 being used by the Department of Veterans Affairs and other departments. By supporting a diverse array of vehicle technologies in our Federal fleet. we will encourage development of domestic energy resourcesincluding biomass. natural gas. agricultural waste. hydrogen. renewable electricity. methanol. and ethanol. When I was in Brazil. I saw how they diversified their fuel by greatly expanding their use of ethanol. When people drove to a gas station. they saw what a gallon of gasoline would cost and what an equivalent amount of ethanol would cost and could decide which was better for them. I want Americans to make the same choices. If they can do it in Brazil. we can do it here. We can educate people on using alternative fuels and let consumers decide what is best for them. Expanding the role these energy sources play in our transportation economy will help break the leverage over Americans held by foreign governmentcontrolled oil companies and will increase our Nations domestic security and protect consumers from price spikes and shortages in the world oil markets.

This authority was inserted into the stimulus bill without opportunity for debate. Of most concern. the authority includes a bailout provision that would require American taxpayers to pay outstanding balances on projects that private developers failed to pay. This bailout provision is particularly problematic because. in November 2011. the Department of Energy inspector general issued a lengthy management alert on this stimulus borrowing authority. To quote from that report: Because of a variety of problems. the project is estimated to be 2 years behind schedule and $70 million over budget. essentially out of funds. and currently at a standstill. with no progress being made. Western had not completed a formal rootcause analysis and corrective action plan designed to ensure more effective program safeguards are in place going forward. Because Western has committed $25 million in developmental funding to a potential $3 billion project that would ultimately require an investment of $1.5 billion in Recovery Act borrowing authority. we are issuing this report as a management alert.

ARC invested approximately $66 million in projects that leveraged over $267 million in privatesector investment. a 4 to 1 ratio. and helped to create or retain over 20.000 jobs. In my State.

    "speech": "Madam Chair. I rise today in support of this amendment to eliminate five regional commissions that waste taxpayer dollars. These programs were initially formed with the mandate to improve the lives of those who live in impoverished areas. However. they have instead veered from this mandate by routinely allocating funds to projects that not only fall under state and local responsibilities. but also projects that benefit only those who live in more economically developed areas. For example. the Northern Border Regional Commission has granted: $250.000 to construct a tower to improve cell phone coverage in New Hampshire. $250.000 to construct a 93mile. fourseason. multiuse trail across northern Vermont and $160.000 to promote and raise awareness of the maple syrup industry in New York. These examples of government waste are not just confined to the Northern Border Regional Commission. A similar organization called the Delta Regional Commission. which spans from Mississippi to Southern Illinois. granted: $150.000 to build a tornado safe room in a Missouri hospital and $47.000 for updating a sprinkler system at a business incubator in Illinois. While there may be a need for these projects. they do not fall under the original mandate of these commissions. I believe that for government programs to be effective. they must be focused.

The Army Corps of Engineers has an important presence in the Great Lakes region. operating an electrified barrier in the Chicago Area Waterway System to keep the invasive Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes and devastating the fishing industry and ecosystem of onefifth of the worlds freshwater.

I agree that the backlog of Army Corps projects is preventing the Corps from taking on new projects in a timeeffective manner. which is particularly problematic as we approach hurricane season once again.

Bonuses are paid for a job well done. but at the VA. the job is very clearly not getting done. The tragic story out of Phoenix is only the latest example. As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee and a doctor who served at the Iron Mountain VA for 20 years. I have watched in disgust as the stories keep rolling in. Pittsburgh. Atlanta. Memphis. Colombia. South Carolina. and Augusta. Georgia. have all seen preventable veteran deaths linked to severe mismanagement. Make no mistake. these are not isolated incidents. This is a national crisis. and it must be treated with the significance it deserves. We can keep dragging VA leaders in front of the committee. but I. for one. am sick and tired of hearing their excuses. We are well past the time when explanations and apologies would be enough. It is time to hold the people that have repeatedly and egregiously failed our veterans accountable for their actions. This amendment is a good. commonsense first step. and I am proud to support it. However. it alone is not enough. The problem goes deeper than the Senior Executive Service. and our veterans are demanding real accountability. That is why I have introduced the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act. to provide a permanent solution to getting the VA to provide the care our veterans need.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise today as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my friend from Pennsylvania . I appreciate his effort on that. It is hard to believe what I am here hearing in here today. When you look at the backlog. when you look at how veterans are being treated in this country. in northern California. it is amazing that we are on complete different wavelengths here. The lack of accountability and transparency within the VA is nothing short of shameful. Yet again and again I have heard from many veterans in the north State concerned about the timeliness and the frustrating claims process at VA facilities in California. namely. the Oakland office. which is one of the slowest regional offices in the Nation. Despite past promises from the VA to improve the backlog. service to our veterans has continued to deteriorate. This negligence and mismanagement is completely unacceptable. When veterans are being denied access to the care and services they rightly deserve and expect. reform is necessary. certainly not bonuses to senior executives. When a program funded by taxpayers is failing to provide the level of services expected. accountability. not compensation. should be demanded. Rewarding incompetency not only exacerbates the most pressing issues within the VA. but also serves as an insult to the men and women who have given so much for our country. as well as the very many good caseworkers on the VA staff who see no bonus but yet still try to do their jobs underneath that regime. This amendment is about fairness and doing what is right by fulfilling the promise to our veterans. It ensures our veterans receive the benefits and services they were promised and restores accountability within the VA to make certain taxpayer money is rightfully spent. fixing the backlog and incompetency that is harming our veterans health and insulting them. as well as the American taxpayer. This amendment isnt about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. This is about throwing the bonuses out with the bathwater. I applaud Congressman ROTHFUS for his leadership in standing up for our Nations veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time.",

It is actually shameful we actually have to be here today discussing this topic. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I have heard over and over and over again stories of abuse. neglect. and mismanagement within the VA. but the one thing I never hear about is accountability. In fact. under the leadership of the current Secretary. a Senior Executive Service employee who has presided over mismanagement at the VA is more likely to receive a sizable bonus than to be disciplined or fired. This culture of anything goes has got to stop. and the best way to stop this is to send a strong signal across the Department of VA that Congress means business. It is obvious from the headlines about the sizable bonuses received by VA administrators at facilities in Georgia. South Carolina. Pittsburgh. and Phoenix that the performance award system at the VA is a failure. I have asked the VA in congressional hearing after hearing after hearing for a specific list of disciplinary actions that the Department has imposed on employees and executives who have presided over these delays and preventable veteran deaths. Instead of giving answers. they have only pointed to retirements. transfers. or bureaucratic slaps on the wrist. but not a single undeserved performance bonus has been returned to the taxpayers. These smokescreen attempts to create the appearance of accountability are unacceptable. Unfortunately. the story last week from Phoenix is not an isolated event. Just 3 weeks ago. in our committee. the VA admitted to another 23 preventable deaths occurring within their facilities. The senior VA bureaucrats responsible for the management of the facilities consistently received sizable bonuses from hardworking taxpayers. These administrators have been given a sacred trust to care for and serve our Nations veterans. And. quite frankly. Mr. Chairman. they have broken that trust. and its time for accountability. For these reasons. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. to defund these VA bonuses. and to return some accountability to the VA. I yield back the balance of my time.",

This amendment is consistent with Section 11 of my legislation. H.R. 357. which passed the House earlier this year by a vote of 3900. My bill would require a five year moratorium on bonuses for SES employees and I am glad to see that this amendment satisfies the intention of the first year of my legislation for FY Mr. Chair. over the past three years the Veterans Committee has uncovered. and continues to uncover. numerous instances of gross negligence and incompetence by senior VA officials. Regrettably. some of these instances have resulted in preventable deaths. yet senior VA officials have continued to receive performance awards. The most recent stories from whistleblowers in Phoenix allege that over 40 veterans could have died due to delays in consult times and alleged secret wait lists. Yet the director received a bonus in 2013 of more than $9000. If these allegations are proven to be true. it only further shows what we have seen in other locations that when a senior executive fails they are more likely to receive a bonus than any type of meaningful punishment. It is well past time for VA leaders to realize that rewarding failure only breeds more failure. and that is why I believe this amendment and my legislation to end all bonuses for senior executives at VA is not only necessary. it is what our veterans and their families deserve.

I rise today to offer an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that would eliminate wasteful spending on unused facilities. which would save tens of millions of dollars for fiscal year 2015 alone. The Defense Department has hundreds. possibly thousands. of buildings and structures that it has rated at zero percent utilization. This is an incredible number of useless facilities the DOD is paying to maintain. Federal agencies. as a whole. must do a better job at managing their facilities. Taxpayers cannot continue paying for unused and underused buildings while the Nation is at record debt levels. That is not good government. and that is not smart spending. That is why I joined with Representatives DAVID JOYCE of Ohio and MIKE COFFMAN of Colorado to introduce the SAVE Act to root out about $230 billion in wasteful and duplicative government spending over the next 10 years. This amendment is an extension of one of those commonsense solutions included in the bipartisan SAVE Act preventing the Department of Defense from spending money on facilities that the Department itself has rated at zero percent utilization. I offered the same amendment last year. which this Chamber accepted by voice vote. and I ask for your same support today. I understand the Department of Defense may be concerned that this amendment would prevent them from carrying out BRAC work. I believe BRAC is an essential process. and I have no intention of disrupting it. After investigating the Departments concerns. my understanding is that no additional BRAC work will happen before 2017 at the earliest. long after this appropriations bill has expired. Any ongoing environmental remediation from previous BRACs is exempted from my amendment. which gives the Department the flexibility to properly address any environmental threats at unused facilities. as well as maintain historic military sites. With that said. I would welcome the opportunity to work with the committee to address any BRACrelated issues in conference.

They can certainly go to a private physician. Frankly. in the States where it is legal. in some of these States. I think they are even working on vending machines for them.

And. if they work. what about the dislocations to the American economy and the global economy in moving this oil off the market? I think people ought to consider that. Ultimately. the only solution is a diplomatic solution to try and work this through. Were not going to go to war and nuclear bomb them. We are not going to occupy Iran. Its ironic.

Unfortunately. I am concerned that voting on H.R. 850 now may undermine efforts to achieve a peaceful. negotiated elimination of Iranian nuclear capacity. At a time when a new Iranian Presidentelect has made statements indicating a greater openness to diplomacy. returning this message with a vote on tougher sanctions only serves to empower Iranian hardliners and weaken Iranian moderates. U.S. policy must make it clear that the goal of sanctions on Iran is to elicit verifiable concessions from Iran that have a material impact on its ability to develop a nuclear weapon. In order to achieve this goal. the President must have the ability to waive sanctions in exchange for Iranian concessions. Yet H.R. 850 places significant restrictions on the Presidents authority to waive sanctions. Mr. Speaker. while we must maintain a credible military threat towards Iran. we must also make every effort to promote the success of diplomatic negotiations with Iran. If we fail to negotiate a solution that ensures the safety of the U.S. and our close ally Israel by verifying that Iran does not have the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. we will be left with few alternatives but military engagement.

Lastly. this bill provides flexibility for the President to not apply sanctions when he deems it appropriate. There is adequate time to test the willingness and ability of President Rouhani to pursue good faith talks and reach an acceptable resolution. That said. complete inaction could signal indifference or a weakening of our resolve to pronuclear forces in Iran. Incoming President Rouhani and the other regime leaders must be made to understand that U.S. economic pressure and other sanctions will remain in force until there is a reliable and verifiable halt to Irans nuclear program.

This innovation was created by a team of programmers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. As a brief aside. I was just at the NCSA in UrbanaChampaign at the University of Illinois for the launch of the Blue Waters supercomputer. one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. which is also there at the University of Illinois. But Marc Andreessen. one of the lead programmers on the original project that created Mosaic and the founder of Netscape. summed up the importance of Federal investment in this research by saying: If it had been left to private industry. it wouldnt have happened. at least. not until years later. Innovative breakthroughs like the Mosaic Web browser changed our everyday lives and established the United States as the world leader in networking and information technologies. and the Federal Government played an important role in that. But today we find ourselves in a world in which we can no longer take U.S. supremacy for granted. As we heard during committee consideration of the bill. China. Japan. Germany. and several other countries are increasing their investments in NIT R&D as well as their capacity to convert R&D into new commercial technologies. We must prioritize cuttingedge. largescale R&D and effective technology transfer policies. focused on the most advanced areas of network and information technology. in order to preserve our lead in these sectors. H.R. 967. the Advancing Americas Network and Information Technology Research and Development Act. achieves these ends through the development of a coordinated Federal R&D investment strategy. This bill requires Federal agencies involved in the R&D program to develop 5year plans specifying near- and longterm objectives and to assess and evaluate progress periodically to ensure we maintain U.S. leadership in these fields. Mr. Speaker. this legislation will focus our scientific community towards the innovative. largescale. and collaborative R&D we need to remain a leader in networking and information technologies.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Ferguson Grand Jurys decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for the August 9th shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown is a grave injustice. This decision plays into the deeply painful narrative. held in the hearts of many African Americans. that the lives of young black men are not valued in this country. While this notion may seem hard to believe for some. it is a reality for many minorities. as we continually see our justice system betray us. Most disturbing about the death of Michael Brown is the chilling fact that he is not the first unarmed African American man to die at the hands of police officers who were not held accountable for their actions. When I think of Michael Brown. I think of Edward Garner. Anthony Baez. Amadou Diallo. Anthony Lee. and Oscar Grant. I think of the futures that could have been. and the pain and suffering brought to their families. How many more lives will we lose before deciding to bring about meaningful change? As the proud mother of a black man and grandmother to three grandsons. I cannot imagine the depth of the wound left in the hearts of Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. As a Member of Congress who represents a predominantly minority community similar to Ferguson. I mourn for the societal ills faced by my constituents. the people of Ferguson and communities of color around the country. I share in their sense of hurt and anger. Our charge now is to harness that anger into constructive change. initiating dialogue with our community members. our elected officials. and our police departments. to ensure that there are no more senseless tragedies. We are never wrong for heralding the call for justice. However. it is time for us to evaluate our methods for sounding that call. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King once said: \"we must accept finite disappointment. but never lose infinite hope.\" At a time when it may seem easy to retreat to our respective corners. we should instead seek understanding and acceptance from one another. by working together to secure a better future for our sons.",

Instead. we are voting to retroactively extend a group of over 50. mostly businessrelated. temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of last yearuntil the end of this year.

These small shops often have storied pasts and are unique for their high quality services and homey appeal. It is businesses like these that are the backbone of Indianas economy. One such business is Badgers Shoe Repair located on East Main Street in New Albany. Indiana. Currently owned and operated by Ron Badger. Badgers Shoe Repair has been providing high quality shoe and leather service repair since its opening by Rons father. Morgan Badger. in 1940. There is much history in this store. finding its start during a time of shoe rationing in World War II. Many small shoe repair stores have come and gone since that time yet Badgers has remained a staple of the community. For nearly 75 years. customers from all around the region have come to Badgers for not only its fine craftsmanship but also for the outstanding customer service. Each customer receives the highest quality of care and service while Ron also offers that unique Hoosier hospitality. Ron Badger took over the family business in 1974 when his father retired after 34 years. At the age of 35. Ron gave up his career in clerical work to become his own boss and take over his fathers store. Ron has stayed true to the old ways of shoe repair. using the same techniques and equipment that his father did. This highquality work and personal attention to detail has attracted some elite clientele. including boots used at the worldfamous Churchill Downs. Unfortunately. Badgers Shoe Repair will be closing on December 31st of this year for the last time. After many years of hard work. Ron Badger has announced his retirement.

    "speech": "and our members of the Budget Committee for a job well done. We have a budget here that will. in fact. balance over the next 10 years after having a debate with our colleagues across the aisle and across the building and downtown who all have budgets that never come to balance. I dont know where \"a balanced plan\" can be called \"a balanced plan\" if we never get to balance. The fact is that weve done the hard work of bringing this plan forward. This budget does more than just balance. It helps improve the lives and concerns of the American people and addresses things that are important to American families such as fixing the Tax Code. Lowering rates means more jobs and higher wages for the American people. Voting for this budget means supporting the Keystone pipeline. and Americanmade energy means more jobs and lower energy prices for the American people. Repealing ObamaCare and supporting patientcentered reforms means more jobs and lower health care costs for the American people. and protecting and strengthening Medicare means a secure retirement for older Americans. Cutting waste means more fairness and accountability for hardworking taxpayers. Doing all of this means preserving the American Dream. which is what we were sent here to do. Weve balanced the budget before. In 1997. a Republican Congress working with a Democrat President. Bill Clinton. came together to put forward a plan that would. in fact. balance the budget. And we did. For 4 years we ran a budget surplus. The President has an opportunity during this critical debate to come forward and to help make this part of his legacy like it has become part of the Clinton legacy. working together on behalf of the American people to solve what we know is a crisis in our country. We cant continue to spend money that we dont have. Its as simple as that. When youve spent more money than what youve brought in for 50 of the last 60 years. no American family can do this. no business can do this. and no government can do this without bringing on a debt crisis that is sure to imperil the future of our kids and our grandkids.

    "speech": "I rise today in opposition to the Republican budget developed by Budget Committee Chairman PAUL RYAN. This budget would not only jeopardize seniors. families. and the most vulnerable in our society. it would also destroy jobs and put our Nations economic recovery at risk. In fact. some estimate that 2 million American jobs could be lost in 2014 under the Ryan budget. The Ryan budget would protect the wealthy while severely harming seniors and the American middle class. Millionaires would receive an average net tax cut of $200.000. while middle class families could see their taxes rise by an average of $2.000. This approach is neither equitable nor balanced. The Ryan budget would cut the crucial programs our families rely on by slashing nondefense discretionary spending by more than $1 trillion below the level of the 2011 Budget Control Act caps. This budget denies Americans access to lifesaving health care by ending the Medicare guarantee. drastically cutting the Medicaid program. and repealing the Affordable Care Act. These cuts would immediately raise health insurance and prescription drug costs for women. while reducing access to care and support for nursing home residents. The Ryan budget could also result in an 18% cut in help with child care expenses to families working hard to make ends meet. and could cause about 200.000 children to lose access to Head Start in 2014 alone. We all know that tough decisions must be made regarding the deficit. but our budget must not be balanced on the backs of women. children. seniors. and middle class families. Instead. we must invest in our children. in our students. and in our families to move our Nation forward. We must ensure that all Americans have access to health care. And we must invest in our infrastructure to create jobs and pave the way for a stronger economic future. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Ryan budget and work together to create jobs and protect middle class families.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 25. the fiscal year (FY) 2014 budget resolution. Once again. this body is considering another misguided budget that asks seniors and middle class Americans to make great sacrifices so the wealthiest among us can get a tax cut. While supporters of this budget claim they deserve credit for producing a budget that balances. this is not a balanced plan. nor a serious one. The Republican budget is a slippery. dishonest collection of old. failed ideas that the American people roundly rejected in the last election. Some say that this budget plan represents a serious attempt to reform Medicare. in fact. nothing could be farther from the truth. It ends Medicare as we know it by creating a voucher program which would shift costs to our seniors. It also repeals the Affordable Care Act which is already providing critical benefits to those in need across our country and that has been affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court as constitutional. By reopening the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap. beneficiaries would see their costs increase by over $13.000 from now through 2022. This is not the treatment our seniors deserve. and I know we can do better for them. Instead of making critical investments in our economy to promote growth and create jobs. vital domestic programs would face drastic cuts. The entire mandatory Pell grant program would be cut by $98 billion over 10 years. virtually eliminating the program. Student loan rates would rise from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent in July. which would have a negative impact on college students across the nation. The budget also doubles down on the disastrous sequester and goes even further than that by cutting an extra $55 billion from domestic discretionary spending in FY 2014 alone. To top it off. the top tax rate would be lowered to 25 percent. costing our nation nearly $6 trillion over 10 years. In order to pay for these disastrous proposals. critical tax deductions for middle class families would be eliminated. leaving the average family with an increase of $3.000 in their tax bill. The priorities of this budget are completely backwards. I commend the gentleman from Maryland.",

    "speech": "for offering a balanced approach in the Democratic substitute budget. This budget replaces the sequester. makes investments which are critical for economic growth. and puts our nation on a sustainable fiscal path. It gives critical support to transportation. education. and small businesses programs which will have a real impact on middle class families and help maintain the upward trajectory of our economy. The Democratic budget also includes $50 billion for immediate surface transportation projects which will create jobs today. in addition to vital tax incentives for the manufacturing sector which has been so critical to our economic recovery. All of these important goals are achieved while continuing the Medicare guarantee for our seniors and generating enough deficit reduction to eliminate the sequester. thereby avoiding losing 750.000 jobs which would occur if sequestration is allowed to continue. If my Republican colleagues are serious about producing a balanced budget then let us set aside this partisan rhetoric and recycled ideas and come to the table willing and ready to make tough decisions for the benefit of our country. American families across the country make tough decisions about their familys budget on a daily budget. Whether it is postponing that new car purchase. refinancing their homes. or cutting back on the types of groceries they buy. American families do not have the luxury to return to past bad ideas. They have to make the tough decisions now or face losing their home. missing a tuition payment. or having their heat turned off. Instead of debating political documents such as this one. Congress must put aside the political games and come together to find common ground to put our nation on a sustainable fiscal path in the long term while making much needed investments in the short term.

What a joy to be able to hear that during the time of celebration that we had here in the United States Congress. President Mandela. who had been ill for a period of time. had earphones on and was looking at television. The words that came from the minority and majority leader. Republicans and Democrats. the Speaker and leader. Republicans and Democrats and various leaders of the House. commended and recognized that a man who had come from the tyranny of separation and apartheid. who had to be against his government in order to free his people. could be recognized and applauded. because when he walked out of Robben Island. he walked without bitterness. And one of the greatest opportunities that he gave to the world was the idea that there could be a democratic election in South Africa. And from that time. he has been a man who promoted peace and promoted love and led his nation out of the devastation of separation and bitterness with kindness and love. Im delighted to stand on the floor today and say: happy birthday. Madiba. happy birthday. President Nelson Mandela. And if its Gods will. may you live forever onward in better health.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise today in opposition of H.R. 5. the socalled Student Success Act. H.R. 5 reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). and it is one that we have waited a long time to revisit. I hoped that we could work together on this bill because all of us care about our childrens growth and development. Both Republicans and Democrats share concerns over the rate at which we are falling behind other nations. And whether you are liberal or conservative. we know that we need to hold our schools accountable for their performance. That is why this bill is so distressing. H.R. 5 is as dysfunctional as anything else that has come to the floor this Congress. It may not be as pointless as the 38th and 39th votes to repeal Obamacare that we had Wednesday. And it may not have been rammed down our throats quite as aggressively as the Farm Bill was last week. But this bill is still a piece of unilateral maneuveringwhen we could be working together. Instead of spending public funds for the public good. H.R. 5 creates a quota system that shifts funds to private schools that are meant to go to lowincome children and schools. Along the way to privatizing our public schools. it decreases accountability for states and school districts by blockgranting specialized grant programsallowing funds meant to address specific hardships to be diverted elsewhere. I will admit to my friends across the aisle. that while I know some in your base may buy into that pipedreamit is not the way to rebuild America. Formalizing the distinctions between our two Americas is not the key to healing our nation. Nor is depriving extra help to students with special learning barriers. Give our children their future. Give them a bill that will guarantee a 21st century school system to lead the world. I urge my colleagues to use this opportunity for something greater than mere posturing. and oppose this bill.",

This bill undermines the fundamental purpose of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). which was created to ensure that disadvantaged children are provided a highquality education that allows them to compete on a level playing field with their moreadvantaged peers. Among its many problematic provisions. this bill locks in devastating sequestrationlevel education funding. fails to hold States and districts accountable for supporting and improving the achievement of all students. eliminates and weakens protections for disadvantaged students. and lacks critical support systems for our Nations educators. I believe No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is flawed and must be reformed. and reauthorization presents a tremendous opportunity to make muchneeded improvements and bring our education system into the 21st century. However. instead of fixing the problems of NCLB. the Student Success Act does not reflect best practices and fails to strike the appropriate balance between flexibility and accountability. Reauthorization should support college and careerready standards. address the overuse of testing in teacher and school evaluations that currently forces educators to substitute test preparation for instruction. and feature an accountability system that includes meaningful targets for improving student attainment that gives schools and districts flexibility in how they achieve those goals. I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 5 and instead support reauthorization that restores our Nations commitment to providing equal opportunity for all students regardless of background.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chair. I rise in opposition to the legislation on the Floor today. a missed opportunity to reform our education system and ensure that every student has access to a high quality education. We should be working in a bipartisan manner to correct the widelyacknowledged flaws of No Child Left Behind and make the law more fair. flexible. and responsive to the needs of students. Instead. the bill before us shortchanges our schools and eliminates supports for our most vulnerable populations. We should be providing the resources our schools need to fix the achievement gap and put a good. supported teacher in every classroom. Instead. todays bill locks in postsequestration funding levels for K12 education and cuts back on professional development. We should be setting high expectations for our schools and giving States flexibility to create accountability systems that improve achievement for every student. Instead. this legislation eliminates requirements for districts to fix struggling schools and ensure that all students make it to graduation. We should be providing additional support for students with additional challengesstudents with disabilities. Englishlanguage learners. and atrisk youth. Instead. we have a bill that allows funds to be directed away from these students and allows all students with disabilities to be taught at a lower standard. We should be encouraging innovation in the classroom. empowering teachers and allowing charter schools to test new ideas. But while this bill would expand charter school availability. it does not require those schools to be accountable or transparent with taxpayer dollars. Mr. Chair there are many missed opportunities in this bill. It continues the exclusive focus on math and reading. with no support for STEM. geography. history. the arts. or other subjects that provide a wellrounded education. It eliminates funding for afterschool programs and wraparound services that ensure students are prepared to learn. Our students. teachers. and parents deserve better than this bill. We should come together in a bipartisan fashion. as we have always done with education in the past. to develop real reform that gives our students the skills they need to succeed in our 21st century global economy.",

James has lived up to the principles of the Scout Oath and Law and has demonstrated the type of citizenship and leadership that I believe is so vital to the future of our Nation. When he becomes an Eagle Scout. James will be standing with World War II combat veteran George Gieda. who James accompanied on an Honor Flight of veterans here to the Capitol 2 years ago. They became friends. they have stayed in touch. they have provided inspiration to each other. Because I cant be with the White family this weekend. I wanted the RECORD to reflect my congratulations. my hope that James future will be filled with many more significant and meaningful achievements. and my belief and reflection that we need more young men like Eagle Scout James White.",

The First Lady has said. \"We just cant leave it up to the parents.\" Several things are wrong about this totalitarian control of children. Kids say the portions are so small or the food is so disliked they must smuggle food from home or just go hungry. This leads to the Federal Government food being wasted and thrown away at the end of the day. What is next? Are the Federal food bureaucrats going to forcefeed schoolchildren with government food? It should not be the role of Washington and the Federal Government to control what children eat. That is the responsibility of parents. Americans are not stupid and cannot leave it up to the almighty Feds to determine what is best for our kids. The Federal Government should not raise our children because the Federal Government is not the parent of my kids or my grandkids. whether Washington likes it or not. And that is just the way it is.",

It is an important day in that we passed the Cassidy bill here in the House that will open the door to the Keystone XL pipeline being built. Since this administration has dallied so. the Chinese have entered the picture and are desirous of having a pipeline going to the west coast of Canada so that. apparently. when this administration does. finally. get around to deciding what is best for Americans instead of what is best for his political situation. then we will have to compete with the Chinese. who will be seeking the oil to go in their pipeline as opposed to the United States getting it to come through our pipeline. We understand that our friend Ms. LANDRIEU. Senator LANDRIEU. will have a bill in her name come to the Senate floor for a vote. I am really proud BILL CASSIDY is a friend. I am proud that we had a chance to vote on the Bill Cassidy bill. and I am proud that it passed. I think it is such a shame that MARY LANDRIEU will not be able to likely get her colleagues to vote for the Keystone pipeline and pass it as BILL CASSIDY has been able to do here in the House. Make no mistake. Since I live in east Texas and the pipeline will come through part of my district and come across private land. nobody who has private land wants a pipeline coming across their land. Anybody who has ever had one knows it is no fun. You dont like having an easement across for a pipeline like that. So it will require great diligence to make sure that it is properly maintained and that damage is avoided. and if damage occurs. then I will certainly want to fight for our landowners to make sure they are properly addressed and taken care of and compensated. That is one thing today. but it really pales in comparison. Mr. Speaker. to what happened 100 years ago today.",

We passed that bill by a strong bipartisan vote of 279 to 147. But despite the overwhelming support. the White House issued a veto threat. declaring the bill was unnecessary given that the administration was committed to reaching a decision on the project by the end of the year. Fast forward to today. and its d6jd vu all over again. More than three years after we passed that initial bill. we still dont have a decision from the president on this critical jobs project despite widespread support from Democrats and Republicans. laborers. and job creators. President Obama famously proclaimed in January 2013 that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to create jobs and 2014 was renamed the presidents socalled \"Year of Action.\" But when the chips are down. President Obama is incapable of saying \"yes\" to a project that would create tens of thousands of American jobs and advance our energy security. But despite the presidents excuses. we havent given up on finding a bipartisan solution. We have now voted a total of eight times in the House to move this landmark project forward. And now we are standing up for jobs and energy once again. We are going to keep fighting for Keystone until we get the job done. There is now no question that Keystone is in Americas best interest. Keystone has been exhaustively studied more than any other pipeline in our nations history and the facts are clear. Keystone will deliver nearly a million barrels of safe and secure North American oil. and President Obamas own State Department has confirmed that it will support over 42.000 jobs without significantly increasing emissions. Its also expected to be one of the safest pipelines ever built. adhering to the new pipeline standards we passed into law with additional safety requirements. Hopefully. this ninth vote is the charm. and the Senate and President will finally agree. that after six years. its time to finally say yes to energy and yes to jobs.",

On October 29. 1923. the Turkish Parliament proclaimed the new state as a republic. replacing the Ottoman Constitution. Turkish soldiers prevailed in the War of Independence despite being under equipped. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. who led the Turkish Army became the new countrys first President. Turkish women played a crucial role in helping to bring about a new nation. During the war they were often left earning the only income in their households. They also assisted in the war effort by transporting ammunition on their backs. moving cannon balls. and pushing equipment to the battle fields. Since independence. Turkey has made incredible gains and taken its place among the community of nations. Turkey remains an important ally in a turbulent region. Its economic vibrancy has catapulted the country to become the 6thlargest economy in Europe and the 16th in the world. Turkey has prevailed because of its roots as a republic and its place as one of the few democracies in the region. This political stability along with a strong cultural connection has led to Turkish investment in Native American enterprises. Turkish businesses have sought to share their experience and expertise with Native Americans. There have been several Native American delegations to Turkey. and Turkish businesses have visited tribes to discuss ways in which to work together. This relationship between Turks and Native Americans is a shining example of how stable governments help foster collaborative growth. Mr. Speaker. all this is why. on this occasion. I congratulate the people of Turkey on this important anniversary. and look forward to a strong and stable Turkish Republic for many generations to come.",

Every day women across our nation live in fear of being abused by a partner. An estimated 1.5 million people in the United States fall victim to domestic abuse each year and one in four women will experience domestic violence at some point in her life. Like a cancer. this abuse knows no limits and crosses all ethnic. socioeconomic. and party lines. For years. the consequences of domestic violence were ignored or minimized. but our nation has since witnessed many advances to protect and support victims of domestic abuse. The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). passed into law this year. will be critical in strengthening the ability of governments. law enforcement. and service providers to combat domestic violence. But the effects of domestic violence are farreaching and plague generation after generation. so we must continue to work hard to intervene in ways that fit individual victims needs and prevent future violence. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting stronger public policy initiatives to meet the overwhelming need that remains for victim services and a range of domestic violence programs. As community leaders. we must pursue every opportunity for domestic violence education. advocacy. and prevention services.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in recognition of National Work and Family Month. As a mother of three schoolaged children. I know how difficult it is to juggle a demanding career while caring for a family. Despite our best attempts. our schedules are never entirely predictablefevers. flight delays. and lifes unexpected surprises have a way of throwing off the schedules we planned so meticulously. As we try to navigate lifes twists and turns. a big part of our success hinges on the flexibility in our work environments. Advances in technology are making greater workplace flexibility possible. but there is still a lot more we can do to make a healthy worklife balance become the norm rather than the exception. The importance of employers promoting policies that support their employees success within and outside the workplace must not be underestimated. Study after study shows that employers who offer effective worklife balance programs are able to attract and retain more talented employees and also maintain a healthier and happier workforce. Workers who have more input and flexibility with their schedules. such as accommodating work hours and paid sick leave. are able to care for their dependents without worrying about their job securitywhether that means caring for a sick child home from school with the flu. a husband or wife recovering from a surgery. or an elderly parent who needs help getting to the doctor. Workers who can successfully manage their personal lives are less stressed. which results in a more productive workforce and lower costs associated with employee turnover. More and more children are now growing up in a household with two fulltime working parents. or are being raised by a single parent who works. For the sake of healthy children and families. employers must update their practices to reflect 21st century realities. Investing in the health and wellbeing of our nations workforce is not just smart for business. its smart for our nations longterm success. As research shows. increased parental involvement is associated with greater academic achievement and lower dropout rates for children. some of whom will become our nations next generation of leaders. So as we recognize National Work and Family Month. I encourage my fellow policy makers. employers. and employees to come together to create workplaces that are more flexible and supportive of our nations hard working families.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. on this day in 1863. 150 years ago. President Abraham Lincoln signed a congressional act creating the Idaho Territory. Twentyseven years later. part of that territory would become the 43rd State. the State of Idaho. The Idaho Territory was initially much larger than the borders of Idaho today. it included most of what would later become Montana and Wyoming. The territory. to be governed by William H. Wallace. an old friend of Lincolns. was previously part of the Washington Territory. Western Washington politicians moved to discard large tracts of land in eastern Washington Territory partly because the population in those areas was increasing rapidly and they wanted to assure Olympia would remain the capital of the region. That population increase was mostly gold miners seeking out their fortunes in the Clearwater region. now Idahos panhandle. This goes to show you. Mr. Speaker. gerrymandering is not a new phenomenon. it is in fact one of the reasons the Idaho Territory was created in the first place. However. the land mass for the Idaho Territory was so expansive that within a year Montana broke away. and four years later Wyoming did the same. leaving the Idaho Territory looking very much like the State does today. In 1890. after 27 years as a territory. Idaho became the 43rd State. However. much of what distinguishes Idaho today came about during its territorial years. including the creation of its main highways. many of its public schools. its tax system. its tribal laws. its universities. its water laws. and indeed. its eventual Constitution. written in the summer of 1889 in Boise. Idahos Constitution remains today almost exactly how it was written. and it still forms the basis for all Idaho laws to this day. The citizens of Idaho have always demonstrated a unity and sense of pride in their traditions and history. and this rich history is what makes them who they are today. From the Canadian border to Yellowstone. from Craters of the Moon to Coeur dAlene Lake. Idahoans celebrate today. It is my privilege today to commemorate Idahos territorial sesquicentennial. E235",

And Rose competed in the 100meter. 200meter and 4 x 100meter relay snowshoe races. These events require a lot of work and a lot of commitmentand Im happy that their efforts were rewarded when they were chosen to compete in South Korea.

Madam Chair. my amendment would prohibit the Department from engaging in rulemaking to allow the use of voice communication devices in flight. in other words. cell phones. When the Federal Communications Commission first floated the idea of allowing cell phone usage on airplanes. the response from the American people was so clear you could hear a pin drop. something that would not be possible if you were surrounded by people chatting on their phones on an airplane. Polling has consistently shown 21 opposition to allowing passengers to make voice calls in flight. In February of this past year. I. along with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. voted unanimously to approve H.R. 3676. which was introduced by Chairman SHUSTER. that has the same goal of the amendment I put forward today. At a time when we document every moment of our lives over Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. the last thing the traveling public needs is to sit next to someone having a loud. onesided conversation on a crosscountry flight. Now. this isnt just a matter of comfort and good manners. it is also a matter of safety. For our flight attendants who are charged with the safety and security of travelers inflight. cell phone use will exacerbate potential conflict among passengers and will create distractions from crew instructions both prior to takeoff and during flights. so it would be dangerous for all on board.

This is yet another attempt to accelerate a race to the bottom and to deny workers their fundamental right to bargain collectively. Specifically. this amendment aims to prevent effective union representation by attacking the use of official time by employees. Use of reasonable amounts of official time has been supported by government officials of both parties for 50 years. In exchange for the legal obligation to provide the same services to those who pay as those who choose not to pay. the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 allowed Federal employee unions to bargain with agencies over official time. Under this law. Federal employees who volunteered to serve as union representatives are permitted to use official time to engage in negotiation and perform representational activities while on duty status. Using official time increases efficiency and is beneficial to both Federal employees and the Federal Government. These types of informal meetings save the government money by allowing the parties to avoid costly arbitration and other less efficient means of dispute resolution. At the FAA. for example. official time is essential for the collaborative process between employees and management. At a time when we are overhauling our Nations air traffic control system. eliminating official time is inappropriate. fiscally irresponsible. and an unnecessary violation of workers basic rights.

It would eliminate funding for the absolute worst performing line. one line. on the Amtrak system. a line that is known as the Sunset Limited. and it runs from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Madam Chairman. the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 required that Amtrak operate without any Federal assistance after 2002. Amtrak was supposed to be free of Federal operating subsidies. Yet. despite this commonsense requirement that Amtrak cease their financial irresponsibility and mismanagement. instead. it costs the taxpayers $396.31 per rider. per year. on this line. That is $396.31 to subsidize the travels of passengers from New Orleans to Los Angeles. a trip that takes nearly 48 hours. assuming the train is on time. Madam Chairman. we could buy everybody a free ticket on an airline from New Orleans to Los Angeles and probably end up saving money. However. according to Amtraks most recent performance report. the Sunset Limited only arrives on time 46 percent of the time. So it might even make sense for somebody to get there not only quicker. but also cheaper. This places the Sunset Limited as one of the top 10 worst ontime routes for any of Amtraks routes in its latest performance report. Madam Chairman. taxpayers should be happy that the train really doesnt run more often. But when it does run. the route loses an average of $40 million a year. So my amendment is the first step. once again. in instilling just a small measure. joining the gentleman from Georgia. in fiscal discipline that Amtrak should be told today that it has to establish. If it cannot manage itself with its worst. most expensive performing line. then God help us all. If they wont do it. we are going to. Failure to do so will only allow Amtrak to continue misusing and wasting taxpayer dollars. Look. it is just very simple. I am asking that my colleagues join with me and say that the worstperforming. the most costprohibitive line would be stopped by Amtrak. So. I think it makes sense to say. no more Sunset Limited.

First and foremost. let me address the serious allegations that employees at a number of VA hospitals around the country placed veterans on secret waiting lists and manipulated backlog data. This is absolutely shameful and if the VA Inspector General determines those claims to be true. we must hold those individuals accountable and swiftly remove and punish all employees who were part of this alleged wrongdoing. Unfortunately. the bill before us today is a fake solution and provides no real fix to the fundamental problems at the VA. Its stated purpose is to hold senior level employees accountable by giving the VA Secretary the authority to terminate them atwill. However. current law already allows for Senior Executives to be terminated for poor performance. Moreover. the VA has broad tools to remove individuals from the SES who are rated unsatisfactory. while providing them no right of appeal. In the last two years. fourteen Senior Executives have been removed. This legislation is an impulsive political reaction to an awful situation. and has many unintended consequences that could ultimately jeopardize the quality and care that our veterans receive. It would dismantle civil service protections that have been in place for decades and would open the door for political abuse and witchhunts. effectively creating a mechanism where career federal employees could be removed because of their views or political affiliation.

Senior Executive Service employees can already be fired for poor performance. An SES employee must. not can. but must be removed should they receive even one unsatisfactory rating.

The American people must have faith in their government. While an investigation of the problems at the Phoenix VA is ongoing. the negligence and indifference is inexcusable We must get to the bottom of what happened. and make sure it. or anything like it. never happens again.

I again want to address what my colleague talked about. the quote of \"too trapped in a war to be at peace. too damaged to be at war.\" These are the words left behind by the soldier. Daniel. who tragically took his own life a few months ago. Daniel was one of many who had been affected by PTSD and who had come back from war with suicidal thoughts. This is an epidemic among our servicemen and -women. and it must be stopped. Again. it is estimated that more than 22 veterans take their lives each day. Thats 30 percent of all veterans who have considered suicide. In Floridas Third Congressional District alone. there are over 120.000 veterans. which means. according to current data. about 36.000 veterans in my district have thought about suicide. This is unacceptable. and we must remedy this. We need to do all we can for those who have sacrificed the most for our Nation. and that cannot just extend to the battlefield. We must continue to take care of our soldiers when they come back home. That includes setting up programs to help veterans deal with PTSD and other psychological issues so they can get the proper help they need. We have to make veteran suicide prevention a priority. and I. along with my colleagues. will work tirelessly towards that end. George Washington said: To judge a nations future military force and loyalty to that nations military will be determined by how well that nation takes care of its veterans. Before our Nation engages in another war. I hope we look at the true cost of that war. If we look at the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. its not just the trillions of dollars or the thousands of lives that have been lost. The true cost of that war will be felt by this Nation for the next 60. 70. 80 years. and we need to make sure that we take care of those veterans and that we think long and hard before we ever do that again.",

Mr. Speaker. our veterans. throughout their military careers. are taught to be physically tough and mentally strong. and just because they suffer from posttraumatic stress. it does not negate that. They deserve every opportunity to achieve the same American Dream that they defended for the rest of us. Yet. unfortunately. too many of our veterans suffer from posttraumatic stress or from other mental injuries resulting from their service. Posttraumatic stress and mental injuries are not always the result of combat. they can also include such trauma as that of sexual assault. Regardless of how the trauma is suffered. we still must take care of our veterans. We cannot allow these injuries to prevent them from living the lives that they deserve. and in some cases. these injuries have led these brave men and women to take their own lives. It has been almost 8 years since my own injury. and in that time. if the 22suicidesaday rate is to be counted. there have been at least 24.000 veteran suicides. This is simply unacceptable. When I was director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. one of the very first things that I did was to create a 24/7 hotline for mental health available for vets. We have one now across the Nation. and that telephone number is 1 (888) 273TALK. Please put that on your refrigerator doors. You never know when that number could save a life. We started that hotline because caring for our veterans and their mental wellbeing is not a secondary priority. it is a mission that we must pursue each and every day. We cannot rest until we end veterans suicide in our Nation. We need to care for these warriors invisible wounds with as much dedication and as many resources as we do their other combat injuries. Yet. because they are invisible. we often overlook these wounds. I am asking all levels of government. business and ordinary citizens to make preventing veteran suicides our mission. We must come together and reduce the stigma of posttraumatic stress. We must provide the funding and the support that our heroes need. They fought for us. Now it is time for us to fight for them.",

Mr. Speaker. our veterans are those who have protected our freedoms that allow us to stand on this floor and debate the issues of the day. Without their sacrifices. we wouldnt have the America that we know today. I am surprised when I read the statistics about veteran suicides. The number that dies by his own hand each year is greater than the official number of all U.S. war deaths in more than a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Between 2005 and 2011. over 49.000 veterans have taken their lives. and more than 69 percent of all veteran suicides were among those 50 and older. and nearly one in five suicides nationally is a veteran. even though veterans only make up 10 percent of the U.S. population. We need to take steps to ensure that our veterans have the mental health sources they need. We need to make sure that we raise awareness and do away with the stigma of suicide so that veterans feel comfortable finally reaching out for help. When soldiers are scared to come forward about their mental health problems because they think they will be labeled a \"coward.\" they continue down a dark and lonely path that eventually could lead to suicide. Instead. we need to ask our struggling veterans to ask for help. As my colleague from Illinois just mentioned. the Department of Veterans Affairs launched a crisis line that since 2007 has answered more than 890.000 calls and has made over 30.000 rescues. In 2009. they added a chat line for text. and over 108.000 texts have been sent.

My father was a World War II pilot. and he flew in 63 missions before he was shot down and served in a POW camp. My fatherinlaw landed on the beaches of Normandy when my father was flying overhead. Both my husband and I were raised in households that. although successful. had many dark secrets. These were households where we lived with PTSD. And I want to say to the veterans who have served our country. of every era. that we are here to serve you. and we will not leave you on the battlefield. I serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee. and its a tremendous honor. With my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. led by Congressman BENISHEK. whom youve heard from today. on the Health Subcommittee. we will stand by the veterans who have served our country. We will work to provide the resources and to help the men and women that are working across this country in our Veterans Administration to provide you with the services and the treatment and the support that you need. Its been a tremendous honor for me. as I travel around the State of New Hampshire and my district. to work with veterans groups. to sit in veterans centers. and to see the oneonone support from the VSOs. from those who have worked in this field. from people who understand the dark secrets that you carry. We are here for you. We will work together and. under the leadership of Congresswoman SINEMA and all of us who serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee and throughout this U.S. Congress. please know that we are here for you and we will not forget. Thank you for your service.",

In 1998. she was the recipient of the Continuum of Caring Humanitarian award by the Friends of St. Joseph Villa. but she never asked for a lot of attention.

The Pay As You Rate Act will ensure that veterans receive at least some of their benefits in a more timely fashion. Currently. the VA withholds benefit payments to veterans until their entire claim has been reviewed and processed. This is a serious problem. especially for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans whose average claim contains 8.5 separate components.

It may not sound like much. but the price of gas is going up once again.

Protection of private property rights is something we hear a lot about whenever government makes a decision to protect unique and valuable public resources.

There is existing pipeline capacity to deliver this oil. The tar sands are not going to disappear. Our citizens should receive a fair chance to defend their property in State courts.

We in North Carolina remember Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Floyd. and we know how important it is for Congress to extend itself in such an hour of need. As ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. I note that DHS would receive $5.5 billion within the base $17 billion provision. accounting for only 54 percent of the administrations request for the Department. Also absent are $6.1 billion in emergency disaster relief and $300 million in disaster loans. Madam Chairman. without this additional $6.1 billion. FEMA estimates that the Disaster Relief Fund will run out of money in May of 2013. halting longterm rebuilding in places like Joplin and Tuscaloosa. Adopting only the $17 billion proposal does not even fully fund current Sandy estimates and. astonishingly. provides no funding for further disasters in 2013. The $17 billion package also shortchanges the Coast Guard by about half the request and doesnt include funding requested for CBP. ICE. or the Secret Service. Now. my Republican colleagues say that the supplementary $33 billion package will address my concerns. but requiring separate votes is designed either to doom the second bill or to pass it on the backs of Democrats while Tea Partiers are free to vote \"no.\" This is another example of Republicans playing politics with disaster aidthumbing their nose at the members of the Coast Guard decimated by Sandy and at the firefighters in Breezy Point trying to rebuild their devastated community. Theyre saying to their own constituents. if disaster strikes. there is no guarantee Congress will assist you. This is a dangerous precedent. Madam Chairman. when I was chairman of this subcommittee from 2007 to 2010. we provided more than $14 billion in emergency disaster relief spending following natural disasters. Not once during that process did we ask who was affected. Democrats or Republicans. red States or blue States?",

I would like to engage Chairman ROGERS in a discussion to help clarify the meaning of that provision. Am I correct in understanding that the term \"selfinsurance\" is intended to refer to a formal plan. pursuant to law or regulation. in which amounts are set aside in a fund to cover losses of specified types and amounts? Am I also correct that without such a formal. funded arrangement. a government or organization would not be considered to be selfinsured for purposes of this language simply because they do not have any commercial insurance coverage for the loss in question?",

I rise today to express my support for the underlying bill and the Frelinghuysen amendment. which will greatly assist the States and communities affected by Hurricane Sandy. In every year since 1997. with two exceptions. the Congress has recognized the need for emergency funds to respond to the impacts of natural disasters on the Nations water resource infrastructure. This year should be no different. The Frelinghuysen amendment includes a total of $5.35 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Of that. about $1.8 billion will be used to repair existing Federal facilities that were damaged in the storm and to restore projects to design standards. The roughly $3.4 billion remaining will be used by the Corps for the construction of projects intended to reduce future flood risk. Additionally. the Frelinghuysen amendment provides $88.3 million to repair facility and equipment damage to Department of Defense facilities in several States along the eastern seaboard. This is what we should be doing as a Nation. It is far less expensive to invest in preventing damage than it is to clean it up. We need to fund projects that result in the longterm sustainability of the impacted communities and reduce the economic costs and risks associated with disasters. Madam Chair. our country has provided billions of dollars in infrastructure funding for dams. schools and roads in Iraq and Afghanistan on an emergency basis. We certainly can do no less for our own citizens in our own country. I urge passage of the underlying legislation and Chairman FRELINGHUYSENS amendment.",

While Im glad that were considering this bill today. it is a travesty that it has taken this long for the House of Representatives to allow a vote on disasterresponse funding. The money in this bill and the Frelinghuysen amendment is the minimum that New York. New Jersey. and elsewhere need for their recovery process. Im very concerned that there are several amendments that will be considered today that seek to cut further funding from the bill. At least one amendment seeks to offset the cost of this bill. Our Nation has never before attempted to offset the cost of disaster assistance. The Appropriations Committee and the House have always come together to help Americans in times of need without regard to costs. To offset costs here would effectively kill this bill in the Senate and further delay assistance that is desperately needed to New York City and elsewhere. The twostep process is the proper way to go. I just may add in closing that we in New York have always seen images of disasters in other areas. but we never imagine anything like this happening in our area. We understand what other folks have gone through. and I hope you understand the need we have to recover. The pain. the suffering. and the despair that people in our community feel is beyond anything we can imagine or we can imagine in New York. And so this aid will. at the minimum. immediately send a message that we care and we want something to happen positive and. in fact. people will be begin to recover.

Representative GARAMENDI. about the cost of these repairs or improvements were talking about a design team. were talking about a construction team. were talking about a maintenance team. And all of that translates into jobs. So these efforts are. yes. an expenditure. but its putting people to work and addressing not only public safety but commerce. Again. my home county. which is split by a historic river. was the scene of a devastation just over 25 years ago where a New York State Thruway bridge collapsed because of the flooding that was occurring beneath that bridge. A creek that you could walk across. walk through in the middle of summer. was equal to in CFS. cubic feet per second. the flow of Niagara Falls. We lost 10 lives in that incidence. and also saw the impact locally to commerce. It just disrupted the flow of activity to ship goods to whatever section of our area. It totally disrupted that situation. That is just a microcosm of impact of what happens. But youre very right. With the levees that might be at risk that could be a challenge to public safety. the poor ratings of our many. many bridges across this country. the need to begin aggressively to address these situations. means that you can bend that cost curve simply by moving projects forward. because the longer we go in time the more expensive it will be and the more risky it becomes with these deficient bridges. So programs like The American Jobs Act or Build America Bonds. all of these efforts are a progressive bit of policy that then takes us to a new realm of thinking. a commitment to the safety of the people of this great country. a commitment to commerce and the doable qualities of having infrastructure vastly improved that enables us then to talk serious business about growing our Nations economy. So I think that the efforts here by the Democratic Caucus to bring to the attention of the full House the sort of positive thinking. the sort of planned opportunities that speak to the very nature of our infrastructureand both of us represent States that rely heavily on welldeveloped and very wellmaintained infrastructureis indeed imperative. We need to move forward with a very strong supportive statement about this Nations infrastructure.",

I had introduced in that session of Congress legislation that would require that our tax moneyat least 85 percent of itbe spent on Americanmade products and equipment. Lets take the Superstorm Sandy situation. We know that. for example. Amtrak is receiving. I think. a little over $150 million to repair its tracks that were damaged by Superstorm Sandy. Those are jobsmen and women will be workingbut its also steel. its electrical wires. its consultants. and it will undoubtedly be various kinds of electrical systems that will be used by Amtrak in rebuilding. similarly with regard to the subways in New York. Now. if we were able to write into the Superstorm Sandy legislation that 85 percent of that money thats used on rebuilding the infrastructure came from Americanmade productsin other words. Buy Americathen that would not only put people back to work. but it would stimulate the steel industry. the electrical industry. and certainly the consultants. engineers. and architects. So Im going to reintroduce that legislationtoo late now for Superstorm Sandy. but there will be other legislation. For example. we know that were going to have to rewrite a new transportation bill in this session. Theres a 2year bill thats now in place. It will expire at the end of the 213th Congress. so were going to need to redo that. We should write into that transportation legislationwhere we will spend $50 billion. $60 billion a year to build transportation systemsa clause like my bill that says thats taxpayer money. lets use that taxpayer money to buy Americanmade equipment and supplies. putting Americans back to work and using that to rebuild the American manufacturing sector along the lines that you describe. not with yesterdays technology. but with advanced manufacturing.",

The efforts that we have with so much of manufacturing. with the incubator programs that enable us to provide for an innovation of sorts in any of these assembly operations is key. I think its key to our future. I think of those situations in my district. or even in my former district. where they worked with a local college that was very technically sophisticated. In this case. RPI. in the Greater Capital Region of New York. worked through its incubator program to develop these new opportunities within the plastics manufacturing that Kintz Plastics in Schoharie County utilized. I think its worth mentioning on this floor that that really brought about a new phase of activity for this company. By innovation. by readjusting its procedure. its process. they were able to compete more effectively. That required. however. that they move to training their workforce because it required a new skill set. As they did that. they reached out to a local community college. in this case. Hudson Valley Community College in the Capital Region of New York. That partnership created the human infrastructure. the incubator provided the innovation. and they lived happily thereafter. because what they did was secure contracts in that international competitive sweepstakes because they provided for innovation. The improvements that they made to their assembly operation enabled them to maintain that sense of competitiveness. Its that sort of thinking that takes us to a new level of job creation and job retention. Compounding that. or creating in the complement the Buy American concept. then inspires reaching to those local firms. It can all be done in that holistic sort of format. with a big picture sort of view that enables us to go forward and build upon sound policy. sound investment. with guarantees of much better outcomes for Americas working families.

So its endless. And for us to just continue to do the same old kind of responses to everyday issues isnt the sort of challenging outcome that I think allows us to best function as an American society.

The North Fork is a spectacular gravelbed river that starts in British Columbia and runs along the western half of Glacier National Park before arriving in Flathead Lake. The North Fork is a worldclass trout fishery. with bulltrout and cutthroat trout sharing the same winding waters that grizzly bears rely on for huckleberries. It is the most important wildlife corridor between the Great Plains and the Cascades. and Montanans have always enjoyed rafting. hiking. fishing. and hunting in it. Today. about 2 million people visit Glacier National Park each year. bringing $170 million into the local economy and supporting 2.750 jobs. For 40 years. Montanans have fought to keep the North Fork pristine. My colleague Senator JON TESTER and I are committed to taking this across the finish line. Four years ago. Montana and British Columbia reached a historic agreement to protect the river on both sides of the border. Two years ago Canada upheld its end of the bargain. Today. the U.S. Congress has the opportunity to do the same. The entire Montana congressional delegation is in bipartisan agreement that the North Fork deserves to be withdrawn permanently from future mineral development. Montanans of all stripes have endorsed this action. including the local chambers of commerce and energy companies such as ConocoPhillips. In fact. the primary interest in more than 80 percent of existing Federal leases in the watershed have voluntarily been relinquished. Everyone recognizes how important it is to keep the North Fork pristine. It is just the right thing to do.

The House passed the North Fork Watershed Protection Act by voice vote last month. This bill is our chance to leave a jewel in the crown of the continent in better shape than we found it.

    "speech": "So that has already been done. I want to thank my colleague Senator WALSH for attempting to bring up the North Fork Watershed Protection Act for a vote. I also want to echo his frustration that once again politics is trumping good policy. The North Fork bill is a Montanamade bill. Folks back home who support this bill are from all political sides of the spectrum. It has wide bipartisan support. Members of both parties. as Senator WALSH pointed out. voted it out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Yet today two Senatorswhom I would challenge to find the North Fork on a maphave decided to hold this bill up. Let me remind them what this bill does. It ensures access along the North Fork for hunters and anglers who contribute to Montanas $6 billion outdoor economy. If you want to talk about economic development. this is an incredible driver. The bill also honors a commitment to our neighbor to the north. Canada. Three years ago British Columbia signed an agreement to retire oil and gas leases on their side of the border. expecting us to protect the region as well. This bill guarantees we hold up our end of the bargain. and it ensures we pass along our outdoor way of life. I should also point out that Exxon and Conoco both have also given up their leases in this region. Why? Because this drainage feeds Flathead Lake. which is the largest freshwater body of water west of the Mississippi. It is an incredible ecosystem. I think what has happened today is a loss not only for Montana. not only for Americas great outdoors. but for this entire country. This fight is not over. For far too long in this body we have had people who obstruct just because they can. It is time to start working together and doing what is right. whether we are talking about conservation issues. tax issues. unemployment issues. or whatever it might be. It is time to start moving the country forward because people are suffering out there. I thank the Chair. and I yield the floor.",

And Bumble Bee has been in that industry for a long time. They are a proud American company. But tuna travel great distances. They are a fish. that if foreign pirates go after them and fish them illegally. and fish them unsustainably and knock that population down. that comes home to roost for good old Bumble Bee Foods. Here is what the CEO of that company said: IUU fishing is a multibillion dollar industry that undermines our global conservation and sustainability efforts. By that he means his company. Illegal fishing penalizes legitimate fishermen and processors and it must be stopped. While the United States has done a good job at developing laws to detect and deter IUU fishing. other nations have not. We strongly support the agreement on Port State Measures to prevent. deter and eliminate the illegal. unreported and unregulated fishing. because it creates an obligation for other nations to take action against IUU fishing. I yield the floor. If any of my colleague wish to speak. let me just say that they do so with my gratitude for this bipartisan moment in the Senate and in support of the jobs that the fishing industry provides for our constituents.",

I will use a couple of minutes to speak again to those who come to our assistance when it comes to the enforcement of our fisheries lawsthe men and women of our Coast Guard. NOAA. and our other enforcement agencies. Senator BEGICH has somewhat dramatically shown some of the scenes. This is not easy stuff out there. When you have somebody who we have reason to believe has been operating illegally in violation of our agreed fisheries laws. more likely than not they are not just going to stand by and let you board and take a peek. They are going to take chase. As we are hearing. as we are trying to find some evidence of the missing Malaysian jetliner. the oceans out there are pretty darn big. Usually. the conditions are not ones in which you would want to go out on a pleasure cruise. Our men and women who are engaged in those enforcement efforts are truly heroes to us in terms of the efforts that they make. the energy that they expend. and the risk that they place themselves at. So day after day. as they cover our waters. as they work to ensure that there is a effective management of our fisheries. their efforts to enforce these laws. their efforts to provide for a level of protection and safety. their efforts to bring the pirates to justice are truly to be applauded. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to make that brief statement.

First. let me tell you how frustrated Americans are as they see the drip. drip. dripping of the sequester. and I join the gentlelady in her frustration on why we have not gone to budget reconciliation. I just want to mention the pathway of education so we can see that families are being pounded upon. Sequestration is causing 70.000 children to lose Head Start and Early Head Start.

I rise with a high degree of overwhelming frustration for the people who live in my State. I am sorry that this rule did not accept an amendment that I had that would have submitted a report to Congress on the feasibility of offering loan forgiveness for those who put businesses in economically depressed areas. That truly provides for jobs. But then the real thing is to cap the interest rates at 4 percent. As was indicated by my colleague. Mr. HOLT. he indicated how the numbers would go up for the students. Well. let me talk to you about Parent PLUS. Now. you can really see the oppression on parents who are trying to help their children go to school. In addition to the $100 billion of debt that students are carrying. we now eliminate the feasibility of Parent PLUS loans. Right now in current law. theyre $27.956.

We approach July 1 with a problem where if the Congress does nothing. interest rates will double on student loans from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. There are three options that are before the country and before the Congress. The first is to just let it happen. to let the rates go up to 6.8 percent and make higher education less affordable for people in the country. The second option is the option thats on the floor which will make it worse. to raise the interest rates over the long term higher than 6.8 percent. and cost students and families an additional $3.7 billion to pay for a higher education. There is a third option offered by Mr. COURTNEY from Connecticut. That option would say lets leave the rates at 3.4 percent for 2 years. lets pay for that decision so it doesnt add to the deficit. and then use those 2 years to negotiate a sensible. longterm solution to the problem. 1l 1000 Now I know that there are those who disagree with Mr. COURTNEYS approach. I know there are those who agree with the Republican approach. But what I dont understand is why all three options arent before the Congress. See. what we have in front of us today is to either do nothing and let the rates go to 6.8. or do something and make them go even higher. Theres a third and better choice that the majority has refused to let the Congress vote on. I suspect the reason we cant vote on that choice is it would win. It would prevail.

Its time to face the simple truth: government spending wont fix our economy. Americas growing debt is real. and Congress has the responsibility to deal with it. The first step must be reining in government spending by passing a balanced budget. That is why House Republicans took the lead and passed H. Con. Res. 25. the Path to Prosperity Budget. Our budget brings spending discipline back to Washington. which balances the budget in 10 years. provides for comprehensive tax reform without raising tax rates. and removes many of the regulatory barriers that prevent employers from hiring new graduates.

In America. we often speak of the importance of expanding educational opportunity and supporting students in achieving the American Dream. Unfortunately. our student loan debt crisis is crushing the dreams and aspirations of students and college graduates. As Congressman MILLER said earlier. today student loan debt exceeds $1.1 trillion. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. student loan debt surpassed total outstanding credit card debt for the first time in 2010. These staggering figures are truly unacceptable and must serve as a wakeup call for developing a longterm solution that helps. not harms. current and future borrowers. As a result. it is shocking that the majority party would bring a baitandswitch scheme to the House floor. a bill that would force students into loans with skyrocketing interest rates. I find it shameful that H.R. 1911 would reduce the Federal deficit on the backs of students and parents by saddling them with almost $4 billion in additional loan interest charges. and leave students worse off than if Congress simply allowed student loan interest rates to double on July 1. High levels of student loan debt can limit where college graduates live and work. It can affect the kinds of careers that students can follow. High levels of debt can create obstacles for young people who hope to start a family. to purchase a home and save for retirement.

So gradually. stepwise. it went down last year. In 1 year we had a 3.4 percent student loan rate tied to nothing other than the whims of Congress. It created a fiscal cliff for loan rates. So we voted to extend it for 1 year to give us time to have a permanent solution for this. The permanent solution that were offering is to simply treat a student loan like any other loan and tie it to a Treasury note plus 2.5 percent for a Stafford loan. Now. what does that mean? Certainly. Mr. Speaker. very eloquently. Mr. MILLER spoke just a moment ago about how rates can go. Variable means rates can change. Thats absolutely true. But rates can also go down. It doesnt necessarily mean that rates will go up. And in acknowledging this. an 8.5 percent cap was put on those loans. I checked the student loan rate if you went to your local bank or credit union to see what a loan rate would be. and its about 7 percent now. higher than that. And I agree with my good friend. RUB]tN HINOJOSA. who believes that we should work for ways to help make college more affordable. I could not agree more. The Secretary of Education. just this past Wednesday. said he agreed and supported a permanent solution. The President said he supported a marketbased approach. This will give certainty to it. and certainly I would urge my colleagues to vote and support this veryneeded piece of legislation.",

The question before the House this morning is whether we should make college more affordable or less affordable. which is better for the country. If we do nothing by July 1. interest rates double on student loan rates from 3.4 to 6.8 percent. This bill makes it worse. It will actually increase college costs for a typical student by $5- or $6.000 over a 10year period. $3.7 billion across the country. Theres a better way. The governments borrowing money today at 1 percent. Why dont we borrow the money at 1 percent. factor in the cost of administering the loans and setting aside a reserve for default. and charge that amount to the students. rather than run a profitmaking enterprise on student loans?",

I am pleased to say that the Black community has made great strides in achieving the goals of the Million Man March. and honor that effort as we continue to strive for social and economic progress for all. It was most inspiring to hear many prominent leaders encourage and empower husbands. fathers and sons all across the nation to \"go back home\" and reclaim prosperity and success for their lives. families and communities. Following the March. an impressive 1.7 million Black men registered to vote and many became more active in promoting civil rights. Since then. we have a larger middle class. more college graduates. and more Blacks are holding political offices. Our twoterm President Barack Obama is a testament to how far we have come. While I am proud of what the Black community has accomplished. there is much more to be done. Blacks still face crippling obstacles that make it difficult for them to remain in or join the middle class. At 12.6 percent. the unemployment rate for Black men and women is disproportionately higher than that of the overall population. In addition. the median wealth of Black households is 20 times less than that of nonHispanic whites. Blacks are still trapped by poverty in urban neighborhoods plagued by drugs. crime and violence. As we commemorate the 18th Anniversary of the Million Man March. the words and ideas conveyed on October 16. 1995. must continue to resonate among leaders and activists today. As a nation we look not at our differences. but at what we can do to uplift our communities and come together to take pride in all we have accomplished as we improve income equality. equal opportunity and the realization of the American Dream for everyone.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1471. the Alicia Dawn Koehl Respect for National Cemeteries Act. This bill would grant authority to the Department of Veterans Affairs to reconsider the decision to inter or memorialize an individual within a national cemetery in situations where it is later discovered that the deceased committed a capital crime. Currently. section 2411 of title 38. United States Code. prohibits the interment or memorialization of persons who committed a Federal or State capital crime. Nonetheless. situations have arisen where the entity. such as a funeral home. or the individual who is charged with scheduling the interment or memorialization of a decedent either does not know of the decedents crime or does not truthfully report such crime to Federal cemetery officials. In situations where a funeral home had no knowledge that a decedent was involved in a capital crime at the time of the burial request. VA actually lacks the statutory authority to reconsider interment or memorialization decisions. Simply put. individuals who are buried or memorialized within national cemeteries cannot be disinterred on the basis of subsequently received information. Mr. Speaker. S. 1471 would provide this authority to VA. as well as to the Department of Defense. in the case of Arlington National Cemetery. VA supports this bill. as it would provide the Department with the ability to redress interment cases where eligibility is invalidated by information that is learned after a burial. This bill would also specifically direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to disinter the remains of Michael Lashawn Anderson from Fort Custer National Cemetery. as it was Mr. Anderson who murdered Alicia Dawn Koehl prior to taking his own life. In that case. the funeral home charged with Mr. Andersons burial was unaware of the incident. Thus they did not properly report the crime. and Fort Custer National Cemetery provided the military funeral. The interment of Mr. Anderson was brought to the attention of the Indiana congressional delegation. and I want to thank my colleague from Indiana for highlighting this tragic incident and for offering companion legislation to S. 1471. I also want to thank our colleagues in the Senate for addressing this need and for passing S. 1471. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. At this time.

This legislation also closes a loophole in the current law. Currently. veterans and their dependents who have been convicted of capital crimes may not be buried in Arlington National Cemetery or any national cemetery. If there is a mistake and they are inappropriately buried in one of these cemeteries. the Army and/or VA cannot correct the mistake.

Mr. Speaker. every year more than 1.000 American families are confronted with the nightmare of their child being abducted to a foreign country by one parent in violation of legal custody and access rights. beyond the reach of U.S. courts. beyond the court of law enforcement. This illegal break in the tie between the child and the leftbehind American mother or father is a tragedy. and many of us personally have constituents facing these wrenching separations in the family. More than 30 years ago. the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction was created to provide a simplified mechanism for returning children to their countries of habitual residence so that parental rights are determined by applicable laws rather than by the act of abduction of that child. Today. the United States has agreements with more than 75 Hague partner countries. and that has helped to return many American children safely home. But unfortunately. agreeing to the Hague Convention and complying with it are not the same thing. and countries sometimes do not abide by their obligations under the Hague Convention. In those countries. there is a heightened risk that a child could be kept there with impunity. American parents need to know about this situation. and they need to know especially. before planning or permitting travel to such destinations. that this. in fact. could happen. This bill will strengthen the incentives and the tools that the Department of State has to address these unresolved abduction cases. It will also require the United States to identify and take action concerning countries that demonstrate a pattern of noncompliance with the obligations to return American children. and its enhanced annual reporting will provide American parents and judges with a clearer picture of actual Hague compliance and the risks of nonreturn associated with travel to certain countries. I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his tireless work on behalf of leftbehind American parents over the last several years.

Noor and Ramsey. in 2008. In 2009. the boys mother unexpectedly took them out of school. boarded a plane. fled to Egypt. and has never since returned. Through all that time. she has refused to return the children. It has been nearly 2 years since Colin has seen or spoken with his sons. Despite the custody ruling of a U.S. court and a subsequent Egyptian court order granting him the right to visit with his children. Colin has been denied the opportunity to see his children time and time again. I just got off the phone with Colin a few moments ago. He recapped the details of his ordeal yet again to me. but I guess. in the words that he said most poignantly: No parent should ever have to go through this. Between the years of 2008 and 2012. Mr. Speaker. parents reported more than 4.800 cases of abduction involving more than 7.000 children. according to the State Department. Currently. 89 countries are party to a Hague treaty that provides a legal framework for children who are victims of international abduction. This bill would require the Secretary of State to enter into a memorandum of understanding with those countries that have not signed the Hague agreement. creating a mechanism where none exists to bring children home safely. Additionally. it would provide better reporting to parents and to Congress. No parent should have to suffer the unbelievable heartbreak that Colin has experienced over the past 5 years. No child should be torn away from a safe home and loving family because their country didnt have the proper protections in place to protect them. We can do more to ensure that these children find a way home. I ask my colleagues to support this bill.",

I rise in strong support of the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction Prevention and Return Act. authored by my good friend and colleague. Mr. CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. SMITH has been a stalwart supporter of the rights of children and for the leftbehind parents. who all too often feel as though they have been abandoned by their government and have no place to turn. According to our State Department. hundreds of parental transnational child abduction cases occur each year. In most of the cases. the leftbehind parents here in the United States face a tremendous uphill battle with the foreign countrys government to return their child. To make matters worse. they have no recourse. no legal basis to turn to. that would compel that foreign government to cooperate with them and return their abducted child to the United States. The effects that this has on both the child and the parents are significant and. in many cases. have unshakable. lifelong consequences.",

Too many parents have been separated from their children for far too long and with little to no recourse. and we must change that now. Mr. Speaker.

Recently. I was able to meet with a constituent of mineMichael Elias. Michael has worked in the Bergen County Sheriffs Department and honorably served our country in the Iraq War. Upon his return from his service to our country. Michael and his wife. a citizen of Japan. agreed to separate. In 2008. a Bergen County judge ordered joint custody of their two childrenJade and Michael. Jr. The judge also ordered that the childrens passports be surrendered and they were. After a few months. on a day like any other. Michael was expecting his exwife to drop off Jade and Michael. Jr. to his house after spending the day with her. They never showed up. Somehow. his exwife was able to obtain new passports for Jade and Michael. Jr. and had fled to Japan. which is not a party to the Hague Convention on Abduction. Despite Michaels years of inquiries and toil. The Government of Japan has produced no answers on how his exwife was able to obtain the new visas for Jade and Michael. Jr. And nearly five years later. Michael has not been able see his own children. This bill will help countless families across the country that face the same heartbreaking situation that Michael Elias is still dealing with today. Our State Department must be on the frontlines for people like Michael. who have literally put their life on the line for this country. H.R. 1951 will empower the State Department to advocate for the victims of these tragic abductions. And that is why I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 3212. for people like Michael Elias and the countless families that have been wrongfully torn apart.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 3899. the Voting Rights Amendment Act. and urge the full House to vote on this legislation without delay. Voting is one of our most fundamental rights as Americans. and any attempts to limit this right on a discriminatory basis must be struck down. The constitutional right to vote existed for nearly a century. but millions of Americans were still routinely denied the right to vote based on the color of their skin. In 1965. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act and our country made incredible strides to eliminate voter suppression and discrimination. Discrimination at the polls is still a fact of life in many parts of our country. Congress recognized this when it passed the most recent reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2006 by a unanimous vote in the Senate and a 39033 margin in the House. Despite this overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and a voluminous record detailing the ongoing need for this legislation. one year ago this week. the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wisely stated in her dissent of the Courts decision that to strike down the Voting Rights Act \"when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes [to election laws] is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because youre not getting wet.\" With efforts across the country to restrict the ability of individuals to register and vote. its clear that we still need the \"umbrella\" protection that the Voting Rights Act has provided for nearly 50 years. The Voting Rights Amendment Act is a bipartisan measure that will restore the critical voting protections that were struck down by the Supreme Court in Shelby. This bill will ensure that states and localities that have a recent history of voting rights violations will be subject to the same strong oversight that has been so successful since 1965. On the day he signed the Voting Rights Act. President Lyndon Johnson stated: \"Today is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any battlefield.\" Congress has a similar opportunity to ensure that the allimportant protections of the Voting Rights Act remain in place. Lets join together and ensure that this \"triumph for freedom\" is not lost forever.",

The Itoo Society is the oldest LebaneseAmerican organization in the United States and one of the oldest heritage societies in Illinois. Named after a small village in northern Lebanon. the Itoo Society was formed in 1914 by a group of Lebanese immigrants who came together to support their members through financial and emotional hardships. Since then. it has developed into an active community group that Peoria. Illinois is proud to claim. Peorians know the Itoo Society to be a family oriented organization that honors its members heritage and culture. The Society has long been dedicated to charitable works that benefit the community members in Peoria as well as villagers in Itoo. Lebanon. Many of their festivals illustrate their dedication to commendable causes. including Peorias oldest food festival. which honors those who have served in our military. I think my colleagues and I can learn a valuable lesson from the Itoo Society as its members are known for producing results through a teamoriented approach to their many projects. In addition to serving its members. the Itoo Society opens its doors to charitable organizations and small businesses. By providing the community with a meeting place for business purposes and public fundraising events. the Society contributes to the success of other community institutions. This function is another way the Society brings together friends and neighbors who share similar problems. values. and ideas. An impressive list of Peorians can claim Itoo roots. including former U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Ray LaHood. former City Councilman and now Chairman of the Society. Leonard Unes. and Peoria County Circuit Judge Steve Kouri.

Autism is a disorder that has a tremendous effect on the lives of the people with it and their families. including challenges with education. communication. and employment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies autism as one of our nations leading public health crises. An autismrelated diagnosis is more common today than the diagnosis of pediatric cancer. diabetes. and AIDS combined. More research on this complex neurobiological disorder is still needed because we do not fully understand the cause or course of this disorder. The Autism CARES Act of 2014 will facilitate autism research by reauthorizing $190 million annually through 2019. In addition. it focuses attention on the important issue of transitioning autistic youth from school to adulthood. I have heard from constituents with autism about the need to improve the transition of services to consider life after high school graduation to ensure that students are supported as they move to work or higher education. I am well aware of the benefits of services and research dedicated to autism. I am proud that Chicago is home to the Therapeutic School and Center for Autism Research run by the Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago. The Center provides care and advances research on autism.

I rise today to express my thoughts and. frankly. some concerns about the Presidents proposal that we will vote on today to train and arm the Free Syrian Army forces to fight ISIL. We are sort of in a \"damned if you do. damned if you dont\" situation. I have always said that our country needs a comprehensive plan. policy. and strategy to defeat the radical Islamists terrorizing Iraq and Syria. Certainly. ISIS represents the antithesis of American ideals. and they have gruesomely demonstrated their disgust for our Nation with the beheadings of two American journalists in recent weeks. What we are considering today is a partial plan. one of which I remain uncertain as to whether it will have the desired outcome. In fact. since 2011. the administration has consistently resisted any major efforts to arm and train the moderate opposition forces in Syria even when. I believe. a window existed to effectively do that some time ago. At a hearing in the Appropriations Committee in February of 2012. I questioned thenSecretary of State Hillary Clinton about why we were not doing more to help the moderate Syrian opposition. She flatly rejected providing support then. Now. however. I fear we may have effectively missed the time in which arming the FSA will impact the barbarism of ISIL in the region. Unfortunately. since 2011 and early 2012. the situation in Syria has become dramatically more complex. and identifying true allies in the fight against ISIS will be exceedingly difficult. Questions remain about the Presidents strategy: How will we effectively vet the opposition forces? How will we ensure that arms delivered will not be sold to ISIS forces or will not be used against already persecuted people in the region. such as the Syrian Christians? ISIL is a threat to our Nations security. and. no doubt. it must be destroyed and defeated. but I do have trepidation regarding this initial step in equipping the FSA at this juncture. Those voting on this measure. I suspect. will do so with great reluctance. Those voting \"no\" will do so with discomfort.",

I am sure that all of us are doing the best we can to come to the very best decision we can on behalf of our constituents. Today. I plan on voting for the measure. The reason is that the civil war in Syria has claimed thousands of lives. Thousands more are now living under the deadly rule of ISIL. and 200.000 Syrians have been killed so far as the world. for 4 years. has not done much to protect them. Now. the fight in Syria and Iraq can. ultimately. only be solved politically. and I believe that the growing humanitarian crisis caused by conflicts in the region warrants an urgent response from the United States. Any military action against ISIL must be led by Iraqis and Syrians. I believe U.S. troops would be a magnet for a group like ISIL. and therefore this fight must be carried forth by the people most affectedSyrians and Iraqis themselves. I believe that a vetted and better armed. moderate rebel group in Syria can fight ISIL in northeast Syria when an Iraqi Army. perhaps. can push them out of their country and into Syria. There cannot be a safe haven in Syria for ISIL. I also want to note that much has been said about the fractured nature or the weakness of the Free Syrian Army. but I would remind people who are participating in this debate that. for 4 years. the Free Syrian Army has withstood the onslaught of the Assad government.

This is a radical and brutal force. opposed to all who do not adhere to their narrow view of Islam and the world. ISIL has declared war on our way of life and the values on which this country was founded and has flourished for over 235 years. In fact. ISIL has made clear that they will not be deterred until they see their flag flying over the White House. When it comes to protecting the safety and security of Americans at home and abroad. America must lead. As we know. a speech is not a plan. An F16 is not a strategy. As the Commander in Chief. we need the President to give us an honest assessment and an indepth strategy to defend the country and our interests around the world. This amendment responds to the Presidents request to use title 10 authority to train and equip vetted Syrian opposition forces. General Dempsey. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. called it a necessary but not sufficient step. Beyond the amendment and the Presidents limited request. the American people need to see a plan clearly articulated with a strategy to dismantle and destroy ISIL. When we look around the world today. we see instability and numerous threats. The spread of radical Islam throughout the globe is pervasive. Iran continues to move toward a nuclear weapon. Russia continues to take aggressive action toward the Baltic states. I support this amendment because America must lead. As we have seen. when America sits on the sidelines. there is a leadership void. which is filled by bad actors. I urge my colleagues to join us in taking this action.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this afternoon I will cast my vote to approve the Presidents funding request to train and equip the moderate Syrian opposition forces. I do so after long consideration and am mindful of the difficulties of vetting such a force during the middle of a brutal civil war. Any decision to supply arms to combatants must be weighed carefully. Indeed. for the last several years. I have opposed arming the Syrian rebels out of a concern for our ability to properly vet such troops and the fear that weapons we provide may end up in the wrong hands. Those concerns persist. but they have been overcome by the growing menace of ISIL and the willingness of our regional allies to play a greaterand openrole in the support of these forces. ISIL now controls about a third of Iraq and a like portion of Syria. It has been unsurpassed in its brutality. committing mass executions. forced conversions. trafficking in women. and beheading its hostages. including Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff. If ISIL is allowed to consolidate its territorial gains. or expand them. it will be able to act on its stated intention of serving as the platform for attacks on the United States. The thousands of foreign fighters. including Americans. who have flocked to join its ranks will one day attempt to return to the West and attack our homeland. Our response must be proportionate to the threat. It does not justify American occupation of Iraq or Syria or the introduction of American ground forces. all of which are likely to be counterproductive. It does justify the use of American air power. intelligence. and financial. diplomatic. and military support. And since air power alone will not be sufficient on the battlefield. it will necessitate the assistance of local ground forces. In the case of Iraq. those ground forces will be provided by the Iraqi military and Kurdish Peshmerga. In Syria. with rigorous vetting. training. and support. the rebel opposition may provide the raw material for a credible military force. There is no guarantee that the Syrian opposition can form a cohesive fighting force. something that has thus far eluded them. But the open support of gulf nations in housing and funding this opposition holds the promise of consolidating regional support behind them.",

I think one thing that most will agree on is that ISIL poses a clear and grave danger to our Nation. our interests abroad. and our allies. And I agree with the President when he stated that we must degrade and destroy ISIL no matter where they exist. And I support many of the provisions that he outlined in the speech he gave just last week: arming the Peshmerga. bolstering the Iraqi security forces. expanding airstrikes. and disrupting the flow of finances and foreign fighters to ISIL. But the one thing I cannot support. the one thing I will not support is arming the socalled moderate opposition force. the Free Syrian Army. It is a ragtag collection of 100 disparate groups. and. just a little more than a month ago. the President stated that the notion that arming the rebels comprised of former pharmacists. doctors. and farmers would make a difference has \"always been a fantasy.\" The Free Syrian Army has no cogent leadership. no organization. no command and control. And without U.S. military advisers embedded with the forces that we train and send back into Syria. we will have no visibility on their effectiveness. their defections. or whether or not our weapons are falling into the hands of our enemies. This is a plan that is destined to fail for the sake of saying we did something. and that I cannot support.",

While there is no doubt that ISIS is a brutal terrorist group that is wreaking havoc in the region. at this time. none of the evidence I have seen. including U.S. intelligence reports. and none of the arguments I have heard convinces me that getting involved in a religious civil war in the Middle East will be successful or effective in keeping our homeland safer. I cannot support what could turn into a war on three fronts: fighting ISIS in Iraq. fighting ISIS in Syria. and potentially Assad in Syria. Nor can I support an unprecedented scenario in which the U.S. tries to reinvent a substantially degraded rebel army to act as our boots on the ground against a former ally of theirs. ISIS. all while ignoring their stated objective of overthrowing Assad. And this entire plan depends on our ability to identify socalled moderates in Syria who would be prepared to die for our agenda. It is not at all clear how we are going to do that. Trillions of dollars spent. allout war. and more than a decade of occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan did not produce the peace we sought or the stability we were promised. We spent $25 billion to train the Iraqi Army to defend their own country. and they were decimated by ISIS in a matter of days and left their weapons to ISIS. What would make anyone believe that spending a great deal less money to train a rebel army to defend our interests would turn out any better?

Representatives and Senators must tacitly approve the Presidents aggressive intervention in order to vote to fund all government programs. It is disingenuous for the administration to tell the American public that we are arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS when the administrations stated objective is to topple the secular government of Syria. a government. I might add. that has not committed aggression against the United States. If the goal of arming and training socalled moderate Syrian rebels is to eliminate ISIS. this plan will not work.

I rise today in support of the McKeon amendment before us that authorizes the administration to arm and train vetted moderate Syrian rebels in their fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. or ISIL. This amendment also contains strong reporting requirements that the administration must follow to fulfill Congress oversight authority. ISIL has made territorial gains militarily in Iraq and Syria and announced the establishment of a caliphate in areas under its control. They have terrorized and killed members of minority groups. including Christians in northern Iraq. and have invaded Kurdishcontrolled regions. Minority groups are not the only victims being targeted. ISIL is also targeting Muslims. Last. but certainly not least. ISIL has beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker. This type of radical. evil behavior must be wiped off the face of the Earth. This amendment ensures that ISIL is not only confronted kinetically in Iraq but also in Syria. Providing the means for rebel groups to aggressively attack ISIL in Syria denies them sanctuary just across the Iraqi border. as is the case with the Taliban on the AfghanistanPakistan border. An armed and trained Syrian rebel force. with assistance from the U.S. and partner nations. will open up a northern front to attack ISIL. Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga will be the claws in the south to squeeze this radical group. American airpower will no doubt be a force multiplier for these indigenous ground forces. Mr. Speaker. there is only one country in the world willing and able to build a coalition of nations that includes Arab countries to defeat this radical threat. and that nation is the United States of America. The United States has an obligation to lead and respond whenever the innocent are being massacred. Our enemies should never underestimate our resolve.

This is the section of the FARRM Bill that reauthorizes the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program at RUS. Rural Utilities Services. at USDA at a cost of $25 million each fiscal year over the next 5. subject to appropriations. Mr. Chairman. this program was first authorized by the 2002 farm bill with the goal of deploying broadband to rural and unserved areas. Despite this goal. the rural broadband loan program has been riddledriddledwith numerous problems. In the 112th Congress. I was a member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology. During a hearing held in the subcommittee in February of 2011. I first learned of problems within this program. USDA Inspector General Phyllis Fong testified on a variety of issues at RUS that prevented it from being effective. She testified that in the 2005 OIG audit of the program. of the 159 of the 240 communities associated with loans in 2004. 66 percent of the loans already had preexisting broadband service in contravention of the statutory intention of these funds. Unfortunately. Mr. Chairman. the problems were only exacerbated in the 2009 OIG audit. Of the 14 recommendations made by OIG in 2005. RUS only took action on six of them. Between 2005 and 2009. RUS made loans to broadband providers serving 148 communities within 30 miles of urban areas with 200.000 or more residents. Furthermore. RUS approved 34 of 37 applications for providers with service lines already existing. Mr. Chairman. although there were reforms made in the 2008 farm bill that were finally enacted earlier this year.

So I would say to the gentleman. and I appreciate him very much. but I want to tell you that this program is really important to districts like mine.

On the other handand this is the alternativein 2011. the FCC. the Federal Communications Commission. under existing statutory authority. fundamentally changed the nature of the Universal Service Fund and created the Connect America Fund with essentially the same goal as the Rural Broadband Loan Program. The Connect America Fund is a different entity. and the FCC announced last month that $485 million of that fund. which is rooted not in increased taxes but in user fees. will be dedicated to unserved areas for broadband deployment. Mr. Chairman. I do believe that the FCC is in a better position than the USDA to implement telecommunications policy. and over the life of the Rural Broadband Loan Program. USDA has only confirmed my cynicism. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.",

    "speech": "I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. Chairman. I have the privilege every evening to travel back to the northern neck of Virginia. Its just an hour and a half from D.C.. and that area is not served by broadband. We all know how important it is to have that service. Folks there are stuck with 1990s technologydialup. If youve ever had to deal with that. you know how frustrating that is. We know for rural areas that economic development. job creation and educational opportunities are all tied to broadband access. Granted. there may be challenges with the Rural Utilities Service program. but. nonetheless. those areas need that particular service. I want to make sure that they get that. Thats why I oppose this amendment. and I understand the gentlemans frustration with that. The RUS Broadband Loan Program does provide the needed leverage to fund construction. It also provides the ability to improve our systems in these areas and to acquire the facilities and equipment that are needed to provide broadband to these communities. Folks. this is absolutely critical. This amendment. unfortunately. takes us away from that. I want to make sure that reforms are put in place so the system works. not taking away that opportunity for our rural areas.",

    "speech": "I thank my friend from New York. I thought it so very unfair that the majority party would be fighting this out without somebody from the minority party jumping in in opposition to the proposal. I am delighted that the FCC has provided $400plus million for what is a very essential service. I am also very happy that the Department of Agriculture continues with the program in which they have a unique ability to reach out to these rural communities. The Department of Agriculture has the men. the women and the organizational structure to provide direct access and direct service. Perhapsjust perhapsthe Department of Agriculture program. together with the FCC program. might actually get the job done. Its very. very important.",

It was just mentioned from the other side of the aisle that. with both programs. duplication is unnecessary with the changes in the Connect America Fund. I believe that the Rural Broadband Loan Program will only become more obsolete. Therefore. I believe that we must act now to eliminate the authorization of this program. and I do urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 30 seconds remaining.",
