His talents were recognized by the late President Kennedy. under whom Assistant Secretary Reed was appointed. His ability is known to many Members of the Congress as a result of his keen awareness of the role these agencies play in the Government. In particular. Assistant Secretary Reeds performance is well known to the Members of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. which has many jurisdictional interests in these agencies.

Interama was established as a State of Florida agency in 1951 and the purpose of the agency is to do whatever may be necessary for the establishment. construction. maintenance. operation. and financing of an InterAmerican Cultural and Trade Center in or near Miami. Fla.. as a permanent enterprise. The character and purpose of Interama were outlined in 1951 by Dr. W. H. Walker. the first chairman of the organization. and a distinguished Floridian. who said: The worldwide Communist drive must be met by a stronger one for truth. freedom. and democracy. If communism continues to spread the next 5 years as it has the past 5. a majority of the worlds population will be under Kremlin control. greatly enhancing the possibility of eventual Russian military victory. The nations of this hemisphere constitute a strong and unconquerable group if they will stand solidly together and restrain communism within their own borders. Unless the United States can solidly cement its relations with the Latin American people. it is in a poor position to do so in other faraway countries. Interama is to be a permanent reminder of our Nations Interest in our hemispherea living reminder of our belief in representative government and freedom for all people. This lasting memorial to the Americas will stand as a strong example to other nations in our desire for a permanent peace and security for our area and of the world. I am hopeful the House will act favorably on this important project. which has had the backing of the last five Presidents of the United States. the Florida congressional delegation. the Governor and cabinet of Florida. the State legislature. and the citizens of our State. In these days of continuing crisis in Latin America we need this concrete display of the cultures of North and South America to stand not only as an example of our mutual desire for freedom. but also as a bulwark in our national defense effort. Participation by our Government will insure the success of Interama and assist the purpose of the undertaking as outlined by Dr. Walker. meeting the Communist threat with truth. freedom. and democracy through this hemispheric illustration of solidarity.

The following editorial supporting this position was broadcast on September 15 and 16. 1965. by WTOP here in Washington: If the District of Columbia is to have partisan political elections. as called for in the administrations home rule bill. we cant see any alternative except to amend the Hatch Act. Under the present plan. Federal employees living in the District of Columbia would be entitled to participate in political management and campaigns in the election of a District mayor. the District delegate to Congress. and the members of the city council. This is true even though those offices would be filled by partisan candidates. that is. candidates running under the Democratic and Republican labels. - If we are to have partisan elections. the Hatch Act amendment is indispensable to the process of democracy in this city. Without it. selfgovernment would be substantially handicapped. The Senate District Committee has made the point that the total of potential electors in the District who are Federal employees may run as high as 35 percent.

During the past 10 years investigating availability of government information. the subcommittee which I head has looked into dozens of information problems involving the Air Force.

They have given the most careful consideration to the recommendations which the House Government Operations Committee has adopted as a result of the subcommittees investigations.

Today I would like to pay special tribute to these High Holy Days by joining with my colleagues here in the House to extend to all people of the Jewish faith my sincere wishes for a happy and prosperous new year. The high holidays usher in the year 5726 on the Jewish calendar. Rosh Hashanah. the new year. begins a 10day period of repentance which culminates in Yom Kippur. the day of atonement. These are solemn and holy daysa time for fasting. prayer. and personal meditation between man and God. On these high holy days. Jews all over the world pause to reexamine their lives. to thank God for the gifts which He has bestowed upon them. to ask His forgiveness for the sins which they have committed during the preceding year. and to pray for His understanding and guidance so that they may profit from their errors. It goes without saying that no one can plan for his future until he examines and understands his past. No one can take on further responsibility before he begins to fulfill his present obligations. The spirit of the Jewish holidays units men of all faiths by calling upon them to look inward and upwardwithin themselves and up to Godin order to open the way for a richer and fuller existence. In these times of world conflict and unrest. it is my sincere hope that the spirit of these holidays will extend to men everywhere and that the sound of the shofar will call upon all mankind to reexamine their lives and to pray to God for His understanding and guidance. Judaism is the religion which first envisaged social justice and preached the sanctity and dignity of human life. Too often these ageold teachers are forgotten. but during the High Holy Days let us reaffirm the hope that they will no longer be ignored and that all men will joint together in the coming year and accept their responsibility to God and themselves. In welcoming the Jewish holidays. I take pride in repeating the ancient blessing which symbolizes this hope: May you be inscribed. once again. in the book of life for a good new year.

No one has ever done more for baseballand young peoplethan the loved and respected and gentle Ed Knebel. We shall miss him greatly. He was the founder and president of SevenUp Bottling Co. and the father of professional baseball in Austin. Knebel began playing baseball when he was 12. Sixty years later he became the first person installed in Austins baseball hall of fame. when Milwaukee Braves President John McHale presented him with a gold baseball glove. During World War I. while serving in the artillery. he saved enough money to open a cleaning and pressing business in France. From his earnings in this business he purchased the NuIcy and NuGrape franchises in Austin in 1927. His present SevenUp company was opened in 1935. Knebels continuous athletic activity earned him the title of Mr. Baseball. When the old city league folded. he continued to play his SevenUp teams against teams out of Austin. He helped form the Big State League in 1947. and was instrumental in getting the $200.000 Disch Field. In 1962 he gave Disch Field to the city. I think every man. in his life. wants to feel he might have made some singular contribution to the welfare of humanity. Ed Knebels primary contribution was his 100 percent devotion to baseball and to the young men of his community. He lived and worked constantly to encourage young boys to play sports and to live wholesome lives. Tens of thousands of young men have been helped through his dedication. and our city and Nation is a much better place because of Ed Knebel who led the good life of productive service to others.

I have asked leave at this time to extend my remarks made in St. Louis in order to call to the attention of my colleagues in the House the fact that although H.R. 202 was favorably reported by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs almost 2 months ago. it has not been granted a rule. It is no nearer consideration by our body of the Congress than when it was reported early in June. It is my hope some of the thoughts expressed at St. Louis may be meaningful to those Members who have suffered the loss of a VA facility in their districts. I remain equally hopeful that portions of those remarks might serve as a reminder to Members of Congress who believe that care for our veteran population should not be reduced or downgraded. They should be reminded that the battle has not been won. There must be a reversal of the January decision. Now it appears it will be necessitated by the intensification of our military efforts in southeast Asia. Following is the text of my remarks:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. in the 67 years since it was founded. the Fraternal Order of Eagles has successfully sponsored Federal and State legislation sought by the workingman in his struggle for social justice. Eagles were in the very forefront of the battle for oldage pension laws and for the establishment of workmens compensation. The Social Security Act of 1935 was enacted after a 14year fight under the leadership of the Eagles and organized labor. In recent years. the FOE has turned Its attention to mitigating the cruel economic discrimination exercised against workers who seek new employment in the years of their maturity. Through a jobsafter40 campaign. Eagles have sought to affirm the propositon that a prospective employee ought to be judged by his previous work experience. by his capabilities. and his willingness to workbut not by the arbitrary yardstick of his chronological age. Their concerted efforts have led to the enactment of 23 State laws which prohibit employment practices that arbitrarily discriminate on account of age. In turn. these laws created a climate in which President Johnson could issue Executive Order No. 11141. banning the use of age limits in advertising or in employment practices by any contractor or subcontractor doing business with the U.S. Government. On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of Aerie No. 385. I had the pleasure to address my Brother Eagles in Independence. Mo.. on the subjectof jobsafter40 legislation. Under previous leave granted me. I am inserting the text of that speech at this point in the RECORD: THE EAGLES JoasAFTER40 CAMPAIGN It is always a pleasure to address my Brother Eagles. Qther fraternal orders promote good fellowship. do good deeds. and do them well. Other fraternal orders provide death payments or other benefits to their members. But the Eagles go further than that. They reach outside their own ranks to promote the welfare of all mankind. As an Eagleand as your CongressmanI am praticularly interested in accomplishments of the Eagles in fostering timely legislation to alleviate pressing social problems. Certainly no legislative efforts could be more appropriate and more timely In this age of automation than the national Eagle program to eliminate job discrimination against men and women after they reach the age of 40. Did you ever stop to think about the pleasant anomaly involved in the Eagles legislative efforts?",

Oakland. Calif.. has an airport that is Very historic. It was constructed in 1927 and enjoyed steady growth in air traffic until World War II. Unfortunately. following the war. when the commercial carriers were developing service based upon larger aircraft. they began concentrating their landings and takeoffs at San Francisco. which is immediately across the bay. In order to compete in this situation. Oakland began a remodeling and expansion project for its airport. When the alterations of the airport were completed and it was renamed the Oakland International Airport. a great struggle resulted to make certain that adequate service was provided by commercial carriers. This struggle is still continuing. However. the testimony presented by Mr. Ben E. Nutter. executive director of the port of Oakland. before the aforementioned subcommittee on July 9. 1965. explains the marked degree of success which Oakland has been having in its efforts to reestablish a position as one of the countrys outstanding air terminals.

We have now come face to face with the realization that the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans on the highways each year are not inevitable. We have come to understand that no dramatic safety program is possible which does not act upon the entire complex of factors which create hazard on the highways. Driver education alone is not enough. The design of highways alone is not enough. Encouragement of vigorous State automobile inspection is not enough. No meaningful safety program can ignore any of these elements. And no meaningful program can shortchange the basic role of the automobile itself and its principal componentthe automobile tire. The events of the last several months have made us realize that safer cars and safer tires can be engineered and economically produced. And the awful toll of highway deaths has brought us to the realization that safer automobiles and safer tires must be produced. The Highway Safety Act which the President has sent us today represents a comprehensive. manyfaceted program for promoting automobile safety. It is a program which should receive the wholehearted. vigorous attention of the Senate. I am particularly pleased to note that the President has endorsed the MagnusonNelson Tire Safety Act of 1966. S. 2669. as an integral part of the Nations safety programs. Several bills relating to automobile safety have been introduced by various Senators in particular the Senator* from Wisconsin . Vigorous hearings have been held by the Senator from Connecticut . The Committee on Commerce has held hearings on several bills relating to automobile safety. The committee is about ready to report an automobile tire safety bill. which is. of course. included in this manyfacet program. The bill just introduced is. of course. in the nature of an overall bill which. it is hoped. will reach generally all the facets and will add up to a good national safety program. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent. in this connection. to have printed at the conclusion of my remarks letters from the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. which contain the administrations endorsement of S. 2669. and also a sectionbysection summary of the proposed Traffic Safety Act of 1966.",

Tex. The Chamizal Treaty National Memorial would stand in commemoration of the historic treaty of 1964 which ended 100 years of disagreement with our neighbor to the south. Under the Chamizal Treaty. 630 acres of land in El Paso. Tex.. were returned to Mexico and 193 acres of Mexican land north of the Rio Grande were returned to the United States. Under this bill. it is proposed to set aside 55 acres of this returned 193 acres for the erection of a suitable monument and a museuminformation center. The remainder of the 193 acres will be transferred to the city of El Paso. it is expected to be developed in a manner harmonious with the National Memorial. Extensive changes have been required In El Paso as a result of the January 17. 1964 Chamizal Treaty. The bed of the Rio Grande is to be relocated northward to reflect the new boundary. many families and businesses are having to relocate to accomplish the change. Basic legislation authorizing the compensation of those relocating was passed in 1964 and that program is proceeding. Another feature of the overall Chamizal Treaty plan is the authorization of a border highway along the new riverbank. That proposal is now pending before the Senate as S. 2630. a bill I introduced last October. The bill I introduce today has the endorsement of the Interior Department. The Advisory Board on National Parks. Historic Sites. Buildings. and Monuments has heartily endorsed the proposal as a symbol of international good will and friendship with Mexico. My bill will be a companion to H.R. 7402. sponsored by Representative RICHARD WHITE. of El Paso. The Chamizal Treaty has been a signal accomplishment in proving the ability of nations to solve their differences by peaceful negotiation. no matter how long standing the dispute or how easy to maintain an unyielding position if in defense of a historic claim. The Chamizal Treaty is a noble example of the fine relations we enjoy with the Republic of Mexico.

The bill to which I am adding this amendment provides a \"program for the further comprehensive development of water resources of the Lower Colorado River Basin and for the provision of additional and adequate water supplies for use in the Upper as well as in the Lower Colorado River Basin.\" The term \"west Texas.\" as used herein. encompasses the high plains area and the irrigable areas in the upper portions of the Red.

It is not too much for the Government to continue to make available to the school districts our surplus milk from the CCC. most of which is now stored in Government warehouses at taxpayer expense. It certainly makes more sense for the Nations needy schoolchildren to have the milk. The administration contends that the cut in this program is needed in order to support other measures. Mr. President. this statement when first observed seems commendable. However. this statement Is hardly believable when we review the many proposals for new funds that continually come before us in the Congress. Some of the administrations proposals are of questionable value. others are simply not required. The school milk program. however. is a valuable and a valid one.

Are these accounts audited In the host countries? If so. by whom?

Federal disposals ballooned to 140.2 million bushels in February. up from only 8.4 million bushels in December and the largest for any month U 4 years. As this report shows. Chicago prices on No. 2 Yellow corn. a key grade. have dropped to $1.27 per bushel. or down 6 -cents from 3 weeks ago. The clear import of this news story is that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now acting like the Office of Price Administration of World War II days. It is taking an active role in price controls on one of our most important grains. It Is deliberately depressing the corn price by dumping the Government surplus. This shocking activity certainly should be stopped by Secretary Freeman. Is it fair to farmers for this administration to wink its eye at wage and price increases in excess of 3.2 percent alleged CXIi335Part 4 JohnsonHumphrey guidelines for other segments of the economy and then turn around and depress the corn market?

Those of us who live in the Midwest suffered the effects of a soft corn crop last yeara crop that could not be held over but one that had to be merchandised one way or the other immediately. This corn could not be stored. so toward the end of last year the country elevators bought good corn from the Commodity Credit Corporation so they could serve their customers during the period when feed is needed. I received a long distance telephone call last week just after the Commodity Credit Corporation had dumped a vast amount of corn on the Minneapolis market. This call came from a small country elevator operator who said: I lost $12.000 because of this Government action. I bought high from the Government. they sold low at Minneapolis and cut my legs off at the knees. This has gone on and represents an obviously frantic attempt on the part of the Department of Agriculture to keep corn prices down. I can only assume that they fear a natural price increase which would drive food prices up. This is a sad commentary on the action being taken by those who were proponents of high supports and who spoke loudly of 100 percent of parity for the American farmer. The Secretary of Agriculture has deliberately held feed grain prices below parity during his entire administration. This whole administration seems to insist on policing prices on everyone but themselves. The continued deficit spending of this administration has contributed more to inflation than any other single factor. Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues in protesting these inexcusable price depressing practices by the Department of Agriculture. and I am bringing this situation to the attention of the chairman of our House Agriculture Committee asking that he institute a committee investigation of the selling practices of the Commodity Credit Corporation.",

It is this age and income bracket which suffers the most from trying to live on small fixed incomes in a time of rising consumer prices. Inflation is fast becoming a reality to these people. and if they are to remain selfsufficient and able to live on the retirement benefits they have earned. some adjustment has to be made which will allow them to do so. In addition. many of the people who will be covered by this bill are also covered by certain provisions of the Economic Opportunity Act. but due to poor administration. are not receiving the assistance which was intended under that act.",

I rose on the floor of the House to inform my colleagues of my grave concern over the proposed acquisition by Chase Manhattan Bank of the Liberty National Bank & Trust Co.. Buffalo. N.Y. Chase is a $13 billion Wall Street banking giant. the Nations second largest. and Libertywith assets of over onethird of a billion dollars--is itself a huge institution. Clearly. the disappearance of Liberty as a competitor of Chase would be detrimental to the banking public and further add to the already great concentration of banking resources in that State. Since both institutions are national banks. Congress has both the right. as well as the responsibility to be vitally concerned. Furthermore. the integrity of State laws on branch banking and holding companies which by Federal law are also applicable to national banks is at stake here. On February 16. Superintendent of Banks Frank Wille disapproved Chases proposal to acquire and control Liberty under New Yorks holding company law. * My own objection to this transaction Is that the acquisition of corporate stock by national banks is clearly forbidden by the National Banking Act. If banks were permitted to acquire and control other businesses. especially banks. independent businessmen. and bankers would rapidly disappear from the American scene. Comptroller of the Currency James J. Saxon. supervisor of national banks. finally realized the weakness of his original decision permitting Chase to acquire the stock of Liberty on the ground that owning the stock of other banks is incidental to the business of banking. Mr. Saxon then decided that he might be able to assist in legalizing this questionable transaction under the provisions of the Bank Merger Act of 1960. But the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation take the position that the transaction is simply not a merger In the first place. Furthermore. the Department of Justice is considering an action under the antitrust laws. In view of the importance of Mr. Willes decision to the future of dual. competitive banking in America. with unanimous consent I hereby insert it at this point In the RECORD:",

There are another 4.5 million people whose low incomes keep them out of standard. decent housing. which I think is the goal of each of us. Last year we enacted legislation to authorize a rent supplement program. Unless we appropriate funds to make this program workable. the entire concept of a decent home for American families becomes a shallow promise. We can shut our eyes if we choose to do so. But. Mr. Chairman. this state of life without hope is a real thing in too many American cities. And it is a dangerous thing in every American city In which it exists. It contributed to the rioting in Watts. and it can explode into rioting and civil disorder in many great cities in the land. We must act positively to eliminate one of the basic causes of unrest by helping our povertystricken families get better and more decent housing. Mr. Chairman. make no mistake about it. we are talking about poor people. This program Is restricted to families whose income would make them eligible for public housing. and it is limited to five specific categories. In addition to thatand may I say to my friend. the gentleman from Michigan . who has looked upon this as so much window dressingwhat we have said about this today is a part of the legislative history of this appropriation act.

The program is geared to private enterprise. and will at last allow the private sector of the economy to attack the problem of providing homes for lowincome families. Funds to finance the projects will come from regular private mortgage markets. The projects will be built by private builders. Mortgages will be insured by the Federal Housing Administration at a market rate of interest and the only Federal funds Involved will be for the supplement itself. The rent supplement itself will in time. we hope. take the place of the supplement which the Federal Government is furnishing to those who occupy public housing units. Now. Mr. Chairman. the able gentleman from California [Mr. TALcOTTI. circulated a letter yesterday in which he attached an article from Readers Digest which purports to deal with FHA procedures and practices. I have read the article. In my opinion it is without perspective. and we would be without vision if we were to follow the Lorelei call away from a program that would help our poor. Mr. Chairman. through the Federal Housing Administration we have become a nation of homeowners. More than 1 million units of rental housing have been produced. The agencys total volume is over $100 billion. and the agency has been a moneymaking agency for the Federal Government. While I do not condone impropriety or malpractice. I believe that articles such as this should be considered against the total activity of this agency. The question we have before us Is whether or not we will help the poor people of our country and if we want to offer private enterprise an opportunity to do the job. If the.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. in the Washington Evening Star of July 18. 1966. I noted that a Republican congressional candidate in Maryland. Nick Nonnenmacher. who many of us knew as administrative assistant to our colleagues Don Bruce and GLENN ANDREWS. pointed out that title V of the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1966 would eliminate the exemption in the public accommodations section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act for the small lodging house proprietor. I am sure you all remember the fuss and furore about \"Mrs. Murphys Boarding House\" in the debate on public accommodations on the floor in 1964. Finally. our righteous liberal friends prevailed. and passed that law. after they compromised on this point. It is highly interesting to check into the 1966 language. Nonnenmacher may well be right inasmuch as title V of this 1966 bill. H.R. 14765. both as originally proposed. and as reported by the House Judiciary Committee. makes no reference to the exemption for \"Mrs. Murphy\" type lodging houses. Section 201 (b) of title II of Public Law 88352. the 1964 act. states: Each of the following establishments which serves the public is a place of public accomodation within the meaning of this title if Its operations affect commerce. or if discrimination or segregation by it Is supported by State action: (1) any inn. hotel. motel. or other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests. other than an establishment located within a building which contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and which is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as his residence. In section 501(a) (9) of title V of H.R. 14765 I find language that would make it unlawful to prevent anyone on grounds of race. color. religion. or national origin from enjoyingand I quote. \"The goods. services. facilities. privileges. advantages or accomodations of any inn. hotel. motel. or other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests.\" Mr. Speaker. in the words that follow that portion I quoted I see nothing that would guarantee the continuationif this bill becomes law as writtenof the exemption from designation as public accomodations of any establislvnent containing five rooms or less for rent or hire.

In effect. the E people themselves select the jury panels that try cases and return indictments. It has not been thought wise to place this authority in the hands of the prosecutors. or any other executive agency. By this bill and this title. the Federal Attorney General seeks authority. himself. through a suit in the Federal court. to appoint the jury commissioner in the State courts who would draw their jury panels. or. to say the least. oversee same. This is destructive of the zealously and jealously guarded right of trial by jury. This title indicates the same lack of faith in the State judges. as Is indicated for Federal judges in title I. The State courts guard the right of trial by jury. and a party litigant is always free to timely raise the question of discrimination in jury selection. If his motion is overruled by the State courts. the U.S. Supreme Court is quick to accept and to make the case for review. This is a right that is amply protected under present law. The law has always frowned upon intermeddlers. yet this title would authorize the Attorney General. by statute. to become an intermeddler of the most officious type. Great. unreasonable. and unconscionable burdens would be placed on local officials to provide the required voluminous reports. and vast new armies of employees in the Justice Department would be created to oversee and examine these reports. During the inadequate consideration of this bill by the Committee on the Judiciary. some of us tried to get an estimate of the probable cost involved in this bill. if enacted.

Any legislation that further and more aggressively implements the constitutional guarantee of citizenship rights. is good legislation. Sure there will be arguments about the crossing of \"ts.\" the dotting of \"is\" and legal as well as constitutional interpretation. But no one can legitimately argue that the Constitution of our Nation does anything but grant equal rights and privileges to all citizens regardless of race. color. religion. or national origin. The big vacuum of course is in implementation. That is to say. how does one seek and get remedy without necessary paraphernalia having been properly established by law? This civil rights bill establishes that paraphernalia. It establishes in clear and concise terms what is outside the law. It spells out clearly and concisely every avenue of redress. It spells out the meaning and definition of the word citizenship as the Constitution cannot. Contrary to views shared by those who oppose this and similar legislation. the Constitution can and should occasionally be clarified by statutory legislation. It is only by statute that some of the doubts and therefore arguments can be removed. It is by statute that the law of this land can be made abundantly clear and its people indivisible. It is by statute that penalties can be prescribed for those who abuse and violate the law. While I am at it. Mr. Chairman. I want to make my position unmistakably clear on one other pointthat of the socalled black power. I am not sure it has been properly defined by anyone. But the connotation is there. If per chance it means black against white with the use of force and violence. I vigorously oppose it. While I know economic injustice is the major reason for the rash of riots and lawlessness of recent date. one cannot harbor or condone thievery. the destruction of private property and the taking of human life. The only way to accomplish equality of opportunity is by legal means. That is what we are again doing today. We have made great progress in just a few years.

I still hope that what remains improper in this legislation. after amendment. can be so inconsequential that an affirmative vote would be proper. There are ideas in the bill which I strongly favor. For instance. I enthusiastically favor workable procedures to guard against discrimination in the selection of juries. and strengthening laws against depriving citizens of their rights to assert by legal and peaceful means their constitutional rights of citizenship. These reforms. indeed. are overdue. There are other procedural changes in the law that I do not find objectionable. But I do find title IV objectionable as a deprivation of a. persons right to contract with whomever he wishes. and of doubtful practical effect in any event. The provision applies only to real estate contracts but if it can be justified for that. what could be the limits to interference in all and any individual rights of a citizen? Furthermore. the States which have State laws on the subject have not had outstanding records of accomplishing what title IV seeks. So. since this section is of doubtful constitutionality and does infringe upon the rights of citizens to contract. and seems to have little chance of accomplishing anything constructive. I sincerely hope this section will be stricken from the bill. That section offers false hope and will be thus just another splash of gasoline on the embers of unrestand for no predictable good.",

His mother. in her anguish. complained to me that Private Ziegler had been trained for military police duty and. except for basic training. was given only 2 days of instruction for combat prior to being ordered into battle. Two days of training. however intensive. could hardly prepare a young recruit to fight against the Vietcong. perhaps the most experienced guerrilla fighters in the world. The Army. when asked for an explanation of Private Zieglers training and assignment. responded with scarcely more than confirmation that. because of a shortage of infantrymen. Private Ziegler had indeed been thrown into combat with little training. Its statement that \"every effort is made to avoid assigning soldiers who have completed advanced training in one branch to duty in a different branch\" was less than fully reassuring. and I requested a thorough reconsideration of the training program for recruits going to Vietnam. The report which I have just received is more encouraging. The Army now assures me that it is conducting a continuous review of all phases of its recruit training program. One product of this reevaluation is a special. Vietnamoriented. 9week advanced program for infantry replacements. designed to train individuals under conditions found in Vietnam and including a 5day field problem conducted in a simulated Vietnamese village.

Earlier in this Congress. when we were seeking an equitable wheat bill. it was labeled a \"bread tax.\" and we were forced to have the wheat certificates paid for out of the General Treasury. largely because of misleading publicity. Those of us from agricultural areas. from both sides of the political aisle. have been protesting these unfair tactics and our protests are beginning to be heard. I was extremely gratified to see this mornings editorial in the Washington Post which points out that the bakery industry is now raising the price of bread and is attempting to put the burden of blame on the farmer. The Post. certainly not known as an agricultural paper. indicates very clearly that the farmers are not responsible for this raise in bread prices.

I am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to their trust is their loyalty to their nation. I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body tonight. Twentyeight years ago I felt as you do now. You will soon learn that you are among men whose first love is their country. men who try each day to do as best they can what they believe is right. We are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union. Two hundred years ago. in 1765. nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power. For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man. One hundred years ago. in 1865. following a terrible test of blood and fire. the compact of union was finally sealed. For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the American community. That struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over. But we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history of freedom. And so tonight. now. in 1965. we begin a new quest for union. We seek the unity of man with the world that he has builtwith the knowledge that can save or destroy himwith the cities which can stimulate or stifle himwith the wealth and machines which can enrich or menace his spirit. We seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the quality of our civilization.

The other three would amend various sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act. One would increase in three steps the minimum wage for those covered by the act to $2 per hour. Another would require the payment of overtime for those covered who worked in excess of 35 hours per week. This would be accomplished in two steps. And the last would extend the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the act to a significant number of Americans who now work without either of these protections. I recognize. of course. that the administration will send to Congress its own bills dealing with certain. or perhaps all. of these subjects. However.

Although some members of the committee opposed certain features of the bill. I believe that on the whole the debate in committee and on the floor has been very constructive. I believe it is a bill which is national in its purpose. although it is directed toward a region. and I believe that it is a carefully constructed bill which has grown out of much thought and effort in the States and in the Senate over the last 6 years. I recall that in 1959. when I first introduced a bill looking to the coordination of such programs as are included in this legislation. the concept of area development was just gaining wider interest. If this bill now enjoys the success we hope. it may very well serve. and properly so. as a model after which other parts of our country may seek to develop carefully constructed development programs based on initial effort and consultation and coordination in and by the people and officials of the areas affected. From my own observation. this has already given hope to the people of this region. as they have looked toward its enactment. I hope very much that the States will continue to give the same creativity and spirit of cooperation to the administration of this program that they have in its development. I believe it could be a model type of program. demonstrating how to achieve the fuller development of what I have called in years past the underdeveloped regions of our country. and I think our debate in the Senate has contributed to the strength of the program on which we now vote.",

He complains about the harassment practiced upon him by the Post Office Department. in the form of daily postcards which he must return to the Post Office Department in order to obtain his mail from the U.S.S.R. In my view. it is ridiculous that Congress has given the Department the power to screen and delay the reading matter of American citizens which is labeled \"political propaganda.\" Americans should be able to read what they like. without governmental interference. It is hoped that the Supreme Court will rid us of this law. as violative of the first amendment to the Constitution. Yet. as long as it is on the books. it is the job of the Post Office Department to enforce it. However. the Department can enforce it in such a way as to minimize. not maximize. the harassment of our citizens. By burning the records of the Post Office Department on who wants the foreign mail and who does not. the Post Office Department has maximized the harassment. If someone such as Professor Harrison has a daily subscription to a foreign paper or magazine labeled \"political propaganda.\" he will receive from. and must return to. the Post Office Department 365 postcards a year.

Czechoslovakia. and so forth. we overlook the fact that the first victim of communism was Russia and we fail to realize that the peoples of both Russia and China are as much the victims of Communist colonialism as are the Baltic peoples. the Magyars. Poles. Bohemians. and so forth. Soviet Russia is a huge conglomeration of ethnic groups whose independence has been as ruthlessly exterminated by the Communists as it was earlier by the czars. At the same time that we are expressing our sympathies for the peoples who live behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains. some powerful voices are urging closer contacts with Communist China and its recognition by the United States. The same voices call for steppedup trade with the Reds. There are some who say that \"you just cant ignore 700 million Chinese.\" Have these people forgotten that the Peking Communist regime has. during its 17 years in power. liquidated many millions of people and placed other millions in slave labor camps?

Few acts perpetrated by the Soviets were as blatant and loathsome as was the capture and enslavement of the large number of East European nations.

It is for this reason. Mr. Speaker. that the Congress and. our Chief Executives have for years observed this Captive Nations Week. The whole purpose of this observance is to focus attention on conditions prevailing in eastern and central Europe and to reaffirm our refusal to accept them as permanent. Mr. Speaker. I join with my colleagues in expressing our hope that the day will soon come when the people of such countries as Poland. Hungary. Rumania. and of all the other countries currently dominated by communism. will once again enjoy the full blessings of freedom.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has been almost 49 years since communism won its first victory by overthrowing the Kerensky government in Russia. Since then Communists have seized power in Eastern Europe. parts of Asia. and most recently Cuba. Nowhere have the Communists come to power through free elections. Force and violence have been the hallmark of their success. The Congress which is elected by freemen has taken note of these misdeeds and others in the captive nations resolution of the 86th Congress and since then during Captive Nations Week. We hope that things are getting better. that the era of suppression is passing. Still we read that the Lutheran Church is being prevented from holding its convocation in East Germany. The Polish Catholic hierarchy Is being challenged by the Communist government as it attempts to celebrate the 1.000th anniversary of Polands conversion to Christianity and Polands birth as a nation. In the Soviet Union itself. dissenting writers are being suppressed as illustrated by the trials held recently for two authors who dared to criticize the regime in their works. These are but a few recent examples of how freedom is still being suppressed. We in the West know of them only because they involved famous people or large organizations. The plight of the common man is probably just as great for he is caught in conflicts between his inner strivings to be free and the world in which he must live. Mr. Speaker. we can hope that someday these people will be able to live in a world which will not suppress their desire to be free. Until that day we shall demonstrate through actions such as the proclamation of Captive Nations Week that we know of their plight and desire as much as they do to see a world which knows only freedom for all of its inhabitants.",

Czechoslavakia lost its independence in 1939. Swiftly. taking the Western democracies by surprise. Estonia. Latvia. Lithuania. Poland. Hungary. Albania. Bulgaria. and Rumania were subjugated to the Communist onslaught. These nations and East Germany which the Russians have never released from bondage following their defeat. comprise close to 100 million people. Most of these nations had during the two decades since the First World War enjoyed freedom and independence and were valued members of the community of free nations. although they were in constant fear of the growing threats of nazism and communism. World War II halted and defeated nazism but left in its wake the confusion which laid the groundwork for the Communists startling and devastating conquest. These nations joined many others. Armenia and the Ukraine included. who had been crushed and absorbed into the Soviet bloc. Twentyone years have passed and these countries remain. under the guise of peoples democracies. Soviet satellites exploited for the benefit of the Soviet Union. But the leaders of the free world and the government of this Republic in particular have not forgotten this enslavement of a large part of the worlds population. During this week. observed and declared as Captive Nations Week. we renew our resolution to foster the growth and eventual independence of these countries and remain determined to see the freedom of these captive nations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. Captive Nations Week was established in July of 1959 through a joint congressional resolution and a Presidential proclamation. By that long overdue act both Congress and the President implemented the wholehearted wishes of the people of this country. For many years a number of nations have been trapped behind the Iron Curtain and enslaved under the tyranny of Communist totalitarianism. These captive nations comprise a good portion of Europes total population of 100 million. They occupy areas In central and eastern Europe. and were sovereign states before World War II. Most of these countries regained their freedom for a while after the First World War. and all of them became valued members of the world community of free nations. During the Interwar years. many of them were in real danger of losing their freedom. Unfortunately. their worst fears were justified very early in the war. All were engulfed In the world catastrophe and all suffered the loss of their priceless independence. Yet they endured the ordeal with courage. hoping that they would regain their freedom at the end of the war. But these hopes were never realized. Instead of freedom. they found Communist totalitarianism. And today. after more than two decades. these tens of millions of peoples who enjoyed a real measure of freedom before the war. are still prisoners in their homelands. and their Communist captors continue to hold them behind the abominable Iron Curtain. While it is true that in recent years the Communist hold over some of the European nations has been ostensibly relaxed. none of these peoples actually do enjoy the true liberty that the peoples of the free West do. It is our ardent desire to see the captive nations freed of tyranny. We are reminded this week to renew our determination to continue the fight for their freedom. It is our hope. Mr. Speaker. that through peaceful means this freedom may be attained. and that these capitive nations may once more regain their sovereignty and independence.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. twice in the same week it has become necessary for me to denounce on the floor of this House outrageous violations of clear congressional intent as expressed in our banking laws. This past Monday I brought to the attention of my colleagues in the House the disclosure that commercial banks appear to be making clear headway to reenter the securities business from which they have been banned for over 30 years. Commercial banking and investment banking were separated by law in 1933 because of the disclosure of shocking abuses which had resulted from affiliations between banks and their stock operations. Today I rise to protest a different but equally harmful maneuver which can only result in undermining our dual system of privately owned and freely competitive independent banks. Although the law is perfectly clear that national banks may not purchase the stock of other corporations (12 U.S.C. 24 (Eighth)) this is exactly what Chase Manhattan proposes to do in taking over the Liberty National Bank & Trust Co. of Buffalo. N.Y.. a huge bank in its own right with over a third of a billion dollars in resources. What is so discouraging. Mr. Speaker. is the fact that instead of protecting the public interests first and foremost in their bank supervisory decisions the banking agencies. in this case the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board. appear to be more interested in serving the wishes of the big banks of the Nation. Time and again I have brought attention to my colleagues in the House the shocking conduct of the banking agencies in issuing invalid regulations obviously in response to big bank pressures. The way these agencies conduct their supervisory activities is an affront to Congress and betrayal of a public trust. How much longer we will stand for this is the question I raise today. The situation has become so serious that I have taken the liberty of communicating with Attorney General Katzenbach. expressing my views and requesting that the Department of Justice consider taking action. in this case under its authority to enforce the antitrust laws as well as to protect violations of the National Bank Act.

Mr. Memmott was educated at Brigham Young University. at the University of Idaho and the University of Geneva. His experience is in administration. Mr. Memmott learned much through his Utah background. particularly how to save and cut costs at every turn. He has achieved an excellent record of trimming costs in the Bureau of Mines. particularly in the area of travel expenses. By careful and constant supervision of all Bureau travel. Acting Director Memmott was able to reduce the Bureaus travel costs some 11 percent for fiscal year 1964. Even more impressive was his feat of reducing the 1965 fiscal year travel expenses afull 23 percent. which was a savings of more than $171.800 for the year.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. one of the increasingly important challenges facing us today is to searchingly examine and prudently move toward achieving a more wholesome and even balance and separability between and among the units and powers of government at the National. State. and local levels. Many authorities have voiced their concern at the accelerating temptation and tendency of the State and community units to surrender too many of their responsibilities and energies to the influence and direction of remote planners and consulters within the agencies of the Federal Government. This tendency is perhaps a natural development in connection with the huge Federal assistance appropriations going to the State and community operations in concert with the duty of the Federal Government. in this nuclear age. to encourage and inspire working partnerships with the States and communities in the common objective of national progress. The fear is that these partnerships. admittedly in good cause. may unwittingly become unhealthily disjointed and eventually operate against the best whole interest. if we do not watch out. Money may be. as in other things. at the root of this unhappy tendency of the States and local governments to give up too much of their community home responsibility and independence but the evil is not inevitable if we are wise enough to recognize its approach and take effective steps against it. It is precisely in order to initiate and develop effective ways and means to restrain this situation. while retaining and promoting the wholesome and dynamic cooperation of the Federal Government with other levels below in obvious areas of essential need. that I have introduced a bill. H.R. 11770. to establish a system for the sharing of certain Federal tax receipts with the States. Mr. Speaker. the traditional principle. that the best government is the government closest to the people. still remains true. It is to that fundamental truth and purpose this bill is directed. I hope that early in the next session the Congress will devote itself to the increasingly imperative need to encourage local government responsibility and independence in matters of home concern while preserving the coordinated energies and vision of wholesome partnership that has brought this country to the pinnacle of free world leadership. seeking only peace on earth and health and progress for all. everywhere.",

Third. peace must be based on moral and religious principles. He was not loved and honored just because he was the leader of his church. There were thousandsmillionsof others outside his church who looked upon this man and his journey as a symbol of something that is needed at this crucial moment in our lives.

This is the fact that some service personnel In combat areas receive a larger income tax exemption than others. It is past the time when this should be corrected. A revision of the Internal Revenue Code to make the exemption more equitable will not have a profound effect upon the lives of our men. but it will be an indication of the attention and solicitation which the citizens of America accord to them in their service to this great country. At the time of the Korean war. Mr. Speaker. the tax exemptions were set at their present levels.

Since that time the pay of enlisted personnel has risen considerably. and I believe rightly so. The result is that at present an enlisted man in a combat zone may now earn as much as $500. tax free. per month.

The Common Markets restrictive agriculture policies recently agreed on. however. make me uneasy about how American agriculture is going to fare as these negotiations continue under the auspices of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. These damaging new policies. plus the fact that our negotiators at Geneva have sometimes seemed inclined to trade off U.S. agriculture in favor of U.S. industrial interests. leads me to believe we must insist upon being kept fully briefed as the windup negotiations proceed. To my knowledge. Mr. Speaker. the Government has released very little information since the negotiations resumed this fall. It is urgent that the Department of Agriculture insist on fair treatment for American farmers at these sessions. and that farmers be kept abreast of negotiations developments.",

Recommendation No. 1 stated: Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons. party. or Government department. The phrase \"Government department\" is especially pertinent to the case of Otto Otepka. the State Department security officer who was dismissed from his post in 1963 for supplying information and testifying before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee concerning lax security procedures in the State Department. Although still on the State Department payroll. Mr. Otepka no longer works in the field of security. a field in which years of experience have preeminently qualified him. Mr. Otepka appealed the Departments decision. and by mutual consent his hearing was postponed until the last of the Internal Security Subcommittees hearings--there are 20 parts in allwere made public. On Saturday. October 1. part 20 of the hearings entitled. \"State Department Security196365\" was released to the public. thus removing the last obstacle to a resolution of the Otepka case. The Otepka case is extremely important from the standpoint of both the Government employee and the American taxpayer. If this case is not resolved in favor of Otepka. then all those in the employ of Governmental agencies better forget about putting \"loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to Government department.\" if such loyalty entails an honest effort to effect corrective action possibly embarrassing to his office but of benefit to the Nation. Every taxpayer should keep an eye on this case for the very obvious reason that every Government employee is working for him. the American citizen. to administer the affairs of government in the best interests of the country. The Chicago Tribune of October 2 carried an article by Philip Dodd concerning the release of part 20 of the hearings which I request be inserted in the RECORD at this point.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the issues in 1966 are many. They fall into four familiar and broad categories: peace. prosperity. the maintenance of the twoparty system. and the future course of federalism. Unlike any other time in recent memory. the American people are restless. discontented and wary of the public pronouncements of their elected officials. Americans are: uncertain about our objectives in Vietnam. unclear about when or whether the spiraling cost of living will top out. uneasy about the imbalance in our system of government that has placed our country on the brink of oneparty government and oneman rule. and unable to solve major problems in our society because the Federal Government has usurped the resources with which to do these jobs. In general terms. Mr. Speaker. these are the issues of 1966. There are. obviously. a great many more \"issues.\" But these. in my view. are the overriding ones--the ones that concern all Americans. no matter what their party affiliation. These issues touch at the core of concern that practically every American feels as he looks around at the world in which he lives. PEACE Peace is an issue because we are once again at war. Ours is a people that would do anything to bring about a lasting peace. Yet. American servicemen are fighting and dying again in a faroff place and many of our citizens are not sure why. Our objectives in Vietnamlong term and short rangehave never been clearly spelled out by our President.

I noted earlier that the union negotiators requested the President of the United States not to announce a settlement on Friday night. They wanted a chance to contact the leaders of the local unions and explain what was involved in the agreement. The President did not see fit to go along with their request. and he announced the settlement on radio and television around 11 oclock. I believe. The union members knew that no settlement could be reached without ratification of its terms by them. They did not know what was actually in the agreement. and they were highly incensed. I think a great many of them voted against it because of a certain pique with the President. for the action that he had taken in announcing an agreement on Friday night. It seems to me.

I believe that the Senator from Illinois will have to agree with me that this statement is correct. I think we should recall that the late President Kennedy. when confronted with the railroad strike. asked for legislation. He did not say that there was no need for it and that Congress should take action with a recommendation from the President. At that time. President Kennedy sent a message to Congress. and said he must have legislation to avoid a national emergency. We can talk about the business concerns affected by the strike. Unfortunately. they are. But so are 35.400 labor men and their families involved in the strike as well as the issue of breaking a strike not involving the public interest. I think that these should be considerations as well. I am disappointed in this union. I think it has been wrong in taking such an adamant position. I have said so publicly and repeatedly. I think that its judgment in this matter leaves much to be desired. But I also think that this motion which I have made will hasten and bring about an end to the strike. I think that will be the end result. I cannot understand my leader defending the President for not making recommendations. or for not sending recommendations to the Congress. I think that that is his responsibility and not the responsibility of any Member of Congress. I am disappointed and shocked. I do not like it at all.

As I demonstrate on this map before me. the urban renewal project lies adjacent to MIT. and under the administrative interpretation. improvements by MIT within onequarter of a mile of the urban renewal project will be covered. I call attention to the fact that there are other improvements as well which are needed in the area. which Is an area which certainly needs improvement. and which in many instances is one of blight. which will not be covered. singly and arbitrarily because the improvement Is more than 440 yards from the renewal project. The thrust of the legislation I am interested in would permit administrative rulings of eligibility to cover improvements beyond the onequarter of a mile. up to 1 mile in this particular instance. I understand. after talking with counsel. that this amendment would open up very broadrange questions. that there would be other universities. such as in Chicago and in Pennsylvania. which would be involved and that such a new rule might go too far. However. I understand there was special lagislation which permitted the University of Pennsylvania last year to extend the area up to a mile. In any event. it would seem to me much more sensible for the administration to look not just at distance. but also as to whether or not the improvements outside the eligible area relate to the improvements within the eligible area. such that they would logically be encompassed by the intent of section 112. then such improvements should be eligible. I hope the distinguished chairman will recognize this problem and its application to many urban areas in the country. I hope this matter may be considered sympathetically by the Senate conferees in conference when it considers the special bill which is in the House version which deals with the Cambridge project.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I urge favorable consideration of H.R. 483. which was reported unanimously by the Ways and Means Committee. This bill makes needed changes in our estate tax laws to remove discriminatory consequences that presently result when property passes to a surviving spouse through disclaimer of a beneficiary rather than under the terms of the decedents will. Under the estate tax law. a marital deduction is provided for property passing to the surviving spouse. either by the terms of a will or under the State law of descent and distribution. However. the deduction cannot exceed 50 percent of the gross estate. If property passes directly to a surviving spouse under the decedents will. the amount will qualify for the marital deduction. If the surviving spouse elects to receive his or her share under the intestacy laws rather than under the will. the marital deduction applies to the amount passing to the wife pursuant to the election. However. if the property passes to a beneficiary who disclaims the property in favor of the wife. the marital deduction is inapplicable. The committees bill attempts to partly equalize the tax rules applicable in these various situations. In order to insure that the benefits will apply to a genuine disclaimer. the committees bill imposes three conditions: First. The disclaimer must be made before any of the property is accepted. Second. The disclaimer must be made within 6 months from the date the will is admitted to probate. Third. The disclaimer must be with respect to all bequests and devises to the beneficiary under the law. The amount of the marital deduction available as a result of the disclaimer is patterned after the amount a spouse is generally permitted to elect against the will. In any of these cases. the property is available to the wife for her use and support. and the tax laws should address themselves to the substance rather than the form of the transaction. This bill will more nearly equalize for estate tax purposes the effect of a specific bequest to a surviving spouse. or a taking by law or intestacy. and a taking by disclaimer.",

H.R. 9220. as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. contains the specificed additions of $250.000 for the Snettisham hydroelectric project in southeastern Alaska to initiate and complete preconstruction planning. and $400.000 to initiate dredging of the Anchorage harbor. These additions are highly desirable and most needed in Alaska. They will permit the States economy to move ahead when they are completed. The public works appropriatiois bill as approved by the other body contains slightly more than $3.3 million for the funding of Alaska projects. The additions which I believe have been added wisely by the Senate Appropriations Committee increase the total figure to nearly $4 million. The increased funding recommended for the Snettisham project is now in the design stage and will. if approved. allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to start work on access roads into the area as well as complete the first phase of preconstruction planning.. Thus. for the sum of $250.000 it will be possible to develop more rapidly. industry in the southeastern portion of the State. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has assured me that it can use this added amount which. when added to the budget request of $800.000. makes a total of $1.250.000 for the Snettisham hydroelectric project located near Juneau. It should also enable the U.S. Forest Service to find a buyer for a large tract of timber in the Tongass National Forest which it will advertise this year. timber from which would be used to support a large pulp mill at Juneau. Moreover the Gastineau Channel area will shortly run out of power. Hence speeding up the Snettisham project is essential. Fifteen years ago the U.S. Army Engineer Division. Northwest Pacific Region. completed in 1950 a study of what might be done to develop the harbor at Anchorage. Alaska. The initial study has been revised and the corps now reports that the harbor can be dredged to a 35foot deep water depth and two jetties can be built for an estimated cost of $5.722.000. The appropriation of $500.000 will enable the corps to start work on this program. These two additions will mean a great deal to the people of my State and I hope they are approved.

I found that the Air Museum had preempted the ground. I tried all over the city. This was the only site to be obtained. I think it is inappropriate to come in at this late hour and try to change the site without any provision for money to buy the site. The bill merely provides for a site in the vicinity of the Pennsylvania Avenue development program. It seems to me this is quite realistic. If it had been provided for originally ard we had been able to get a site. it would be another matter. but a great amount of time. money. and effort have been expended on the development of the site.

Another thing is that it will provide that the payments shall be made on the difference between the pricesupport level and what is a fair price for cotton. and that will have to come by a payment in kind or by a Treasury check. I am against these payments being made to farmers. The farmer wants to sell his cotton in the marketplace and to get his money for his cotton then and there. He does not want to have a check coming in from the Government every time he sells a bale of cotton. Payments to farmers are repugnant to their manner of belief and opinion.

One of the main things I would like to discuss is this: that is the open end unlimited planting provision in this legislation. In the first place. we have on hand now 14.2 million bales of cotton. What we propose to do in this bill is to give the farmer an opportunity to plant all his land in cotton. if he so desires. and the fence rows in cotton in 1966. 1967. 1968. and 1969 under this bill. Open end planting. Yet we are trying to cut back in our production which is a primary reason for the cotton legislation being here in the first place. They are going to let them plant all their land in cotton if they desire and they will be paid 22 to 24 cents a pound. the worldprice level for their cotton. It is too good a deal for so many farmers to miss. They will be able to plant an awful lot of it. The first estimate made by the Department of Agriculture officials who came before our committee were 2 million added acres would be the result of this legislation. We are trying to cut down the surplus from 14.2 million bales of cotton. The Department of Agriculture said 2 million acres would be added. They came in and revised those figures and said there would be added from 400.000 to 800.000 acres. Where would they come from? Those acres would come from the irrigated West. the areas in this country that produce at least two bales of cotton to the acre. If you were to have 1 million additional acres of that kind of land put into cotton that would mean 2 million additional bales would be grown. They are talking about cutting costs and they come in now to appease California where this provision is appealing. The chairman said before the Committee on Rules in order to get the bill out of the committee he had to appease someone in order to do it. The vote was 18 to 14.

Taking an average of anywhere from 5 to 10 years that they will take this cropland out. or taking an average. say. of 7 years. at $700 million a year. there would be $4.900 million that would be completely thrown away. absolutely thrown away. Why do I say that? Because you are cutting back on cropland. supposedly. That is what you are supposed to do. What are you going to cut back. when you cut back on cropland? You are going to cut back on feed grains. Well. we have got a title in this bill for feed grains. That is what the purpose of the feed grains title is. What else would the legislation do? It would reduce wheat acreage. Well. we have a wheat section in this bill. You are also going to have authority given to the Secretary of Agriculture to go in and get down and work out some kind of a proposition with the farmer to cut back on his cropland through a system of bids. The cropland adjustment title is aimed at reducing cotton acreage. The cotton title to the bill would drastically eliminate cotton acreage. Mr. Chairman. this cotton legislation is bad legislation all the way around. There are some provisions in the overall bill I would say are good. But I hope the legislation will be recommitted to the committee for redrafting that part having to do with cotton.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I introduce legislation which would automatically increase social security benefits in proportion to increases in the cost of living. This concept. which I have long supported and advocated. finally seems to be gaining the support of more and more of my colleagues who have recently seriously considered the need for such a change in social security policy. The small percentage increases each month in the Consumer Price Index have steadily mounted. seriously weakening the purchasing power of those retired. elderly. and other dependents of social security. In essence. this process actually decreases the real benefits which those on social security have honestly paid for and who now deserve to have them returned to them. This process has been allowed to continue. with congressional action coming only when benefits lag far behind actual costs which payments were intended to cover. The bill I propose today would be designed to eliminate mounting inequities. it would substitute the ounce of regular economic prevention for what has usually been emergency cure. The ones hardest hit by inflation are those with fixed incomes and pensions. And those who suffer most are the elderly on social security. It is high time some consideration was given the problem of meeting increasing costs of services on a dependents fixed income. Financing of this program would also be automatic. As cost of living increases. there is a concomitant increase in revenue obtained by the Social Security Administration. Would such an automatic increase create a further inflationary push? Not any more so than current wage increases. If industry can afford to continuously give its healthy workers pay increases to meet the cost of living. then we should return to the elderly. retired. and other dependents the real value of what they have already paid through direct or indirect contributions to the social security system. The bill would thus relieve inequities caused by inflation. Inflation can be stopped at its roots. when such industrial wage increases exceed recommended guidelines. Inflation must not be abated at the expense of those who can afford it least. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this automatic increase concept. which I hope will allow the social security benefits to pay. in real buying power. what dependents have already paid for.",

I commented at some length on the much publicized TriContinental Conference held in Havana in January of this year and attended by representatives of the peoples of Asia. Africa. and Latin America. and the plans of that conference for increased activities through infiltration. subversion. and guerrilla warfare by students trained in Castros Cuba. In Panama. we have already seen the results in the form of bloody student riots that were featured by loss of life and large destruction of property in that country and which required the use of the Panamanian National Guard to restore law and order. We have also seen that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been made an objective for fomenting a socalled war of national liberation. The latest information from Cuba is that from July 29 to August 9 there will be a Fourth American Congress of Students at Havana. with 27 Latin American delegations present and Puerto Rican Communists playing a major role. Because such activities will inevitably have a bearing on the Panama Canal. which is the main target in the longrange program for Hemispheric assault by Red power. I quote the pertinent section of a recent Latin American Report published by the Citizens Committee for a Free Cuba of Miami. Fla.. as part of my remarks. If the situation thus presented were in the reverse and if in the Soviet or any of its satellite countries. there was permitted an assemblage with representatives from the free world committed to the task of freeing satellites from the Red yoke. such agents would be stood up against a wall and shot. If delegates from the United States and Puerto Rico attending the indicated Cuban convention do not suffer any sort of punishment at home for their recreancy. then we can expect an everincreasing resurgence of communistic revolutionary activities both in the United States and Puerto Rico. Under these circumstances. it is not a matter of wonder that communistic power flourishes in the free nations while in Red lands all efforts in behalf of freedom are ruthlessly suppressed.

The serious decline in milk production. and the widespread sale of dairy farms and herds have resulted from the fact that the farmer has been receiving an inadequate price for his milk.

    "speech": "I think in response to the question asked by the gentleman from Louisiana. the idea for the relaxation of penalties against narcotics offenders comes from this report of the Presidents Advisory Commission which was issued in November 1963. in which the Commission expressed definite disagreement with the Bureau of Narcotics as to the effectiveness of mandatory penalties. The Commission charged that mandatory penalties are not effective because there still continues to be narcotic addiction. Well. of course. there continues to be narcotic addiction. But the record shows that the effect of the mandatory penalties has been to reduce the incidence of addiction. Notwithstanding the increase in the population. as the gentleman pointed out. in a number of these serious areas such as Chicago. the number of new addicts has gone down. The subcommittee did not recommend this provision in title III which gives the soft penalties to those between the ages of 22 and 26 who are narcotics offenders. The subcommittee eliminated those provisions and the full committee in putting those provisions back in. it seems to me. has taken the recommendation of this Advisory Committee which is in complete disagreement with the Bureau of Narcotics and in complete disagreement with the record insofar as the effectiveness of the BoggsDaniels Act and the various State mandatory penalty provisions.",

I very. very firmly believe that it should be at the beginning of a new Congress and that we should not be put in a position of deciding now on a very controversial and important issue in such a way that the new Congress. which will come in in January. will not consider the program until it has been in session for more than a year.

As one of the cosponsors of the law authorizing this program. I have long been convinced of its need. In my opinion it is long overdue. Through medicare we have established a national policy which states clearly that our senior citizens are entitled to medical assistance under conditions which will not wipe out their life savings because of unavoidable illness and hospital expenses. That policy also lifts the heavy burden of medical bills for the elderly from the shoulders of their children and grandchildren. These policy objectives will not be accomplished by waving the law like a magic wand. It will take the capable cooperation of the entire medical profession. hospital administrators and personnel. There have been early rumblings and claims that serious problems. such as shortages of hospital beds and nursing personnel. may develop very quickly. No doubt there will be problems after the program gets underway. For these reasons. I have recommended to the able chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. our colleague from Arkansas. that steps be taken to keep developments in the medicare program under constant scrutiny.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield 30 minutes to the able gentleman from Ohio . and myself such time as I shall consume. Mr. Speaker. House Resolution 897 provides an open rule with 1 hour of general debate for consideration of H.R. 14741. a bill to authorize an increase in the number of Marine Corps officers who may serve in the combined grades of brigadier general and major general. The purpose of H.R. 14741 is to increase general officer grade limitations presently applicable to the Marine Corps in order to meet increasing requirements for general officers in that service. These increases have stemmed in part. from the increasing complexities involved in the duties and responsibilities of officers in the field. on joint staffs. and in Headquarters. US. Marine Corps. This situation has become more acute with the commitment of Marine Corps combat forces in Vietnam. The bill involves a reduction in the proposed table of authorization for general officers as recommended by the Department of Defense and would substitute a new table of authorization for general officers for that contained in present law. This new table would authorize a total of 79 general officers for the Marine Corps during fiscal year 1967 based upon anticipated officer strength. Mr. Speaker. in view of the magnificent record of this dedicated and courageous branch of our armed services. the Marine Corps. I certainly think all of us will agree that we should consider the bill H.R. 14741. I hope the rule will therefore be adopted. I yield to the able gentleman from Ohio.",

House Resolution 897 makes in order the consideration of H.R. 14741. which authorizes the increase in the number of general grade officers for the Marine Corps from the current 60 to 79. It provides for an open rule with 1 hour of general debate. In the DOD. the overall ratio of general grade officers to men is 4.8 to 10.000. in the marines it is 3 to 10.000. The situation could become serious. particularly in view of the expanding war effort in Vietnam. The original request was for 94 general grade officers. The Committee on Armed Services found that all were justified either for necessary future expansion or to meet enlarged current needs. The committee cut the total from 94 to 79. but made clear before rules that the original request was a true projection of current and future needs. The bill as reported completely provides for current requirements but leaves the question of futureneeds open. The projected cost of the legislation on an annual basis is $199 million. The Committee on Armed Services recommends the bill unanimously. I know of no objection to the rule. and urge its adoption.",

House Resolution 898 provides an open rule with 1 hour general debate for consideration of H.R. 15005. a bill to amend title 10. United States Code. to remove Inequities in the active duty promotion opportunities of certain officers. H.R. 15005 would provide for a permanent change in the grade tables which specify the number of Air Force officers on active duty in the grade of lieutenant colonel and colonel. and would also provide temporary authority for additional numbers of officers in the grades of major and lieutenant colonel for a 6year period. The effect of the bill will be to allow the Air Force to carry out a longterm promotion program enabling their officers to be promoted at approximately the same time in service as members of the other branches of the Armed Forces. Enactment of this legislation is estimated to result In an increased cost of $17.600.000 in fiscal year 1967. which cost is not included in the fiscal year 1967 budget. however. the Bureau of the Budget has no objection to the bill.

This bill as amended by the Committee on Armed Services would authorize a relatively modest increase in general officers strength in the Marine Corps. The hearings on this legislative proposal and the report clearly justify the proposed increase. Prior to the Vietnam buildupJune 30. 1965the Marine Corps ratios of generals to total officers and to total strengthbased on 60 generals--were 1 to 261 and 1 to 3.170. respectively. while the overall DOD ratios were 1 to 257 and 1 to 2.124. In fiscal year 1967 the ratios of generals to total officers and total strengthbased on an authorization of 64 generalswill be 1 to 348 and 1 to 4.347. respectively. while the projected overall DOD ratios will be 1 to 272 and 1 to 2.326. If the revised H.R. 14741 is enacted. the ratios of generals to total officers and total officers and total strength in fiscal year 1967based on 79 generals authorizedwill be 1 to 281 and 1 to 3.521. respectively. compared with the projected overall DOD ratios of 1 to 272 and 1 to 2.326. Stated another way. despite this proposed increase in general officer strength. the Marine Corps will continue to have an overall ratio of general officer strength lower than that projected for the Department of Defense. The Marine Corps is in every sense of the word a combat organization. If it needs these additional general officer billets. and the Committee on Armed Services believes it d jes. I am sure the Congress will. without the slightest hesitation. give its unanimous stamp of approval. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. was read the third time. and passed. and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.",

Every Member of the Congress has undoubtedly received many letters from his constituents in the Air Force who. by virtue of existing restrictions on promotion opportunity. have been unable to achieve the same relative promotion opportunity as their contemporaries in their sister services. Since 1959 the Congress has recognized that the provisions of the Officer Grade Limitations ActPublic Law 349. 84th Congresshave been too restricted. As a consequence. the Congress has periodically extended to the Air Force temporary authority to exceed the statutory grade limitations provided in the Officer Grade Limitations Act. This authority was last given in 1966 with the enactment of Public Law 89157 which provided temporary authority until June 30. 1966. to exceed these statutory limitations. The failure of the Congress to take positive action in this area will therefore preclude any promotion program in the Air Force for commissioned officers during the coming fiscal year.

As early as 1963 Cubas trade balance with bloc nations started to deteriorate with their deficit of $625 million. It was estimated that she owed the Soviet bloc more than $900 million in trade alone. In addition her debt for technical aid. arms. and so forth. Is $1.5 billion to Russia. $430 million to Czechoslovakia. $250 million to Poland. $85 million to Hungary. $70 million to Rumania. and to several countries in the Western Hemisphere another $165 million. In 1963 the trade balance of Cuba with Western countries was favorable in the amount of $65 million. However. this had to be used for other necessities. so Cuba is now almost with no dollar reserve. Last year she had only $20 million in reserve and this year her flnancial situation will be much worse. The U.S.S.R. made two loans to her of $50 million and $16 million each at the end of 1964 to cover her letters of credit with Western countries and to buy basic materials necessary to the sugar and nickel industries. At the end of 1964 Cuba had exceeded her budget for imports by $300 million. and the outlook for 1965 is far worse in spite of a normal sugar harvest. The biggest job we have ahead of us is to convince our free world allies that by trading with Cuba they are helping perpetuate the Communist regime of Fidel Castro and holding the people of Cuba in a state of slavery and desperation.

D.C.: I would appreciate receiving an explanation of the policy being followed by your Department in making available summer jobs under President Johnsons youth employment campaign. Also please answer the following questions: If the 6.000 jobs to be filled do not involve political patronage. why do the regional offices have authority to advise local postmasters which applicants are to be appointed after Executive Assistant Monroney stated to the press that individual postmasters would assist with the hiring? Why were certain Senators and Congressmen given specific quota numbers of jobs to be filled while others were simply told that they could submit a list of names when personnel directors are not supposed to indicate to the postmasters. who are supposed to make the final decision. whether an applicant has been endorsed by a Congressman or Senator? Why were members of the majority contacted by high officials of your Department concerning these choice available appointments. while members of the minority were contacted by lower echelon personnel days later and only after the press began asking questions? What happens to the qualified applicants already on the civil service eligible register who are waiting for summer jobs in post offices throughout the country? If this program is not being operated on a political patronage basis. why in many cases are county Democratic committees consulted for recommendations and clearances? Why did high officials of your Department. in soliciting patronage appointments for certain Members of Congress. fail to point out that the President had designated these jobs as being created for economically and educationally disadvantaged young people? Why is the Post Office Department not working through State employment offices when other agencies are supposedly following such procedure?

The Safety First Club of Maryland campaigned for 5 years for the approval of this stamp. and for that reason Baltimore was given the privilege of serving as the site for the first day issuance ceremonies. The 5cent traffic safety stamp will help call attention to the tragic traffic toll registered during 1964: 48.000 deaths. 3.840.000 injuries. 285.000 pedestrian casualties. more than 1.300.000 casualties from speeding. and 18.960 deaths on weekends. almost 40. percent of the total. Over the last weekend alone. 536 Americans lost their lives in traffic accidents. As one of the highlights of the first day program. the Safety First Club of Maryland sponsored a \"stamp out accidents\" luncheon on September 3 at the Lord Baltimore Hotel in Baltimore. Principal speakers at the luncheon included Frederick C. Belen. Deputy Postmaster General. the Governor of Maryland. the Honorable J. Millard Tawes. and Mayor Theodore R. McKeldin. of Baltimore. The executive committee for the observance included Morris A. Kasoff. general chairman. William F. Laukaltis. postmaster of Baltimore City. Warren M.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. press Interpretations of French President de Gaulles news conference this week leaves the impression that he is adamantly opposed to any forn of supranationalismwhether by means of the Common Market. European federation. or a wider Atlantic federal union. Certainly. his recent moves have been toward French independence. He pulled France out of Common Mark3t negotiations because he did not want majority vote substituted for nationai vetoat least until the agricultural issue was settled. In his press conference he gave notice that by 1969 at the latest. France will have no part of the present integrated command structure of NATO. In his press conference he also said: I do not believe that this type of national abdication would be justified. By \"this type\" he meant arrangements in which France would \"take a back seat. put aside its national personality within international organizations constructed so that the United States can exercise. either inside or from outside. a dominant influence to which we have only to submit.\" He thus qualified his criticism of \"a federation called European. which would in fact be Atlantic.\" Perhaps De Gaulle is gun shy of alliances for much the same reasons once set forth by the first U.S. President. George Washington. In his farewell address Washington warned that alliances could be entangling and thus impair national effectiveness. He said all alliances. in all time. have been subject to interruptions and infractions. Still. the same Washington in the same speech spoke favorable of a government for the whole in order to make possible the efficacy of the Union. In its present form NATO is a union but a very imperfect one. Dressed up with a command structure which Washington himself might well describe as \"entangling.\" it is nonetheless simply an alliance. As such it is of course subject to the same historical weaknesses which were just as obvious in Washingtions day as ours. Given the opportunity. would De Gaulle embrace a federalunion government for \"the whole\" as did Washington in an earlier era? Suggestions that the answer may be affirmative come from Clarence K. Streit. editor of Freedom & Union magazine and for many years an advocate of a NATO federal union government. He was recently in Paris interviewing key advisers to President de Gaulle on the question of NATOs future. Here is his report. prepared for the September issue of the magazine:",

Last year. the parimutuel turnover in Idaho came to $600.000. Illegal gambling was far more extensive. Testimony given to the McClellan committee supports an estimate placing nationwide illegal gambling at $120 billion annually. On a population basis. Idahos share of this sum would be $480 million.

What happens is that assignments are made on the basis of cash or money advanced now. An assignment is made that does not take effect for 4 or 5 or 6 years in the future. So a member of the Menominee Indian Corp. can take his certificate and go to a bank and get a loan and give an assignment.

I had hoped there would be included funds for a Forest Sciences Laboratory at Missoula. Mont. In the fiscal year 1964 appropriations for the Forest Service. an amount of $28.500 was allowed for planning and architecture for such a laboratory to be built on the Montana State University campus in conjunction with a new school of forestry the university itself plans to build this year. The money appropriated has been spent on engineering and plans for the laboratory. the university has provided a site adjacent to the new school of forestry on which construction will begin very shortly and. I believe the Forest Service could and would immediately begin construction of the Forestry Sciences Laboratory if the estimated cost of $425.000 was made available. An expanding program of forestry research in Montana and the Northwest is of unquestioned importance to the State and the Nation. The need for more intensive and extensive investigations in forestry and the woodusing industries is particularly pressing in western Montana. where much of the economy is forest based. This need has been recognized for some time. and there have been a number of preliminary developments. including the recent increase in State appropriations for the experiment station and grant funds to the State universities under the Federal McIntireStennis program. The cooperative effort of the Forest Service and Montana State University to further strengthen the forestry research program in Montana requires the primary implemeitation of a new laboratory facility. for which reason I emphasize the urgency of completing the planned Forest Service Research Laboratory as soon as possible. I am hopeful that the other body will add the amount of $425.000 to this bill for constructing this muchneeded facility and that this body will support such an amendment when it comes back here.",

However. I should like to express my keen disappointment over the fact that the Committee on Appropriations has seen fit to recommend the deletion of the $3.114.000 requested by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife for the acquisition of 19.000 acres for wildlife habitat refuges for various endangered species of birds. Included in such sum was the budgetary allotment of $150.000 for the acquisition of land to provide habitats for rare Hawaiian birds. Of the several disappearing species in Hawaii. the nene goose is perhaps the most outstanding. The sentimental value attached to the nene goose goes back into folklore and the traditions and mythology and ancient rites of the Hawaiians. In the minds of many of the tourists. a certain mystical quality is associated with the nene goose. It would indeed be a tragedy if the bird were to become extinct. The same comments may be made with respect to each of the other species of Hawaiian birds which are rapidly disappearing. These are the Hawaiian duck. the Hawaiian gallinule. and the Hawaiian stilt. Habitats would have been provided for all of these birds under this budgetary item for the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. With its deletion a grave doubt has been cast on the future existence of these rare species. Being a political realist I shall not attempt to offer any amendment to restore the deleted item. However.

As the public gets more experience. it would be more likely to be In the area of 25 percent or less because this is a Governmentguaranteed loan. This is completely safe.

We therefore proposed legislation of this kind designed to take care of this inability of SBA to lend. We have already established the fact that the States would be able to tax these obligations. That is one of the main reasons why the rate is onequarter percent higher. The States would be able to tax these obligations to the Federal Government and in view of the straitened circumstances of the States who. are in need of funds for welfare and education purposes. it seems to me that these are prices that the Federal Government can pay.

One of the reasons this procedure has been followed is that there is a legal ceiling on interest rates for Government bonds where it cannot pay more than 41/4 percent on Government bonds beyond 5 years. The Government is still living in the 19th century when it thinks it can borrow money for 414 percent. It does not have the courage to ask to have the ceiling repealed so that Government bonds can be put on the market bearing a maturity date beyond 5 years. This is a method of concealing the true interest rate. I think the President ought to ask Congress to repeal the 414 percent ceiling because it is not effective. Certainly the cost of Government borrowing today goes beyond 44 percent. The interest rate on Government bonds goes to 5 percent or more. Instead they are selling Government .bonds at a discount. That is not the proper way to finance the Government. The administration ought to recognize the facts and call expenditures what they are. repeal the artificial. unrealistic ceiling of 44 percent. and borrow its money in the way it has been done heretofore.

In my judgment. this increase in cost is outweighed by the advantage of securing these funds from the private market. I believe that as this method of financing becomes better known to the public. the cost of these certificates will become closer to the cost of regular Treasury borrowing. This additional method of obtaining funds for SBA would not deprive the Congress of control over the program levels of the various SBA lending activities. Specifically. the present ceilings placed by the Congress in the Small Busincss Act on the dollar amounts outstanding on SBA lending programs would remain fully effective. That point was made by the chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. the distinguished Senator from Virginia . in his support of the bill.

Everyone knows that if this bill is taken up. with all of the differences which exist between it and the administration measure and all of the pressure behind the administration measure. including the 10 able Senators who have been named by the Senator from Michigan. numerous civil rights groups. and othersand some unknown sources as wellwith all of those pressures available to stand behind any part of the original bill which may be offered either as a substitute or as an amendment. those who fear the bill that is now attempted to be motioned up and those who fear even more the administration measure think that there is a very great Issue involved. which concerns the question of whether we should take up the bill. Those who apparently advocate passage of the bill we are discussing have not seen fit to recognize this as a substantial issue. The senior Senator from Florida thinks it is a highly substantial issue and he does not understandand he says this without criticism or reflectionwhy those who advocate and support the bill have not only not seen fit to argue for the bill on the floor of the Senate at any length or to even explain it in any detail. but also have not seen fit to supply us with a quorum so that those who want to argue against the bill would have that opportunity. A cloture motion has now been filed without any Senator who is opposed to the measureand there are manyhaving been heard except three. It seems to the senior Senator from Florida that the Senator from Michigan and his associates whom he has named fail to see that the very motion made by the Senator from Michigan to take up this weaker bill is a very real issue that deserves to be debated. We have not been able to understand why the advocates of the bill have not been willing to let their wisdom be heard on the floor of the Senate.",

That is all that we now seek to do.

I say to the Senator from Florida that any time any piece of legislation comes before us and is up for debate. the possibility exists that a decision of the majority of the Senate will be displeasing and disturbing to us and that we may think it is unwise.

President Johnsons economic message of last week offers us a way to check inflation before it gets out of hand. and at the same time to continue and broaden our prosperity. A first recommendation is that the 7percent investment tax credit be suspended for 16 months. This is precisely in accord with the recommendation of the Joint Economic Committee of last March: We should immediately suspend the 7percent investment credit provision in view of the extraordinary exuberance indicated by investment programs. This is one of the major inflationary threats of this year. This action should be accompanied by a provision that the 7percent credit would go back into effect at a fixed future date unless Congress acts to extend the suspension. The House Committee on Ways and Means. and its chairman. the gentleman from Arkansas have today commenced hearings on the Presidents tax recommendations. Another important recommendation of the President is to the Federal Reserve Board and to the banks to lower interest rates. The suspension of the tax credit. and the curtailment of Federal expenditures. will reduce the demand for credit. Lower interest rates can and must follow. Banks have recently been making the headlines by raising their interest rates. We would all welcome some new headlines bearing the news that banks are now lowering their interest rates. President Johnson also said: We ask the cooperation of employers and unions In maintaining price and wage policy consistent with stabilization. The administrations wageprice guideposts. after the airline machinists wage settlement and the steel price increase. are admittedly sick. But reports of their demise. as Mark Twain once said of reports of his own death. are greatly exaggerated.

In this way It makes an invaluable contribution to the veterans themselves and to the Congress. In view of its service to the disabled veterans and to the country Congress. In 1932. granted the DAV its congressional charter as a veterans service organization. And in the past 34 years DAV has been outstanding in its efforts to \"advance the interest and work for the betterment of all wounded. injured. and disabled veterans.\" Mr. Speaker. as DAV celebrates the 34th anniversary of its congressional chartering I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations. I hope that the dedication and perseverance on behalf of the veteran which has marked the DAV so well in the past will continue to distinguish it as one of Americas finest organizations.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is a pleasure for me to Join my colleagues today in commemorating the 34th anniversary of the granting of a congressional charter to the Disabled American Veterans. It is important that the DAV be commended and recognized for their endeavors in the areas which are so vital to the disabled veteran but which may be overlooked in the usual course of passing veterans legislation. . The DAV has already played a major role in the passage of laws which provide the due treatment and compensa1 tion for men who have incurred disabilii ties while serving in their countrys Armed Forces. Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. the Disabled American Veterans was founded on the principle that this Nations first duty to veterans is the rehabilitation of its wartime disabled. The DAV continues today to play an important part in furthering the Just interests of the disabled veteran in such fields as compensation to the veteran or his widow. insurance programs. employment rights and opportunities. and the very important areas of hospital and outpatient treatment and physical rehabilitation. Of at least equal importance to the Congress. Mr. Speaker. is the role that the Disabled American Veterans plays in todays struggle against communism. The members of the DAV are logically in the forefront of American citizens who recognize the danger. strength. and scope of the Communist movement both within our borders and from abroad. They also recognize the equal importance of strengthening Americanism and our moral fiber in a variety of ways. With this in mind. Mr. Speaker. I am inserting today in the RECORD several titles of resolutions passed at the last annual DAV convention which deal with important issues of this sort facing the Congress today. It would do us all well to listen to the voices and heed the admonitions of the Disabled American Veterans in matters such as these:",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. as a veteran myself. I know that I and the others who were more fortunate welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to our comrades who were disabled through service to their country. The Disabled American Veterans organization was created by the congressional approval of Public Law 186 on June 17. 1932. when it was incorporated. Since this time the organization has benefited its members in a number of ways. It has proposed legislation and supported its passage which has been most helpful to the veterans and their families. These have included such bills as the War Orphans Assistance Act and expanded pension programs. At the present time the DAV is rallying support in Congress for the amendments which Senator RALPH YARBOROUGH has introduced to the recently passed cold war GI bill. His proposals include onthejob training. onthefarm training. and expanded educational benefits for veterans. The DAVs interest in public affairs and its nationwide campaign to rally support for the servicemen in Vietnam has been praised on a bipartisan basis in the Congress and in the administration. In another meaningful way the DAV makes substantial contributions to the welfare of its members. Through personal service and social contacts it assists its members to adjust to their communities again. These men who have fought the good fight stand as a living monument to a great nations commitment to the ideals of liberty. justice. and peace. They are a constant reminder to all of us that we cannot leave our ideals unguarded. It Is not enough to say that we have won the battle. We must continue to protect our interests and principles in every corner of the world where they may be challenged. We have truly paid a high price for our liberty today.. Yet I know that every member of the DAV believes that it was worth the cost. In deepest gratitude to them we have a continuing responsibility to review the programs for our disabled and their widows and orphans to be certain that they are not forgotten in the fastmoving world of today.",

During the American war for independence. brave men from European nations Inspired by our ideals of justice and liberty ventured forth to our continent and fought with dedication and bravery by our side. This day commemorates the anniversary of the birth of one such individual. Casimir Pulaski. General Pulaski stands as an example of the brave people of Poland who have inspired the world with tielirundying zeal for justice and liberty for all people. After leading a heroic but unsuccessful effort to win Polish freedom against the coalition of Prussia. Russia. andAustria. General Pulaski was forced to flee Poland. He made his escape to France where he met Benjamin Franklin and offered his services to the cause of American independence. In 1777. General Pulaski joined the main Army at Valley Forge and provided a struggling new Nation with brilliant military leadership during the remainder of the Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself in various engagements with the enemy and was rewarded by the Continental Congress with the rank of brigadier general. The American people feel deep gratitude to General Pulaski. to his countrymen. and to the many foreign patriots who fought and died for the cause of our freedom. Today we face a world where tyranny and injustice still exist. Casimir Pulaski will always serve as an inspiration to these people who must continue their fight for freedom.

Captain Treadwell. who holds a masters degree in oceanography. was accompanied by five- other scientists. As a submarine officer in both the Atlantic and A957 the Pacific during World War II. and as head of the Oceanographic Division of the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. Captain Treadwell is particularly well qualified to evaluate certain aspects of the Soviet oceanographic program. Both those in which the Russians are proficient and those in which they are deficient are stated in some detail. I am particularly impressed by Captain Treadwells report on the extensive Soviet activities in support of fisheries research. which includes the construction and operation by the Institute of Fisheries Research of ships up to 4.000 tons. the operation of a submarine to study fish behavior. and the employment of many vessels as ships of opportunity. The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries apparently has had little success in recent years in impressing the authorities over it or the Bureau of the Budget of the need. in behalf of our own American fisheries industry. for modem. efficient U.S. exploratory and research vessels. The result is that the expansion of this field has been very. very limited. Meanwhile. massive Russian fishing fleets haunt New England and Alaskan waters while Soviet research ships. equipped with advanced and sophisticated instruments and equipment. cruise the length of our Atlantic and Pacific Coasts and the Gulf of Mexico on exploratory missions that it is reasonable to believe are not limited to locating fishery resources. Captain Treadwell reported highlights of his visit to the U.S.S.R. in the December 1964 issue of Navy. the magazine of seapower. His article. entitled \"The Soviet Effort in Oceanography.\" is proof. in my opinion. that we are engaged in a contest with the U.S.S.R. for the mastery of the oceans and their scientific secrets. This is a Soviet challenge. like that for supremacy in space. that the United States cannot afford to ignore. Mr. President.

Almost half that number are serving in. over. or around the area of hostilities in Vietnam. They are engaged in the defense of free and democratic institutions in that troubled part of the world. They risk their lives and many have laid down their lives in that faraway land as a symbol of our resolution to punish aggression. and to give warning to other potential aggressors and hope to other potential victims that the cherished principles which are the cornerstone of liberty throughout the world will be defended. Many of those who serve in our Armed Forces have not yet been granted citizenship in the country whose uniform they so proudly wear. In initiating steps to correct that situation. I have introduced a bill to permit the expeditious naturalization of alien members of the Armed Forces who have served or are serving during the current period of hostilities. My bill will amend the basic Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 by granting to members of the Armed Forces who have served honorably since January 1. 1963. the same exemptions from certain requirements of the naturalization laws as have been granted to veterans of World War I and World War II and the Korean hostilities. My bill retains the essential requirements which relate to good moral character. attachment to the principles of the Constitution. and understanding of the English language. generally applicable to all who petition for U.S. citizenship. My bill eliminates the requirements of minimum age. periods of State or national residence. technical court jurisdiction. and the 30day waiting period between petitioning and final naturalization. Any person who was enlisted or in-. ducted into the Armed Forces within the United States is also exempted from the general immigration requirement that he must have been admitted to the United States for permanent residence. Honorable current service or honorable discharge. if separated from the services. is also required of all applicants who are benefited by my bill.

Hoban. archbishop of the diocese of Cleveland. who for many years has served as spiritual shepherd of the Catholic people of northeast Ohio. Archbishop Hoban came to Cleveland more than 25 years ago and during that period the diocesan growth was phenomenal. Under Archbishop Hobans direction scores of new Catholic parishes were opened within the diocese. and many Catholic institutions were expanded throughout the area of northeastern Ohio. New orphanages. new infant care facilities. new nursing homes for the aged. and new treatment centers for those afflicted with the dread disease of cancer came into being. Archbishop Hoban was more than just a spiritual leader of the Catholic population of his diocese. he was a community leader who understood the true meaning of the message of Mount Sinai and who lived his every day in accordance with the principle of the brotherhood of man under the Fatherhood of God. His was a warm and engaging personality that will be sorely missed on the Cleveland scene. He possessed a ready wit and a sympathetic understanding for the plight of the underprivileged. Archbishop Edward F. Hoban particularly was proud of the fact that during his service to the diocese of Cleveland the seminary facilities of the diocese were greatly improved and expanded. and as a consequence. many were drawn to the religious vocation. His was a life of real fulfillment in the practical as well as the spiritual sense. He was a priest among priests and who earned by reason of his humility and his spiritual zeal the respect of the men of all faiths and from all other stations of life. Archbishop Hoban was a man of humble beginnings who rose to the heights of achievement in life. but who never lost sight of his eternal destiny. His complete consciousness in life and. yes. his every action was directed and offered to his Heavenly Father. The old Gaelic salutation. \"Heaven Is My Home.\" so simple. yet so completely seems appropriate as we mourn the passing of Archbishop Hoban. A son of the Gael and a spiritual leader of crcmendous dimension has gone home for his eternal reward. May he rest in peace.",

Rockford. Ill.. and Cleveland as a builder of schools. churches. and hospitals. His life was dedicated to religious and community service. The lives of both clergy and laity are richer because Archbishop Edward Francis Hoban has lived. Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago referred to him as his \"right hand.\" Like many of the Catholic hierarchy. he was the child of working class parents. His father. William Hoban. was a shoemaker. The boy. one of eight children. was educated in a Chicago parochial school. St. Ignatius High School. He studied for the priesthood at St. Marys Seminary in Baltimore. to which he was directed by Archbishop Feehan of Chicago. Archbishop Quigley sent him to Rome for advanced studies in philosophy and sacred theology. Upon his return from Rome. Father Hoban was assigned to the staff of Quigley Preparatory Seminary. As a Chicagoan. I. therefore. associate myself with my colleagues from Cleveland in tribute to this great man whose influence will survive in the lives of all of us and whose monuments are the churches. schools. and hospitals built by Archbishop Edward Francis Hoban.",

While I am particularly concerned with the Great Lakes. this legislation. also authored by Senator GAYLORD NELsON. would include lakes in all parts of the Nation. Titled the \"National Lakes Preservation Act of 1966.\" the bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make a nationwide lake study and recommend to Congress lake areas that would be included in a network of lakes under local. State. and Federal supervision. To be known as the National Lake Areas System. this coordinated approach would place major emphasis on pollution abatement. shoreline protection. and development of the recreational potential of the lakes themselves. Deterioration of a lake accelerates as the amount of its privately owned shoreline increases. Today. only 5 percent of the total shoreline of the Nations largest 250 natural lakes is held by governmental units and accessible to the public. It is clear that unrestricted development of lakes must be checked or the Nation will forfeit a vital part of its water supply. The National Lake Areas System would raise a protective umbrella over these lakes and the people and industries who depend on them. An equally important feature of the National Lakes Preservation Act of 1966 is its provision for intensive study of the pollution problems lakes are prone to develop. The knowledge acquired through research into lake sciences would be used not only to ward off further degradation. but also to revive those lakes which have already succumbed.",

It reads as follows: On the other hand. to go on saying that the Vietcong doesnt exist and to force Hanoi in advance to speak for it in one form or another. is begging the question. In 1954. the United States did not object to the presence at first of some pretty phantomlike \"PathetLao\" and \"Free Khmer\" (Cambodian) delegations. As the conference settled down to some serious bargaining. those delegations dropped out by mutual consent and the Laotian and Cambodian ceasefire accords were signed. for the Communist side. by North Vietnam. As long as those various \"unconditional\" offers to talk peace contain the advance condition to drop one of the participants under the tableand the Vietcong has 200.000southerners under its control and not 3.000 to 4.000 troops. like the PathetLao--there is very little chance of getting anywhere at all. except into a bigger war.

I believe that the sentiments stated in a letter to me from Dr. Donald B. McDonald of the Department of Civil Engineering. University of Iowa. Iowa City. present most clearly and concisely the sound reasons why this proposal should be defeated: Hon. JOHN R. SCHMIDnAUSER. House Office Building. Washington. D.C. DEAR Sia: I am writing to you to voice my objections to the proposed Marble Gorge and Bridge Canyon Dams which are included in the Colorado River Bill which is now before the House Interior Committee. In 1958 I directed preimpoundment studies on the Colorado River in the Glen Canyon area for the Utah Fish and Game Department. and thus have some firsthand knowledge of the situation on the Colorado River. I do not feel that this project is justified from the reclamation standpoint. but more important. I feel the damage to the recreational and scenic resources of the Colorado River. one of the last great unspoiled rivers in the country. would be immeasurable. Not only would the impounded water invade the Grand Canyon recreational area and seriously damage the scenic beauty of one of our few remaining wilderness areas. but the fluctuation in water level and the changed environment which result from the formation of a reservoir of this sort would destroy much of the unique biota of this area. This loss becomes particularly significant when one considers the rapidly increasing population and the critical need for adequate unspoiled recreational areas. I am well aware of the critical water problems which exist in the Far West. but I feel that solutions are possible which do not result in destruction of irreplaceable scenic resources.

I have done so in the belief that the story concerns not only a great American life. but a great American institution. It has been the story where the energies and passion of a single man. seemingly frail and physically slight. were almost solely responsible for the growth and development of both the academy and the historic community in which it stands. Frank Boyden is the only headmaster Deerfield Academy has ever known. He came to the school 64 years ago. when it was a crumbling country public school of uncertain future. Harboring private plans for an altogether different career. Frank Boyden began to build and to mold the school. Without really realizing it. Frank Boyden was making a lifetime commitment to an idealand he has lived and worked to see it come to full fruition. Under unanimous consent procedure. I am pleased to place. in the RECORD at this point a final segment of that profile. It brings the article to a close by bringing us up to date on the lifework of Frank Boyden.

Frank Boyden continues to lead his charges at Deerfield. continues to seek funds whenever and wherever he can to perpetuate his school. and continues to maintain a pace in both work and play that would have stopped a less dedicated. less courageous. less devoted man many years ago.

If. however. dues are used. or assessments are made. to promote or oppose birth control. to repeal or increase the taxes on cosmetics. to promote or oppose the admission of Red China into the United Nations. and the like. then the group compels an Individual to support with his money causes beyond what gave rise to the need for group action.\" And Mr. Justice Douglas went on to say: \"I think the same must be said when union dues or assessments are used to elect a Governor. a Congressman. a Senator. or a President. It may be said that the election of a Franklin D. Roosevelt rather than a Calvin Coolidge might be the best possible way to serve the cause of collective bargaining. But even such a selective use of union funds for political purposes subordinates the individuals first amendment rights to the views of the majority. I do not see how that can be done. even though the objector retains his rights to campaign. to speak. to vote as he chooses. For when union funds are used for that purpose. the individual is required to finance political projects against which he may be in rebellion (International Machinists v.

In some States an attorney is compelled to join and pay dues to a bar association in order to practice his profession. However. we are confident that few Members of Congress would oppose a proposition to preclude the bar association. where membership is compulsory from. first. discriminating against Negroes. or. second. using its dues for purposes not related to its professional function or. third. penalizing members for exercising constitutional or other legal rights.",

The bill which I am introducing has the endorsement of the Nations largest humane organizations. the American Humane Association and the Humane Society of the United States. Without restricting or reducing muchneeded medical research this new legislation will require a high standard of humane treatment of animals used in research. thus fulfilling the moral obligations of our society. All Americans have been shocked by the deplorable conditions existing in some laboratories. and the manner in which these animals are acquired. transported. and kept. We are all aware of the sometimes cruel and endlessly repetitious experimentation. A society which adopted humane slaughter legislation years ago to curb abuses and unnecessary cruelty in the meatprocessing industry cannot sit by any longer and permit these conditions to exist In a field which justly prides itself in trying to relieve pain and sufferings of humans through research. The great failure has been in the inability of any responsible authority to provide minimum standards of care which would insure the daily humane treatment of these animals. and which makes this legislation necessary. My bill would establish within the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare an Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. which would be headed by a Coordinator and would be responsible for insuring that adequate. humane procedures are followed in the handling. care. and use of laboratory animals which are used in research financed through Federal Government funds. Leading laboratories have already discovered that the proper care and treatment of animals greatly aids research and actually reduces costs. These researchers are as concerned about this problem asthe American public. and I am sure will join in the support of legislation to regulate those in the industry which seek to profit from the sufferings of animals in their custody. It is of primary importance that this countrys many vital research projects continue their fight to prevent disease and eliminate human suffering. It is also of importance that we guarantee humane treatment of laboratory animals used in this research. Responsible researchers agree that these two goals are not incompatible. It is my sincere hope that the legislation which I am introducing today will be an effective step toward the achievement of these objectives.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. since this administration is waging wars on so many fronts. I would like to suggest a massive escalation in its alleged war on waste. The confusions. conflict of programs. and lack of policy are most clearly revealed by only two examples of waste and dollar loss in the foreign aid program. While our Government tries to limit overseas travel and purchases by Americans. the Government itself wastes millions of our dollars and contributes to the outflow of gold. In Brazil. we paid $3.8 million for the shipment of Brazilian sugar to other AID recipients. when we had Brazilian currency which could have been used and the dollars saved. In the United Arab Republic where we had sold millions of dollars worth of tallow for American dollars. our AID agency through Public Law 480 has replaced the dollar payments by giving the Arabs surplus tallow for soft currencies which we cannot use. In Brazil we gave away dollars. In the Arab Republic we displaced $5.3 million of transactions which would have improved our balance of payments and our gold reserve. Though the methods they use are diverse. they are consistent in their ability to waste our gold. If the administration wants more than a fictional war on waste. there is no better place to start than right in the foreign aid program. and no more appropriate time than now. I am preparing a resolution designed to stop such absurd and wasteful contradictions. VIETNAM",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. to all of us keeping a cautious eye on our foreign policy. the news today from Vietnam is particularly ominous. Saturdays downing of an Air Force Phantom. 40 miles west of Hanoi. would in any event be sobering news. yet in this instance. the news is chilling. for the Phantom was probably shot down by a Soviet surfacetoair missile. Should this prove true. Americans will have to face the fact that our Government has long known of the Hanoi area SAM sites. yet has never seen fit to destroy them. Members of Congress and responsible citizens throughout the country have repeatedly called for the destruction of these sites. Why should it require the loss of American lives and American planes to awaken us? The downed Phantom was engaged in a bombing mission against the Lang Chi explosives plant 55 miles northeast of Hanoi. I have long been among those advocating this type of offense as the surest means of preventing an escalated allout war. Recent reports of stepped up activity in this area are. of course. heartening. But more important. I would hope that they are an indication of our Governments decision to attack other military targets in North Vietnam and to establish a naval blockade around the North Vietnam ports. For these are the sort of tactics that. when used in support of our regular forces. can prevent this war from becoming an allout ground war with its frighteningly heavy cost of American lives and material. The President is today said to be reassessing his policies in light of the weekend events. Let us hope that he will call upon every means at our command--economic. military. and diplomaticto defeat Communist aggression and thereby prevent this war from becoming an allout land war.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I would like to express my support for and urge the prompt passage of S. 1991. the Unemployment Security Amendments Act of 1965. This bill would for the first time provide unemployment compensation coverage for our Nations farmworkers. It also brings about long needed improvements in the area of FederalState unemployment benefits. As chairman of the Migratory Labor Subcommittee I have studied the problems of our migratory farmworkers and have found that their employment periods. through no fault of their own. cover less than half of the year. Agricultural workers at the present time are eligible for unemployment compensation benefits only in Hawaii. the District of Columbia. and Puerto Rico. Yet. because of the uncertainty of their occupation. these are the people who most need unemployment compensation coverage. The bill. S. 1991. would extend unemployment compensation coverage to all agricultural employees performing farm labor for employers who used more than 300 mandays of hired farm labor in any one of the four preceding calendar quarters. In effect. unemployment compensation benefits would be extended to farm enterprises using approximately four or five fulltime employees during a calendar quarter. This test would cover approximately 78.000 farms and provide a coverage for over 750.000 farm employees. At the present time. these farm employees are not eligible for any form of FederalState unemployment compensation. The proposed minimum Federal standards in this bill on the number of weeks of employment which States may require for eligibility for unemployment compensation. and the extension of the duration of unemployment benefits. will also aid the American farmworker. Farm jobs provide the average migratory farmworker with only 110 days of work during the year. Therefore. almost all State eligibility employment requirements would bar many farmworkers from unemployment compensation benefits. Under the bill. S. 1991. States would be prohibited from requiring more than 20 weeks of employment in a base period for a worker to qualify for unemployment benefits. In addition. States would be required to extend the payment of unemployment benefits for at least a 26week period of time. The proposed changes in our unemployment compensation laws are long overdue. Our agricultural workers have too long been excluded from unemployment benefits granted to the rest of our Nations citizens. I. therefore. again urge the prompt passage of this much needed legislation.",

The plan calls for a civilian government in Saigon \"that can open contact with the insurgent forces.\" The fastest and most effective action that can be taken here is the holding of free countrywide elections. This objective should be encouraged with every resource at our command. Third. The Times suggests a \"tapering off\" of the bombing of North Vietnam in order \"to build an atmosphere conducive to negotiations.\" Fourth. It recommends coupling efforts to reconvene the Geneva Conference with \"broad diplomatic discussions\" that can find a \"formula for the neutralization and economic development of southeast Asia as a whole.\" What is now required. as the Times makes perfectly clear \"is a clear indication that the American objective is not a military victory but political settlement. The American ability to escalate the war needs no further demonstration. The need now is to halt the escalation and make a vigorous new effort to achieve peace.\" It may well be. as I have suggested before. that no political or diplomatic initiatives will persuade the other side to come to the conference table.

My resolution would call for an immediate cessation of this strike. and would provide for the immediate resumption of the airline services that are so desperately needed by all sections of the United States. It would further provide for a special arbitration board which would settle this dispute in such a manner so as to preserve the rights. dignities. and equities of all the parties to the controversy.

Food and Drug Administration officials told the Interior Department that its petition for approval of fish protein concentrate could not be granted until the FDA had further Information. I am told that FDA scientists believe that the fluoride CXII- 1087Part 13 content of the powdered fish extract may be too high. As I understand it. the question is not one of toxicity. but rather of possible \"cosmetic\" effects. It is thought that if large amounts of F.P.C. were consumed by someone over a period of years. his teeth might become mottled as a result. The possibility of mottling is not conceivable in this country. I am told. in view of the fact that F.P.C. would only be a very modest percentage of anyones diet. Since F.P.C. is a food additive. appropriate levels could be prescribed for adding to cornmeal or other foods so that there would be no problem even in other countries where fewer foods are available. As I am speaking. children all over the world are dying from malnutrition. Each moment of delay denies some of them the chance to live. I have been advised by a number of experts that this question of fluoride content is not a valid complaint. Frankly. I cannot believe that the approval of F.P.C. is being held up for this reason. The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries scientists do not feel the fluoride content is significant. I have personally talked with a number of other eminent scientists. including Dr. Frederick Stare. worldrenowed nutritionist. and head of Harvard Medical Schools Department of Nutrition. These men assure me that they have worked with F.P.C. and consider it to be perfectly safe. It has had remarkable beneficial effects in Latin America where I saw firsthand how infants who had suffered from severe malnutrition were transformed into happy. healthy children by an F.P.C. additive introduced into their diets. The doctors seemed to be completely satisfied with the results. Last October. the National Academy of Sciences gave its stamp of approval to F.P.C.. and since then. the Food and Drug Administration has had ample opportunity to study the data presented to them by the Interior Department.

Mr. Howe was asked whether the payment of these funds that were indicated in the appropriation would be used during the training period for the payment of teachers salaries. Mr. Howe responded: Our interpretation has been that the intent of the House was to have this language apply to payment of full salaries of teachers once they have gone into actual operation in a local school district and not to extend to the payment stipend while in training. That has been our interpretation and that was the basis for our earlier statement to you. Senator PASTORE said: \"I realize that.\" Is that the interpretation of the Senator in charge of the bill?",

    "speech": "Mr. President. startup of the 800.000kilowatt Hanford atomic steamplant April 8 represents a victory for perseverance over adversity. for conservation over waste. and for the cooperative approach to developing our regions resources. This is a significant and important step in putting the resources of the atom to work for the citizens of the State of Washington and the Nation. The Hanford dualpurpose nuclear steamplant. which is the worlds largest atomic powerplant. began producing the first of an eventual 800.000 kilowatts of power which will be integrated into the Bonneville system. When this facility went on the line. it was a victory for conservation over waste. for the cooperative approach to resource development. and for perseverance in the face of many disappointments. The history of the Hanford dualpurpose plant began in 1958. when Congress authorized the new production reactorNPR. It was intended that convertibility features would be built into this plutoniumproducing facility so that byproduct steam could be used to produce electric power. In 1961. the northwest congressional delegation. the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. and others. asked Congress to provide funds for a Federal steam plant to use this byproduct steam for the production of electric power. There was strong objection to this proposal from other congressional delegations. At that point. a group of public utility districts in my State of Washington. organized as the Washington Public Power Supply System. came forward with a proposal to finance. construct and operate the plant. This plan did not involve the use of Federal funds. What it did use was the steam produced at the federally operated Hanford plant to add 800.000 kilowatts of powermore than the output of Bonneville Damto the power supply of the Northwest. On August 1. 1962. the Senate passed the AECs authorization bill which contained an authorization for the Hanford generating plant. A conference committee with the House retained the steam plant authorization. and the conference report was accepted on September 14. Passage of the authorization represented a victory for the supporters of Hanford in the Congress. for the WPPSS. and for its able managing director. Owen W. Hurd. Passage. in addition. has given the people of the Northwest a valuable power asset. which was obtained by the perseverance of those who labored to make Hanford a reality.",

This tremendous installation. which Is the worlds largest of its kind. represents impressive evidence to all the world of the great gift to peace and industry which the atom is capable of rendering. There is more involved here than Just another source of power for the Northwest. The huge production which will be realized will be an important addition to the power available to the intertie system. It will augment the power capability of the Northwest to meet its growing needs at a cost which will insure the future prosperity of industry in the area. It comes at a time when the hydroelectric resources are being tapped nearly to capacity. My own State of Nevada looks forward to the beneficial effects of the intertie system and to the peaceful uses of atomic energy of which Hanford is an integral part. The experience which will be gained by integrating the output of the atomic steamplant with the hydroelectric power will be most valuable and useful to the entire Nation. The success of this project is also a tribute to the excellent work of my distinguished colleagues from the State of Washington who have labored long and diligently to make it a reality. Senator JACKSON first introduced the pioneering legislation in 1950 while he was in the House and. through his association with the subject. as a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. has been in a position to exploit the opportunity that existed. Senator MAGNUSON also has rendered enormous service in shepherding this project by means of his important and invaluable assistance in the appropriations field.

Washington. nuclear reactor. The Hanford dualpurpose reactor is the worlds largest atomic steamplant. Its first nuclearproduced electricity surged into the northwest power pool at 5:52 p.m. on Friday. April 8. an event which has been precisely noted because it may truly be called an historic occasion. When the power of the atom was first revealed in all its fury. the prospect of harnessing its tremendous forces for peaceful use was only a dream of the future. Since then the skill of scientists and the dedication of both public and private leadership have brought the dream to fulfillment. There is no longer any question of practicality. whether it be in the powering of nuclear submarines or the production of electricity. In this development there has been the closest of cooperation between the Government and the private sector. Our hope for the future in the realm of the atom is not in the mushroom cloud but in the transformation of the lethal to the useful. of megatons to kilowatts. It is for this reason that the new step forward accomplished by the event noted today is one worth noting. For surely it is as great a step to turn the atoms awesome energy into power. heat. and light as it is to beat swords into plowshares.",

The Packwood Lake hydroproject of WPPSS has been completed. and now the great Hanford nuclear plant is coming on the line.

The important task will be to coordinate the building of future generating plants in such a manner as to protect the regions resources and to bring greatest benefit to its people.

The committee has decided that the percentage should be increased from 10 percent to 20 percent without changing the overall total figure. Would the increase implicate us to the extent that it would be harder for us to extricate ourselves in the future from the responsibility? Would not such action become an obligation. in a multilateral sense. to many nations. as against dealing with one person? Would the proposed action mean that from now on the percentage rises from 10 percent to 20 percent--and maybe later it may even go above that percentagebut even if it does not. we shall have committed ourselves to 20 percent. and from now on we might as well reconcile ourselves to the fact that the program will be our obligation from now into the future?",

No repayment will be made for 10 years. Yet although this experiment has been in operation briefly. It is now proposed to double the amount. Why not continue with the present 10 percent? Doubling it is what I object to. My amendment does not provide for its repeal. Several Senators yesterday in debate suggested that the program be abolished. I do not go that far. The chairman of the committee refers to the high interest rates I propose. What are those high interest rates. which occur under the direct aid program? One percent. and after 2 years. 21/2 percent. That should not be disastrous to any borrower. when we have to borrow the money from the American people at a cost of twice or three times that amount. All the International loans are on these generous terms. There never seems to be any discretion. All the loans are made at threequarters of 1 percent. with no repayment of principal for 10 years. and the life of the loans is 50 years. Is there any flexibility in the overall analysis of the projects for which we make these foreign socalled loans? Apparently not. This amendment would merely hold the program in status quo for the next 2 years. and we would proceed on that basis. Why double the amount before we know how the program will work? We do know that these loans are made at negligible interest rates. Actually. they are not loans at all. they are grants. Mr. President. I am prepared to vote.",

One of the more disturbing elements in our troubles with the Dominican Republic is one that need not have occurred and which certainly need not have occurred and which certainly need not continue. It is the use by the United States of a lobbyist as intermediary with a Dominican politician. The lobbyist is I. Irving Davidson. and the Dominican he represents is Joaquin Balaquer. Mr. Balaquer was President of the Dominican Republic for a time after the death of Trujillo. I do not doubt that Balaquar is still a factor in Dominican politics. and he rightly should be considered as a possibility for public office there again. Moreover. I expect the United States to have some contacts with him as we seek to put together a new government down there. pending new elections. But to use Mr. Davidson as the intermediary is completely unlecessary and cannot help but cloud still further the good intentions of the United States. Let us face the fact that our virtual occupation of the Dominican Republic and our current. undisguised intention of installing a new government favorable to the United States is not exactly enhancing our standing or our good name in the Western Hemisphere. It is a dirty business at best. But we are making it dirtier by including in our dealings a paid lobbyist who has advertised his claimed connections with the President by advising his clients in Central America that in 1960 he had assurances from the \"L.B.J. policy board\" that there will be a general housecleaning of the policymakers of the State Department for Central America. and that the same \"L.B.J. policy board\" had also promised him \"first refusal for representationsambassadorial. military. et al.\" Mr. Davidson made these claims in a letter to Senor Luis Somoza. of Nicaragua. its President. and one of his clients. in a letter dated July 7. 1960. This letter and Mr. Davidsons testimony about it came up in the inquiry of the Foreign Relations Committee into the activities of agents for foreign governments.

Nowhere in the United States will its celebration be more meaningful than in my hometown of Racine. Wis.. the \"Drum Corps Capital of the World.\" Racine enjoys this distinction because the rhythmical pageants which thrill communities in all comers of the Nation were first seen there in 1916. when the Boys of 76 were organized by members of the Wisconsin Field Artillery. This corps. which has won several national championships. was adopted by American Legion Post 76 in 1920 and is recognized as the oldest established Legion drum corps. The Boys of 76 can take credit for the varied and imaginative repertoire which characterizes modem drum corps entertainment. In 1929. the Boys introduced elements of grand opera during their performance for the national championship. which was such a sharp break with drum corps tradition that the judges refused the outfit permission to enter the finals. However. the Boys had struck a musical blow which crumbled the rigid limitations on drum corps entertainment and allowed it to develop as a creative and contemporary American art form. The enthusiasm that the Boys of 76 inspired in Racine generated other drum corps. In 1927. former members of the Boys of 76 organized the Racine Boy Scout Corps. which ranks as the oldest musical organization in the Boy Scouts of America. William Peterson. its prime founder. has been quoted as saying: A boy blowing a bugle is too busy to blow a safe.",

Concurrent with this scientific breakthrough looms a new era in international relations. A treaty guaranteeing peaceful exploration of outer space and international cooperation in space is being advanced in the United Nations and appears acceptable in most respects to representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union. While there are still important areas of disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union over the treaty. I am sure I express mankinds desire when I advance the hope that they soon can be resolved. This treaty would prohibit any country from establishing military bases. claiming territory or orbiting of weapons in outer space and commit all nations to aiding any astronaut in troubleregardless of nationality. If this treaty is signed and ratified. the entire world will be relieved of the persistent fears of military and colonial domination of space by one nation or the use of space as a strategic position for military action. either offensive or defensive. These fears have. up to now. diverted much time and energy from scientific considerations. With an outer space treaty. we could strengthen our efforts to use the resources of outer space and the knowledge gained in space for the benefit of mankind. Such a treaty also would be a significant step toward a more peaceful universe. Peace to me. Mr. Speaker. is not a monolithic concrete wall erected overnight. It is a brick wall slowly and carefully constructed brick by brick. Historically speaking. a new peace in the modern world was begun with the Antarctic Treaty. The nuclear test ban treaty came next. Let us hope that we soon will erect the third major component in the structure of universal peace and that after that we will continue to move steadily ahead in thismans most important work. Ambassador Goldberg and his colleagues at the United Nations are certainly to be commended for their efforts to achieve international cooperation in the development of celestial exploration and a more peaceful universe.

It would require systematic reporting of additional important information concerning the operations of private pension plans. For each pension plan subject to the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act. an annual report to the Secretary of Labor would be made on the number of employees. whose participation in the plan was terminated during the year whether by discharge. indefinite layoff. resignation. or other reasonsand on the number of these employees who lost all their accumulated credit toward future receipt of a pension under the plan. These annual reports will thus enable us. for the fitst time. to gather reasonably comprehensive and precise data on the number of American workers whoafter 5. 10. 15. or even more years of service with an employerleave the employer. whether voluntarily or involuntarily. and are thereby stripped entirely of the retirement credit built up over these years of service. Mr. Speaker. this information is urgently needed. Increasing interest is now being shown in the important role which rapidly growing private pension plans have assumed in the American economy. One of the central issues. upon which this interest is focused. is the need for more widespread and more liberal vesting provisions in these plans. Vesting gives the worker a right or equity in a pension plan. based upon his accrued service. even though his employment under the plan ends before he has met the normal requirements for retirement. It entitles him to receive from the plan. when he reaches retirement age. some portion of the normal pension. despite the fact that he may have left the pension plan employer years before reaching retirement age. Information presently required under the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act shows that vesting provisions. of one sort\" or another. have now been incorporated in a great number of private pension plans. But. Mr. Speaker. we have no reliable information on this critical question: \"How many of our workers. after giving a substantial period of service to an employer. resign from or lose their jobs with the employer before they have met the eligibility requirements of the vesting provision\"--if indeed there is a vesting provision-\"ln the employers pension plan?\" We would also like to",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I was pleased to learn that the House and Senate conferees had reached agreement on the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. S. 4. Water pollution is a problem which affects every community and every State in the Nation and there is a great need for a stepping up of Federal assistance. greater enforcement at all levels. and a pattern of local. State. and Federal cooperation to abate and stamp out pollution. We have been fighting a losing battle up to this point and the recent droughts in the Northeast have focused new attention upon the urgency of the problem. In the light of these developments. the need for legislative action on S. 4. which is similar to my bill. H.R. 3716. is imperative and I look forward to its immediate enactment. The agreement arrived at by the conferees is reasonable. I think. in that it gives consideration to both the House and Senate versions of the wateruse standards by permitting States to have prior right to act if they wish. but authorizes the Federal Government to take up where the States neglect or refuse to establish adequate protective standards. I think there are sufficient teeth in this provision to guarantee effective steps by delinquent State governments to correct the Nations single most serious domestic hazard while protecting the freedom of action of States taking the necessary steps. I am pleased that the conferees saw fit to retain in the bill my proposal to authorize the increase of matching grants to municipalities from $100 million to $150 million a year for 2 years for sewage plant construction. Mr. Speaker. I have previously stated my support for the several phases of this legislation which will work to the advantage of each of us. including the inclusion in the act of the directive to the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare to initiate Federal enforcement action when he finds that substantial economic injury results from the inability to market shellfish or shellfish products in interstate commerce because of pollution.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it has recently been announced that the House will soon be asked to appropriate $300.000 to begin planning for an extension of the Capitols west front similar to the extension of the east front which was completed in 1961. I have grave doubts about the wisdom of such an extension. I do not believe most Members have even had a chance to consider the question involved. and as one item in a supplemental appropriation bill they are certainly not likely to have an extensive opportunity for such study and debate. An extension of the Capitols west front such as is projected by the Architect of the Capitol would. in the first place. be historically damaging in covering up the last remaining face of the original historic Capitol building which dates from 1800. Secondly. such an extension would seriously upset the present architectural balance of the Capitols West Front which many critics. by the way. regard as its most attractive face. I believe we ought to oppose the appropriation of any funds for this purpose until the matter can be more fully studied by the House. Under leave to extend my remarks I include an editorial from the Washington Post of September 12. 1965. I also include a copy of my weekly report to my own constituents. dated September 7. 1965. dealing with the same subject.

Mr. Chairman. this bill is particularly loose in that It states that any area that had the status of a redevelopment area as of March 1. 1965. would automatically be considered to be qualified for all aid under this bill until the next annual review of such areas is made. This means that the 423 or more areas that were on the rolls as ARA areas as of March 1. 1965. but have subsequently been dropped from the rolls because they no longer qualify under the present Area Redevelopmnt Administration Act. will be restored to the rolls under this bill and. therefore. they will be able to come in for all these supplementary expenditures. even though they can no longer prove they have the requisite unemployment to meet the test of the Area Redevelopment Administration Act that has been in effect during the past year. This again certainly is a looseness which I believe does not constitute good legislation. Beyond that. the bill states that economic development centers will be authorized and they will be authorized to receive aid under this act even though they themselves do not meet the test of an economically depressed area as defined in the act. So once again we may be pumping Federal funds into these socalled economic development centers. even though they have lower levels of unemployment than other areas may have which cannot qualify under the bill for the supplementary funds. This to me certainly is a looseness which is not advisable for Congress to authorize. The last thing I should like to mention is that the bill would authorize a revolving fund not subject to congressional appropriations. so that all repayments of loans made under the act would go into the revolving fund. as well as interest on those loans. to be utilized by the Area Redevelopment Administrator. with no further recourse to Congress for legislative appropriation.

The Allergy Foundation of America reports that a rainy first half of August will mean a miserable hay fever season. Pollen from the ragweed plant causes the unpleasantness of hay feverrunny nose. weeping eyes. sneezing. and headaches. not to mention many more serious illnesses which are effected by ragweed. the prime example of which is bronchial asthma. the killer of some 4.000 persons yearly. The Air Pollution Control Board of the Department of Health of the State of New York has concluded that they know of no beneficial use for ragweed except. in the overall balance of nature. it does more harm than good. In addition to their health suffering. these 10 million hayfever victims will lose about $140 million dollars a year in treatment. Medical cost is estimated at roughly $60 for injections. plus from $20 to $40 for medications--that is. about $100 per person. per year for those who seek medical help. In fact. the air pollution control board in its studies has estimated that more than a million people in the State of New York suffer from hay fever. and that some 250.000 lose a week or more from work or school each year because of the allergy. Much study has been made in order to combat the ragweed but it has been confined predominantly to the State of New",

I wish to extend greetings to our distinguished minority leader. GERALD FORD. and our equally distinguished and beloved dean of the Ohio delegation. CLARENCE BROWN. I was amused when someone pointed out the \"Todays Horoscope\" to me in this afternoons Washington Daily News. It advises those readers born on July 14 that they are \"natural competitors.\" My knowledge of astrology is limited to the impact it currently is having on the NASA budget. but the stargazers are right in this case. Both the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Ohio enjoy continued success at the polls in their respective districts. proof that they are successful competitors in the political arena. Congressman BROWN first came to Congress in 1939. Congressman FORD in 1949. giving them a combined total of service of 43 years in the House. It has been my pleasure over the last 7 years to work closely on the Appropriations Committee with JERRY FORD. I am indebted to him many times over for his friendship and guidance as the ranking minority member of that committee. He is doing an outstanding job of leadership during these lean times for Republicans. CLARENCE BROWN claims a special place in the hearts of all of us. He Is a great and wonderful man. When I first came to Congress some 11 years ago he gave me much sound advice and counsel. It has stood me in good stead all these years. We Ohio Republicans meet weekly for lunch and discuss matters coming up before the House. There is a great deal of jest and jocularity at these meetings and much kidding. CLARENCE is always there. with his good dry wit as necessary as the salt on the table. CLARENCE is a tower of strength on the Rules Committee. a man of wisdom and integrity and one of Ohios most loved sons. I wish both of my good friends the happiest of birthdays and many more to be observed in this Chamber. CXI1061",

I came to this Chamber at the tender age of 67 and all the world ahead of me. I wanted to map for myself a pugilistic career and CLARENCE BROWN took me under his wing. CLARENCE BROWN became my manager. No one in all the history of fisticuffs did a greater job. He arranged the battle of the century between his charges. \"KID\" OHARA. and \"Kid\" Crawford. better known as the Saginaw Hurricane. for the worlds congressional championship. And under his skilled management the whole thing came off. with terrific publicity and without the pulling on of a glove or the exchange of a blow. Under the management of CLARENCE BROWN and the fight being conducted on the same terms as the historic CrawfordOHara battle of the century I am sure I still can bring back to the Congress the worlds championship. This would result from the skill of the manager and not of the fighter. Seriously. I wish to pay the tribute of a loving heart to CLARENCE BROWN. one of the finest gentlemen I have ever known. I might add that CLARENCE BROWN was probably the youngest Lieutenant Governor in the history of our country as well as one of the alltime greats. CLARENCE was only 25 years old when he was Lieutenant Governor of the great State of Ohio. I am happy that \"JERRY\" FORD had the good judgment to select as his birthday the birthday of CLARENCE BROWN.

Republican of Minnesota. 4 days earlier with reference to the Charleston. W. Va.. Womens Job Corps Center. The same day Congressman SAM GIBBONS. of Florida. took the floor defending OEO and declaring that Congressman QUIE. inadvertently. was wrong. Further investigation in Charleston not only showed that Congressman QuIE was right but that he conservatively understated the established facts that add up to scandalous poverty profits to a leading Democrat officeholder in West Virginia. Congressman QuiE said the Hotel Kanawha was owned by a corporation whose president was Angus Peyton. a prominent Democrat and the present commerce commissioner in West Virginia. This is undenied. Congressman Quiz said that the Kanawha Hotel lease provides for payment of $94.800 a year net profit. after the Federal Government reimburses for taxes. insurance. utilities. and repairs. Mr. Boutin said the rent was $90.000. The fact Is that the rent is $94.800 and the Federal Government pays. in addition. $4.800 a year for the storage of old hotel property. Congressman Quis said assessments in West Virgina were by law 50 percent of market value. Mr. Boutin said they were 40 percent. Chapter 18. article 9(a). section 4 of the West Virginia Code provides that assessed valuation shall not be less than 50 percent nor more than 100 percent of appraised valuation.",

The fact is that reliable real estate brokers in Charleston indicated the Hotel Kanawha was worth about $250.000 prior to renovation. A somewhat older but comparable hotel in Charleston. the MilnerRuffner. with more land and a more valuable location. sold on February 1 this year for $200.000. Mr. Boutin defended the Kanawha Hotel expenditures with the claim that annual square foot rental cost is less than $1. The figure must have been computed by dividing the erroneous $90.000 per year rental by 100.000 square feet. This becomes an entirely meaningless computation when It is -understood that it ignores $4.800 being paid annually for storage of the old hotel furniture. $7.500 paid annually for taxesincluding taxes on the furniture in storage and the hotels accounts receivable-$5.740 paid annually for insurance and $4.800 paid annually for rent in addition to the $90.000 reported by OEO. Certainly a meaningful annual squarefoot cost figure should include all annual expenditures. not to mention $16.000 to settle leases of former tenants and some annual amortizing of the $345.549.51 renovations. Who does Mr. Boutin think he fools by citing such glib and misleading figures? In summary. the poverty program has spent $345.549.51 renovating a rundown hotel worth about $250.000. A corporation. whose then president is a leading West Virginia Democrat. receives $94.800 per year profit on property worth $250.000. That is a poverty profit of 38 percent a year.

The new economics centers on the concept that our National Government should provide private business with conditions that favor a rising and welldistributed prosperity but should be prepared to do something toprotect people from the excesses of boom and crash in our modern industrial system. As Mr. Davis puts it. the new economics describes for the National Government a task of not accepting tragedy but of adjusting to do something about it.

Saxon. the soundness Of the banking business. and the possibility that the the criminal element has infiltrated our national banks. The following excerpts from the Monday. April 18. 1966. editorial in the Washihgton Post seems to pinpoint this issue with particular clarity: To be sure. James J. Saxon. the Comptroller of the Currency. is one of the more controversial luminaries of the Federal firmament. He is a stubborn. proud man and his aggressive thrusts on more than one occasion have outraged sensibilities by disturbing the equilibrium within the bureaucracy that regulates the banking industry. But compatibility. with .the establishment Is not the sole criterion by which a civil servant should be judged. By urging innovations and pointing to new opportunities for profit and growth. Mr. Saxon has shaken the federally chartered national banks out of a lethargy that was induced by the trauma of the 1929 crash and the stagnation of the 1930s. Since 1961. Mr. Saxon has chartered 500 new national banks and acquired many enemies in the process. In some localities his new institutions are a threat to local banking monopolies. In others hackles were raised because charters were granted to groups which by virtue of religion. color. or national origin have seldom enjoyed the privilege of creating credit. The fact is that only one of the new national banks has failed. and a very small one at that. Moreover. if there is in fact a drive by racketeers to enter the banking industry. they are more likely to succeed by takihg over existing Statechartered institutions than by applying for new national bank charters which are granted only after exhaustive investigations. There is no place in banking for unscrupulous men. But concern for the depositoractually they are amply protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationmust not be used as a mask to perpetuate privilege.",

It is therefore with pride and satisfaction that I call the attention of Congress to the state of robust health of our island States major industry. In the year 1965 Hawaii registered an alltime record in peracre sugar production. Exceeding the 1964 figure by almost half a ton. the 1965 sugar production was a record 11.11 tons per acre. This record tonnage exceeds the previous record of 10.84 tons per acre which was set in 1955. One sugar company on the island of Kauai recorded the highest figure ever registered by any plantation with 14.99 tons per acre: Although comparable 1965 figures for the other domestic areas are not yet available. a cursory comparison with the official 1964 figures of the U.S. Department of Agriculture puts Hawaii well ahead of any other domestic sugar producing area. Louisiana produced 1.76 tons per acre. Florida. 2.61 tons. Puerto Rico. 3.26 tons. and the beet area. 2.38 tons. Since Hawaiis crop takes 2 years to mature. while the others mature in 1 year. the Hawaiian figure should be cut in half for fair comparison. Even then. Hawaii still leads in peracre sugar production. Hawaiis producers deserve national recognition.",

The person thus chosen must possess unique attributes. He can be no ordinary man. Personal sacrifice is the order of the day for a priest. Sixty years ago. there came to the priesthood in Italy a young man aged 25 whose eager face and hopeful eyes reflected the indomitable spirit of a laterday Christopher Columbus. Anthony DiLuca. the boy. became Father Anthony DiLuca. never realizing that his deeds on earth were to exceed his childhoods fondest dreams. A more humble man never walked this earth or wore the priests collar. His love of God and church is equaled only by his dedication to the people he serves. In time the fantastic accomplishments of Father DiLuca. who took over a poor and insignificant \"Italian\" parish in 1933. came to the attention of the Vatican. And to the gentle man who developed the \"Miracle of Brookline Avenue\" came the high honor of elevation to monsignor. In the 33 years that we of the NutleyBelleville area have enjoyed the special privilege of Monsignor DiLucas friendship. inspiring leadership. anti companionship. his holy family church complex has become one of the most outstanding parishes in the American branch of the Roman Catholic Church. As Monsignor DiLuca relaxes to meditate upon his fruitful 85 years this Saturday. the communities he has served so well express their gratitude to one of Gods greatest servants.

Herbert had a good chance for an electronics assemblyne job at $1.69 an hour and Rita. at 18 the mother of two illegitimate children. was packing candy for $1.35 an hour. But Herbert muffed his chance. appearing u day late for his job interview. and Rita. after working for 2 days. didnt show up on the third and was laid off. The cases of Herbert and Rita are being tackled by an unusual program here to reduce hardcore unemployment persisting in todays brisk economy. The experiment. called a Human Resources Development program. and largely financed by the Federal Government. relies heavily on persontoperson contact. Welfare workers seek out the unemployed and \"underemployed\" in depressed neighborhoods and offer them Job training. medical help or whatever else is needed to help them land a job. It is too early to ascertain how successful the new program. which is only a few months old. will be.

But his remarks have added significance. since they follow the bold statement made by President Habib Bourgiba. of Tunisia. who suggested that the Arab States should reconsider some of their fanatical leadership and should look forward to the day when permanent peace with Israel might be negotiated. Prime Minister Eshkol addressed himself to the question of peace in the Middle East. when he said in his speech: One way or the other. by all means let there be a mutual understanding to refrain from aggression. so that our justified apprehensions and their vain fears may be dissipated at one and the same time. Then the Prime Minister described the fruits of peace. and did so in terms that are of interest. not only to the people in the Middle East. who would be the principal beneficiaries. but also to all the people of the world who yearn for peace and who very much want to see the achievement of a settlement of the difficult situation in Mr. Eshkols part of the world. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Eshkols speech be printed at this point",

The problem has been that we in this country have not recognized sufficiently the value and importance of languages other than English. Recently. I am happy to say. a change in this attitude has been evidenced in a number of ways. Our schools are teaching more and more foreign language. and the instruction is being given in earlier grades. Another straw in the wind has just come to my attention from the office of Mrs. Esther Peterson. special assistant to the President for consumer affairs. Mrs. Petersons staff. in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture. has produced an excellent little pamphlet entitled \"Consumers Quick Credit Guide.\" So informative and useful has this guide proven to be that it has gone through a number of reprints. Until this moment. all these reprints have been in English. but Mrs. Peterson has wisely recognized that she can reach a huge new audience by printing a Spanish language edition. and that is what she is going to do. I congratulate her on her leadership in this important area of communications. Sylvia Porter. the distinguished financial columnist for the Washington Evening Star and other newspapers. had some interesting and enlightening comments on the pamphlet. I should like to have the column reproduced in connection with these remarks. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that her column be printed in the RECORD.",

Now. Mr. Chairman. that disenfranchised the rest of the people of this country. When the other body considered S. 1118. they made certain amendments that improved the proposal.

The other part of the legislation which Is obnoxious and not according to regular form is that once the budget has been determined. and the amount of money needed for the District determined. if the city council so determines they may without any action whatsoever increase that at least 5 percent. You have a proposed budget of approximately $331 million for the fiscal year 1966. If you take 5 percent of that then you permit the city council to issue shortterm notes to the tune of $15 million without any reference to the people whatsoever.

A lot of my friends who are sincere say they cannot be for this bill because Washington is a Federal city and belongs to all of the people of the United States and we will give that away in these bills. They are partly right. There are portions that do belong to all of the people and I do not want some city council telling us what goes on in the White House or what goes on in the Capitol. but the point I make is you can separate the parts of Washington as a city which have a national interest and the parts of Washington which do not have a national interest. Congress does have an overriding concern with what goes on in the Capitol and these great Federal buildings. but the voters in Tombstone. Ariz.. have no real concern about zoning at 49th and Upshur Street or dog leashes or liquor laws and other things that I have referred to. This bill very carefully lets the people of the District legislate on things that are local and reserves to the Congress and the President the right to legislate on things that have a national interest.",

New Jersey. New Mexico. New York. North Dakota. Ohio. Oklahoma. Oregon. South Dakota. Tennessee. Utah. Vermont. Virginia. Wisconsin. and Mississippi. Many States have wrestled with the problem of providing an education to children whose parents do not pay taxes in the State. Mississippi spends more of its income on education than any other State. Because Mississippi has the lowest per capita income of all the States. we have to stretch our tax dollar as far as possible. Every citizen must bear his share of the burden. Parents who prefer to live in another State without their children should have no misgivings over contributing to the education of their children. It is their responsibility. * The Mississippi Legislature needs no defense from me. The Michigan Legislature in its wisdom has passed judgment on this matter and it should be subject to the same criticism as the other 22 States which have acted on this subject matter. The people of Mississippi welcome honest and constructive criticism. However. we .dislike being scorned in such a manner wherein it is made to appear that Mississippi alone requires tuition from nonresidents. Describing Mississippis law as \"extraordinary\" is quite misleading. and is an injustice to a State of this Union.

Both were the subject of discussion during consideration of the Social Security Amendments Act of 1965the medicare law. The first provision is designed to retain the special medical expense deduction which was available to older citizens before passage of the medicare act. Prior to that. persons over 65 could deduct all medical expenses without regard to the 3percent floor. Last years law mandated an end to that special treatment. beginning In 1967. and placed older citizens in the same category as other taxpayers. Today. we forestall that change and retain. for the American over 65. this important deduction. The second provision is of particular interest to me. since I originally proposed it as an amendment to the Social Security Act of 1965. This provision provides for the coverageunder medicareof the cost of out of hospital prescription drugs. While drugs admins* tered in the hospital were covered under part A of medicare. no provision was made. in last years law. for reimbursement for the cost of drugs needed by the outpatient older citizen. As the committee report shows. these drugs represent a significant portionperhaps 25 percentof the health costs of older citizens. In 1963. the National Committee on Health Care for the Ageda group of health and insurance experts which I helped to organizeproposed a program to cover outofhospital health care which was the forerunner of the present part B. This proposal. which I introduced as a bill that year. covered prescription drugs administered outside a hospital. Last year. I offered this coverage as an amendment to the medicare bill and testified before the Finance Committee urging its inclusion. It was opposed. at that time by the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. which asked for time to study the operation of the new law before recommending expansion of coverage.

The gentleman from Indiana referred to the suggestion by the other body that there should be a 2year program for foreign aid. All the House conferees felt strongly that this would be most inadvisable. You will see by the terms of the conference report that we have a 1year program only. The conferees have also suggested that earnest consideration be given. should the administration next year ask for a longer authorization. to the possibility of extending it for more than 1 year. I agree with the gentleman from Indiana that under present circumstances it would be most unwise to authorize the foreign aid program for more than 1 year. I should hope that in a few months from now the international situation would have improved so dramatically that we could consider a longer authorization. but I do not consider that likely.

I wish to express my warmest commendation and admiration for the way in which our esteemed chairman. \"Doc\" MORGAN. has led the fight to sustain the House position in the conference on the foreign aid bill. Naturally. there always has to be some element of compromise when reconciling the Senate and House differences in any major legislation. but Dr. MORGAN has succeeded in preserving the House position on all the principal features of the bill. particularly on the question of the 1year authorization. The conference agreement was reached only after 14 meetings during the past 2 months. and is a tribute to the indomitable patience and the wealth of knowledge exhibited by Chairman MORCAN. \"Doc\" MORGAN and his fellow conferees. both Democratic and Republican. deserve our congratulations for a difficult task well done. The end result of their labors merits our fullest support. I urge that there is wide support for this conference report and I hope it passes by an overwhelming majority. Perhaps it is a time. too. to have the record include the fact that \"Doc\" MORGAN is one of the great unsung heroes of not only the foreign aid program but of U.S. foreign policy as well. He is an unassuming man and avoids the spotlight whenever he can. But those who know him well are fully aware of the great role he plays behind the scenes in practically every foreign policy step America takes. He has rendered great service to the United States. to our national interest. and to our national security. I am sure my colleagues will join me in hoping he continues to do so for a long time in the years ahead.",

They would be designed to help youngsters who want to make a career. of the military service or who want to get into. the service. but whoare otherwise unqualified. There wouldbe no compulsory aspect to it. We find that one of the ambitions of youngsters. particularly\ufffd in the urban slums. is to get into the military service. We find a fairly significant number of those who drop out of the. Job Corps .camps. or who graduate from Job Corps camps. go into the military service. Many of the slum youngsters are unqualified because their mental aptitude Is too low. Selective Service has held their requirements at a fairly high level. Some of them are disqualified for other deficiencies that are correctable. This program would be for volunteers to go into a military career center run by the Secretary of Defense. and they would there be equipped to Join the Regular service. I would emphasize that it is not our purpose. as seems to be the purpose of the Secretary of Defense. to take youngsters who will never qualify for the military service. who are below military standards. and who have very little hope of serving usefully in the military service. This would take that marginal group of youngsters who could be helped and who want to go into the service. At this particular time in our countrys history and the manpower crisis we have. these people who want to volunteer to serve in the service should be given that opportunity. This could be run on an economical basis. I am confident we would find the cost per enrollee far. far below the extravagant costs that we have now in both the urban and the conservation centers.

The gentleman really has not suggested any particular advantage which would be gained by transferring the Neighborhood Youth Corps over to the Department of Labor. I believe it is appropriate in this respect for me to cite the response made to a question put to the Secretary of Labor himself on this very point of the relationship between the Department of Labor and the Office of Economic Opportunity in the administration of the Neighborhood Youth Corps. Said Secretary Wirtz: I think quite candidly. the working relationship there. and I dont mean just In light cooperation. I mean in hard terms of people working together. and not doing other peoples jobs. has been almost complete and almost perfect. Secretary Wirtz went on to say that. so far as the Neighborhood Youth Corps program Is concerned. he believes the tieup works \"almost ideally.\" There is another reason why the suggestion of the gentleman from Minnesota is unwise. It is that effective coordination of the war on poverty requires a close relationship between the Office of Economic Opportunity and the several antipoverty programs that are authorized by the Act. It seems to me that we would lose the thrust of the entire Economic Opportunity Act. which is to be of assistance in fashioning programs to give greater opportunity to the very poor people in our country. if we were to transfer these programs away from the administrative control of that agency which has primary responsibility for the conduct of all these programs. the Office of Economic Opportunity. I believe it is significant that even the substitute offered by the gentleman from Minnesota. if I heard him correctly. there is a provision requiring that NYC projects be funded through local community action agencies. So if It is admittdd that there should be a clear connection at the locallevel between the Neighborhood Youth Corps and the overall antipoverty effort. it seems to me wise to maintain it at the Federal level as well.

I have watched my neighbors. one after another. go out of business. Some of course have failed. but more have rebelled against the continuing encroachment of government upon their prerogatives. and have given up their businesses in disgust. Year after year I have watched my profits after taxes dwindle. The point has finally been reached whereby the passage of the two pieces of legislation mentioned above will be the straws that break this camels back.

Our predecessors spoke and wrote bravely of progress. but they were uncertain and hesitant in their pronouncements. Some of us have become victims of a style of thought. I do not recognize among our people a despairing attitude or a sense of life without purpose. On the contrary. what uncertainty exists stems from a keener awareness of the complexities of our ages problems. a recognition that answers are not easy to formulate. an understanding that solutions are accomplished slowly and with difficulty. We are not victims of the simplistic faith in progress that troubled men in the last century.

It is very easy for those not affected by an increase in the minimum wage to decry its inflationary impact. I say that the burden for combating inflation must be put upon those who can best afford it. not upon those who can afford it least. That is why H.R. 13712 is a good bill. It s a compromise drawn up by leaders from labor. Congress. and the administration with the good of the public as well as the workingman in mind. I do not believe we can delay enactment of this measure any longer. The inequities to which it points call out for correction. I support it wholeheartedly.",

Citizen of recent date had a real good editorial with regard to the effect of the Fair Labor Standards Act amendments which would increase the minimum wage rates. The editorial deals with the effect of increasing wages without at the same time upping the productivity per manhour of work. The editorial points up the issue of the ability to pay the increased benefits that would be provided by the legislation. We are living in a war economy in which a greatly increased money supply is competing for goods that will become scarcer and scarcer. Under a situation of that kind the dollar buys less goods and services. The pinch is upon the wage earner. more particularly the small wage earner. The impetus is felt greatly by the whitecollar worker and people who must live upon fixed income. These include the schoolteachers and other salaried employees and the many millions of retirees who live upon their annuities or pensions. During the time that our Nation is engaged in fighting a war in southeast Asia with the finest of our young manhood and those of our allies. it is illogical. unrealistic. and illtimed for the Congress to consider legislation such as the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act by increasing wages and adding new employees to the acts coverage which would fan the fires of inflation.

With this bill we again advance in the effort to build for America an economic structure in which all who work will receive wages enabling them to share in the benefits of our affluent. expanding economy. Twentyeight year ago we first took action toward achievement of this objective. The original act fulfilled its intention. and since then we have amended and improved the law from time to time as the need arose. It is now. again. woefully inadequate and it is imperative that we act to bring it up to date. It must be geared to todays economic conditions. and to the economic and social climate we anticipate in the immediate future. Our Nations democratic labor organizations have assured millions of Americans of fair wages. excellent working conditions. and many other important benefits. both for their working years and for their time of retirement. Unfortunately. however. millions of working men and womenthose who have been called. most aptly. the \"invisible Americans\"-exist among us at a bare subsistence level. It is particularly for these unseen citizens. those for whom we wage the war on poverty. that this bill is important. Mr. Chaif man. H.R. 13712 will extend coverage to 7.2 million wage earners who do not now come under the act. It will cover many workers in retail and service Industries who have been exempt from the acts protection. And for the first time in history. we will make a start toward coverage of workers in the agricultural segment of our economy. We all recognize that an increase in the minimum wage and an expansion of the laws coverage will create adjustment problems. particularly for small business. And for this reason it is important to emphasize that the changes provided in the bill will take place gradually. The subcommittee. under the leadership of our colleague. the gentleman from Pennsylvania . has done an outstanding job in developing this workable but progressive legislation. For too long. Mr. Chairman. millions of our citizens have been kept out of the mainstream of American life because of substandard wages. We must not delay further the passage of this measure so vital to the workers affected. and so essential to the health and growth of our society. Malaysia Jolted by U.S. Rubber Stockpile Sales",

Litton Industries in my district. Minneapolis. constructed the submarine Alvin which recently made a recordbreaking dive to a depth of 6.000 feet. This remarkable achievement deserves recognition. The recordbreaking dive was made on July 20 of this year. near New Providence Island in the Bahamas. While Bathyscaphs have gone deeper. the Alvin descent was the first time that a neutral buoyancy submersible had reached a depth of 1 nautical mile. Alvins chief pilot was Mr. William Rainnie and its copilot was Marvin McCamis. They reported that they were able to see 30 to 40 feet with the aid of exterior lights. Rainnie and McCamis stopped the submarine every thousand feet on its descent to check all Its systems. While Alvin was submerged in its testing procedures. a heavy thunderstorm arose on the surface. with winds in excess of 25 knots. The recovery operation was the roughest to date. The craft was taken aboard its catamaran tender and brough back to Port Canaveral. Fla.. for a postdive checkout. The 22foot Alvin was conceived and designed through the cooperative efforts of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Applied Sciences Division of Litton Industries. The construction of the craft by Litton and the research program are supported by funds from the Office of Naval Research. In our enthusiasm over the Gemini project. we should not forget comparable undersea achievements. Everyone connected with the Alvin project should be congratulated.

In my letter I pointed out that the Department suggested an amendment to A6279 section 2 of S. 250 which would provide for exchanges as follows: On page 2. line 5. change \"SEc. 2.\" to \"Szc. 2. (a)\" and add at the end of subsection (a) the following new subsection: \"(b) In the exercise of his exchange authority the Secretary may accept title to any nonFederal property. and in exchange therefor he may convey to the grantor of such property and federally owned property under his jurisdiction which he classifies as suitable for exchange or other disposal and which Is of approximately equal value. If the properties are not of approximately equal value. the Secretary may accept cash from. or pay cash to. the grantor in order to equalize the values of the properties exchanged.\" In my July 28 letter I made these observations: I understand that at least one timber company with lands inside the proposed park will. if this section is included. seek to exchange these lands for ELM timber lands in another county. The result will be to reduce ELMs allowable cut and the amount of timber available for independent operators long accustomed to the purchase of this public timber. Also. there is no requirement that private companies will have to practice sustained yield similar to that on ELM lands. In addition. there exists the possibility that timber speculators may obtain options on Oregon Dunes properties. then seek to exchange for ELM sustained yield forest.

On the other hand. it is well known and generally admitted that such fabrics when composed In the main of wool or mohair fibers are nonflammable. that is. while such fibers will. of course. burn under certain conditions. they are not combustible and the fire danger is reduced to a minimum. On this subject. my attention has been called toa recent letter written by Dr. Paul F. Wallace. medical director. Sebring Races. Sebring.

According to WTOP radio and television. of Washington. D.C.. such is not the case. I offer for the RECORD an editorial entitled \"Free Press\" which was broadcast June 9 and 10. 1966. by WTOP: This is a WTOP Editorial. Considering that Washington houses many of the basic documents of American freedom. its positively amazing how little seems to be known here about freedom of the press. A good part of the municipal business of the District of Columbia is conducted in a way that suggests that a free press is an unheardof concept. As an example. take the Wednesday afternoon meeting of the Ad Hoe Committee on Alcoholism. This is a quasipublic group set up to assist the DC Health Department in its grappling with the problem of chronic alcoholics. The committee scheduled . meeting for 4 p.m. Wednesday to hear from a DC health official. Richard Tatham. who was to discuss what is done and not done in the treatment of alcoholics. The meeting was no secret. four newsmen. including one from WTOP News. showed up to report what was said. As it turned out. however. Mr. Tatham told Committee officials that his discussion would be hampered if the press were there. So the reporters were tossed out. Committee spokesmen say they regret having to do so. butaccording to one of themit was the \"only way to get the Health Department to say anything meaningful.\" We are now told that Mr. Tatham revealed \"some dirty linen\" in the Health Department concerning efforts at alcoholic rehabilitation. Its no surprise that dirty linen exists because the DC program for treating alcoholics is a mess. But it would be dandy if the public could be let in on whats going on because its a public problem. Mr. Tatham is a public official. the Ad Hoc Committee is established to serve the public interest. What this city needs--among many other thingsis a local freedomofinformation statute. The present law requires only that the Board of Education conduct public meetings. Why not all DC officials and agencies? This was a WTOP Editorial. Jack Jurey speaking for WTOP.

I am happy to inform you today that the Secretary of Labor. W. Willard Wirtz. and Sargent Shriver. Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity. jointly announced the funding of this program. The 1year demonstration grant will be administered by Jobs for Progress. Inc.. a nonprofit organization jointly sponsored by the League of United Latin American CitizensLULACand the American GI Forum of the United States. Project SER will explore new approaches to employment. increased earning power and improved living standards for those in the Southwest who face unique problems largely because of cultural differences. The grant will establish a single centralized regional service. which will in turn provide technical assistance for jobsforprogress centers in the five States. each programing training. placement. and relocation services. SER will provide prevocational guidance. remedial education. and relocation services for the Spanishspeaking community while assisting States. industry. and the Federal Government in recruitment. A regional skills bank created from the network of jobsforprogress centers will maintain an inventory of professional. technical. skilled. and semiskilled persons for employment throughout the fiveState region. Relatively little specialized service. bilinqual. and culturally oriented. has been available for the SpanishAmericans. but these centers will draw into manpower. development. and training programs. community action programs. onthejob training projects and prevocational courses. large numbers of persons not now reached through more conventional approaches. The job progress centers will put heavy emphasis on communications and recruitment. The Government agencies expect sharply increased utilization by SpanishAmericans of U.S. Employment",

Latvia. and Lithuania. thus ending the existence of these countries as free and independent nations. That invasion and occupation and the imposition of the Soviet regime was a flagrant act of aggression and continues as such today. The Soviets haye deported to their country more than a half million people from Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania. regardless of the fact that the U.S.S.R. joined the Genocide Convention. In addition to these deportations the Soviet Union is forcibly resettling young people from these countries in Soviet Russia. thus obliterating their national identity by Russification. atheism. and Communist indoctrination. The U.S.S.R. does not have any legal basis for the occupation of these countries but is trying to justify its domination by fraud and usurpation of the will of the people. The United States has never recognized the seizure and occupation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union and has upheld and restated this position in a recent official publication of the Department of State-\"Treaties in Force.\" Mr. Speaker. it is my hope that the oppressed people of these once independent nations will be able once again to gain their freedoma freedom they so richly deserve.

The practical effect of the Senators amendment would be to increase the tourist exemption from $100 retail to $167 retail. Although I have not been able to calculate precisely what would be the balanceofpayment consequence of the amendment. it would be substantial. The Secretary of the Treasury estimated before the House committee that the difference would be $36 million as it affected our balance of payments. So Senators can see that the amendment would greatly reduce the effeet of the bill and would cut by more than half the amount of the gain we hope to derive from the bill. The record shows that the average person who comes into the country brings with him commodities having a value of only $50 or $55. So the average person would not benefit by the amendment. I hope the Senate will insist on the economy recommended in the balance of payments by the House and also by the Senate Committee on Finance. so as to obtain what the bill provides. The Senator from Texas spoke of our situation with respect to Mexico. What he is doing is advocating $167 at retail value. 12 times a year. for the people who cross the Mexican border from a nearby area.

This amendment has nothing to do with the liquor problem. It relates only to whether the exception is to be on a retail or a wholesale basis. The present law is on a wholesale basis. The amendment would retain the wholesale basis. I point out to the Senator in charge of the bill that for a long time the customs officers have used methods of computing the wholesale value of articles. I invite attention to the difficulty of providing a uniform method of determining retail value. It is easy. of course. to ask. \"How much did you pay for it?\" But we who have traveled in other countries know that retail prices are subject to great fluctuation.

This is an amendment that the Senate can accept. Mr. President.

    "speech": "Mr. President. both the majority of Congress and of the American people have come to accept foreign aid as a necessary ingredient of our foreign policy to promote a peaceful. stable community of free nations. I think it is also fully accepted that economic development is a longterm undertaking. requiring years. in order to promote a better life for the millions of people of the underdeveloped nations. Like domestic development programs. the foreign aid program must look ahead. plan ahead. and commit its resources through a number of years for the results to be a success. But unlike domestic programs. foreign aid presently must attempt to do this with a yearbyyear legislative commitment. In the past 5 years Congress has made strides in placing the foreign aid program on a longterm basis. voting development loans and Alliance for Progress loans longterm authority. Last year. the Senate voted a 2year authorization for the rest of the foreign aid program. which unfortunately was deleted in the final version of the bill. In support of the Senate position. the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee wisely said a year ago: Congress should cease its annual review of foreign aid and place the program under longterm authorizations. The case for doing so is both familiar and persuasive. and just about everybody involved with foreign aid agrees to itexcept Congress. The case Is equally as familiar and persuasive in 1966. This year the 5- and 4year authorizations for development loans and Alliance for Progress loans expire. To renew these programs with anything less would be a drastic step backward. To authorize the rest of the foreign aid program on a longterm basis would be in keeping with the past endorsement of the Senate and in the full interest of our Nation and foreign policy. I invite the attention of the Members of the Senate to a paper giving reasons for a multiyear authorization. and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD.",

The year 1965 brought to the electric cooperatives of Texas its first GovernmentinAction Youth Tour. It was praised without exception by the 28 participating cooperatives as one of the most effective and rewarding activities ever attempted in a cooperative venture. While the youth tour concept is not new. 1965 was the first time that electric cooperatives of Texas participated. Through oratorical contests sponsored by participating cooperatives. 63 youth leaders of Texas won the opportunity of visiting their Nations Capital in 1965. The idea of the REAs sending young people to Washington was originated by President Johnson in the early 1950s. when as a Senator. he selected outstanding young people and offered them the chance to visit Washington. D.C. In 1958. the first statewide contest was initiated by the Iowa Electric Cooperative Association. From 1955 until 1965. the group grew from a mere handful to more than 700 young people. They gathered in Washington to learn more about their Government and to see it in action. Last years visit and this years visit by the Texas group included points of interest in Washington. along with a congressional breakfast with the Texas delegation. and a special visit with President Johnson in the rose garden of the White House. We cannot begin to measure the public and community relations value of such a project. With color slides of their trip in hand. the 63 Texas participants last year have completely blanketed their cooperative area with program talks concerning their visit and also talking of the sponsorship of their electric cooperative.

I have been advocating such legislation since April 1. 1964 when I introduced a bill to make it a Federal offense to murder a person exercising his civil rights. Since then a number of similar bills have been introduced. I am a cosponsor of a bill by Senator DOUGLAS which would broaden Federal offenses in the area of civil rights. Under this bill. for instance. the killer of a civil rights worker could be charged in Federal court with the crime of murder. rather than merely with depriving someone of his constitutional rights. I am also cosponsoring the administrations omnibus civil rights bill. one section of which would make racial violence an explicit Federal crime. All the rights granted Americans by the U.S. Constitution. and all the Supreme Court decisions carefully defining and protecting these rights. can be nullified by wouldbe assassins such as the one who gunned down James Meredith. This kind of terror nullifies the rights of every American citizen. The U.S. Congress cannot allow this to continue. The fundamental American rights granted by the Constitution must be backed up by Federal law. There have been a great number of tragedies over the years to demonstrate the need for Federal legislation protecting those who merely seek to exercise their American rights.

Mr. President. those individuals over 65 who do have income in such an amount that they pay an income tax will pay a greater portion of their hospital and medical expenses based upon their income tax liability of the year before. In the case of a husband and wife filing a joint return. this amendment provides that each would be presumed to have a tax liability of onehalf of the amount required to be paid on the joint return. The income tax liability has been used in this amendment instead of the amount of the income. . The income tax liability has been used as a measuring device rather than the amount of the individuals income because it has many advantages. An individuals income tax liability is arrived at under explicit laws and regulations. It is a term that is easily defined. All citizens over 65. or someone acting for them. could readily provide the answer to the question as to whether or not the beneficiary paid any income tax in the previous year and if so. how much. He comes into the hospital and he is asked. \"Did you pay an income tax last year?\" the reply might be. \"No.\" Then he would be told. \"Then this amendment does not apply to you.\" He has the $40 deductible he must bear before the benefits would flow to him. If he should say. \"Yes. I did pay an income tax. I paid a $500 income tax last year.\" he would not get anything until his combined hospital. doctor and other bills exceeded $500.",

Mr. Chairman. the administration has within the past 2 weeks at various times denied. the seriousness of inflationary pressures. urged businessmen to cut down on investment. blamed housewives for not putting on their glasses and taking a good look at prices when they shop. suggested a whopping tax increase and then backed away from this suggestion. finally talked vaguely of cutting spending by $1 billion in the present fiscal year. even as it continued to ask for supplemental appropriations. We in the minority again call on the President to end this confusion. to face frankly the growing problem of inflation and use the most direct weapon at his disposal to counteract it by reducing the planned level of Federal spending this year and next. We in the minority do not want another tax increase. This year the taxpayers burden has already been increased by higher social security taxes. higher excise taxes. advanced withholding. and by general tax rises by State and local governments. All these increases already imposed are reliably estimated to run about $8 to $10 billion. Reduced Government spending is preferable to a tax increase as an antiinflationary measure for three reasons. First. every dollar cut from spending is a dollar less of inflationary pressure. When Government raises taxes. on the other hand. it takes many dollars that would have been saved if they had been left with taxpayers. Every dollar of a tax increase. then. does not reduce inflationary pressures to the same degree as a dollar 6ut in spending. Second. the Government cannot per. suasively call for reductions in private spending when It fails to exercise restraint in its own spending. It cannot expect businessmen and consumers to follow the advice which it refuses to heed in managing its own affairs. Third. a tax increase will encourage recklessness in Government spending. It Is not likely to produce the fiscal restraint which Government should observe in the present economic situation. In controlling inflation. the timing of governmental action is all important. Action must be taken before the fire becomes a conflagration. The longer the administration dallies. the more drastic the action that finally will be needed.",

I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues in the House a recent article appearing in the September 1965 Issue of the Readers Digest entitled \"With Every Breath You Take.\" condensed from the book by Howard R. Lewis. This article gives dramatic emphasis to the great hazards from air pollution to the health of our citizens and the ruinous damage to property. The House on September 24 passed a bill. S. 306. introduced by Senator EDMUND S. MUSKIE. of Maine. providing for research programs relative to controlling air pollution and establishing a Federal Air Pollution Control Laboratory. Senator MUSKIE. as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution. has led the fight against this insidious threat to the lives of millions and deserves considerable credit for bringing about a greater public awareness of this grave problem. I call particular attention of Members to an allegation in the Readers Digest article that Washington.

I Include the following editorial from the October 1 issue of the St. Paul Dispatch: NoNMunrsc AMERICANS Will Americans ever adopt the international metric system of measurements in place of our ancient and unscientifc hodgepodge of such units as inches and feet. ounces and pounds and pints and quarts? For generations the scientific minded have advocated this change without success. But Commerce Department experts now warn business and industry that future sale of American made machinery and other goods to the rest of the world may be jeopardized if we fail to fall in line. Foreign buyers want metric measurements. If America fails to conform. its competitive position will eventually be weakened. say the trade authorities. Britain. the original sources of most American measuring units. will begin phasing out its traditional system next year. By 1975 it hopes to be entirely on the metric plan. universally used throughout Europe and most of Asia. American scientific groups want the United States to follow suit. The opposition is strong. A bill to authorize the Commerce Department to make a study of the practical problems involved was killed in the House of Representatives when an elderly member of the Rules Committee said metric measurements were Greek to him. Other Congressmen joked about the difficilty of translating the vital measurements of movie queens into meters. Senators took a more serious view of the matter. They approved the proposed Commerce Department study. which leaves hope that it may be revived in the House next year. There is no argument as to the practical advantages of the metric system. It is incomparably simpler. more logical and more scientific than the old English usages. The trouble is that Americans are used to their own ways and dont relish the bother of changing. But when Britain takes the plunge into meters. liters. and grams. Uncle Sam is going to occupy a very lonely position in the scientific and industrial world. Some day even the Members of Congress will have to pay attention to the way in which the rest of the globe does its measuring. With Every Breath You Take",

The deficit in the operation of the restaurants during fiscal year 1966 is estimated to be $121.000. in addition to which there is a deficit from prior fiscal years of $25.000. The balance of $100.000 is recommended to provide for a wage increase for the restaurant employees. The General Accounting Office has made a detailed study of these operations and has submitted a plan which will result in increased costs of $134.000 per year. The committee recommends to the Committee on Rules and Administration. whose responsibility it is to supervise the operation of the restaurants. that the General Accounting Office plan be adopted. further. that prices in the restaurants be increased to assist in financing these wage increases. It is the committees hope that with price increases in effect. the deficit for the next fiscal year will be materially reduced. With respect to airmail and special delivery stamp allowances. the committee recommends that effective July 1. the allowance be increased from $610 per year per Senator to $800 per year per Senator.

    "speech": "Mr. President. as I said earlier. I support the amendment of the Senator from Delaware. I believe we have dealt as fairly as is humanly possible with the expenses of Senators. We have increased the allowance for travel back home. we have increased the amounts for postage. we have increased the telephone allowances. All those allowances were badly needed. as was disclosed by the large amount of testimony which was taken. We did not consider the stationery account. because it was not proposed by any Senator to raise or lower it. But I believe. from all the discussion that has taken place on the floor of the Senate. that it would be unwise to postpone action on this matter until a later date. We shall have other appropriation bills. surely. within the next year. and if there is a will within the committee to examine or change the provision. that can take place. because the money is already appropriated for the current fiscal year. It seems to me that the best point that we could make to the public in general and to ourselves in particular would be always to insist on \"goldfish bowl\" accounting. so that we can identify the expenses if a question is raised about them. This has been a good opportunity to bring one subject into focus. so that the public will know what the money is being spent for. This is helpful. But identification is required. I feel if an accounting is desired as to subscriptions to trade journals or official or special publications. communication material such as radio tapes. and items of that kind. we should vote for it and provide for it. so that it can be classified and properly identified. Since the question has been raised. I do not believe it is right for us to avoid the problem to which the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware has invited our attention. Therefore.

    "speech": "AIR One of the more adamant opponents of proposals to revise the rules on bank mergers has been Attorney General Katzenbach. Now. however. he appears to have retreated a bit. The Attorney General..in a letter to Chairman PATMAN of the House Banking Committee. indicates the administration would be agreeable to legislation embodying a couple of principles which happen to be the prime aims of those who want to revise the merger rules. So Mr. Katzenbachs letter may help settle the matter. For one thing. the Attorney General agrees that Federal policy toward mergers of banking institutions should be consistent. Though thats clearly a sensible rule for the Government in any area. consistency has been notably lacking in Washingtons approach to banking mergers. In a number of cases in recent years. bank mergers duly approved by a Federal banking agency have been challenged by the Justice Department as illegal. Its not that the Department and the agency were reading the law in different ways. they were simply reading different laws. If the banking agencies and the Justice Department are all going to continue looking into banking mergers. as Mr. Katzenbach thinks they should. his suggestion is sound: They all should act on the same legal principle. Above all. he says in effect. the public interest is paramount. That interest is recognized by the banking agencies which. under the Bank Merger Act of 1960. consider not only a mergers effect on competition but also whether it will benefit the community by improving service and promoting a sounder banking system. The Justice Department and the courts. on the other hand. may ponder only a mergers competitive impact. Mr. Katzenbach proposes that his Department and the courts be required to take the banking agencies broader view of all the elements involved in mergers. As he says. \"all such factors should be taken into account in determining whether the merger * * * is in the public interest.\" Those simple conceptslegal consistency and the public interesthave been largely obscured by the charges that the banks somehow are seeking special privilege.

Yet the Pope reminded us all that peace is not built by means of politics and of balancing of interests alone. but is constructed by concrete works of peace. and by enlightened ideas. the product of 20th century man grappling with his destiny. Technological advances have made the prospect of war so menacing. so potentially destructive of all that mankind has labored so hard to construct. that all of us must share the Popes plea of \"No more war. war never again.\" But the real danger to mankind \"comes not from progress or from science. No. the real danger comes from man himself. wieldIng ever more powerful arms which can be employed equally well for destruction or for the loftiest conquests.\" What we desperately require for our technological advances to be turned to mans betterment. instead of our detriment. for our advancement as social beings to keep pace with our scientific progress. is. as the Pope so eloquently declared. \"a halt. a moment of recollection. of reflection. almost a prayer. a moment to think anew of our common origin. our history. our common destiny.\" Mr. President. only when we begin to think in terms of the common origin and common destiny of all mankind. when we begin to put into practice our splendid ideal of the brotherhood of man. only then will peace be assured between the nations and within them.

Nevertheless. both the Presidents message and the bill to be reported in the House are greviously deficient in one respect.

To the best of my knowledge. no other State in the Union is forced to pay taxes on the money which it raises for Its public schools. What makes this tax especially objectionable is the fact that it was not imposed by Congress as a tax on State efforts to raise funds for education. but as a tax on private wagering operations. Furthermore. the wagering tax imposed by chapter 35 of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply to wagering at parimutuel races. lotteries held in private gambling casinos. or lotteries held by many taxexempt corporations. Nevertheless. the Treasury claims that it does apply to the State of New Hampshire in the operation of the sweepstakes designed to provide funds for the operation of public schools. Mr. President.

I am sure the American people and the Congress will not only support strongly but appreciate the action taken by the President of the United States in dispatching troops to the Dominican Republic for the purpose of safely evacuating American civilians and other foreign nationals. The President had no alternative under the circumstances. The President had made urgent appeals to both sides in this struggle to cease fire long enough to permit the removal of civilians from the area. His petitions were ignored. Those in charge of the lawenforcement agencies of the Dominican Republic had notified American officials that it would no longer be possible for either civilian or military personnel on the ground to protect American citizens. Under the circumstances the action of the President of the United States was not only correct. it was absolutely necessary. Marines were used in a protective evacuation and up to this time have not engaged in any shooting incidents. The President has been joined in his appeal for an immediate cease fire by the Organization of. American States which will present a formal request at an open meeting of the OAS later today.

It has been established beyond the peradventure of a doubt that while that which the commentators have referred to as a local and internal conflict which started with the best intentions in the world to keep it a local affair. it has been documented that those now in charge have been oriented. trained. and directly identified with Castros Cuba and that they are Communists. There is no question about this. It has been established. The Americans in that part of the world were in grave danger. The local government could not cope with this type of warfare. The people in charge of this activity have been trained to conduct this type of guerrilla warfare and the government was unable. even with the implements in their possession. to control it. It has also been established that those who started this apd who had good intentions. have repudiated the present leadership. After getting these facts the President had no alternative. The Marines are now ashore and this is the only way to protect the Americans. There are great numbers there. I applaud the action of the President. He had to act as he did. I am sure he will have the backing of the Congress and of the American people because had he not acted. Castroand it was his intention to do so--could well have taken charge of the Dominican Republic. We cannot and must not permit such a thing to happen as happened in Cuba.

I want to reemphasize the fact that we have this legislation before us today because of the desire of the legislative committees to limit the authority of the Secretary of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation with respect to feasibility grade investigations and the preparation of feasibility reports. In other words. this bill implements the limiting provision adopted by the Congress last year when we passed the Federal Water Project Recreation Act.- Up until now. since 1902. the Bureau has had general authority to conduct these studies. From now on. each feasibility investigation must be specifically authorized. The reason for the great number of studies listed in this bill is because this is the first legislation considered since enactment of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act. Thus. this bill must provide authority to continue all the investigations underway at the present time. including even those that have been completed where the projects have not been authorized for construction by the Congress. In the future. the Congress will need to authorize only the new planning starts. The restriction on the Bureaus general authority. approved by the Congress last year. permits the legislative committees to examine these proposed projects at an earlier stage in the planning procedure and to exercise better control over the program. Past experience has shown that. once a project study reaches the feasibility stage. the impression prevails among the( people in the local project areas that congressional authorization is pretty much a routine matter and foregone conclusion. The local people and the local sponsoring groups are usually surprised to learn of possible delays in authorization. They cannot understand why the projects should not immediately be authorized once the feasibility report has been completed. They are unaware of the problem of imbalance between. the Bureau of Reclamations planning program a nd construction program. and that all of the projects with completed feasibility reports cannot be authorized because of budget ceilings. Under the new procedure. it will be possible for Members of Congress to be familiar with the studies that are being",

    "speech": "Mr. President. a major function of all courts is to settle disputes. At the same time litigation in many instances may also encourage disputes by raising social problems to the level of reasoned public debate. One such instance is the question of how best to deal with the social problem of pornography. On the whole. Congress has not concerned itself directly with this question. but it las received extensive review by the judiciary. However. social problems cannot be alleviated by legal means alone. The problem of pornography is part of the broader problem of developing literary and esthetic standards in our youth. This is not the job of Congress or the courts. but of our basic institutions: the family. the school. the church. the voluntary community organization. and others. An editorial by Dr. Stanley Elam. which appeared in the May issue of Phi Delta Kappan. the journal of the national education honorary society. makes this point well. I commend the article to my colleagues and ask that it be printed in full at the end of my remarks.",

In fact. our aid may go for purposes which run directly counter to our own national policy.

Mr. President. ships flying the flags of allied nationsthose with whom our country has mutual defense pactsare delivering goods and commodities to North Vietnam. A large majority of these ships fly the British flag. Merchant shipping Is the sole important industry of the Greek nation. So the initiative of the Greek Government in preventing ships flying its flags from trading with North Vietnam should receive public recognition. This initiative of the Greek Government proves once more the sense of allied solidarity which Greece has already shown in other similar circumstances. Indeed. since 1949 Greece has restricted all trade with Red China. this in marked contrast with other allied governments. particularly West Germany. which has officially guaranteed the financing of a steel plant for the Red Chinese. I cite another example. The Greek Government has barred all trade with the island of Cuba. the royal decree being signed on March 12. 1963. and September 24. 1963.

They are volunteers serving on the SS Hope. the famed white hospital ship. now on its fifth teaching and treatment mission. Since the Hope arrived in January. thousands of Nicaraguans have received treatment aboard the ship or in shorebased Hope clinics. Perhaps more importantly. hundreds of Nicaraguan doctors. nurses. and technologists are working side by side with their American counterparts. learning new medical techniques which will remain with them when the ship leaves in November. As has been the case in each country the ship has visited. Hope is having a tremendous impact on the people of Nicaragua. A reservoir of good will has been built which grows each day. As a result. many tributes praising this project have come from the Nicaraguan people. An example of the warm friendship which has developed may be seen in the remarks of the Most Reverend Agusto Oviedo Reyes. bishop of Leon. who recently visited on board the Hope. I ask unanimous consent. Mr. President. that the text of these remarks be printed in the RECORD.",

This dispatch reports that the administration intends to seek increased social security benefits next year. I am heartened by the administrations announced intention which. I point out. is the direct result of determined efforts in the Senate to enact the proposal sponsored by my able and distinguished colleague from Vermont and several other Senators. including myself. to blanket under the social security system. for minimum monthly benefits of $44. all persons over 70 years of age not now covered by the program. This proposal in the form of an amendment to the recently approved Tax Adjustment Act was not accepted in its entirety by the HouseSenate conferees on this measure. but the principle therein is now on the statute books. This action by Congress under the leadership of Senator PROUTY has evidently persuaded the administration that it is high time to give millions of elderly Americans. most of whom are poverty stricken. a decent break in the social security program. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the dispatch to which I referred earlier be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. few actions by the Supreme Court have raised as much controversy. posed as many unanswered questions. or fostered such legislative activity as the series of decisions beginning with the Engel against Vitale. or as it is more commonly known the school prayel case. This decision and its successors have had the effect of forbidding the free exercise of prayer in public schools. where the action was formerly part of the daily activity by our Nations youth. It is extremely unfortunate that this decision has had such an effect. It was clearly not the intention of the framers of our Constitution to forbid the populace to publicly practice religion. For instance. we here in the Senate open every day with a prayer to give us spiritual guidance. The President of the United States must take the oath of office with his hand on the Bible. and part of his oath is an affirmation to Almighty God. One of the mottos of our Nation is \"In God We Trust\". certainly our forefathers did not mean to say that for a period of time it was all right to have public religious affirmations. and after a point. it was not. I would like to quote one of Americas foremost religious leadersBilly Grahamreferring to the decision: This is another step toward the secularization of the United States. Followed to its logical conclusion we will have to take the chaplains out of the Armed Forces. and the President cannot put his hand on the Bible when he takes the oath of office. The framers of our Constitution meant we were to have freedom of religion. not freedom from religion. The question is then. Mr. President. whether the pupils who desire to join in a prayer at the beginning of each school day may do so. The recent decisions of the Court have effectively prevented many pupils who want to exercise their religious rights from doing so. It is my hope that the Senate will quickly pass the ptoposed constitutional amendment so that religious freedom will be permitted again in our schools. This right of Americans which is as old as the Constitution itself. must again become a part of our heritage.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. there are many ways to measure a communitys contribution to the Nations welfare. Some communities grow food for our people. Others manufacture goods. and still others extract needed material from the land. The sum of such contributions is the Nations strength. the resources which make a free society possible in a hostile world. The Chilkat Valley in southeast Alaska is a community of about 1.000 residents. Mr. President. while I have no way of knowing for certain. I believe this community is making a unique contribution to the Nations welfare. for a large percentage of its most precious resource. its young men. are serving in the Armed Forces. According to the Chilkat Valley News. 10 residents of the community are on duty in Vietnam. I understand that an additional eight young men from the valley are serving in their countrys Armed Forces elsewhere. As the Chilkat Valley News observed in a recent editorial. about 1 percent of the communitys population is in Vietnam. The News reasons. with justification I think. thatIf all the communities in the United States had the same percentage of local residents in Vietnam that this area does. the United States would have 1.620.000 there. Since recent reports show something over 200.000 U.S. troops in Vietnam. some of the areas residents have reported the belief that this small community has one of the higher percentages of Americans there. Because of what I believe to be a unique contribution to the Nations welfare I will place in the RECORD the names of the Chilkat Valley residents serving our country. The News lists those serving in Vietnam as Sp4c. David Land. Sp4c. Gene P. Strong. Sgt. John W. Berry. Sp4c. Stanley J. Alex. Larry Albecker. Ronald Martin. Gary Cranston. James Strong. and John W. Thompson. I understand that Howard MacRae also is in Vietnam. though his name was not listed by the News. According to a letter from an area resident. Billy Albecker. Billy Blackmore. Murray Clayton. Paul Matsuno. Walter Weedman. Gene Martin. Jim Brouillette. and Pat Stevens are also on active duty. Those who read the names closely will learn that three families have two sons in the service. Clearly. Chilkat Valley Is doing its part in this time of peril. for its most precious resource is serving where the peril is greatest.",

I do not want to see the Secretary of Agriculture build up a rival bailiwick that could be considered a division of the Department of Agriculture with respect to foreign policy. Matters of foreign policy should be funneled through the Department of State. Moreover. it will be much easier for Congress to write the standards under which aid to any field may be extended if all the programs are administered together.

Under the bill as we have presented it. our Government can more or less force India to use more funds to develop its agriculture. and under the agreements that will be entered into. there can be a provision that India shall use so much of its resources to develop agriculture. After the amount that it usually uses is reached. then we can insist that some of these counterpart funds be used in order to assist India to further increase its agricultural program. so as to make India more or less selfsustaining in that regard. In the past. much of the aid was used to develop industrially. But under this bill. we can now insist that it be used to develop agriculture. It is my belief that if this new policy is followed through by our Government. it will only be a question of a few years until India should be selfsustaining. For instance. under this new law. we can insist that instead of putting up. let us say. a plant to make steel. they make fertilizersomething to aid agriculture. Another feature. I may say to my good friend. the Senator from Oregon. is that we can insist that some of these funds be used to develop education along agricultural lines. Under this bill the emphasis Is being put on agriculture. These funds can be used to further develop agriculture. and thereby make it possible that we will soon be out of India. insofar as our selling surplus food for her to carry on.",

Therefore it would serve no useful purpose to include this part of the proposal. nor would it correct any practice which has been followed heretofore. In other words.

Certainly tobacco and tobacco products do not come under the category of agricultural products which are necessary to combat hunger or malnutrition. On the contrary. the Surgeon General of the United States has stated most emphatically that the use of tobacco products is injurious to human health.

In effect. such sales are substantially grants. Another part of the bill provides for the sale of tobacco products for dollars. However. the provision for sales for dollars is set forth on page 45 of the bill. as follows: SEC. 106. (a) Payment by any friendly country for commodities purchased for dollars on credit shall be upon terms as favorable to the United States as the economy of such country will permit. Payment for such commodities shall be in dollars with interest at such rates as the Secretary may determine but not less than the minimum rate required by section 201 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for loans made under that section. Thus we find that even though they may be sold under this act for dollars. the dollars received will not pay for the total cost. When full payment is being made they can be sold for dollars outside of the act. Such sales do not have to come under this bill at all. The only purpose of the act before us is to subsidize such sales. It is true that when the commodities are sold under section 4 of the act. which provide for dollar sales. to a certain extent. we do get back the cost of the product. but I repeat. the purpose of this entire bill Is to subsidize all sales. to get part payment in dollars where we can. and where we cannot. to get payment in soft currencies. and there is even a provision for outright donations.",

For many communities across the Nation. water will be in short supply during the warm months ahead. Already. New York City is having trouble supplying its residents with enough water. Other urban areas will be facing the same problem. And so will many rural areas. Too many of our smaller communities are without an adequate water supply system. The Farmers Home Administration. for example. has estimated that about 30.000 rural communities lack modem water facilities. Thus the development of our rural water resources is of great importance. In this connection. I would like to call to the attention of my fellow Members an editorial from the June 15. 1965. issue of the Creston NewsAdvertiser of Creston. Iowa. As the editorial points out. our supply of water is limited. But the need for it increases annually. especially in those communities seeking to develop their commercial and industrial potential. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has done a good deal to aid in the development of rural water resources. The Soil Conservation Service. for example. helps plan and finance watershed projects. These projects. in addition to their other benefits. can serve as a source of water supply to nearby communities. As the editorial notes. such a project is planned for the ThreeMile Creek in the Creston area. Once completed. this watershed will do much for the Union County area. in which Creston is located. Since 1961. another branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. the Farmers Home Administration. has provided loans for financing water supply systems in rural areas. This program has been a success. but more needs to be done. Legislation. including a bill I introduced last month. is now pending before the Congress to authorize the Farmers Home Administration to make Federal grants. as well as loans. to finance rural water facilities. I amhopeful that this legislation will become law. A program of Federal grants for rural water systems would help greatly in solving some of the problems outlined in the Creston NewsAdvertiser editorial. which I hereby include in the RECORD: [From the Creston NewsAdvertiser.",

The substance of these comments has been primarily concerned with criticism for his sounding a false alarm as to the similarities or dissimilarities between our economy today and our economy in 1929. I think we are missing the point where we merely argue about similarities to the 1929 situation or about what really caused the stock market crash if we ignore drastic recent changes in the money supply. I call attention to the fact that in the month of May alone. the Federal Reserve decreased the Nations money supply by $1.2 billion. Furthermore. member banks reserves have been at the minus $150 million level for a month or more. In other words. Mr. Speaker. the real Issue here is that not only has there been no growth in the money supply to finance orderly expansion in the economy but there was an absolute decline of over $1 billion in the month of May. This is a real threat to continuation of our prosperity. My distinguished chairman. the gentleman from Texas . has made this point many times.

No matter what their intentions. good or bad. they have organized resentment among the Negro and white races. No fact emerges more clearly from events of the past several years than the disappearance of the American political tradition and the decline of the moral authority of the Christian church. When 30.000 bishopled demonstrators can so intimidate the President as to send him into a steamrolling appeal to Congress for new laws before laws enacted had hardly been tried. something tragic has happened to the American political system. It is the Christian faith. and not the Constitutionjby which the bishops and clergy are ordained. When they abandon the expedition of the Christian Scripture with which they are supposedly familiar. for the interpretation of the political and constitutional principles for which they have neither been trained. commissioned. nor paid. they are destroying not only the fabric of Christianity in American living. but the political foundation as well. I would plead with my colleagues to help us in every way possible to keep these outside agitators from our doors. With peace and harmony free of outside agitation. the State of Mississippi will continue to prosper and grow to even greater heights than it has grown in the past. and it will be able to handle its own growing pains.

The root cause of poverty is ignorance. It follows. therefore. that the cure for poverty is education. As I pointed out in the debate on the aidtoeducation bill when the Green amendment was being considered. the best way we can help the underprivileged in the South. the majority of whom are Negroes. is to make education available to children of the poor. It is no secret that the Negroes. who make up the overwhelming population of many counties in the South. have lacked educational opportunities in many instances. No matter what the causes which contributed to the lack of educational opportunities. it is imperative that we make a start on improving education if we have any hope at all of winning the war on poverty.

Jack Campbell. of New Mexico. the delegates came from the Mexican Border States of Baja California. Coahuila. Chihuahua. Sonora. and Tamaulipas and from the U.S. Border States of Arizona. California. New Mexico. and Texas. The delegates stated that the purpose of the yearly Governors Conference will be to strengthen \"the bonds of friendship of the peoples of the Border States of Mexico and the United States and to channel their cultural. economic. and social development on the basis of cooperation and mutual exchange of ideas and experiences which will permit an enhancement of these activities.\" Mr. Speaker. this is indeed a refreshing and welcome development in the conduct of international relations.

Up until now. moneys spent for development and research by the Government can be justified when a search is being made for a thing of value for all the people. We place nucleonics in this category. Our taxpayers moneys without much restriction on amounts aid in the development of this potential industrial giant. Now we find that persons. most of whom contributed little of their worldly goods to its development. are seeking to use the new found source of energy to drive out of the energy market the coal. gas. and oil industries while still enjoying in some instances the benefit of public funds. Heat Is heat and light is light. and when in the normal use of these required elements an industry can become a monopoly. then it is time we look at the costs--the costs in man work. investment. and the development of further uses of the competing fuels. Certainly with over a thousand years of known reserves in coal. it is no time to allow Governmentsponsored competition to develop a scaretype campaign to do what it cannot do on a strictly costeconomy base. I am reminded of the TV and press media claims of the various headache and pain remedies. They are getting so bad in these advertising namecalling sessions that a listener needs a headache tablet when they get off the air. Frankly. the sum and substance of the nucleonics editorial is an appeal for other Government agencies to push coal out of the competitive market as a health hazard. Funny thing about that. this country became pretty much of a leader in everything all over the world before nucleonics ever entered the picture. I have voted for funds for all research and development projects and probably will continue to do so but I draw the line at our modern eras disregard for the rights of others and belowthebelt punching by a fighter who is not even listed on the fight card.

H.R. 6254. the purpose of which is to secure for all American citizens the right to vote. which is guaranteed in the Constitution. It is a fact that today qualified Americans are prevented from voting because of the color of their skin and the guarantees of our Constitution concerning the political rights of citizens of the United States are being flaunted. This condition must not continue. Both the Supreme Court and the Congress have clearly and overwhelmingly indicated their concept of the policy of the U.S. Government in the field of voting rights. The Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 sought to place on the statute books legal sanctions which would make the voting right a practical rather than a theoretical one. Unfortunately. national intent and national good will and the good will of many people in the controversial States themselves have not been sufficient to bring about legal registration of all qualified citizens. For this reason it is necessary that the Congress now take further action to provide sufficient strength to frustrate the efforts of those who would circumvent the objectives which the civil rights bill put into law. President Johnson has eloquently stated the objectives of the administration and those who guide the Nation and I subscribe to them.

I introduce today legislation designed to relieve the detrimental shortage of railroad freight cars which continues to inflict hardship and economic loss on Oregon. the Pacific Northwest. and other national centers of lumber. farm. and mine production. In 1964 the cumulative effect of freight car shortages. increasing steadily since World War II. forced the Interstate Commerce Commission to promulgate unprecedented emergency regulations which. in essence. brought about freight car rationing. There appears to have been only minimal relief brought to this national problem by the Commissions orders. The daily average rail freight car shortage continues to be at a level of about 6.926 cars. of which 4.671 are boxcars. The only permanent relief must come in new legislation. The bill I introduce today. similar to that introduced in the other body by Senator MAGNUSON. provides incentive to railroad management to build the freight cars essential to our national need. It provides the Interstate Commerce Commission with the authority to fix a rental rate providing reasonable compensation to freight car owners. contribute to sound car service practices. and encourage the acquisition and maintenance of a car supply adequate to meet the needs of commerce. The industries of my State of Oregon are deeply concerned with this problem in their shipments of lumber. grain. farm produce. and mineral products. It is of the utmost importance that this situation be rectified. I urge the Congress to act with expediency to meet this pressing depressing effect on our economy.",

November] Defense of our great Nation is every Americans business. We rely heavily on the Army Reserve as a significant part of our countrys defense team. In his dual role the civilian soldier contributes substantially both to his community and to the defense of our land. For your selfless devotion I commend each one of you. I appreciate also the remarkable way in which your families share in your contribution with their support and understanding. I am confident that the Nation can rely upon the Army Reserve today and in the future as it has so often in the past. Seven weeks later. Mr. Johnson approved a Pentagon recommendation that would scuttle the Army Reserve. I am greatly appalled at the Presidents aboutfaceand his decision to support this deplorable proposal. Historically. the Army Reserve has been the peacetime skeletal force of the Army. and the eliminating of this auxiliary body seems incongruous in the light of history and current world events. There are units and personnel in the U.S. Army Reserve which have no counterparts in the Regular Army or in the National Guardwhich elements meant the difference between almost immediate aggressive action and random recruiting after Pearl Harbor 1941. In President Johnsons attempt to establish a onebranch Government. he has forgotten that Congress is charged with the responsibility for raising and supporting armies. not the Secretary of Defense. This country Is in great trouble when one man can dictate such a sweeping change in our defense policy and position. It would appear to me that the administration is attempting to reduce our Nations defense appropriations in order that the Great Society can be provided more funds for additional welfare programs. I believe the decision to return the Army Reserve to the status it held in the early 1920s and to put all of the Armys Reserve defense eggs into the National Guard basket under State training and supervision is fraught with danger and should be rejected.

The annual report of the Connecticut Light & Power Co. shows a comparable rate reduction due to the tax revision. - It is encouraging to know that the tax cut had such a direct influence in reducing rates. thereby freeing more funds of individuals and corporations for general use in the economy.

The gentleman spoke about the fact that the little investor. the small investor. is now going to have a chance to invest in the very fine participations issued through FNMA. The Government of the United States is now spending thousands of dollars on advertising the 4.15percent yield Government bonds for the small investor. That is 4.15 percent. It is on radio. It is on television. It is in fullpage ads in the newspapers. What will this do? It will permit the large investor. the big investor who has from $5.000 up to $1 million. without any effort to get 5 /2 percent. with no lid on the amount. This is big. high interest frozen in for the profit of the big investor. who really assumes no risk or expense in order to obtain his participation.

Well. what difference does it make? What difference does it make just how assets be converted into cash. and just where the incidence of title might rest? It makes no difference.

The agreement would provide for safeguards to assure that materials and facilities subject to the agreement are used only for peaceful purposes. and that arrangements be made for assumption of safeguards responsibilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The amendments to the Spanish and Swiss agreements would. among other things. provide for longterm supply of fuel for these nations nuclear power programs. and also that arrangements be made for assumption of safeguards responsibilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

I have felt that the Senator from Pennsylvania has spoken out as clearly. as forcefully. and as courageously on this issue. and. perhaps more important. as accurately. as any Member of the Senate. So to have his statement here in the RECORD reinforcing what I have tried to say makes me all the more confident of my position. I am very grateful to him. With regard to the points he has made respecting the military situation that faces us in Vietnam. I do not feel in a position to comment with any great technical knowledge about that. but I do agree with the Senator that it is a very discouraging prospect. I do not think our own military people in South Vietnam are under any illusions about what they are up against. We have highly competent military officers in Vietnam. They have made clear. from General Westmoreland on down. a military victory would require an enormous increase in American forces. The French military effort ended with a disastrous defeat at Dien Bien Phu some 12 years ago in spite of the fact that they had committed a land force of something over 400.000 men. That is twice the number we have now committed to this conflict. So I do not blame our military people for asking for reinforcements. I think they realize. as the Senator from Pennsylvania does. that they are up against a dangerous situation. I do question the policy assumptions that have led us into this situation in Vietnam and the military mission we have asked our forces to undertake.",

I would hope the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. the President of the United States. would redefine for us our diplomatic and military policies in Vietnam. and just what our military and diplomatic objectives are. I am as concerned as is the Senator from South Dakota at the escalation of the war and having our American boys hunting through elephant grass to look for the elusive Vietcong. As Walter Lippmann said some time ago. what we are doing there is very much like trying to punch water. As soon as one pulls out his arm. the water comes back. and often spills over him. The policy which the Senator from South Dakota has advocated is to fight a defensive war at our strongpointsI would hope with our backs to the seawhile we proceed in an honorable way to try to persuade the Communists and others in South Vietnam who are not Communistsand there are many of thosethat we are not going to leave until there is an honorable peace that will include free elections by the people of South Vietnam to select those they want to govern them. What concerns me is what appears to be a tug of war between various highly located persons in the executive and administrative arms of our Government. For example. I read this in the newspapers. I did not acquire this information through access to any classified document. It was stated that General Westmoreland and Ambassador Lodge are really opposed to negotiating at this point because they believe the military situation is too unfortunate from our point of view to enable us to get a satisfactory settlement. The map to which I referred gives graphic evidence that the question involved is how many Americans we are prepared to have killed in order to improve the military situation. I for one do not want a single American killed to reclaim useless jungle land in South Vietnam. Although I expressed it more explosively than did the Senator from South Dakota. I wonder if he would comment on my statement.",

What we do have is some indication that the more we try to attack the Vietcong forces by military means. the more we terrorize and destroy the civilian population with which they are intermingled. One of the reporters who has been over there for some time and who has been watching our efforts to destroy the Vietcong forces in the villages and Jungles has suggested that the attacks we are making would make more sense if we were fighting an enemy rather than an ally. What he meant was that when we bomb a village or area controlled by the Vietcong guerrillas. or when we shell those areas or spray them with machinegun bullets. or destroy their crops we are destroying and alienating the civilian population. whose aid we will need if we are to attain our objective.",

Did you get any impression that the bombings had done what they were supposed to do when they were started last winter? Senator MCGOVERN. Well. Im not sure that I know what all the objectives of the bombing policy have been. If those attacks were designed to stop the flow of manpower from North Vietnam into South Vietnam. theyve failed. because we have many more men from the North fighting on behalf of the Vietcong In the South today than we did when the bombing attacks started last February. If the bombing was designed to encourage North Vietnam to come to the negotiating table. Im not sure that that has been achieved. It may be that It had just the opposite effect. that it tended to produce a more rigid situation than what might otherwise have been the case. But what disturbs me most of all is that no matter how careful our pilots are about the bombing attacks--and these are truly superb pilotsin a situation like this. youre bound to kill many innocent civilians. Im talking now. not about the bombing in the north. but in the south. where supposedly the people or at least a large percentage of them are on our side. I was told that we exercise great caution in bombing villages and hamlets. but nevertheless. while I was there. in visiting the civilian hospitals in South Vietnam. I found them crowded with bombing victims. with little children with their legs. arms blown off. men. women and children with their faces and their bodies horribly burned and scarred with napalm bombs. those things. it seems to me. are inevitable in bombing attacks of this kind.",

Now. as I understand it. both sides have given some rather strong Indications that the terms of the original Geneva settlement. going back to 1954. are for the most part acceptable. We may have some difference of opinion as to how those Geneva terms should be interpreted. My understanding is that the other side is saying that there must not only be an eventual troop withdrawal. which we have accepted on principle. there also must be a coalition government formed in South Vietnam on a provisional basis until elections can be held. and that the Vietcong. or the National Liberation Front. would have to be a part of any such coalition government.

Now. this war began in South Vietnam as a struggle between the government which we were backing in Saigon and another group of South Vietnamese that have formed under the National Liberation Front. which does not accept the government that weve been supporting. It was basically a civil and local conflict. So. I think we could greatly improve the chances for success in our current negotiating efforts. if those efforts included General Ky. or whoever happens to be in power in Saigon when negotiations get under way. and the National Liberation Front. For us to insist that we cant have any dealings with the Vietcong. with the socalled National Liberation Front. would have its parallel. it seems to me. if 200 years ago.

I think we may have reached a situation of stalemate. whereby neither side can score a decisive victory. Ive been trying to think of some analogy to the military and political situation that confronts us there. and the other day Iit occurred to me that Its very much like putting a bumblebee in a cage with an elephant.

In 1936. when the vessel construction subsidy bill was adopted. it contained a provision that the Government would subsidize the construction of private ships up to an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the cost of the ship. It was argued at that time that in order to develop an adequate U.S. merchant marine. it would be necessary for the Federal Government to subsidize its construction and operation. It was then argued that a 50percent subsidy was justified and that in the course of time the differential in the cost of building a vessel in the United States as compared with the cost of building a vessel in a foreign country would grow less and less. Instead of the cost growing less and less. it has grown larger and larger. Instead of the merchant marine getting better and better. it is growing weaker and weaker. This is happening in spite of the fact that the U.S. taxpayers have provided in the course of 30 years $2 billion to subsidize the operation of the merchant marine of the United States. run by private industry.

The operators of this company are not asking for a subsidy. They will build the ships on their own. They contend that they will be able to compete with other merchant marine operators even though those other operators are receiving this huge and extravagant subsidy to which I referred. The article quotes Mr. Marshall Safir. the chairman of the board of directors of the SapphireAtlantic Express Lines. as follows: We have discovered that subsidy does not build a healthy merchant marine. on the contrary. subsidy only breeds more demands for more subsidy. and the taxpayer winds up .paying for inefficiency and waste. The article further states as follows: The Government pays roughly $200 million in direct ship operating subsidies and about $100 million in shipbuilding grants. In addition it pays out nearly another $100 million in indirect subsidies for shipping Government cargoes in American vessels at about double prevailing world trade rates.

The problem here involves much more than the matter of enormous cost to municipalities. Inadequate purification of sewage is the primary source of the growing pollution of our fresh water streams and lakes. Pollution destroys wildlife. ruins recreational areas and reduces the already limited supply of usable water. The enormous challenge requires major technical developments in sewage treatment. One of the most perplexing problems has been that of devising ways to remove residues from fertilizers and other similar chemicals which cannot be eliminated through conventional techniques. The volume of these inorganic substances is increasing and the failure to eliminate these constitutes evermore serious form of pollution. Many of these elements when placed into slow moving streams and lakes cause vigorous growth of algae and other water plants. The resulting abnormal growth can kill off fish life and destroy the commercial and recreational value of great portions of our fresh water resources. Mr. President. a small experimental sewage plant now in operation in the city of Lawrence. Kans.. may well prove to be the forerunner of a truly major breakthrough in sewage technology. Using a new approach of this plant has been able to remove inorganic chemicals. something which has never been effectively accomplished to date. This project is the brain child of Prof. Ross E. McKinney. head of the University of Kansas Civil Engineering Department. Professor McKinney has been assisted by several of his students such as Doug Newport. Valery Wahbeh. Robert Sherwood and Russell Cummings. The small plant which they designed can handle the daily sewage of approximately 50 persons. This project may well provide the answers to the problem of controlling inorganic pollution. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that an article appearing in the Christian Science Monitor of June 14. 1966. describing this project be printed in the RECORD. Mr. President. I warmly congratulate Professor McKlnney and his students and also call this project to the attention of my colleagues as this promising new technology is truly of national interest.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may require. . Mr. Speaker. I wish to add my support to the efforts of my distinguished colleagues on our Committee on Merchant Marine in urging favorable consideration of the bill. S. 1349. - Under the existing inland. Great Lakes. and western rivers rules of the road. the duties of small craft when operating in narrow channels in which large vessels also are navigating are not clear. No distinction Is made in regard to the size of the vessels concerned and their ability to maneuver in the confined areas of narrow channels. It is the purpose of this bill. S. 1349. to clarify this situation by amending the inland. Great Lakes. and western rivers navigation rules so as to clarify the rights and duties of the operator of a small powerdriven vessel less than 65 feet in length and any sailing vessel operating in narrow channels in which large deepdraft vessels are also navigating. The effect of the amendments made by the bill to the rules of the road would be to furnish a clear andpositive obligation on the part of the increasing number of smallcraft operators to become cognizant of the restricted maneuvering ability of larger vessels in narrow channels. It is a clarification of existing rules dictated by the commonsense. and is designed to meet the problem of the burgeoning number of small pleasure craft and the everincreasing size of commercial vessels. In fairness to the small boat community. your committee has amended this bill so as to take effect 90 days after enactment. The purpose of this amendment is to insure that there is sufficient time for the Coast Guard to widely advertise this clarification of the rules to all parties concerned. and particularly to the small boat operators making them aware of their obligation not to hamper the safe passage of larger and more cumbersome vessels in the confined quarters of a narrow channel. Accordingly. in the interest of navigation safety. I urge the favorable consideration and passage of the bill S. 1349.",

With all due respect to my friend from Illinois. that will be the time and the place for him to make his argument against the renewal of this act. The Commodity Credit Corporation is. as he has said. a creature of the Congress. and I suppose we can hamstring its operations and could change the rules in the middle of the game. but I do not think that is quite fair. I think the rules ought to be announced at the beginning of the game instead of between innings. So long as the bill is on the books which requires the Department of Agriculture to take certain actions which the gentleman would now limit I think it would be a mistake for us to tell the Department that it shall not enforce the law which Congress passed after full and complete debate.",

I say that we ought to point out how unfair some of our agricultural laws are. In order that there will not be two prices on cotton. the Federal Government pays a subsidy to the mills so that they can buy cotton for their domestic use. raw cotton. at the same price that the exporter pays for cotton which is sent to foreign mills. Now let us take another commodity that was in the same bill. wheat. With wheat the loan level is now down to the world market price. but we are charging the wheat millers this coming year 75 cents a bushel to make sure that they do have a twoprice program. Where flour mills have foreign competition as they do especially along our Canadian border. the flour millers in this country have to pay 75 cents a bushel more than the export price of wheat. So we see unfairness all through our agricultural laws. I rise today to point out that we have three commodities in which we use direct paymentsfeed grains. wheat. and cottonand we use a different kind of direct payment under each one. With cotton the mills receive a subsidy from the U.S. Treasury to bring their cost of raw cotton down to world level. With wheat the mills pay a tax to the U.S. Treasury to bring their cost way above the world level. With feed grains the farmers receive a subsidy from the U.S. Treasury the way a program ought to operate if direct payments are to be used.",

These participative certificates are 100 percent guaranteed by the Federal Government. Some say that they will be in denominations no lower than $10.000. which means that the Johnson administration will make sure the average John Doe will not collect this 51/2 percent interest.

A deficit is facing us. and the objective of the administration is to avoid that deficit by selling capital assets. President Eisenhower made a similar recommendation in order to avoid a deficit in 1959. Is it not a fact that the argument which the Senator from Delaware is making today is substantially the same argument that he made against the Eisenhower proposal in 1959?",

Contrary to what the Senator from Maine said. when the Secretary of the Treasury was before the Committee on Finance I joined with the then senior Senator from Virginia.

I point out that there is this difference in todays proposal and the 1959 resolution which I supported. The 1959 resolution condemned something after it had been done. It was not a resolution to stop such sales. Only $335 million was involved in the 1959 transaction. However. the recent request was for $33 billion. and the request now is for $11 billion. As I said and agreed to on the other day. a principle is involved. When we sell assets we should not count the proceeds as regular income. If a man who has a $9.000 a yearsalary and is spending $10.000 a year sells a corner of his lot for $2.000. or sells his car for $2.000. he cannot then brag about the fact that he has a balanced budget or a $1.000 surplus.

I am delighted to have this opportunity to share with the Members of the House the 6 P.m. editorial given by Mr. Joseph McCaffrey on WMALTV \"News T\" on March 30. 1965. in which he endorses the proposal by the Honorable HARLEY 0. STAGGERS. our distinguished dean of the West Virginia congressional delegation in the House of Representatives. to raise the Federal income tax personal exemption from $600 to $1.000 per year. The gentleman from West Virginia. Congressman STAGGERS. has labored diligently to achieve this objective for the past 15 years. and it is my hope that the editorial which I cite will be of some small help to the gentleman from West Virginia. Congressman STAGGERS. in obtaining favorable action in the House of Representatives on this matter of importance to every American family. The Great Society is moving to help those who have nothing. and every administration has done something to help those who have a great deaL but it is about time that somebody tried to help those who are trying to help themselves but havent gotten very far. Even the welltodo Douglas Dillon. the retiring Secretary of the Treasury. recognized this last week when he said that there should be a tax reduction for the lowincome families. In his last formal speech as Treasury Secretary. Dillon said that the lowincome families have not been given adequate tax relief. Congressman HARLEY 0. STAGGERS heard the retiring Secretary loud and clear. STAGGERs. a West Virginia Democrat. said this is what I have been talking about. and he asked for some support for a bill he has offered in almost every Congress for the last 15 years. Raise the personal exemption from $600 to $1.000. STAGGERS believes. and you have helped the smallincome earner better than any other way. Not only that but it is the quickest way to bring about relief. Other Members of Congress have long plumped for a boost in the personal exemption and now that there is a recognition of the problem of the lowincome family building up. perhaps Congressman STAGGERS and the others who support a boost in the exemption will get help in the House and Senate.

While I realize the committee has provided for temporary employees which they feel are sufficient in number to maintain current services. the failure of the committee to provide for the necessary permanent employees will be a distinct disservice to our many areas of rapid economic expansion. The Departments original request was the minimum request and was kept at that minimum figure in order to help with the Presidents economy in Government program. That 20.000 figure was the minimum figure necessary to maintain the current efficiency of the Post Office Department. If the Department were to eliminate all of the overtime now necessary. it would take twice the request they made in order to maintain adequate service to its 45 million family and 4.1 million business patrons. Mr. Chairman. I am quite familiar with the problems that the Department faces in areas of rapid economic expansion. In my own district we have had 36 new post offices constructed in the last 11 years. Some of these have been in communities which as short a time ago as 1957 did not even exist. These post offices are making use of the latest equipment and systems for processing the mail but they also need employees. If the Post Office Department is going to continue to meet the needs of areas of rapid economic expansion. they must have the manpower to do so. The committee actfon cripples the request for that manpower and the Department has attempted to be reasonable in their request. Several -of the communities in my district arei so understaffed that substitute carriers and clerks have been working as much as 60 hours per week. On top of this the regular employees have been working overtime as well. The normal morning deliveries are arriving at residential homes as late as 5 p.m.. and the continued growth in my area will mean added problems to the post offices in meeting the demands for adequate service. Mr. Chairman. it would seem that if the fine record of our Post Office Department has made in the past Is to be continued. additional permanent postal employees will be needed.

I do not fuss with the Appropriations Committee for curtailing unnecessary expenditures or for insisting on maximum economies. However. I do not subscribe to the theory that the Appropriations Committee is infallible in their judgment. The Post Office Department requested sufficient funds for the Bureau of Operations to eliminate some 15.000 manyears of excess overtime. They proposed to accomplish this by the appointment of regular employees. This approach is nothing less than good management and would produce eventual economies. Mr. Speaker. experience has proven that it is not efficient to employ excessive temporary employees or to work regular employees excessive overtime. In the first instance. it is a costly process training temporary employees and certainly because their employment is temporary they leave the post office for employment elsewhere whenever they can find permanent jobs. This vicious and costly cycle continues on and on. A1668 In the second instance. It has long been known that employees performing hours of overtime are not as productive as during their regular hours of employment. Costconscious and progressive private firms found this to be true. and as a result have taken proper steps to eliminate excessive overtime in their plants. Certainly If this is true in the cases of companies operating for _a profit. It is equally true in the case of the Government. I regret that the Appropriations Committee did not provide sufficient funds to enable the Bureau of Operations in the Post Office Department to convert their temporary employees to a permanent basis. The report states: Additional funds will allow about 1.300 positions to be used as an experimental program to reduce the excess overtime work by postal employees. It is my contention that the time for experimentation has long since passed. The work existsit is being doneeither by temporary employees or by the use of excess overtime. Neither course is proper. The solution is to provide sufficient funds so that regular clerks and carriers can be employed to do the work of the Post Office Department. Dereliction in Debate",

It seems to me what would be confusing to the entire business community is that if we should adopt his amendment and his approach. we will be changing the concept of investment credit as it has heretofore existed. Because. as I understand it. the Senators amendment says that you cannot get the benefit of the investment credit. it is tied to income. There are many little businesses. of which the Senator from Illinois and all of us know. that go out and borrow money and pay interest on the money which they borrow. and they do not * finance their building by. we will say. equity financing or selling stock. but they have an interest problem. and when they pay it. they have no income. Therefore. having no income. they are declared ineligible for the use of any investment credit. So what we would do is complicate what is already a bad situation. The Senators amendment would remove from businesses which are already being hurt. and which are most in need. the possibility of enjoying an investment credit. That is what worries me about the proposal of the Senator from Illinois. Another illustration would be casualty losses. Suppose we had a storm such as we had up in New England a couple of years ago. which blew down many business buildings. knocked down signs. and one thing and another. and they had to build new buildings. The casualty loss would have to be used against the income. so that there would be no income. and that business then could not have the advantage of an investment credit. So it would seem to me that while I. as the Senator from Louisiana. have the highest regard and respect for the pur-. poses and the sincerity of the distinguished Senator from Illinois.

It does not provide that the Finance Committee of the Senate must sit on its hands and be spineless and motionless until some Secretary of the Treasury sends up a recommendation. The responsibility is clearly upon the legislative branch of the Government to initiate revenue measures and the only priority which the House has is that of origin. It is incumbent upon the legislative branch of the Government to raise the revenue to support the Government. to provide for the common defense. The constitution does not require the Congress to wait until the President or the Secretary of the Treasury tells it precisely what to do. when to act. how to act or not act. after all the wheeling and dealing that goes on prior to such a recommendation. I implore the chairman. who is a new chairman of the committee. to provide the leadership to make of it a powerful and effective committee. not merely a compliant pawn for an administration.",

The Finance Committee included a number of amendments in the bill. and I believe that they did a very fine job in adding a number of amendments which we thought to be meritorious. The -Constitution declares that revenue bills shall originate in the House. The Senate does not have the power to originate such bills. The Senate really does not have the right or the duty to initiate legislation of a revenue nature. It must start in the House of Representatives. I suppose that we on our committee are to be regarded as a bunch of lackeys because we reported most of what the administration recommended. as well as adding other amendments. I suppose that puts the House in a bad light. The House brought back to the floor and voted through almost precisely what the package was when it was recommended by the Treasury. but we do have to work together. I suppose that if we have been lacking in this matter. in a bill passed by the House which was reported by the Committee on Ways and Means. at least we did do our best to try to be responsible as a committee. We resisted the temptation to put a lot of additional taxes on which we did not feel were justified. and we did not try to make an appropriation bill out of a tax bill. As a committee. I believe that it has tried to be responsible. It has considered all amendments which were offered on their merits. While it is true that we did not agree with some of the amendments offered by some Senators. we certainly did respect their good faith. their good intentions and their desires to serve their country as patriotically and as ably as their consciences dictated. I am sure that they all do that. and I wish the Senator to know that if he does not have as much regard for some of us who did not vote the way he did. that we do not reciprocate. that we have a high regard for him.",

Today the figure is greater. for the worlds population is increasing at the rate of more than 7.000 per hour. He further points out that the population increase is outgaining the rise in productivity. In his talk. he quotes Dr. Raymond Ewell of the State University of New York: The world is heading for the greatest catastrophe in historyfamine for hundreds of millions of people. * * * Such a famine will be of massive proportions. affecting * * * possibly billions of persons. * * * Not only will the coming famine be widespread. but it will be persistent and get worse year by year. unless ways and means are soon found to increase agricultural production. * * * It is difficult for us. sitting in rich. comfortable. overfed America. to realize that the greatest disaster in history is just around the corner.

This trail is replete with instances of Soviet brutality. of Soviet flagrant disregard of treaties and agreements. and of Soviet domination of unwilling peoples. Some would counsel us to accept these facts. The words of the late and great Sir Winston Churchill best answered this line of thought. when he stated: One cannot accept security by throwing small nations to the wolves. Truly.

In 1917. when the oppressive czarist regime was shattered. the Lithuanian people had a chance to realize their centuriesold dream. and February 16. 1918. they proclaimed their independence and established their own democratic government. In the midst of multiple handicaps and hardships. they succeeded in working their way out of chaos and misery. Soon their independence was recognized by other soyereign states. and thus. once again. Lithuania became part of the world community of nations. For about two decades. during the interwar years. through sheer hard work and tireless industry. the courageous and determined Lithuanians rebuilt their wartorn country. In time. they made it one of the most prosperous and progressive democracies in northeastern Europe. and they enjoyed their freedom to the full. But the turn of international politics. over which they had no control. threatened their independence. and even their existence as a free people. Unfortunately. their worst apprehensions seemed justified when. in 1940. they were treacherously robbed of their freedom by the Red Army. Lithuania lost its independence as the country was annexed to the Soviet Union. Its people became restless prisoners. During the last war. Lithuanians changed their detested masters more than once. After enduring the Russian Communist yoke for about a year. the German Nazis occupied the country. and held it for more than 2 years. Finally. when these were evicted by the Red Army. toward the end of the war. the Russians returned. and to this day they are there. ruling over Lithuania with an iron hand. inflexible in its ruthlessness and cruel efficiency. There is no freedom of any kind in the country. The unhappy Lithuanians are sealed off from the free world. and only in recent years a few visitors from the free West have been allowed to visit the country. But. despite some thawing and relaxation recently. the Lithuanian people still suffer under totalitarian tyranny.

It is one of historys most tragic ironies that the only Lithuanians who can freely celebrate this occasion are those no longer living in their native land. The iron legions of the Red army now hold that proud but small nation in tight bondage to the totalitarian dictatorship of the Soviet Union. After over a century of domination by czarist Russia. the Lithuanian people proclaimed their independence on February 16. 1918 and. along with their Baltic neighbors. Latvia and Estonia. took their rightful place in the community of free nations. But their freedom was short lived. Two decades later the new imperialists of Red Russia sent their armies into Lithuania. Latvia. and Estonia. and brutally incorporated these independent nations into the Soviet Union. The Soviets have tried every method to wipe out the patriotic fervor and will for freedom of these heroic peoples. Thousands have been murdered. Hundreds of thousands deported. many to suffer the inhumanity and starvation of Soviet slave labor camps. But their dedication to freedom is still strong. their patriotism undiminished. Our Government. through many administrations. has consistently supported the just aspirations to freedom and independence of the Baltic peoples and. indeed. all the Captive Nations now suffering the various forms of Soviet imperialistic domination. We must never waver in that support. for to do so would be to break faith with our own ideals and aspirations.

He made his profession of the theater a respected image in our Capital. and he brought to us. in person. the people of the world of \"make believe.\" and made them our friends. He boasted no personal fortune. he had no patronage to bestow. but upon his untimely death the press of our city was moved to honest praise that could be the envy of the mightiest. I truly believe that such a man Is a vital part of our history. Those of us who knew him were the better for the knowing. and all of us can be inspired by a recital of the sincere estimates of Jack Foxe. who was so fittingly eulogized by Father Gilbert Hartke.

If they did. and if the facts are such as the Senator from North Carolina has related them. such counties would automatically be taken out of the effects of the bill by a mere letter or piece of paper filed with the threejudge court in the District of Columbia. together with a statement by the Attorney General that no such discrimination exists. Let me go one step further. The reason for the inclusion of these provisions in the bill is that since the latter part of the 19th century. beginning around 1890. State after State in the South. and even my own State of Maryland at that time. adopted various statutes to deprive Negroes of the right of the franchise. In some States they used the grandfather clause. Then the white primaries were put into effect. When those laws were struck down by the court. ingenious State legislatures came up with another statute. Time after time when the courts struck down one barrier. the legislatures came up with another.

The magnificence of America is emphatically brought home to our people in a motion picture produced by one of the Hollywood film industrys true giants and an outstanding patriot. Col. Jack L. Warner. who over many years. and through hundreds of notable productions. consistently has demonstrated his devotion to our Nation. The wide range of Warner Bros. films repeatedly has depicted the cavalcade of history and progress. our bountiful resources and opportunities. and Americas incomparable scenic beauty. The appeal of the United States is vividly presented in a new Warner picture appropriately entitled \"The Land We Love.\" which was produced for the Treasury Department. Offering an inspiring view of the whole vast panorama of America. this picture enlisted cooperation of the entire motion picture industry. With the 50 separate States occupying the role of individual stars. the settings are the mountains and valleys. the deserts and streams. the cities and towns that constitute America. The drama is the dynamic story of a Nation. Ably narrated by Raymond Massey and designed to stimulate public interest in U.S. savings bonds. \"The Land We Love\" will enchant viewers by spectacular views of this countrys wonderland.

They are equally sincere today in recognizing the practical difficulties. dangers. and disadvantages entailed in the minting program the Treasury might have had in mind in carrying out the expressed intent of the Congress. We would be playing into the pockets of the hoardersdoing nothing to help commercial coinage circulationand doing irreparable harm to industries dependent on the use of silverand the bread and butter jobs dependent on those industries. Todays discussion performs a tremendous service. It points up the silver question in a fashion that must be understood by all AmericansEast and West. North and South. There just is not enough silver being produced in the free world to meet all our silver needs. The free world production is only 225 million ounces of silver. The industrial requirements are 300 million ounces. These are divided among such employing industries as silverware and jewelry. electronics. photographic film. batteries. missiles. and medical and dental requirements. There is a 25percent deficit between consumption and production. There is no new production left for silver coinageand the present Treasury stocks must be safeguarded to protect our present coinage. Present coinage requirements alone threaten to exhaust our Treasury stocks in 3 years. The price of silver rises each yearbut the price rise does not stimulate production. Since producers outside the United States account for 85 percent of the total free world production. they would derive the major benefit from increased silver prices. I hope the western Senators will now take a good look at the worldwide and longrange problem that silver proposes. Their local desires. and pride and purposes. have my sympathy and my respectjust as I respect their present realization that only the speculator could profit from a piecemeal treatment of the silver situation.

This amendment would add to section 4(b). \"automatic trigger.\" a provision excluding any political subdivision of any State in which 90 percent of the persons of voting age applying for registration in connection with the presidential election of November 1964 were adjudged literate and registered by the election officials. This amendment ignores the crux of the voting discrimination problem. which is that. because of the effects of past discrimination. Negroes have not been encouraged to apply to register in any significant numbers. Thus. those who applied to register in connection with the presidential election of November 1964 probably were mostly whites. and the result of this amendment would be that. if the registrars allowed most of those whites to register. whether they were actually literate or not. the State or political subdivision would be exempted from the provisions of this bill. There is no apparent basis for letting a State escape the coverage of S. 1564 for the reason allowed by this amendment. Further. It is possible that many States and political subdivisions which should be covered would escape because of the way this amendment would work. It should also be noted that this provision is tied only to persons who applied for registration in connection with the presidential election of November 1964. In a political subdivision where registration is permanent. this could be a very small number. For example. if 20 whites who had just reached 21 applied and 18 were registered. the political subdivision would be beyond the ban of section 4. Mr. President. I urge the Senate to reJect amendment No. 158.",

I want to thank the gentleman for pointing out that we succeeded in increasing the amount of funds for development loans for the Alliance for Progress by $25 million. Some of us had good reasons for this action. thinking that if we were going to have to give money away It would be a little cheaper to ship it to Latin America than to ship it to the Far East. as we will save a little money because of a reduction in the freight rates. In addition. in my opinion. I think the Alliance is the most important program in the bill and I think it must succeed. Latin America is much more Important to us than any other area in the world. Mr. Speaker. again I say I do not think I am entitled to any commendations because. as far as I am concerned. I just do not feel that I am any longer doing a very creditable job. simply because the aid agencies request money far in excess of their actual needs. and one of the two branches has the wisdom to make some necessary reductions. At one time we did our own work on this side. and we made substantial reductions. but apparently we have recommended excessive appropriations in recent years. Then the bill goes over to the other body. and they now do our work for us. In thanking the gentleman for his very gracious compliments. I must insist that the Members of the other body should also be complimented. but I hope that all the compliments are not premature because of the new policy of the aid agencies in submitting requests for supplemental appropriations. which I referred to earlier in my remarks.

The House bill was unanimously reported by the Armed Services Committee and has the support of both the General Accounting Office and the Department of Defense. The bill would authorize contracts in existence with the Department of Defense on or after March 1 of this yearto be amended to provide an equitable price adjustment for increased prices paid by a contractor for raw milk resulting from actions by the Secretary of Agriculture which caused increases in the producer price of such milk. Certain dairies holding milk contracts with the Department of Defense are experiencing losses on their firm fixedprice contracts as a result of increased prices for raw milk due to actions by the Secretary of Agriculture since March 1. These actions reportedly have increased the average price of raw milk approximately 90 cents per hundredweight. which. I am told. is equivalent to about 8 cents per gallon. The existing milk contracts with the Department of Defense do not include a clause authorizing an amendment to the contract for price adjustments. even though unforeseen increases In the price of raw milk result from actions by the Department of Agriculture. Because of this lack of authority of the Department of Defense to amend procurement contracts of this type. many of the dairies reportedly are faced with tremendous losses and even bankruptcy in certain cases if they attempt to fulfill their contracts. The bill does not guarantee a profit to any contractor. but merely insures against his suffering a loss as a result of the unforeseen actions by the Secretary of Agriculture in adjusting the raw milk prices. The burden of proof lies with the contractor to furnish evidence that he will suffer a loss and not merely a diminution of anticipated profit because of those unforeseen increases. The committee was advised that some 350 to 375 contracts could be affected by this legislation. However. the Department of Defense indicated that they were unable to provide an estimate of the cost involved in these price adjustments.",

H.R. 6413. introduced by our distinguished friend from California and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. was unanimously reported by that committee. It would permit the taxfree withdrawal from bonded wine cellars of wine and wine products when they are rendered unfit for beverage use. This bill will permit the use of wines withdrawn tax free in nonbeverage productssuch as food flavoringand will also alleviate economic problems. in some cases. by helping to dispose of fruit surpluses. Under existing law. an excise tax is imposed on the withdrawal of wine from a bonded wine cellar irrespective of Its ultimate use. The tax is imposed at rates varying with the alcohol content of the wine. Present law permits a drawback of all but $1 of the tax per gallon in the case of distilled spirits where they are rendered unfit for beverage use. but there is no comparable provision under present law in the case of wines. Your committee sees no reason why a taxfree withdrawal privilege should not also be available in the case of wines. To guard against evasion of the alcoholic beverage taxes. the bill provides that wines withdrawn tax free must be rendered unfit for beverage use before their withdrawal. \"Unfit for beverage use\" in this case means the same as when that term is used in the Internal Revenue Code in the ease of drawbacks of tax on distilled spirits. The bill excludes from coverage wines containing more than 21 percent alcohol. This is provided because it is believed that the inclusion of higher alcohol content wines might result in attempted diversion for beverage use and. additionally. because it is felt that a tax exemption of these higher alcohol content wines might. because of their resemblance to distilled spirits. place persons now using distilled spirits in nonbeverage products at a competitive disadvantage. This bill has been reported unanimously by your committee and the Treasury Department has indicated no objection to it. It is expected that this bill will result in only a negligible revenue loss.",

I would first of all like to express my appreciation to the members of the Ways and Means Committee. especially the chairman. for their fine work and cooperation. Our present laws do not contain any provision for use of wine for nonbeverage purposes. Provisions similar to those proposed in H.R. 6413 are now effective for industrial alcohol and distilled spirits. This bill proposes that wine that is denatured and rendered unfit for beverage use be permitted to be withdrawn taxfree. If this is allowed. it will open new markets for wine throughout the country in food. pharmaceuticals. livestock food. and other fields. Such a provision would not involve any loss of revenue. Our entire grape industry is seriously in need of new markets. This Is being gradually accomplished in the case of raisins and other grape products. through extensive research and market development in new fields. Such market development is seriously hampered. and I think unnecessarily and unreasonably so. in the case of wine grapes. because of the existing tax structure. I can see no reason either from the viewpoint of public policy in regulation and control. or from the tax revenue viewpoint. why this serious obstacle should not be eliminated under proper and careful regulations as are proposed in H.R. 6413.

In formulating this legislation. the Congress took serious consideration of the reservations expressed by our constituents concerning proposals which were earlier advanced. These amendments set forth by H.R. 15119 make five major changes in the unemployment compensation program. First. coverage will be extended to approximately 31/2 million workers whose jobs were not previously protected. Second. a permanent program will be established to extend benefits to workers who exhaust their regular unemployment compensation payments during periods of high unemployment. Third. the States will be provided with a system of judicial review. Fourth. the financing of the program will be improved. Fifth. a few new State requirements will be added and other changes will be made to improve and strengthen the FederalState unemployment compensation program. When this legislation was being initially considered. I was concerned about the \"apparent misunderstanding of some people regarding the relationship of the Federal Government with the unemment compensation program. Far from being an invasion of the rights of the States. unemployment insurance was a Federal concept from the beginning. It was part of the Social Security Act of 1935 and since that time. the Federal Government has collected from employers and distributed it to the States.

At that time. I suggested that the time had come to give realistic support to establishing some type of helicopter operation in these areas. and I urged a study of this problem be undertaken. Ground traffic in the BaltimoreWashington area is definitely a clearcut case of congestion. Perhaps. then. the most ideal place to start some type of direct lift aircraft program would be right here in the Nations Capital. Almost every day. I have read or heard reports that stressed the overcrowded conditions at Washingtons National Airport. while at the same time there has been a slowing down of traffic. by comparison. at Dulles and Friendship airports. If an adequate helicopter transportation system was available at these three airports and in downtown locations of Baltimore and Washington there would be an untold amount of time saved by users of commercial air transportation as well as relieving the critically crowded and congested conditions. I am pleased to report that one of our colleagues. the gentleman from Maryland. the Honorable SAMUEL FRIEDEL. has recommended to Mr. Charles Murphy. Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. that a comprehensive study be initiated with regard to establishing helicopter service in the BaltimoreWashington area. I endorse this move as a giant step forward in the direction of reducing traffic congestion as well as providing a much needed service to air travelers and I urge that this study be authorized at the earliest possible date.

I urge that a demonstration or trial flight from a central downtown location. the Elipse for example. to the various Washington area airports to point up the many benefits in cost and time saved that would be derived from such an operation.

Each of these lives is precious. not only to those left behind who make up the immediate family. but precious as well to our Nation.

I have therefore introduced today a resolution that it is the sense of the Congress that the architecture of the historic west front of the Capitol of the United States should be preserved for the education and enjoyment of the people of the United States. and. therefore. any work done with respect to such west front should be limited to replacing or reconstructing damaged. deteriorating. or unsafe portions of such west front. The preservation of the Nations Capitol. its unique architecture and design. particularly the magnificent west front. is an obvious responsibility of the Office of the Architect of the Capitol. To intentionally plan its destruction has been aptly described as an act of vandalism. and is to me incomprehensible. It is as if the spirit of the British vandals who seized the Capitol and burned it down during the War of 1812 lives on in the most unlikely breasts. I hope my colleagues will join me by introducing similar resolutions to save the Nations Capitol. Mr. Speaker.

In this century the Pacific Northwest has furnished a very substantial part of this lumber. A most alarming development was brought to my attention yesterday. It appears that the office of the Surgeon General has proposed drastic changes in hospital construction regulations- prohibiting use of wood. These proposed changes would be effective tomorrow. This outrageous. highhanded action is almost beyond belief. Lumber is an essential building material in nearly every commercial building. Modern techniques make possible wide uses of lumber not previously possible. Fireproofing of lumber can readily be accomplished. Despite historic and well established use of lumber in hospital construction. the Surgeon General proposes to prohibit it hereafter. The war in southeast Asia makes all forms of building materials more scarce. There probably is. however. less pressure on lumber than other forms of building materials. including steel. The most alarming aspect of the proposed action is that a trend in this direction could well be established which could indeed seriously harm and even cripple our great lumber industry. I ask that the Surgeon General at once. today. suspend his proposed changes until representatives of the forest industry can have a fair hearing before the Surgeon General.",

Nick Kotz of Cowles Publications reported in the June 17 issue of the Minneapolis Tribune that the Defense Department is continuing its policy of buying certain beef and pork overseas rather than buying it here in this country. Personally. I view this decision. taken at the recommendation of Agriculture Secretary Freeman. as far more damaging to the American farmer than the 50 percent cutback in military prime pork purchases. Why is that? Because buying meat for our servicemen overseas from foreign sources rather than American farmers means a domestic livestock surplus is being permitted to build up. This can produce the same extreme livestock price depression that happened a couple years ago because of massive beef imports. This is another example of the administrations unswerving attempt to make the farmer the scapegoat for inflation. I request inclusion of the Kotz article at this point in my remarks.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. over the past several months. our Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries has been conducting a series of hearings on \"VietnamShipping Policy Review\" in an examination of the current plight of the American maritime industry. During the course of these hearings. several witnesses have suggested that our Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries review and authorize budget requests of the Maritime Administration before such requests are processed by our Committee on Appropriations. Such a procedure would enable our Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries to express its views and make appropriate recommendations concerning these budget requests. Experience has indicated that the absence of a requirement for a legislative review of the Maritime Administrations programs. particularly in the field of vessel construction. limits the Congress in its scope of its understanding and appreciation of the need for ongoing and progressive programs to meet the needs of the American merchant marine. This is particularly important at the present time in light of events in southeast Asia and in the foreseeable future when the American merchant marine again may be called upon to meet the security requirements of the United States. By requiring legislative review and authorization prior to appropriation for the various Maritime Administration promotional programs on an annual basis. I firmly believe that a genuine service can be rendered to both the Congress and the Maritime Administration in evaluating and implementing such programs. It also would be beneficial in overcoming a serious present lack of responsiveness to the needs of the American merchant marine. Three years ago to meet a similar need. Public Law 8845 was enacted requiring authorization for certain appropriations for the Coast Guard. Since that time our committees experience has been that assertion of such congressional control has proven to be beneficial for the Congress. the U.S. Coast Guard. and ultimately our national interest by enhancing the preparedness of the Coast Guard to discharge its missions. Accordingly. I am today introducing a bill to amend title IX of the Merchant Marine Act. 1936. as amended. so as to require that appropriations to carry out the provisions of that act be preceded by specific legislative authorization and thereby strengthen congressional control over promotional efforts designed to assist the American merchant marine.",

Those who profess so much concern about the use of these agents would do well to remind themselves that we are up to our ears in trouble in southeast Asia. and the chances are that situation is going to get worse before it gets better. I have a lot more interest in seeing the job finished out there and in seeing American boys permitted to come home than I have about what weapons are used against the people who are seeking to kill Americans. The Vietcong have not been particular in their choice of weapons. even against civilians. The agent which has been used is nonlethal. It is disabling for only a limited time5 to 15 minutes. It is used by major police forces of the world and was issued to the Vietnamese for riot control. It was humane considerations that caused the nonlethal substance to be used against the Vietcong under circumstances where South Vietnamese also could have been killed or wounded had other weapons been used. It would appear that the bleeding hearts would recognize the fact that the South Vietnamese are doing the Vietcong a favor when they use temporarily disabling nonlethal weapons. Certainly. this is preferable to napalm which burns its victims to death or shrapnel which blows them to bits or nuclear devices which destroy everyone and everything.

And that is not so surprising when It is considered that such a period of years takes the Nation back past the Custer massacre into the days when the West was yet untamed. It is difficult to visualize the world of 95 years ago. and the way Americans of 1870 lived. Their way of life we would call. possibly. primitive. And yet there was nothing primitive about the thinking of Americans who lived then. They planted the seeds of progress that so many of us enjoy today. Out of their foresight and imagination grew fantastic inventions. great national wealth. fabulous advances in selfgovernment. Chicago burned and was rebuilt. and rebuilt again. The dark continent of Africa was explored and opened. Great industries to meet needs unknown in 1870 came into being to enrich the lives of all of us. If we look back 95 years. our chests swell with pride. unless we happen to look at one particular day in our history. March 30. 1870. Up to that day. America had under consideration a proposition contained in language of beautiful clarity. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race. color. or previous condition of servitude. On March 30. 1870. exactly 95 years ago today. America proudly proclaimed the ratification by the necessary 29 States that made the 15th amendment basic law in our land. In many areas of our Nation. that promise has been redeemed. These areas tend to be the ones most benefited by the forces for progress unloosed by the foresight of our ancestors. It is perhaps significant that the areas which have been most remiss in redeeming their promise tend to be those which have benefited least from the forces set into motion by the men of 1870? As a nation we are now. almost all of us. embarked on the task of making the promise of 95 years ago the realities of today throughout the 50 States.

North Dakotans of both political parties were shocked to hear the Presidents budget message recommending a cutback from 31/2 to 1 million farmers. We had hoped that we had this attitude corrected. but then just last week the Department of Agriculture granted a sugarbeet acreage permit to a new group in Maine without holding new hearings and giving our farmers in North Dakota a chance to plead their case. And virtually the same day the Department. which as you know is cutting back the acreage of our growers in North Dakota. announced that they would allow unlimited acreage to New York State farmers who wanted to raise beets. They normally had a 75acre limitation on new beet growers. but the Department of Agriculture announced. and I am quoting: The 75acre limitation is removed and maximum acreage that can be committed to a farm will be determined by the New York ASC Committee. The announcement goes on to say. and I quote: If farmers in the central New York locality do not contract for all of the 29.500 acres available. the company building the beet sugar factory may wish to plant some of the remaining acreage. If this is not corporation farming. I do not know what it is. It seems strange that we are getting more and more into a double standard discriminating against the smaller States. We find that farmers in New York State can plant unlimited acreage of sugarbeets. Corporations are even being encouraged to get into the farming business. Under the education program. a child in New York State is given far more than a child in North Dakota. Our veterans facilities are being shut down in the smaller States and new ones built in the more densely populated areas. although unfortunately people still get sick in small States.

The jet was on its way to Paris. and French Government agents were on board to guard the more than 10 bars of U.S. gold just obtained by General de Gaulle in exchange for U.S. dollars. The Treasury Department has just noted that U.S. gold stocks declined $250 million last week. and that $231.5 million of U.S. gold drops were a result of French demands for U.S. gold. France still owes the United States $6 billion in World War I debts. and has made no payment on them since 1931. France also owes the United States over $600 million in debts for World War II. This is one account which needs to be balanced. To allow General de Gaulle to escape payments on debts over 34 years old while he continues his onslaught against Americas gold reserves is absurd. France is in effect using our own money to attack the American dollar. Commonsense dictates that gold be exchanged for dollars in order that the faith in American money be upheld. But commonsense also dictates that loans be repaid. particularly by those countries who have so many U.S. dollars that they can exchange them for over $230 million worth of U.S. gold. I have introduced House Concurrent Resolution 301 which expresses the feeling of the Congress that Frances repayments on her World War I debts to the United States be put back on the original schedule. General de Gaulle should be made aware that the feeling of the American people is such that France repay her debts.

Rare is the Congressman supporting a foreign aid program who dares risking the cynicism of his colleagues by admitting to a philanthropic motive. however mild. Altruism is for the squares both in the executive and the legislative branches. We couch our speeches and arguments in terms of fighting communism. or of making money in the long run by increasing the capability of our neighbor nations to buy from us. Indeed. it seems that any intimation of moving with the philanthropic motive of feeding the hungry. healing the sick. or educating the illiterate out of the goodness of our hearts would constitute a poor argument in the Halls of Congress. It would be shocking. therefore. to learn that at least one Asian statesman. according to Crosby S. Noyes of the Evening Star. has seen through us and says that we. the United States. will ultimately succeed in his part of the world because we. as a people. want to be loved. It may develop that despite ourselves. the goodness of hearts and our sincere desire to help others to obtain for themselves the blessings of freedom and prosperity. may show through our smokescreen of selfprofessed selfinterest and discover that our softheartedness is in fact our greatest strength in international affairs.

I take particular pleasure in joining with my ItalianAmerican friends in paying tribute to Giovanni da Verrazzano whose discoveries played an important part in our American history. On or about April 17. 1524. this daring and adventurous Florentine navigator sailed his ship into New York Harbor and sent a small boat through the narrows to explore upper New York Bay. The widespread public interest in Verrazzano and appreciation of his important contribution to the development of our country motivated the issuance of a commemorative stamp to honor his name in 1964. Also. in 1964. a suspension bridge across the narrows of New York Harbor was completed. appropriately bearing the name of Verrazzano. When we honor Verrazzano for his great deeds. we also think of the hundreds of other great men of Italian birth or descent who have done so much for America.

In my opinion. however. the entire watershed program has been seriously jeopardized by recent action of the Bureau of the Budget in limiting to 100 the number of projects to be funded with the $5.7 million approved last year for this purpose by Congress. I therefore am introducing - today a resolution requiring the Budget Bureau to fulfill the intent of Congress by releasing all funds allocated for watershed project planning this fiscal year. ending Since its establishment in 1954. the watershed protection program has relied upon local initiative to stimulate cooperative local. State and Federal planning and financing. My home State of Indiana has been particularly diligent in this respect. As a matter of fact. eventual local and State money devoted to watershed projects in Indiana will total about $51 million. This figure is just $15 million short of equalling the Federal Governments share. The accomplishments of these programs are widely known. but bear repeating. Watershed programs help save lives and property that otherwise would be destroyed by floods. They provide much needed recreational facilities for a constantly increasing population and help develop fish and wildlife habitats. They serve to enlarge municipal water supplies. They store irrigation water and thereby make significant contributions to our agricultural economy. Now. however. these valuable and beneficial achievements are being threatened with severe curtailment by the Budget Bureau. At the present time. 28 watershed projects in 18 States are ready for planning authorization. Another 18 projects will be ready in the next few weeks. Of these 46 projects. 3 are located in Indiana. all of them in the Ninth Congressional District which is being so ably served by my distinguished colleague. LEE",

It was in April 1941 that the people of that ancient and culturally endowed land were finally able to assert once more their right to pursue their own destiny. Caught up in the tragedy of World War II. nevertheless. the Croatians made good on their determination to become an independent state. Their determination and courage in facing numerous obstacles and odds was truly a remarkable and commendable feat. The Croatians ancient experiences as a powerful kingdom and center of influence served to inculcate in them the stamina necessary to accomplish their longsought goal. However. the end of World War II saw the demise of Croatian independence and now she is an integral part of Communist Yugoslavia. But to those patriots who lived through that period of Croatian resurgence. their freedom was an experience they shall never forget. It is tragic that the people of such an ancient and historically rich entity are unable to express their own will and choice so as to enjoy the blessings of freedom. I extend best wishes to the people of Croatia as they solemnly recall that April 1941 when their fellow countrymen were successful in proclaiming an independent Croatia. To Croatias friends in America I also extend best wishes as they observe another April and recount the glory of those few years of Croatian independence. Consumer Protection: What Johanna Wont Read",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Greater Cleveland Red Cross chapter last month began distributing Service Star decals to families of men in service. These Service Stars are to be displayed in windows of homes to show that a person from that family is serving his country. You will recall that during World War II Service Stars were a familiar sight on every street in our Nation. The idea for bringing back the Service Star resulted from a letter to the editor of the Cleveland Press by Nunzio R. Calvo. commissioner of the Soldiers Relief Commission of Cuyahoga County. Cleveland. Ohio. which was published on December 30. 1965. Mr. Calvo wrote as follows: We live in an age of symbolismeverything has a meaning. What better way could we demonstrate ourselves than to revive the custom of displaying a Star in the windows of our homes for sons or daughters who are away serving their country? Even places of business used to do this to signify that their ezhployees had left to serve. The number of men in Vietnam increases daily. This Star should be seen again as the symbol of hope. faith. and trust we place in our country and in the men who are serving it. The project was launched on March 16. 1966. with a luncheon at which time the Greater Cleveland Red Cross chapter presented Mr. Calvo With a frame that included the first Service Star decal off the press. his original letter to the editor. and the following inscription: To N. R. Calvo. commissioner of Soldiers Relief. Cuyahoga County. for his thoughtprovoking letter to the editor which Red Cross officials acted on by making Service Stars available to families without charge. Because the Cleveland Red Cross chapter is the first in the country to sponsor such a program. many eyes will be watching the success of the project. Perhaps other cities will followup on the idea. and once again the Service Star will be shown proudly in homes across the country. This is a wonderful way to display a symbol of support and confidence in our American servicemen away from home. and to share with these men and women our pride in the job they are doing for our country.

Food costs have increased so fast and with the increase in social security. taxes. etc.. it would be a real burden on us to try and absorb an increase in wages. Our payroll for 1965 amounted to $42.685. with gross sales of $149.000. My net before my wages or taxes amounted to $9.300.

This latter measure has 29 cosponsors from both sides of the -aisle. The purpose of our bill. Mr. President. is. quite briefly. to permit U.S. businessmen to take advantage of normal trade opportunities without fearing reprisals from foreign countries which attempt to interfere with this trade. It amends the Export Control Act of 1949 to prohibit domestic exporters from taking any action. including the furnishing of information or the signing of agreements. in furtherance of restrictive trade practices or boycotts imposed by foreign countries against other foreign countries friendly to the United States. At a time when our national efforts are bent to promoting international peace through the fostering of trade and commerce between nations. it becomes all the more desirable to enact legislation such as the WilliamsJavits bill to further this end.

After more than a century of Russian domination. Lithuania declared its independence on February 16. 1918. In celebrating this anniversary we give sad recognition to the fact that the independence of the brave Lithuanian people was of but short duration. For over two decades. Lithuania thrived as an independent country. guaranteeing its citizens the rights for which they had struggled so long. Much progress was made in education and social legislation. Literature. music. and the arts flourished. In 1940. this tide of progress was reversed with the beginning of a new era In Russian domination. The Soviet dictators ignored the pledge they had made 20 years earlier to renounce forever all rights to sovereignty over Lithuania. first by forcing a mutual assistance treaty upon them. then by occupying the country. and finally. by incorporating Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Many Lithuanians fled the country. To those who remained. freedom is still only a dream. I have taken the floor to voice my praise for the Lithuanian. Americans who refuse to accept the relegation of the land of their fathers. with its seven centuries of history. to the past. While hope for eventual restoration of liberty and independence may now seem dim. the prospect of liberation from communism will always remain a growing possibility as long as the people of Lithuanian ancestry remember and hold precious and dear their great heritage.

At the same time. it is a period of deep sorrow and regret for these same brave people who have suffered so much and so long under the domination of communism. The Lithuanian nation. once a kingdom in its own right. and a leader in the cultures and arts of the world for some 700 years. has just reason to be proud of its heritage and background. In marking this anniversary. we. as citizens of the free world. marvel at the faith and courage of these people who have taken enslavement and bondage with heads held high. Their firm conviction of eventual independence and return to sovereignty and selfdetermination. is indeed a lesson to us. Their actions give us further reason to assist them In attaining their goal.",

At the close of World War I. the Lithuanian people. long suppressed by czarist tyranny. were overjoyed by President Wilsons proclamation of the principle of selfdetermination for all people. On February 16. 1918. independence was proclaimed and recognition was extended by all the great powers. For 22 years this nation lived and prospered in freedom. Then came the fall of Paris in June 1940. Within a few days the Soviet Union delivered its ultimatum in keeping with the terms of the notorious MolotovRibbentrop pact of 1939. and demanded the surrender of Lithuania. From that day forward the Communists embarked upon a campaign to make Lithuania over in the Soviet image. The hallmarks of Communist oppression followed. Collectivization of the farms. religious persecution. denial of free speech. assembly. and private property. The United States openly denounced this illegal occupation and every American administration since has continued the policy of nonrecognition of the Soviet puppet regimes. I trust my Government will never alter that policy. The conquest of Lithuania is a sad but true reminder that freedom is in constant danger. So long as international communism professes world domination we must be vigilant. We join the Lithuanians in celebrating this independence day and pledge our efforts to hasten the day when freedom returns to the people of Lithuania.",

For the next 22 years the people of Lithuania progressed and prospered as their centuriesold dream of independence came true. This dream was shattered in the summer of 1940 when Lithuania was occupied by Soviet troops and soon was incorpoiated into the Soviet Union. Lithuania may have been wiped off the map as an independent nation by this act of Soviet imperialism. but it has not been wiped out of the hearts and minds of Lithuanians and friends of freedom. Today in Lithuania. there will be no tears of pride and patriotism at the sight of the Lithuanian flag. Rather. there will be tears of rage and frustration. for the flag of Lithuania is now the hammer and sickle. Lithuanians will not stand at attention and sing their national anthem. because their national anthem has been turned into a dirge for a country suppressed by Soviet tyranny. We can be sure. however. that today Lithuanians will pause. silently. and dedicate themselves anew in their neverending battle for liberty. Mr. Speaker. we need not have asked for whom the bell tolled when Lithuania lost her cherished liberty. for it tolled for freedomloving people all over the world. It tolled for America. the bastion of freedom and democracy. for whenever freemen are enslaved. no American can be completely at rest. We would be remiss in our responsibilities as the leaders of the free world if we did not do all we can to honor and to support the resolve of the brave people of Lithuania.

Despite repeated invasion and occupation. Lithuania developed rich customs and a strong sense of national identity. That identity was acknowledged by the framers of the Versailles Treaty led by Woodrow Wilson. On February 16. 1918. Lithuania became an independent state. The League of Nations was commissioned to be the guarantor of national selfdetermination for a people so often oppressed by foreign powers. Yet after only 22 years. Lithuania lost its cherished independence to the Soviet Union. Now. as. has been the case for most of Lithuanian history. the country is occupied. ruled from abroad. and denied its freedom. There are strong reasons why America should champion the cause of Lithuania. During the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. many Lithuanians sought the dream of American life and emigrated to this country. Their contribution to the United States was and continues to be substantial. And though all citizens of Lithuanian background are fully assimilated into our ways. their customs still thrive as a reminder of this countrys rich immigrant legacy. So it is with many other countries now behind the Iron Curtain. Our commitment to Lithuania may thus symbolize our refusal to accept an Eastern Europe in bondage. On this day celebrating Lithuanian independency. we should renew that commitment.",

Fortyseven years ago a proud and independent Lithuania gained freedom from foreign domination when her larger neighbors collapsed in World War I. The Lithuanians natural desire for a sense of national identity and independence had never died in the more than 400year period that the tiny nation had been absorbed. first by Poland. then by Russia. Enlightened Lithuanian leaders established a progressive constitutional democracy. But the new state could not avoid the great power ambitions that kept Europe in a constant state of turmoil during the period between the two wars. The seeds of democracy fell into troubled soil. The czarist grip that had been broken in 1917 was only to be replaced 23 years later by a far more potent form of tyranny. The Communists. true to their hatred of independence. absorbed Lithuania into the Soviet Union after making a cynical pact with the Nazis. Next followed a period of Nazi tyranny. followed again by Soviet oppression.

In the first place. we must never forget that Lithuania was once a free and independent nationstate. and. secondly. that Lithuania has been the victim of brutal Communist aggression. From 1918 to 1940 Lithuania enjoyed the international status of an independent nationstate. world powers. great and small. recognized Lithuania and carried on normal diplomatic relations with her. Lithuanian statesmen. actively participating in international relations. concluded diplomatic engagements with many nations of the world. Lithuania. moreover. played a part of some importance in advancing the cause of world peace by its work as a member of the League of Nations and as a member of other international organizations devoted to the purposes of peace. On the domestic scene. Lithuanians built a strong and vigorous economic and social order. In cultural achievements they made many significant advances. and in the religious realm. all Lithuanians were free to seek in their own way their religious destiny. However. Lithuanian independence came to an end in June 1940. when the Soviet Union dispatched its army across the borders. occupied the country. and annexed it to the U.S.S.R. That the Soviet Union was guilty of aggression is unquestioned. By their unwarranted and brutal military invasion. the Soviets had willfully destroyed every contractual engagement concluded between the U.S.S.R. and Lithuania. It is significant to note that in all of these political engagements. the Soviet Union acknowledged and reaffirmed the national independence and territorial integrity of Lithuania. With utter disregard of their pledged word. the Soviets destroyed the Lithuanian Republic. On this 47th anniversary of Lithuanian independence. the free world is reminded once again of the great misfortune that has befallen these people. This anniversary should be a reminder to all free peoples of Communist treachery. especially now when observers generally hold that a detente has been established in SovietAmerican relations. To Lithuanians everywhere. America extends its warmest felicitations. and along with other nations of the free world. expresses the hope that the Communist tyranny they now endure will. in the course of time. dissolve. and the spirit of Lithuania once again be free.",

During the hearings. each member of the committee has been given complete discretion as to the amount of time devoted to questions. Of course. they must be asked in order. but there has never been any cutting off of questions. The chairman has patiently sat through the long explanations sometimes offered. which I am sure he had heard many times before. in an effort to make it clear to all members of the committee and all persons viewing the hearings that this is a fairly operated committee. During the deliberationswhich were long. tedious. and most controversial. as is bound to be the case with an omnibus farm billeach member of the committee was given ample opportunity to set forth his views.

The Agriculture Committee deals with an industry which is forgotten at times. but which is the largest industry in the United States. and basically the most essential. because it provides the food and clothing for the people. I have known. from experience in other countries. the problems a country faces when it cannot feed and clothe its people. America should be very proud that it does feed and clothe its people. and also the people of many other countries. So the Senate Agriculture Committee is a great and important committee. I am glad to be a member of it also because agriculture is the greatest single industry in my own State. as It is in other States. Perhaps we may gain some satisfaction from the knowledge that while the farm problem Is difficult and at times may seem impossible of permanent solution. and may not be very clearly understood by most of our people. we on the Agriculture Committee may know something more about the problem than others.

A few days ago. I estimated the number of hours that the committee had spent in executive session discussing this bill. I think It was almost 50 hours.

We have been fortunate indeed. I am sure the Senate is not. at this time. planning to enact permanent farm legislation. There is no such thing as permanent farm legislation. because the agricultural situation changes so fast that no program can be permanent. I know that in respect to certain commodities. we are in difficulty. I do not agree that we have large surpluses in this country. I would confine our surplus list to cotton and tobacco. and tobacco has already been legislated upon this year. We hope that. in conjunction with the House of Representatives. legislation may be devised which will work. Should it be legislation I disagree with. I will still try to help make it work. though I may be on the losing end with respect to some of it. I do not yet know whether I shall be or not. I assume that perhaps I shall be before we are through. Great tolerance has been exhibited by all members of the Agriculture Committee. They do not tear their hair when they find themselves on the losing end of a vote. neither do they try to tear their opponents hair. Much of this tolerance has been due to the patience shown by the chairman of the committee. So we are very fortunate. as I have already told the committee. Speaking of permanent farm legislation.

One is the group of small farmers whose acreage is so small that they do not dare to cut back their acreage if they wish to provide a decent living for themselves and their families.

It seems to me that if our production now is less than the amount we sell. at. least this year or next year. we might be able to reduce our surplus to normalcy.

I read with some concern of the increase in the use of beef wheat which has been occurring. During the 196064 base period. the average quantity of beef wheat was 41 million bushels a year. Last year it was 72 million bushels. It is estimated that it will increase to 95 million bushels this year.

The same thing occurs when corn allotments are reduced. It reduces corn production. It is my hope that the Secretary will do the very thing the Senator is suggesting. As I recall. this exchange was made more or less to give advantage to the farmers of the Northwest who grow much wheat. It was too expensive then for them to feed that wheat to cattle. They had to get corn and milo. They could not even grow milo maize. as I understand. At first the plan was to try to assist in that area. but it has been expanded until now it is used for practically all the Wheat Belt as well as the Northwest. If there are no further questions on feed grains. I turn now to title III. dealing with rice. I wish to say that the Senate committee also deleted the rice title. just as the House committee did. It struck it from the administration bill. Of course. there were a number of reasons why the title was stricken. One was that in effect. there was a curtailment of acreage from 1.6 million base acres to about 1.350 million acres. The rice farmers could not stand that cut from the minimum acreage provided by law. Another reason advanced was that the ricegrowers would be paid for their crop. more or less. by raising the price of rice to the consumer. There was a fairly good overall case made to the effect that it would not cost the average consumer more than 5 or 6 cents a year. but when the committee examined the witnesses who came to testify. it was shown that the consumption of rice in Puerto Rico. for example. was not 8 pounds per capita. but 102 pounds.

It is encouraging because it shows how much can be accomplished within the framework of a carefully balanced economic policy. It is challenging because it points the way we must go if that policy is to continue to be effective. We are now in the 61st month of the longest. continuous period of prosperity in Americas peacetime history. Only the period of expansion during World War II exceeds it. Profits are up. wages are up. employment is up. and sales are up. And the best news of all is the announcement that February saw our unemployment rate drop to 3.7 percent of our workforcethe lowest in more than 12 years. What this means is that more Americans are enjoying more of the fruits of their labors than ever before. But President Johnson was quite correct in pointing out that there is still much that remains to be done. Unemployment among Negroes and teenagers is still a national problem. Troublesome \"pockets of unemployment\" still remain in depressed areas of the Nation. Too many skilled Jobs remain unfilled for lack of trained manpower while untrained workers remain on our unemployment rolls. What is President Johnsons answer to these problems? Training and planning. We must look to the decades of the 1970s and 1980s. We must determinenowwhat our manpower requirements are going to be and then we must begin the task of training our workers. particularly our young workers. in the skills that those requirements demand. We can sustain our great prosperity. The record of the past 6 years proves that we can. But we will not sustain it by sitting on our hands. What Is needed is a wellcoordinated and wellplanned program from the national level down through the community level. And that program must begin with this session of Congress.",

A nation preserves the memory of its past by its anniversaries. its stamps and coins. its symbolic places and its patriotic observances.

Students hard at work in the countrys schools would be given renewed energy in their history classes by the ideals and activities of American History Month.

There is no doubt we must remodel our entire law enforcement structure and this message provides a blueprint. a real beginning for these endeavors. I have no quarrel with the quality of our law enforcement. both Federal and State. but I want to see both improved and I want our society to be remembered as that era when man seriously attempted to alter traditional notions of crime and attempted to lessen it. Our goal is not only the victims of crime but as the President said we must prevent and deter those in our society who have not yet begun a life of crime. We cannot waste those natural and Irreplaceable resources. To this end. the President will have my wholehearted support on the measures he has spelled out. I firmly believe that policemen should have higher salaries and opportunities for better education. Modern science should be brought to the police station. I am pleased there is study on the use of computers to more effectively deploy forces to fight crime and that the most modern uptodate communications methods will be employed by the police. The President is right when he says that the District of Columbia should employ these techniques and be a model for the Nation. and I want to support that desire to make it such a model. But science. education. and salaries are clearly not the only answer to effective crime enforcement. The President recognized this and included in his message those statutory tools which are essential to give the policeman a better opportunity to control crime. It is of the utmost importance that we quickly enact legislation to regulate the interstate transportation of dangerous firearms. We are all aware of the havoc that can be wrought by the free use of such firearms. The legislation proposed by the President adequately protects the constitutional right of a citizen to bear arms and yet effectively provides a tool to protect society as a whole. We must not delay such legislation any longer. It is absolutely essential if the States are to provide effective and meaningful gun control regulation.",

I agree with the President that all the institutions of society must join together to control and then attempt to diminish the incidence of crime. It is essential that Federal. State. and local law enforcement agencies cooperate together at all levels. I was particularly pleased with the Presidents recommendations and report on the Law Enforcement Assistance Act. I supported the act when it was sponsored by the President. and its work to date has confirmed my trust in the act. As the President said. the modernization of police work and the framework of criminal justice is long overdue. It is urgent that society continue and expand upon this effort. The Law Enforcement Assistance Act has been an important contribution in this area. It is subsidizing excellent programs to improve the quality and efficiency of police work and. in addition. providing a basis for the development of many experimental programs for use in the fight against crime. The presence of the act has provided a stimulus for new ideas that were not even thought of a few short years ago. No extensive fight on crime can succeed without the \"daytoday work\" that must be done by the \"cop on the beat.\" The Law Enforcement Assistance Acts prime concern is that end. For that reason. I do not hesitate to agree with and wholeheartedly support the Presidents request for the additional appropriations. In addition. I am very pleased by the program to send police officers to school and provide for a law enforcement program under the National Defense Education Act. In the context of a complex society. our police officials must be well educated. They must be familiar with all the latest techniques in psychology. race relations. and science. The decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court within the last years have set forth high standards for our law enforcement officials. And I am in agreement with the President that we must provide the means for the police to meet these requirements. The Presidents message is a good one. and it will have my support.",

Despite an intensification of the Federal attack on this business in recent years. racketeers continue to thrive on a base of human suffering and moral corrosion.

The gambler operating a fixed roulette wheel. the narcotics peddler trading on the misery of the poor. the racketeer engaged in extortion. prostitution. corrupt labor relations. and bootleggingall these are wellknown predators. Yet the enormous amounts of money involved in these activities tell only part of the story of the rackets financial interests.

Evidence concerning the sinister. clandestine operations of this multimilliondollar business is particularly hard to uncover because of the uncivilized meansmurder and torture includedused to enforce the racketeer.s code of silence. The immunity legislation which the President proposes would be an effective tool for obtaining information vital to the prosecution of key rackets figures. to the war on organized crime and to the national welfare. As the President has pointed out. the immunity provision is already available for use in laws covering several crimes. It is important that the provision be extended to racketeering cases.

As has been stated on the floor today. the Departments action in opening the gates to more foreign sugar for the benefit ofa few Northeast States has driven down the raw sugar price to 12 cents below the target set by Congress without reducing the price of refined sugar in the Northeast.

Indeed. a case can be made that this action has pushed the price well below this target level. working a particular hardship in middle western and western sugarbeet growers. whose market has been depressed. I believe the target price which the Sugar Act authorizes should be reached to help growers whose costs are increasing at every turn. As one who has long been interested in a restrained and careful policy for the disposition of Commodity Credit stocks in grain so as to allow grain producers the full benefit of market demand. in just this same vein.

I want to join many other colleagues here in the House today in protesting the Department of Agricultures lifting of all restrictions on the importation of raw sugar during the first quarter of this year. It is my feeling that sugar beet growers and refiners in Minnesota. the entire Midwest. and the West may very well suffer from abnormally depressed prices. because the USDA thought sugar prices were getting too high. particularly in the Northeast. Almost all this foreign sugar after refining will eventually wind up in the Northeast market. where base prices are more than $1 a hundredweight above the base prices west of Chicago. But the alarming fact is that the USDA action taken to reduce inflated sugar prices in the Northeast has not dropped prices there by so much as a penny. but raw sugar prices have been driven to 12 cents below the target set by Congress in the Sugar Act. Since the raw sugar price underpins the entire price structure for beet and cane growers and refiners in the United States. this precipitate action by the Government may very well hurt those presently getting the least for sugar. Mr. Speaker. most of us from the Midwest know that domestic sugar beet growers and refiners in our area have long had a depressed market. They have been just starting to narrow the price gap between Midwest and east coast prices. but this USDA action seems likely to prevent such a happening.

It was never the intent of the National Football League. nor of the American Football League. to seek any type of immunity. except that of throwing the cloak of immunity around the league merger itself. Mr. Speaker. it is my feeling that professional football is fortunate in having the leadership it has in Commissioner Rozelle.

Mr. Speaker. I believe all of us who are Members of the House of Representatives who are interested in sports. and sport spectators and football players throughout America. can trust the Commissioner to protect the public and players alike. The conference report is clear on the intent and purpose of this proposal. I quote from it: The amendment to the act of September 30. 1961. would not extend to the combined league any greater antitrust immunity than that now existing for the existing professional football leagues. The amendment does not seek to resolve any of the antitrust problems of professional football or the other professional team sports. It is the intent of the conferees. both on the part of the House and of the Senate. that the new league will commence operations with no greater antitrust immunity than the existing individual leagues now enjoy. The sole effect of this amendment to the act of September 30. 1961. is to permit the combination of the two leagues to go forward without fear of antitrust challenge based upon a joint agreement between the member clubs of two leagues to combine in a single league and to conduct their affairs as members of a single league.

I rise to speak in support of the amendment to H.R. 17607 which will permit the American Football League and the National Football League to merge into a single professional football league. I regret that this matter must be brought up in this form. I certainly would have preferred that we follow the orderly procedure of taking up a bill reported from the Judiciary Committee. which has been considering such legislation. However. the limited time remaining to us in this session has precluded completion of committee action. This is. however. a good bill and prompt action on it is essential in the public interest. The purpose of the bill is simply to permit the two professional football leagues to merge into a highly desirable expanded league without risking antitrust suits. Without this legislation the leagues are reluctant to go ahead in view of the serious uncertainties arising from our antitrust laws. In the absence of legislation they would face a prospect of prolonged and complex litigation. The Senate report clearly states the limited effect of this measure. as not extending \"to the combined league any greater antitrust immunity than that now existing for the existing professional football leagues. The proposed legislar tion does not seek to resolve any of the antitrust problems of professional football or the other professional team sports.\" The great need for this legislation has been most effectively presented to the Judiciary Committee by the commissioner of the National Football League. Certainly the reaction of the public and the press that has come to my attention has been overwhelmingly favorable. Arthur Daley. the veteran sports columnist of the New York Times. summed up the matter very well with the words: Everyone presently involved will benefitowners. coaches. team members. and fans ....

Mr. Paulucci. founder and president of Chun King Corp.. worlds larger producer of packaged Chinese foods. in addition to his wideranging business interests and civic activities. has given outstanding leadership to our programs of economic dedevolpment.

But Jeno Paulucci said \"no\" to the pessimists. and with the boundless energy and enthusiasm typical of his whole career. became the driving force that set in motion a new spirit of optimism. a new cooperative action for progress. a bold new venture laying the groundwork for the brightest economic future the area has ever known.

Northeastern Minnesota is now well on its way to a longterm future of solid. stable. healthy economic growth.

Moreover. the proposals placed before the United Nations by Ambassador Arthur Goldberg acting on behalf of the President of the United States open other possible approaches.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to call attention to a bill that was passed yesterday with relation to the return of certain German paintings. I initially objected to the passage of this bill because of my concern for the solvency of the war claims fund. These paintings were vested by the U.S. Government as German property. All such enemy property Is eventually sold with the proceeds going to the war claims fund. This fund. in turn Is used to pay the claims of American nationals against the Nazi government of Germany. The fund now totals $235 million and is expected eventually to be $285 million. Claims which have been filed by small businesseswhich have prioritytotal $146.736.569.33. In addition. there remain unsatisfied. the claims of 6.540 individuals and nonprofit corporations. In light of these figures. it seemed inappropriate to return this propertyworth probably $1 millionwhich would result in a depletion of the fund and a proportionate reduction in the claims paid. On the equities. it appears that these paintings were not per se \"Nazi\" property or stolen from others. but that these werepaintings stolen from a museum in what is now Communist East Germany in the 1920s. before the Nazis came to power. and somehow found their way into the hands of an American. It is my understanding also that the President will present these paintings to Dr. Erhard while he is in this country on a state visit this week and that this presentation is of importance to GermanAmerican relations at this time. particularly in light of circumstances within the NATO alliance. Because the Department was persuasive in arguing for the passage of this bill for these reasons. I removed my objections and support passage at this time.",

Section 13 on page 12 achieves virtually everything which the 67 cosponsors of the school milk bill which I introduced wanted to achieve. It does it in almost precisely the same way we wanted itthat is. at the $110 million in 1967. $115 million in 1968. and $120 million therefrom level. I want to reaffirm what I think other Senators strongly feel. namely. that the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry was wise in doing Its best to maintain the program in the same way it has in the past. and not to have a program for the needy or a welfare program but a program for all the children of America. I think it is a program which will reach the needy much more effectively and on a much more widespread basis than if we had concentrated on a means test. as had been proposed. This Is a fine bill. It saves a school milk program that would otherwise have suffered an 80percent reduction. Again. I thank the Senator from Louisiana and congratulate him and express my gratitude to him.",

I believe the record shows that it was not supposed to take care only of those children. but was also to be addressed to a much larger number of children.

I know that the problem of administering a lunch program in such school districts is often very difficult. It is difficult in my own State. particularly in the eastern part. the section where I live.

If the United States is to wage a major .r in Vietnam. then that matter cer.nly falls within the responsibility of ngress and ought to be thoroughly red in congressional hearings and dete. Recent reports that American oops in Vietnam are in fact taking on active combat role rather than servg as advisers raise serious new questions that need to be fully understood and discussed by the Senate. Mr. President. the unfortunate nature of combat in South Vietnam is well illustrated by news reports of recent fighting between the Vietcong and Government forces. An estimated 800 men of the South Vietnamese Government forces are either dead or missing as a result of last weeks combat. The other side of the coin is that American jet bombers which participated in the increased fighting took a heavy toll of village life. It is estimated that three out of four patients seeking treatment in a Vietnamese hospital after the American raids were village women burned by napalm jellied gasoline bombs. This is the kind of unfortunate byproduct of our involvement in this war. Mr. President. that makes it so hard for us to win the confidence of the Vietnamese people. How can we expect to win the support of villagers whose wives and children are burned by our napalm attacks? And how can the Government forces which we are attempting to sustain suffer weekly losses of as high as 800 men and expect to turn the war favorably to their side? For the various reasons I have outlined. I shall support the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon.",

It assures it. I am for the expenditure of the funds for economic aid. My amendment would merely prevent the addition of $89 million more to the foreign aid bill. As the Senator from New Hampshire has said. if the time comes when the President needs more money for military aid for Vietnam. and he makes his case. he will get it. But I quite agree with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from New Hampshire that it is not necessary to provide the $89 million this afternoon to accomplish the economic purpose the President has in mind. My amendment would accomplish that for him.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I shall give the Senator from Pennsylvania an opportunity to vote for a greater cut in military aid than the figure of last year. That figure is merely a gesture. I want the Senator from Pennsylvania to know that he does not disagree with me. although he may try to talk himself into a disagreement on economic aid. I hope that the Senator from Pennsylvania does not believe that the only possible place to make a cut in the bill Is in military aid. When we make other cuts in the aid program. we cut military aid very effectively. Some of the technical assistance is concealed military aid. The amount involved here is merely $89 million. However. the important thing is that I am supporting the program of the President for $89 million for economic aid. The Senator from Pennsylvania is quite right. I stated my case in chief this afternoon. That is only the beginning. As the Senator from Alaska and I pointed out. we would probably be giving aid to the extent of $1 billion over the course of years. We cannot do it overnight. However. we would be engaged in a great deal of waste if we were to extend this aid and. at the same time. kill people with napalm bombs in North and South Vietnam. We would be destroying a lot of the aid in the progress of making war. We had better get the war settled first. I have a little difficulty with the paradox of pouring $89 million of aid into a country and. at the same time. destroying $89 million worth of property.",

I intend to offer an amendment which was approved by the Committee on Foreign Relations by a vote of 13 to 4 this morning. The amendment I intend to offer is essentially the administration proposal. I do not like to eliminate the aid by such a procedure. I believe that the way to deal with the measure is to vote the amendment down and then have the Senate vote as it pleases on the program. I am sure that there will be many opportunities for the Senate to cut the amount. as the senior Senator from Oregon has stated. in any part of the bill. I believe that it would be a mistake to do this. I believe that we should have a straight vote on the measure. I hope the amendment is rejected. I shall. immediately after the vote. offer the proposal of the President and get a vote on that. Then many other amendments may be offered. I see no reason to mix the two elements together.",

It is commonsense that if the war takes a better turn. if some reasonable peaceful settlement can be achieved in the reasonable futureand I do not mean next week. but in the course of the yearsand the war does not degenerate into an allout war. we could be of further assistance to the area. There is no question about that. The President made that clear in his Baltimore speech. and in his statement here. We have made it clear in other countries. Consider what was done in Koreafar more than is contemplated in this amendment. It is clear we will help these people reconstitute and reconstruct their country. but this is not a commitment to do so. The facts of life would indicate that we are bound to do so. especially if we can achieve some kind of truce or peace in the area. So long as the war is continuing as It is. what we can do in this respect will be limited because the opportunities are limited. If It is possible to achieve a cessation of the struggle. I believe that this kind of activity would step up. and everyone would like to see that. We are spending $2 billion a year now. Why would it not be a bargain. if we could prevent any kind of expansion of the war. so that we could do something in the economic field. which would be less expensive than in the military field. This would be a small part of what we are spending now to prosecute the war. That is on a small scale compared to what it could be. My personal interest in this matter is that it could have an important influence upon the course of the war itself. It could well have an influence upon the Vletcong and the people of South Vietnam. Heavens knows. I still believe that It is worthwhile to prevent an allout war. It would be better to try to find a basis for a truce and a settlement. These are things we cannot prove on a sliderule. It is a matter of the psychology of the area. This is not only the opinion of the President but also the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Relations.",
