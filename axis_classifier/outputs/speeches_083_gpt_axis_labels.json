He then proceeds to outline the different phases of these expenditures which are calculated to take the place of the Marshall plan. the ECA. and other appropriations. He says in a later paragraph: Even the United States labor groups have a motive for opposing offshore purchasing. One of the selling points on the program has been the claim that labor costs in Europe are about onethird of what they are in the United States. With labor costs the biggest chunk of production costs it makes the end product considerably cheaper if purchased in Europe. the argument goes.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I obtained figures this morning which show that the Federal Government collected during calendar 1952 almost $1.000.000.000 from American motorists from Federal gasoline. diesel fuel. and lubricating oil taxes. Of this huge sum only about $550.000.000. or 50 cents of each dollar collected from motor fuel taxes. was used for highway construction. More than half a billion dollars of these revenues were diverted to other purposes than road building. This diversion of gasoline and diesel oil taxes to other than road building purposes should be stopped. More Americans are slain each year on our highways by automobiles than are killed in Korea by enemy bullets. The casualty lists of those maimed and crippled on our streets and highways are longer than those of our battlefield wounded. Everyone knows that the most effective preventative of death on our highways is better roads. Yet. despite this knowledge. our highway building program appropriations during the past 6 years has remained almost stationary despite the fact that our Federal revenues from highway users in that period have doubled. With more than 53.000.000 cars already crowding our Nations streets and highways. an increase of 21.000.000 cars over 1940. our roads are wearing out faster than they are being rebuilt. according to Commissioner MacDonald. of the Bureau of Public Roads. This trend must. in the interest of safety. be changed. The American people will pay for these better roads whether they obtain them to ride on or not. If the roads are constructed no one can dispute that the taxpayers will pay for them. If they are not built the taxpayers will pay for them just the same in the form of increased doctor. hospital. and repair bills. in increased maintenance and operating costs on their cars. and in higher automobile insurance rates.",

Mr. Russell. for making a study of the problem in an effort to find a solution. The House parking lot is usually crowded to overflowing. This is especially true when the House is in session. The only answer to that problem is more parking facilities. It seems to me that it would be advisable to consider underground parking or perhaps a threestory structure on the House lot. Two stories could be above ground. The grade at the lot would permit an underground drivein at street level from Delaware Avenue. On South Capitol Street the second floor could be reached by a drivein at street level with a ramp leading to the top floor. That would triple the parking space at the New House lot. twothirds of which would be indoors. The traffic and parking situation is a difficult one everywhere here in Washington. as it is throughout the Nation. There are many things that recent Democratic administrations have been charged with unjustly. but they cannot escape blame for growing parking and and traffic problems. The increasing number of automobiles is the best evidence of the high living standards that people have won over the New Deal years. Seriously. a threestory structure on the present House lot would cost less than buying land. It would be more convenient for House Members. and would be a practical approach to cleaning up this mess.",

It has been my privilege to study the subject of trade with China and the Communist bloc for a long time. A vast network of controls exists now which should be reviewed and analyzed carefully before taking further action. Many rumors about shipments of all kinds of materials to Red China are floating around. We know that trade of a certain nature is carried on by water. as well as the regular overland routes of exchange between China and our Allies. China is a very large nation and borders many strange lands in Asia. Russia and the Soviet bloc of course have access to China both by water and land. After studying a large number of factors involved in trade with Red China. I think it would be entirely feasible and practical to take an intermediary step as a basis for future action. This intermediary step might be called operation spotlight which would give us a perfectly legitimate basis for seeing just how present controls are operating. just what is going to China and from whom and in what quantities while simultaneously we step up our negotiations with our Allies to get better international agreements bylateraliy and multilaterally. Operation spotlight could be a very comprehensive check by United States Naval Forces under the United Nations delegated authority of just how the embargo provisions of the Battle Act.

He was a man of great knowledge and high ability. He was a kindly man and never knowingly did an injustice to anyone. Even in the midst of debate. he never permitted his partisanship to. do an injustice to his opponent. To those who were privileged to enjoy his trust and friendship he gave a loyalty that was impressive. For years Mr. Woodruff was a member of the Republican policy committee and presided with skill and fairness as chairman of the Republican conference. Although in recent years a stouthearted fighter for Republicanism. he entered Congress in the Sixtythird Congress as a member of the Progressive or socalled Bull Moose Party. A veteran of the Spanish War. he was a follower of the colorful Teddy Roosevelt and won the election on his ticket in 1912. In the readjustment which followed In the next 2 years he was offered the Republican nomination. but preferred to be a candidate on the Progressive ticket. He was defeated. as he knew he would be. but it was characteristic of Roy Woodruff. He would not falter in the carrying out of his convictions. Four years later he returned as a Republican and continuously served thereafter. In recent years his health has been poor. and finally he concluded. much to the regret of his legion of friends. not to stand for reelection. During all his congressional career his devotion to his good wife and her devotion to him was touching.

Our intense desire and determination is to support the continuation of Americanism. to preserve democracy for the sons and daughters of this country. and offer it to any and all who seek Its better way of life. If there be among us any who would seek to degrade. overthrow. or destroy our Government. let him be accused. given a fair trial. and proved guilty or innocent. and punished or freed. But I say to you let there be employed much care and caution when an accusation is made. Let us be sure we are right. Communist. spy. traitor. These are strong words. destructive words. malignant words. words not to be hurled freely and promiscuously. To accuse an innocent person of a crime so hideous as that of being a foreign spy or traitor to ones government just because that particular person happens to be a political enemy. a business enemy. or a social enemy. is to employ the handiwork of the Devil. During this Easter season our thoughts are with our dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ as He faced the greatest sacrifice since the beginning of time. and we are reminded of the accusations that were flung at Him. and the cry. \"Crucify Him.\" still rings In our ears. Let us not in our lack of foresight point our fingers at anyone and accuse him of wrongdoing until we have positive proof our accusations are true and in the interest of goodness and justice. My colleagues. I ask you to join with me In the search of our consciences. seek Divine guidance. and proceed with great caution to legislate. investigate. and navigate this beloved Ship of State into the peaceful waters of trust. brotherhood. and truth. We have one of the most efficient and best trained investigators in the world in the FBI. I feel that all matters such as these should be turned over to them.

Your organization is richly deserving of great. credit in helping to foster the esprit de corps for which the naval service is so justly famed. The Fleet Reserve was devised as a means of assuring the Navy of a nucleus of mature. trained and Navywise personnel who would be immediately available for active service in the event of emergency. Such an emergency has in part recently been successfully surmountedthanks in no small measure to the unselfish service performed by you here and many others just like you. As members of the Fleet Reserve Association I know you all maintain an active interest in all matters pertaining to naval personnel. both officers and enlisted. I should like to discuss some of those topics which I believe may be of interest to you and to include such forecasts and policy statements as may be pertinent.

This is a matter of grave concern to the entire Nation. One of the most complete studies of this problem ever made was done very recently by Mr. B. L. Krebs. distinguished staff writer for the New Orleans TimesPicayune. In order that the Members of Congress may be informed. I am including his masterful series in the RECORD: (By B. L. Krebs) People have been saying for the past 50 years or more that some day the Mississippi River might desert New Orleans and take a new and shorter route to the gulf by way of the Atchafalaya River past Morgan City. The United States Army Engineers. through the Mississippi River Commission. now affirm that the Mississippi River not only may but positively will be captured By the Atchafalaya unless man steps in to prevent it. And this will inevitably happen within the lifetime of threefourths of the people now living below Old Riverunless the threatened calamity is prevented by the expenditure of anywhere from $50 million to $100 million on control works at the entrance of Old River. Old River. the present connecting link between the Mississippi and the Atchafalaya Rivers. is a 6mile section of an old bend of the Mississippi. Its eastern end leads out of the Mississippi opposite the State penitentiary at Angola. 120 miles by airline northwest of New Orleans. and 217 miles by the winding main river. At the western end of the 6mile stretch. Red River comes in from the north. and the Atchafalaya River goes out to the south.",

About the year 1500 the first condition favorable to a new change in course was established by the Mississippi. It kept pushing its Turnbull Island Bend. in the vicinity of Angola. steadily westward until finally it caved into an old abandoned course of Bayou Des Glaises. which the main river itself had occupied in its wanderings of many centuries before.

Advance warning of its coming can be read. for instance. on the shore of Cheniere au Tigre. 50 miles west of the mouth of the Atchafalaya. Like the ominous surf under a clear sky that signals the approach of the still distant hurricane. extensive mudfilats already blanket the beaches of the former resort. giving grim notice of the day when the entire silt load of the Mississippi may be poired down the Atchafalaya and out into the waters of Atchafalaya Bay and the Gulf. More leisurely than the storm. the Mississippi is taking its own time. But while the hurricane may veer in its course at the last hour. the Mississippi is inexorably on its way to take over the Atchafalaya unless man intervenes in the next few years. At present slightly less than a third of the water brought to the latitude of Old River by the Mississippi. the Red. and the Black is flowing down the Atchafalaya. and threefourths of the sediment it carries is being dumped below the end of the Atchafalaya levees. and in Grand and Six Mile Lakes.",

We have reason to believe that a move Is pending in the Boston Post Office which will result in the elimination of the remittance section of the postal finance with a consequent loss of day assignments by some 15 clerks as well as a possible reductioninforce in the Boston postal district. We desire our congressional representatives to be informed that these disturbing changes are made without prior consultation with our national officers in the Government and Civic Employees Organizing Committee in Washington. We feel that this policy of effecting financial work transfers without prior consultation of our organization spokesmen makes for poor labor relations in the post office and is detrimental to our members.

The Treasury analysis has already progressed to the point where I can say that I will include a .ecommendation for a reduction in the dmissions tax in my proposals for a modified system of excise taxation.

I read the Presidents tax recommendations in his budget message to the Congress. and what did I find he had to say about \"a modified system of excise taxation\"? Nothing but a recommendation that the excise taxes which are scheduled under present law to be reduced on April 1 be continued indefinitely at the present rate. and \"that any adjustments in the other excise taxes be such as to maintain the total yield which we are now receiving from this source.\" If this constitutes specific proposals for a modified system of excise taxation. it seems to me that the field is wide open.

As everyone knows. the Federal Government finds its necessary from time to time to acquire private lands. Examples are for floodcontrol projects. reclamation work. military purposes. and power transmission lines. Under present law owners of land taken for such purposes are compensated in cash. Congressman ELLSWORTH. of Oregon. would change this by House bill 4646. His proposed bill would order a Federal agency acquiring private timberland to replace that timberland from Federal holdings when the private land is alleged to be a part of a sustained yield timber operation. - 1 This specialprivilege legislation obviously is aimed at our national forests. because most of the valuable timber now held by the Federal Government is in these forests. However. as the bill comes to the floor there is nothing in it to prevent selection of timberland from national parks. national monuments. wilderness areas. or from vital and valuable watersheds. Mr. ELLSWORTH has said that he will offer an amendment to restore a prohibition against making land from the national parks and like areas subject to the provisions of the act. That this is specialinterest legislation is readily apparent. It gives special consideration to timberland owners and to them alone. The man whose farm is taken doesnt get lieu land. he must accept the cash payment and move. Further. it is specialinterest legislation for big timberland owners. Regardless of how good forestry small operators practice. few if any of them can be said to be on a sustained yield. which requires substantially equal cuts each year. Land chosen under this legislation might well destroy a nationalforest management plan for a unit aimed to support a community or several mills. In the October issue of Frontier magazine. Richard L.

Many of our urban problems originate from our faulty techniques in the development and use of urban real estate. Years ago approximately 73 percent or more of our people lived on farms. The most pressing economic problems of the day grew out of the utilization of farm lands. Very properly the need for research and the discovery and application of basic principles was recognized by the Federal Government and a Department of Agriculture was created with a Secretary of Agriculture assigned to the Presidents Cabinet. Agricultural colleges were founded throughout the country. Agricultural improvement in research stations were founded every year. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in research and educational activities for our citizens who have vital personal interests in the efficient utiliza.tion of farm lands. At the present time I am told that less than 25 percent of our people live on farms. Our most pressing and vital social and economic problems today originate in the cities. There has been no consistent research done to discover how best to \"cultivate\" urban lands so as to produce maximum yields in monetary terms and amenities. There have been innumerable halfhearted attempts at the fringe of the problem as evidenced by the various building codes. zoning laws. neighborhood rehabilitation programs and many other such ideas but the science of urban land economics remains in a nebulous state. In the meantime we are appalled by the slum conditions. decentralization movements and other phenomena which we do not really fully understand or appreciate. I am sure that we have in this country enough sound and able thinkers to develop urbiculture to a point where it can be as serviceable to owners and utilizers of urban property as the science of agriculture has been to the owners and users of agricultural property.

A number of Congressmen. and the Under Secretary of the Interior Department. along with a staff of experts. have already done so. For the most part. these men who have made a thorough investigation. including a visit to Dinosaur National Monument. are the men whose previous opposition or indifference has changed to solid support of Echo Park. The recommendation that Congressmen look into the situation carefully is certainly sounder than Mrs. Roosevelts original recommendation that all of her readers immediately write their Congressmen in blind opposition to Echo Park. As to Mrs. Roosevelts desire not to be unfair to any State. it might be suggested that her letter to this newspaper is hardly sufficient to remedy the damage done the cause of the Echo project by her first article. In all fairness her reconsidered attitude should be given the full circulation of her syndicated column. for all her readers to see and understand.

We heard glowing promises about how the problem was going to be solved by the Departments new emphasis on foreign outlets. We have the results to compare with the promises. I believe much more can and should be done in the foreign fieldmuch more than the Department has done or is doing. But I believe first of all we must explore new outlets at home. among our own people. We must seek to get the food needed to people who cannot afford to buy it. We must make food distribution part of our farm program to assure outlets for the abundance we are capable of producing. and the abundance that we will need in years to come. No one. contends that a permanent answer to the farm problem is giving away food. This is a temporary situation. Our growing population itself will use up all the food we can produce if we keep our economy prosperous and expanding. But we need action now. and this Is the kind of action that will help. We need this fooddistribution program not just for the sake of farmers. but for the sake of the aged. the needy children. the disabled.

Education. and Welfare concerning the GeorgeBarden appropriations for vocational education: Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to ap* pear here today in order to give the facts concerning my State of Missouri in relation to appropriations that are necessary for the continued work of vocational education. Following are some of the facts which I \" should like to call to your attention: 1. The 2year drought has reduced the income of people in rural Missouri and for this reason it is difficult for them to pay additional school taxes. 2. Because the Governor vetoed a supplementary appropriation of $91/2 million for the schools. State funds to operate school programs are already critically short. If Federal funds are curtailed. this will make the general school situation even worse. 3. The program of reorganization of school districts. leading to larger school service areas and hence better school facilities for all the children. is continuing in the State at a rapid rate. About the first demand which a reorganized district makes on the State Department of Education Is for the allocation of State and Federal funds for vocational programs. In an effort to comply with these requests. reimbursements to local schools have been progressively reduced over the years. resulting in the reduction of teachers salaries and the loss of vocational teachers. 4. Each year finds a larger number of youth in our public schools and one of their chief interests. and that of their parents. is In vocational education through which they can prepare to earn a living when they enter the world of work. 5. Many business and industrial establishments are calling on the schools to expand their programs of adult education. In order to meet this need and those explained above. we shall need more GeorgeBarden funds. not less. During the postwar years vocational education has been neglected in a way. in favor of expenditures for defense and foreign aid. While the GeorgeBarden Act of 1946 authorizes an expenditure of over $29 million for vocation education Congress has always appropriated less. leaving the schools short by several million dollars. I hope that the committee will see fit to recommend appropriations for the full amount this year. Armenian Independence Anniversary",

Over this span of years. our Nation has grown from a group of small frontier settlements to a position of world leadership in economic development. Our transportation systems have played a vital part in this phenomenal development. Water transportation has always been the mainstay of these systems for the movement of bulk commodities and heavy goods. Over the past 125 years. we have developed almost 300 commercial harbors. 28.000 miles of improved waterways and about 500 locks and dams. These improvements have facilitated the growth of trade with other nations. developed commerce among the States and contributed to the security and continued growth of the Nation. The latest available figures show that in 1952 the waterborne commerce of the United States totaled about 890 million tons. of which 660 million were domestic and 230 million were foreign. This represents an increase of 50 percent over the prewar peak in 1929. On the inland waterways. the commerce reached a total of 168 billion tonmiles in 1952. which is an increase of 42 percent since 1940 when the total amounted to 118 billion tonmiles. The improvement of these waterways for a growing peacetime economy has also given us a valuable asset in time of war. They have been used to provide access to inland shipyards and they have made possible a widespread geographical diffusion of manufacturing processes which otherwise would have been forced into congested or more exposed coastal areas. The bill provides for many projects to deepen and widen existing channels and harbors. This is necessitated by the increasing use of larger and more economic vessels which will result in lower transportation costs and lower prices to the consumers. The progressive development of waterborne transportation has consistently brought economies in the cost of production of the many goods that provide us with the highest living standards of any Nation on the earth today.",

The Kentucky Woodlands National Wildlife Refuge. containing approximately 60.000 acres. is located between the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. About 6.000 acres of that wildlife refuge will be taken in the construction of the high dam thereA It might be said that 6.000 acres is a small percentage of more than 60.000 acres in the wildlife preserve. However. these 6.000 acres constitute the only productive land within that preserve. They provide feed for the geese and wild turkeys which abound in that wildlife preserve. Unless some replacement is made for that land. the remainder of the land will be of no further value as a wildlife preserve. As I said a short time ago. the amendment would not add anything to the cost of the bill. It would merely give to the Engineers the authority to acquire this land when they acquire all the other land which is needed in connection with the construction of the dam. instead of having the Department of the Interior called upon to provide the machinery to acquire the land. The Engineers could do It. provided definite authority was included in the bill to permit them to do it. I ask the chairman if that is a fair statement of the facts.",

My colleague lives in the section of Kentucky where the improvement will be made. He was once governor of Kentucky. and he is very familiar with the wildlife refuge. I hope very earnestly that the conferees on the part of the Senate will press the request made by my senior colleague and myself. I know that the Senators who will represent this body on the conference committee are familiar with the authority of the Corps in such a field. In analogy. I remember that when the Wolf Creek Dam was built on the Cumberland River the town of Burnside was inundated. In that instance the Engineers not only provided relief from the serious damage suffered by businesses and industries which had to move from the inundated areas. but also made arrangements to restore the town to the same comparable condition in which it was before the inundation. That situation may not be an exact analogy with what my colleague has said. is needed in this case. but it is true that the situation cannot be handled except in the way in which my colleague has described.

If we have not disposed of the agricultural bill by then. we shall probably have the calendar call on Monday of next week. again depending on the progress we make on the agricultural bill. After the agricultural bill has been disposed of and we have had the call of the calendar. the Senate will take up three antiCommunist bills. They are the following bills: Calendar 1720.

Calendar 1833. H. R. 9580. to revise and extend the laws relating to espionage and sabotage. and for other purposes. Calendar 1834.

The bill itself contains many provisions on which we could all agree. I shall go through the bill. provision by provision. without going into detail to any extent. There is included in the bill a provision for setting aside certain amounts of agricultural commodities which are now owned by the United States Government. These commodities are wheat. cotton. cottonseed oil. butter. powdered milk. and cheese. This is in accordance with the recommendation of President Eisenhower. and the effect of setting these commodities aside would be to take them out of consideration in fixing minimum levels of support for such commodities in the future. or until they are disposed of. The majority of the committee approved not only the continuation of 90 percent price supports for basic commodities for another year. but also approved the setting aside of these commodities. The minority of the committee does not approve of the setting aside of these huge amounts of surplus commodities if 90 percent rigid supports are continued after this year.",

Section 202 would set the price support for longstaple cotton at the minimum determined in accordance with the schedule set out in section 101 (b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. The reason for that is that producers of longstaple cotton came before our committee and asked us to adopt a provision which would not freeze their longstaple cotton at a higher price.

I think it appropriate to call attention of the Congress to a new book on this general subject which will be issued June 15 by the Funk & Wagnalls Publishing Co. The book was written by Edward F. Barrett and is titled \"Truth Is Our Weapon.\" I have just read a preedition copy of this book and can recommend it as factual. thoughtful. and informative. To any Member of the Congress interested in the subject of our international information problem this book is must reading. Mr. Barrett Is perhaps better qualified to write such a book than almost any other American. He was former Administrator of the Voice of America and during World War II served as a top executive in the Office of War Information. His long career as a newspaperman displays itself in the readable manner in which he has prepared his material. Any person who reads this book will have a better knowledge and understanding of the Nations as yet unsolved problem of carrying on an effbctive and proper campaign of propaganda and information to the world. Whatever program our Government adopts must first be approved by the Congress. Hence. it goes without saying that the better the Members know this subject. the better the program will be. None can be too well informed on this problem. The tremendous research work and effort made to prepare the material for this book attests its reliability. In my opinion. it is the finest text on the subject yet written. Since I am perhaps the only Member of the House who has actually served in overseas propaganda work. I believe I am somewhat qualified to know this subject and to recommend a book dealing with it.",

Regardless of how well words may be woven into eloquent rhetoric. they are still weak in comparison with great deeds and great actions and great character. In the passing of Senator TAFT. I feel that the country and the Congress and the councils of free men have suffered a very great loss. In his death there has been taken from the arena of public service a vigorous and vital mind. a stalwart character. a courageous soul. I had the privilege during the last 12 years many times of sitting on conference committees with Senator TAFT. dealing with legislation that came out of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. particularly legislation in the field of health. Each time I went into such conference I came out of it more and more impressed with the greatness of his mind and the honesty of his mind. I did not always agree with him in conference. but I always knew what he believed and I knew why he believed it. I often found it hard to escape the logic of his conclusions and the wisdom of his viewpoint. Out of that experience I developed a deep admiration for Senator TAFT and his death brings to me a sense of personal loss. No mound of earth can still the voice of Senator TAFT. I think in the days ahead in this Congress and many Congresses to come we shall still feel the compulsion of his presence like a voice out of a \"great cloud of witnesses.\" In his quiet passing at the very peak of such a vigorous. vital. and rich life.

But such a tide as moving seems asleep. Too full for sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home. Twilight and evening bell. And after that the dark. And may there be no sadness of farewell. When I embark. For though from out our bourne of time and . place The flood may bear me far. I hope to see my Pilot face to face .When I have crossed the bar.",

Every. where I went on that trip whether it be a discussion on the plane. in the taxi. in hotels or in the homes of friends everyone asked about you. They praised the great work that you were doing.

His countless friends in Colorado join with me in expressing profound grief over his untimely death. I first met Senator TAFT when I was Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee of Colorado. At that. time we formed a friendship that has been one of the richest experiences in my life. When I came to Congress Senator and Mrs. Taft were most gracious and helpful. Mrs. Chenoweth and I have had the pleasure of being in their home on different occasions and they were charming hosts. A visit with the Tafts was always an outstanding event and it was a real privilege to partake of their genuine hospitality. There was something wholesome and fine about Senator TAFT that always impressed me when I was in his presence. There was never any pretense or hypocrisy. I was always impressed with the fact that his public and private life was above reproach. There was never any scandal or gossip in connection with either. Everyone knew and respected his reputation for honesty and integrity. Mr. Speaker. I feel utterly inadequate to express what is on my mind and heart today. In the passing of Senator TAFT I have suffered a heavy personal loss. His life will always be an inspiration and a challenge to me. In these critical days our country needed Senator TAFT as never before. He occupied a unique place in our Government. It is impossible to estimate his influence on our national life. There is great sorrow over this Nation today because of his passing. Citizens in all walks of life realize they have lost a true friend. We will not see his like again. Truly Senator TAFT was one of our greatest Americans and history will so record. I wish to extend to Mrs. Taft and the other members of the family my deep personal sympathy in their great sorrow.

Senator TAFT was a longtime friend of my family. I first got to know him well. however. in the 1948 campaign when I was State Young Republican chairman and helped organize the young men and women who were interested in his candidacy for President. And it is as a young man that I should like particularly to pay tribute to the Senator. His unquestioned integrity and devotion to principle. his overall knowledge. and his terrific capacity for work caused him to be admired by all who knew him. But this was particularly true of younger people to whom he set a shining example of the finest tradition of public service and of devotion to his country. Senator BOB TAFT will be remembered In history as a champion of the freedom he so greatly cherished and as a courageous. competent. forceful legislator. But he will be remembered even more for the highest type of public service which he rendered and the example of devotion to his country which he set for all young people to emulate and strive to follow. Mr. Speaker. I join with my colleagues In extending to his wife and to his sons our deepest sympathies in their bereavement. Mr. Speaker.

I have spoken before of ROBERT A. TAFT as an \"anchor to windward\" in retaining those principles and precepts in which he believed and on which we rely. Certainly no one ever accused ROBERT A. TAFT of deviating one degree from his charted course in order to take advantage of a situation. To know him was to respect him. I am glad that so many of our American people have already called him not merely Mr. Republican. but Mr. American. The fact that this came spontaneously and all over the Nation at once is in itself a tribute to the great Senator from Ohio. ROBERT A. TAFT could and did work with those with whom he was not in complete accord. but he did this without giving up his own views and principles. Furthermore. he commanded their respect. His regard for his family was proof of his spiritual qualities. It has been only since his death that we have learned of his personal courage in helping his doctors learn everything possible from his own ailment that might assist in curing others. In my opinion this great last act was the crowning glory of a great career by a great man. We mourn for a friend. We mourn for a statesman. But even more important. we mourn for a real American.",

The fact of the matter is that. according to every reliable report. we are falling behind in expanding the reservoir of skilled personnel capable of spearheading technical operations in United States industry and defense. I was pleased. therefore. to receive from Mr. John Gammell. the director of graduate training of one of the great manufacturing corporations of my Statethe AllisChalmers Co.. of Milwaukeethe text of a paper prepared for the convention of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers by Dr. M. H. Trytten. director of the office of scientific personnel of the National Research Council. here in Washington. Dr. Tryttens observations are. I believe. of tremendous significance to government and industry alike. and I should like to present them now. albeit necessarily in somewhat abridged form. I may say they supplement an article which I noted in the July 2. 1954. issue of Science magazine. entitled \"Professional and Scientific Personnel in the U. S. S. R.\" written by Nicholas DeWitt. of the Russian research center of Harvard University. in Cambridge. Mass. I should like to urge the appropriate officials in the Pentagon and in the Office of Defense Mobilization to give their deep consideration to this overall problem. I am glad to note that President Eisenhower has already indicated his own awareness of this problem. I may say. too. that I have been in correspondence with Dr. Joseph Hierschfelder. Director of the Naval Research Laboratory. at Madison. Wis.. regarding a somewhat parallel problem of better use of scientific talent by the armed services themselves. I send Dr. Tryttens paper to the desk. and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Appendix of the CONGRES-",

One might expect the National Association of Attorneys General to be supported by dues from its members. and to have their interests as its chief concern. That is not quite the case. The National Association of Attorneys General has no membership dues or assessments. nor is it financed by equal contributions from all sections of the country. Instead. it is subsidized by three StatesCalifornia. Texas. and Louisiana. In 1951. for example. total contributions were $33.750-$9.750 from Louisiana. $9.000 from California. and $15.000 from Texas. The organization spent $32.464.41 that year. More than half. $18.000. went for the salary of Walter R. Johnson. $125 per month was paid for an office in Washington. $225 per month was expended as rent for a house in Arlington. with additional sums for utilities. - The National Association of Attorneys General and Walter R. Johnson. its highly paid employee. are both registered under the Federal Lobbying Act. The only legislative interest they list is influencing the passage of bills designed to give submerged lands to the States. The impression that one obtains. of course. is that in the course of studying all the many legal problems faced by our 48 State governments. an organization of 48 attorneys general has decided to devote some of its time to the offshore oil question. This impression. I submit. is a valuable part of the campaign of misrepresentation. Mr. President. I should like to have someone present any evidence that may be obtainable to indicate either. first. that this organization obtains financial support from all the 48 States. or. second. that it has other legislative interests as well and is therefore something other than a paper organization to do the lobbying on behalf of the giveaway joint resolution.

I wish to say definitely that the bill does not provide the standards for sound administrative procedure that the Congress should require. Mr. President. let us make no mistake about it: If the present administration thinks it had a number of unpaid bills left over by the previous administration. I say this bill will open a Pandoras box of unpaid bills for future administrations. for once the bill is enacted into law we shall have said to future administrations that they can proceed forthwith to enter into leasepurchase agreements that will commit the Government to untold millions of dollars worth of construction. without appropriate check by the Congress. Is it not fitting and proper that a committee of the Congress should have the right to place a check upon an action of the administration? Under the Constitution the Congress of the United States has the responsibility of appropriating money. and the appropriation of the money involves also making a policy decision as to what the money shall be appropriated for. This bill would permit the administration to make the policy decision. commit the Government of the United States to construction work. come to the Congress. figuratively place a gun at its forehead. and say. \"We already have the community behind the bill. We have already aroused public opinion. Now pay.\" If that is what is called sound fiscal policy. I must confess that I am in error.",

There is not a single differing decision on the part of the Supreme Court. We heard a great deal of discussion yesterday about the Pollard case. When the attorney general of the State of Tennessee was testifying before the committee he tried to point out that in the Pollard case a piece of land away out in Mobile Bay. lashed and tossed by the storms in Mobile Bay. was the land under contest. but the actual fact was that it was a city lot inside the city of Mobile. and anyone who was at all familiar with the circumstances knew that this piece of land had become filledin land and the Federal Government did not claim it. The suit was not filed by the Federal Government. it was filed by a private interest. Never once has the Federal Government claimed to own this particular piece of land. The decisions have been uniform for more than a hundred years. Filledin land along the coasts of the States. on inland waters. and in various other spots. does belong to the States. and no one has ever tried to take such land away from the States. Testimony was introduced in the hearIng in an effort to show that the Federal Government had paid many of the States. and that that was a confession of State ownership. I do not think it was a confession of title. but it shows that the Federal Government has always leaned over backward to recognize that the areas of filledin land and lands adjoining the coasts ought to be given to the States. What we object to is not to the doing of that at all. What we object to is the effort to provide that lands 10 miles out in the ocean. and. beyond that. even farther than the eye can see. lying 150 fathoms below the surface. belong to a State.",

Committees may have gone beyond that realmsometimes I think they havebut that is the basic purpose and the only justifiable ground on which investigations are conducted.

I am confident that the project will be approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. and I shall press vigorously for favorable action by the full Senate. As I have said. the question is not whether the seaway will be built. Canada will build it. Canada is ready to move. Her leaders are ready to proceed. The question is whether we will have anything to say about it after it is built. I am happy to say that many persons who heretofore seemed to be prejudiced have now seen the significance of this great international highway or waterway. and I trust that ere long we shall be able to demonstrate statesmanship in that regard on the floor of the Senate.",

Ezra Taft Benson. for the fight he is putting up to lower farm prices so that farm products can be purchased bj consumers. especially in the cities. Before his election President Eisenhower spoke of full parity in the market place. The present Secretary of Agriculture. it seems. to me. is trying to fulfill the Presidents pledge. I am sure that everyone realizes that if the price of farm products is reduced for the American housewife. farmers themselves. in the national interest. must put aside greed for money gains. and accept a lower price for the products they sell. The attitude of the Secretary of Agriculture in his speech in St. Paul. Minn.. is good news for the American consumer. He said: God help us to raise our sights beyond the dollar sign. beyond material things. Mr. Speaker. some people think the American farmer has too long been pampered by the farm policies of the Democratic Party. As individuals. should farmers learn not to lean upon Government -for assistance? The policies of the Republican Secretary of Agriculture are clear to me. He has outlined his program with frankness and sincerity. I am sure that unless selfish farm leaders create confusion. the American farmer will understand that the end of artificial pricesupport programs is in sight. We will soon come to the end of programs that pile up potatoes and butter at the taxpayers expense. Evidently. the new policy is. as the Secretary has so aptly indicated in his remarks of the past month. if the farmer is so inefficient that he is unable to make a profit. let him quit farming.",

I think the Commission ought to go about doing something at once. I do not see any reason for taking a full year to study the question. Furthermore. the language. without the intention of the committee. very obviously covers the study of the taxability of municipal bonds. I have received a letter of very violent protest from the executive director of the United States Conference of Mayors objecting at least to inviting the Commission to open up that subject. which has been .before the Congress two or three times already.

If we expect the Government to go back to the local level. as many people are now advocating. it will be necessary for local governments to have taxes in order to perform their functions properly. Chief Justice Marshall said that the power to tax is the power to destroy. The Federal Government will eventually destroy the State governments. and the Federal Government and the State governments combined will destroy all local government unless we give local government taxes with which to carry on the functions which we expect local government to perform. I think the Congress ought to keep that principle in mind at all times. This bill. of course. provides for a study of the situation. Before we can come to any sound conclusion. we must have taxes allocated for the three levels of government. and we must make sure that the highest level of government does not interfere with the lower levels.",

Mr. Duke first said he lacked sufficient funds to come to Washington. so we sent him an airplane ticket. He then complained that he never received the ticket. so Mr. Flanagan then made arrangements for him to pick up another ticket at the airport. Mr. Duke then called back to say that he had discussed the matter with a lawyer. and that he had found that we could not extradite him in contempt proceedings. and therefore he thought he would not return to the United States. He has not returned since then. The committee met and unanimously voted to cite Mr. Duke for contempt. If Senate Resolution 30 is agreed to today by the Senate.

Those are the causes for which the United States has been willing to fight in the past. We do not wish to fight in order to protect the economic system of some other country. particularly colonialism and the economic benefits which accrue from it to the nation in control. But many of our citizens might be inspired to be willing to make another sacrifice if they thought that by doing so. in pursuance of the great ideal of freedom for the people of the countries of Indochina. France would make an announcement to those people to the effect that she would give them their freedom and would fight against communism. so that they might eventually have their liberty.

The contention that exists here today is over whether or not the proper procedure has been followed in bringing this legislation to the floor. The gentleman from California . if I understood properly the meaning of his remarks. as well as the gentleman from Illinois . contend that the Reorganization Act should be paramount. and that when the Reorganization Act of 1949 was adopted and passed by the Congress. it set aside all the other rights of the Congress to consider legislation under the usual procedure. If the gentleman will consult with able parliamentarians. I think he will learn that all we did when we adopted the Reorganization Act was to provide another method by which reorganization plans or reorganization of the Government could be considered by the Congress. In other words. under the Reorganization Act of 1949 we gave to the President certain rights and privileges in connection with reorganization matters. but by so doing we did not take away from ourselves. or from the Congress. any of the rights which have been inherent in this legislative body throughout the 150 years or more of our Governments existence. We still retain those rights. We can reorganize the executive branch of the Government. any time we in the Congress please. by the passage of affirmative legislation. So all this joint resolution does today is to speed up the process. and I am sure the former Speaker will agree with me.",

By evolution. down through the years. it has become almost exclusively responsible for management of the Postal Establishment. This marriage of law enforcement and management has been a constant and Increasing case in incompatibility that has had an Ill effect on the efficiency and economy of the postal service. The inspection service. on the one hand. does not command the confidence. cooperation. and participation of the rank and file of postal employees In matters of management. thus. progressive movement is limited. On the other hand. the inspection service. as an entity. is not equipped by training or experience to provide the technical skill required to streamline and modernize the operations of the Postal Establishment by taking full advantage of recentday developments In the fields of engineering and management. The report leads one to believe that the inspection has gone far afield from its original duties and is causing a great deal of discontent and is not doing any good.

I believe in December 1952. or very early in 1953. an inspector appeared at that office and began finding fault about various minutiae. and finally the resignation of this man was requested on the ground of gross inefficiency. It hardly seems possible to me that there could have been such a deterioration of character on the part of the postmaster in that short period of time. I think the cases submitted will indicate that. in the main. inspectors have been used by the Postmaster General to try to force Democrats out of the postal service and put Republicans with political influence in the service in their places. I am not a civilservice crank. I believe that a certain amount of patronage is needed in operating the political system. But I also believe that the law should be observed. Such employees are civilservice employees. and were guaranteed continuance in office so long as they performed their duties efficiently and honestly. What is happening all over the country is that the inspectors are practically framing a great many of such employees. at least that is the effect. either by forcing them to resign or driving them from office with blemishes on their records. when. in fact. such blemishes are so slight as to be natural.

However. I do think that in this caseand I am afraid also in certain other cases which I have detectedthe State Department did not tell the Congress all the truth. It failed to make full disclosure. and therefore. by inference. it deceived the Congress. Those are harsh things to say. but I think they are true. That makes it very difficult for us to trust the State Department on those matters with respect to which the Department enters a specific denial. We have been deluded so many times that we begin to wonder. when we are getting the truth. I urge the State Department to come clean in these matters. I speak as one who has been a defender of the State Department. We cannot be expected to trust the State Department if the State Department will not trust us with the facts. I wish to go back to the case of France. because that is one country where we are putting up buildings. I call attention to Tangier. French Morocco. where there is a restriction. There is a restriction with respect to France. I wish to call attention to the last sentence of paragraph A. which reads: One surplus property credit agreement in the total amount of $300 million provides that $15 million thereof may be used for the acquisition of property and that $10 million thereof may be paid in French currency that may be used for buildings or an educational program. I should like to point out that buildings need not necessarily be State Department buildings. They could be buildings for our defense forces. and to that degree they would reduce the outlay which we must make in credits to foreign countries.

Unfortunately. however. the committee has not been able to consider the bill. By way of explanation of the amendment I am offering. I may say that the information obtained through studies made by the Committee on Small Business is to the effect that the legislative history and the administration of Public Law 921 indicated that the Congress. in extending the law. expressed a twofold intent. namely. to provide military sources of supply by keeping defense suppliers in business. and to afford relief to suppliers subjected to heavy losses on fixedprice contracts. We found that the defense agencies were administering the law under regulations which allowed relief only in the case of essential contracts. That is the principal and specific reason for my desiring to obtain agreement to this amendment to the present provisions of title II of the First War Powers Act. namely. to make certain that small businesses which have suffered extreme hardships under a fixed contract will be given the same consideration as that which the defense authorities have accorded to the essential contractor.

The children of our country will be greatly benefited if we start paying something on the national debt that we now owe instead of leaving it to them and to their children to pay. I am not sure it is a wise thing to earmark these funds at this time. but if they are going to be marked. Mr. President. I hope that the Senate will mark the funds for payment on our national debt rather than putting them into a fund for Federal aid to education. when there is no such program now in existence. It has been rejected many times. None of the details for such a program have been worked out by the Congress of the United States. Mr. President.

It never occurred to me that the education of the citizens of this country was not for the general good of the people of the country and the future of it. I had not conceived all the funds as a largess just for the personal benefit of the schoolteachers. It has always seemed to me that education as such was good for the country. if it was our intention to continue as a selfgoverning country. If we permit our governmental system to be reduced to one governed by small groups. such as in certain other countries. there would be no particular reason why the populace should be educated. I can understand also why some people do not like to have the electorate well educated. so they would not understand what is going on in the country. It is much easier to deceive illiterate people and mislead them along false principles. So that I well understand why there has been a great and vigorous opposition to the Improvement of education in this country. and I expect it to continue.

I think it is perhaps true that some bills have been predicated on the idea of giving aid to the States with small economic resources. There have been different formulas. But that very fact points up the weakness in the Hill amendment. namely. that it makes subject to perpetual review the amount which will go to the various States. When we make grantsinaid we base them upon that point. I once had that kind of formula in a bill which I introduced in the House of Representatives. but after receiving protests from school superintendents and from persons who saw some possibility of the Federal Governments securing a controlling hand over the kind of education which would be offered by the schools in the various States to which aid might be granted. I abandoned it in favor of a per capita distribution. because it seemed to me that it kept the long arm of the Federal Government out of control of the little red schoolhouse. It seemed to me that it was more desirable to preserve local control over education In the States. As the Senator from Wyoming has so well pointed out. the problem of schools with lesser opportunities or with smaller resources is a problem within the States. and the States can take care of it and place the money where it is most needed. without the Federal Government reaching the long arm of Washingtons bureaucracy into the administration of local schools.",

The very purpose of that principle is to allocate to areas within a State additional funds so that there may be educational equality of opportunity within the States. The Federal aidtoeducation bills. as I remember. were bottomed on that idea. The Federal Government. in an effort to give aid or greater aid to areas which do not possess sufficient taxable wealth to provide educational funds. had in mind the equalization of educational opportunity throughout the country. That was the purpose of the Federal Governments entering into the field of education. The point I am raisingand. of course. I am aware that the Senators amendment does make funds available to the Statesis that the amendment kills the idea of the allocation of funds for the purpose of equalizing educational opportunity throughout the Nation.",

It permits the States to make the determination. and not the Federal Government.

For while I appreciate the good motives and fine intentions of these Senators. their amendment involves a matter of delusive simplicity in dealing with one of the most complicated questions that can be presented. The amendment proposes that the funds available for education be allocated between the States according to the relative number of enrolled pupils in all schools. public and private. in primary and secondary institutions. Mr. President. there are many weaknesses in this formula. and they have been touched upon during the debate. In the first place. while the Senator from South Dakota has somewhat reduced the weakness of his formula by striking out higher institutions of learning from the basis of allocation. nevertheless. there is also a sectional element in connection with secondary education. There are many students from the West and Middle West who go to eastern and northern primary and secondary schools. Therefore. this formula. while it is not quite so bad as that which was originally advanced. does discriminate against States where children of welltodo families go East and North for their secondary education.

I am not impressed with the statement of the Senator from Illinois that we need more timemore timemore time. We have held hearings on the question of Federal aid to education lasting literally over months. At last we have an opportunity to show to those interested in schools and education whether we really favor Federal aid to education or whether we have seized upon the Hill amendment as a fat. juicy political issue which can be used over and over again for the next 10. .20. or 30 years. I say that the vote we take this afternoon on the Case amendment will show definitely whether or not we are sincere in voting for the Hill amendment. We know all the little mattersand they are big matters to some peoplewhich arise in a hearing. We know the religious issue which will be injected. and which has killed Federal aid to education more than once up to this time. We know the arguments which will be made for giving this State more. or that State more. or this type of school more. and the arguments as to what grades we should support. The manner in which the Senator from South Dakota proposes to settle this problem is the only way that. within the next generation. we can succeed in giving any Federal aid to education. Do we believe in States rights? If we do. let the States spend this money as they spend their own money. and not try to bind them by intricate formulas so that the Federal Government will tell them how to operate each and every school. from the primary grades up to the colleges.",

What is the use of saying that we are going to give the States some money for education. and then limiting them so that they cannot obtain a cent of money? Let us give it to them if we are going to give it to them. The proposal of the Senator from South Dakota is eminently fair. There is no such thing as an absolutely fair formula for the distribution of these funds. and any law we enact will be subject to ironing out the inequities through subsequent legislation. But if we want to provide money for educationand God knows. every school in the country. from the primaries through the universities. is desperately in need of fundswe shall never have a better opportunity to do it than we have now. The proposal of the Senator from South Dakota might give one State a little more under this formula than it would receive under some other formula. However. as I have stated. no formula Is exactly correct. The extension service Is based upon rural population. I have heard no complaints as to the workings of that system. This proposal is based upon school enrollment. As the Senator from Illinois has said. school attendance would probably be a better measure In the long run. We can change the formula later.

This memorandum also indicates the existing gaps in our present policy in this field. These memoranda. together with other important materials on the subject. have been brought together by the Senate Committee pn Armed Services in a committee print entitled \"Compilation of Certain Legal Materials Prepared by the Office of the Senate Legislative Counsel on Conflict of Interest Statutes.\" A careful reading of this valuable document will convince anyone that a fresh and intensive study by Congress is needed in this field. Mr. President. I believe that the most expedient and effective method of making this study would be through a temporary joint committee set up for this specific purpose. It is my hope that the concurrent resolution which I have introduced to authorize such a committee will be supported by members of both parties and will be acted upon promptly by the Senate.

Fla.. on November 3. 1953. He served in the 82d Congress as representative from the 1st Florida District. It seems but a few short days ago at the close of the 82d Congress that I took the floor to express my sincere regret that Chester had announced his decision to retire from Congress. With many other Members of the House I expressed appreciation for the splendid manner in which he had discharged his duties. We realize now that he probably knew that time was not long for him and nobly made his decision to step aside. Now we pause to pay honor to his memory. Chester McMullen was rare among men. His courage and his determination to stand up for his Christian convictions was an inspiration to all who knew and worked with him. His influence was strong among us because instinctively we realized that his opinions were based on quiet. sound reasoning. He was not swayed by bigotry or influenced by prejudice. His death has left an empty place. In Florida. in Washington. wherever he was known he had friends who deeply mourn his passing. I find it hard to realize that we will not see his smile again or hear his cheery good morning or benefit from his wisdom until that better day somewhere in the great beyond.

During the time Chester McMullen served in the Congress. he came to be recognized for his strong character. great ability. and unswerving allegiance to whatever he considered right and just. It was my pleasure to know Chester for over a quarter of a century. He was a member of a pioneer family in the greater Tampa Bay areaa truly pioneer Florida family endowed with great American tradition. which patterned his whole career. Chester entered public life in 1927. when he was appointed county prosecuting attorney. In 1930 he was elected as State attorney of the Sixth Judiciary District of Florida. where he set an enviable record for law enforcement and justice. In 1950 he resigned this seat when he was elected to this House. I shall always remember Chester for his winning smile. his kind and gentle manner. his great courage and generosity. I recall very vividly the prayer of Dr. H. W. Blackburn. pastor of the First Methodist Church of Clearwater. when at the graveside he uttered these words: We thank Thee for the life of Chester McMullen. for his warm and natural friendliness. We are grateful for the fact that he improved lis native gifts by devoted and unselfish service. in some way he could leave this country a better place in which free Americans could live their lives under the greatest government of all time. Chester McMullen was from a family of pioneer Floridians. His father. who was affectionately known as Uncle Eli. moved to Pinellas County. Fla.. by oxcart before the War Between the States. Uncle Eli raised eight children. all of whom are extremely well thought of in our State. The name of McMullen is Ul.. 4 a. t~o .Lvce .11 UU4. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman State of Florida.

Chester was a graduate of the University of Florida and had a long and distinguished career as an outstanding lawyer. plus his experience over many years as a prosecuting attorney.

I had the opportunity of talking to Chester that day about service in the Congress. That incident illustrates to me the unselfish spirit of service that belonged to Chester McMullen. There are two fragments of poems that come to my mind as we think of death. One is in that beautiful Elegy by Gray that I am sure all of us recall: The boast of heraldry. the pomp of powr. And all that beauty. all that wealth eer gave. Await alike the Inevitable hour: The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Chester McMullen was not a man to whom the spirit of that poem might be applied. There was about him none of the boasting. none of the pomp. and no display of power. I am inclined to think of Chester in terms of the injunction in that other poem about death: So live. that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan which moves To that mysterious realm. where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death. Thou go not. like the quarryslave at night. Scourged to his dungeon. but. sustained and soothed By an unfaltering trust. approach thy grave.

I have known no Member more conscientious in his service or more desirous of finding the right answer for difficult problems. During his first year as a Member of Congress. it was my privilege to be a member of a special committee. chairmanned by him. having as its purpose the study of native possessory rights in Alaska. One of my lifes finest experiences of fellowship was on that trip. Mr. McMullen was most conscientious in the discharge of his responsibility and as leader of that journey to our northernmost shores. was exceedingly fair in the way he handled the committee hearings. Such industry and fairness was exemplified by him in all the relations I had with him. I have never known a more pleasing and noble personality. I was most sorry when he announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection. Only the announcement of his passing advised more fully of one of the reasons of his voluntary retirement. I know that his final decision was made in light of what he thought was to the best interest of the people whom he had the honor to represent. What a difficult decision he had to make. And how nobly he made it. His life was full of many instances of such nobility of character and evidences of unselfish devotion to the interests of his fellowmen.

The purpose of these amendments is to tighten the proposed law and make it more workable and easier to administer. In my opinion. the amendments are all noncontroversial. There are six amendments in the series. For parliamentary reasons it has been necessary to offer them en bloc. but I shall explain each one separately. The first of the amendments eliminates confusion respecting whether the Communist Party is a true political party. The whole purpose of the findings in this section is to make it clear that the Communist Party is not a true political party. but. unfortunately. the phrase \"other political party\" has been used several times. which would give Communist lawyers an opportunity to argue this point. The proposed amendment eliminates this phrase. and thus draws a clear distinction between the Communist Party and true political parties. The second amendment is a necessary technical amendment. so as to make the bill refer. properly. to the National Labor Relations Act as amended. The third amendment eliminates words added to the definition of \"Communistinfiltrated organization\" which have the effect of making it impossible to prove that any organization comes within the definition. It must be recognized that this section does not impose a criminal penalty or quasicriminal penalty on any person. it seeks. rather. to assess the nature of an organization. To require that for this purpose there must be a showing of what was in the mind of an individual or individuals at a certain time. is to make an impossible requirement. Furthermore. to require a showing of what an organization. as such. knew at a certain time is another impossible requirement. because an organization has no mind. and a showing of what was in a number of individual minds would be impossible. even if it could be determined what individual minds composed the organization.",

The theory that impelled the Congress in both cases was simply this and when the coal. the oil and gas and other minerals are extracted of course the resources of the States are being depleted. The Congress recognized that fact and provided that a major part of the income should be used to replace that loss with another resource in the form of reclamation projects. The principle behind that theory is sound. The principle is that in the main the income from the soil of these Western States belongs to the people of those States. The income to the Federal treasury from the public lands in Wyoming during the past 50 years totals $146 million. That portion of the income set over to the reclamation fund from public lands in Wyoming and the amount repaid by the settlers on reclamation proj ects in our State have repaid the entire investment in water projects in Wyoming. That being the case. Mr. President. it is only fair and just that the income from the public lands of the State should now be used for the exclusive benefit of the people of Wyoming.

Of course. the Great Lakes States. including the great State of Illinois. own the bed of the Great Lakes. It seems to me the Senator from Illinois should be willing also to make the Great Lakes States pay for all their river and harbor improvements. and also for their lighthouses. So I hope the Senator will accept an amendment. to include the States bordering on Lake Michigan. so that those States will also pay for the same services which he thinks the coastal States should pay for. and on the same basis.",

The prayer by the bishop was one of deep spiritual significance. Bishop Cooper has been in Korea since 1908 and has served in the capacity of bishop for 23 years. In the spring of 1953 he was released after nearly 3 years of captivity by the Communists. Following a brief sojourn in England. he returned to Korea to serve once more the people of that troubled land. It was my pleasure to have lunch with Bishop Cooper during his brief visit with us. Even from this brief meeting it is evident that his deep and abiding faith. coupled with a keen sense of humor. account for the fine attitude and health which he enjoys today after the ordeal which he endured. He has conducted many services for our troops in Korea and since his return there has gone to the front lines regularly for confirmation and other pastoral duties. An indication of the affection in which he is held by those of our servicemen who met him in Korea is evidenced by the fact that a young couple flew from Albuquerque to Denver to have him baptize their child. I am informed that he is the second bishop. and the first Anglican bishop ever to offer the prayer at the opening of a session of the House of Representatives. He has been attending the Anglican conference in Minneapolis and I am sure as he returns to Korea in a few days that he carries with him the best wishes of his many friends in America and throughout the world. coupled with a deep appreciation of the 50 years of service which he has rendered.",

A report made by the Architect of the Capitol to the House Appropriations Committee (195051) tells why. It is perfectly frank in saying \"that the fact that the House Restaurant has for many years been operating at a loss has long been a matter of common knowledge.\" As a matter of fact. all the problems involved resulted in a total loss of approximately $30.000 for the year 1953. But it should be known there are certain uncontrollable costs that have to be absorbed before the restaurant can show a profit.

It is my good fortune to serve with him on the Judiciary Committee. although not on his subcommittee. This amendment is a fair extension of some of the provisions of the original Refugee Relief Act which was passed in 1953. That act authorized the admission to this country on special nonquota visas of over 200.000 persons who had fled or escaped from behind the Iron Curtain. or had been expelled from their homelands. Included in this figure were 60.000 of Italian origin and 17.000 of Greek origin. This amendment makes it easier for these persons of Italian and Greek origin to come in under the act. As orginally passed. a certain quota of each of these groups was reserved to those having close relatives in this country. The applicants in those categories greatly exceeded the quotas provided in the original act. and the effect of this amendment is to permit the total number of each of those groups to be admitted either under such special quotas or under the more general provisions. This liberalization of the law will mean a lot to those of our citizens who have relatives seeking to enter this country under the provisions of the 1953 act. It will mean happy family reunions and a further strengthening of this country through the building up of these families. some of whose members are already citizens. A Report to My Constituents",

In the House of Representatives the margin of control fluctuated through death or resignation with the result that at no time during the 2year period did the Republican Party enjoy a majority of more than five seats. In the United States Senate the hairline majority has never exceeded one seat. In some instances due to death the Democratic Party actually had a majority even though the control of the Senate remained in the hands of the Republican Party. Because of the narrow margin of votes between the Republicans and Democrats in Congress every legislative proposal was given thorough discussion and political steamrollering became a lost art.

MERLIN HULLS was a long and useful career during which he served the people of his home community. his adopted State. and the Nation not only in varied capacities as a public servant but as a newspaper publisher as well. We who knew him as a friend and colleague down through the years learned to appreciate MERLIN HULLS intellectual -honesty and his extreme diligence as a Member of the Congress. He went about his committee assignments with great seriousness of purpose and I have no doubt he adhered to the same high standard of service in daytoday relations with his constituents. Certainly the many years he has served here attest to the esteem and confidence in which he has been held by the people of his district. In the death of MERLIN HULL It can be said that America has lost a loyal and most faithful servant. Beyond that. my own State of Indiana has lost a native son. and we here in the Congress have lost a good and kind friend. Our deepest sympathies go out to the bereaved family and we express the hope that the burden of sadness is lightened in some measure by the knowledge that their beloved husband and father has served his country well.",

Mr. HULL was a very friendly and likable man. When I first came to Congress. I had the pleasure of meeting him. and had a special interest in knowing him because of the fact that he represented a district in my native State of Wisconsin. He was a very active man in the politics of Wisconsin. As a young man. he was speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly. Later he was secretary of state of Wisconsin. From his earliest manhood he adopted a progressive attitude toward the political questions of the day. He was trained in the school of Robert La Follette and continued to have the forward outlook to the end of his life which he had in his days as a young man. The La Follettes. both Robert La Follette and Robert La Follette. Jr.. left a great impress. not only on the political life of the State of Wisconsin but also strongly affected the political life of the Nation: badly needed political reforms. such as a primary law. which took the control of our parties away from the political bosses. a good public utilities act. and other reforms. On the national scene. the La Follette Influence was felt in uprooting corruption. and helping give to the common citizen protection against predatory interests. who looked upon government as a vehicle for the development of their selfish ideas and interests.",

I had had the idea that he had been making great and determined progress in his convalescence from his long illness. There are few men in public life who have been held in such high esteem as MERLIN HULL. For many. many years he enjoyed the warm affection and devotion of the people of the Ninth Congressional District of the State of Wisconsin. which he so ably represented here for 11 terms. It was my great privilege to know MERLIN HULL ever since I became a Member of Congress. We used to eat lunch together in the House Restaurant. always at Bob Bakers table. day after day. and month after month. over these last many years. I enjoyed a warm friendship with him and admired him for his sincerity of purpose and independent thought. He and I often discussed the problems affecting our respective constituencies and I always found him to be an outstanding and effective foe of any legislative proposals which he deemed not in the best interests of his Nation. It is hardly necessary for me to review MERLIN HULLS long and illustrious public career. His record speaks for itself. With his great wisdom and understanding he was a courageous advocate of progressive legislation. As a member of the House Banking and Currency Committee his service was characterized by a conscientious and intelligent approach to the many important issues of our time. He was a true statesman and his devotion to his work was an example and inspiration to all of us who served with him. I shall miss this affable and lovable friend. I shall never forget his courtly manner and his simplicity of character. His years of distinguished service in this body have left an imprint which shall not be soon forgotten.

June 24. 1954. regarding the American policy in the Middle East: There is a radical difference between the set of problems which we faced before. and the set which we have faced since. the establishment of the State of Israel. The problems before the State was founded were the centuryold problems of national homelessness. of a people \"robbed and despoiled.\" the problems of persecution. concentration camps. refugeeswhere to go. how to surviveall the desperate problems of an abnormal national existence. The problems since 1948 have been the more or less familiar problems which any pioneering state must face and wrestle with as part of the routine of its establishment on firm and secure foundations. These are the problems of a normal national existence. They may be grave and serious problems. but the effort at solving them carries with it an eager challenge. a creative joy and a deep spiritual confidence. These problems bring with them new tasks. What these new tasks are is evident: They are the manifold and exciting tasks which have to do with nation building. with the construction of new homes and settlements. with bringing springs of water to dry lands and gardens to the wilderness. They have to do with industry. trade. and commerce. with mining and engineering. with seafaring and aviation. and with all the noble arts and enterprises of peace. They have to do with education. health. and religion. and with a peoples chosen way of life. These new tasks are of necessity also concerned with national defensethe world in which we live being the kind of a world it is and the neighbors of Israel persistently refusing to make peace. Some of these tasks possess greater urgency than others. some are of longer duration than others. some of them will continue indefinitely since they are coextensive with the life of a nation.

I welcome this conference as another splendid bulwark of sound thinking on the part of the student body of the United States and of students of the free worldthe young men and young women who tomorrow. figuratively speaking. will take over the world. For too long. international communism had almost preempted the field of mass organizing of young university people. That is why I am so delighted that youngsters dedicated to the free way of life have banded together. It is really remarkable. Mr. President. They are discussing in the free way the ideas that are challenging them. I send to the desk the text of an article carried in the March 17. 1954. issue of the Christian Science Monitor. and ask unanimous consent that its text be printed in the Appendix of the RECORD. to be preceded by a list of the olicers and members of the advisory council of the USNSA. The tile of the article is \"AntiCommunist Bulwark: NSA Recruits Worlds Students To Spread Democracy.\" I think all of us can well take time to think about the significance of that gathering.",

I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD two editorials published in recent issues of a great newspaper. the St. Louis PostDispatch. one dated Wednesday. May 5. 1954. and the other dated Sunday. May 9. 1954. The two editorials relate to the Indochina situation and. in my judgment. are a complete answer to some statements made by administration spokesmen over the weekend. which are causing many persons in the United States to believe that the administration is still moving in the direction of bringing us into a war in Indochina. The editorial of May 5 is entitled \"A War To Stay Out Of.\" and I commend a reading of it to the Members of the Senate. The other editorial is entitled \"Temporary Reassurance.\" and bears upon one of the statements made by Mr. Dulles. who makes so many conflicting statements that it is difficult to know exactly where he stands on the Indochina issue. But in this particular statement he was saying things which seemed to give reassurance that the administration is not on a war march into Asia. Because I have spoken on the subject several times on the floor of the Senate. and because I still think it is the most vital issue facing the American people. surpassing in importance all other issues combined. I desire to make these two editorials a part of a short speech this afternoon on the subject. and. therefore. to incorporate them in the body of the REcoRD.",

One that is worth a billion and a half dollars to them annually. During the darkest days of the depression they got Congress to pass a law that banks could not pay interest on demand deposits. Before that the Government used to r eive a large sum annually as interest on its deposits in banks. But they stopped that. A lot of individuals and corporations all over America received interest on their demand deposits. That was stopped and it saved them a billion and a half dollars a year compared to what they used to pay. They are not in favor of repealing that. no. They do not want the competitive system there. That would be open competition between the banks and the people would get a little money for their demand deposits. but they are opposed to that. They want it closed. they want a closed book on that. They are not willing to change. So. they are in the least position to object. and I could tell you 10 other instances. 15 other instances. 20 other instances. but time will not permit. But I assure you that they can come before our committee and ask that other groups be restricted with the poorest grace of any association in America.",

Last week I was one of 160 Members of Congress who attended a breakfast honoring Evangelist Billy Graham. who has just returned from a preaching trip abroad. His audience was most attentive as he told of speaking to a total attendance of more than 2 million people in Great Britain over a period of 12 weeks. On the Continent he addressed 300.000 persons more through interpreters. Mr. Graham stated that much of the success of his meetings was due to a spiritual resurgence as the result of World War II and the fear of the atom bomb. Friends. right now is the time to start building a new world. And. we can only build a new world when we discard the old implements of war and put God back into the center of life. Let us do it now. not only for ourselves. but for generations to come. Mr. Speaker. Evangelist Billy Graham has had a great revelation. *And that revelation means much responsibility. He should be supported by the Congress of the United States. and the present administration. At any cost. let us make this great Godfearing man. and his equally great team. our official ambassadors of good will and spiritual awakening. A miracle could yet happen. Glorified Blackmail: H.

With all due deference to my friend from Indiana that is not a correct statement of the facts. Public housing terminated in Public Law 176 signed by the President on July 31. 1953.

I suppose everybody has his mind made up whether he is going to vote for or against this matter of making the tenants in public houses wards of the Government or whether you want to encourage home ownership in this freeenterprise country of ours. The issue is clear: Do you want to go on record today in favor of a brandnew publichousing program? No termination is involved here. Let us face up to the issue. It is not a question of termination. it is a question of revival of a program that was completely killed last summer.

The city is working hard to clean up the approximately 55.000 homes in the slum areas not suitable for decent living. but to do this. it must have assistance from the Government in the form of publichousing units.

It does not lower interest rates. It does not cost the Government any money and neither does it save the Government any money. It deals with the occupancy of public housing. The 1937 publichousing law. as amended in 1949. provided 2 tests that a person who desired to occupy lowcost public housing must qualify under before he could get admitted as a tenant to such lowcost public housing. One of those provisos that he had to qualify under was that his income had to be under a certain amount depending on the number of members in his family. The second proviso required that he had to come from substandard housing before he would be permitted to become a tenant in public housing. The 1949 act further provided as to that second proviso that he had to come from substandard housing that that should be waived in behalf of veterans. or families of deceased veterans. The act of 1949 stated that that waiver should continue until March 1. 1954. on the 1st of March of this year. that preference to veterans expired.

In many towns. publichousing units are only now being completed and the veterans in those communties have never had an opportunity to occupy them. I will say to the committee that if there was any excuse for placing this proviso in the law in 1949. it is certainly in order to continue it at the present time. I may say to the committee. although I know you will not be influenced by what the Senate does. this same matter was brought up in the Senate by Senator SPARKMAN. It was considered by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee and reported out and passed the Senate on March 1. 1954. I think it is a good amendment.

It merely provides a formula which would result in Federal and local cooperation in the liquidation of any particular public housing project. once the local governing body or the voters by referendum decide to discontinue a project that is in active operation. It is not designed. nor can it be interpreted. to bring about the wholesale liquidation of the 1.631 public housing projects which are today in operation or the 414 projects now under construction. Under existing law the Federal Government is legally obligated to make contributions for 40 years in order to maintain the subsidized lowrent character of public housing. However. shifting of populations. as well as incomes. Increased standards of living. and other changing circumstances in a community might conceivably bring about a situation that renders the continuation of a public housing project wholly impractical. For example. the hearings on. the Independent Offices Appropriation Act in February contained references to several communities where the local housing authorities were actually advertising in press and radio for tenants. Unfortunately there is no provision in the law at present which would enable such communities to proceed toward liquidation. The only provision for liquidation suggested in this bill would not be operative until 40 years had elapsed. Surely. it is reasonable to foresee a desire on the part of a community to liquidate a public housing project 10. 15. or 20 years after it has been instituted instead of waiting for 40 years.",

The reason for introducing it at this time is to make it a part of the permanent legislation regarding public housing so that it will not be subject to a point of order as it was this time when the appropriation bill came before us. The substantial reason for the amendment is that the public housing authorities have said over and over again. particularly in Pittsburgh. Detroit. and other places where the question has come up. that they are unable to get the Communists out of the public housing projects without some enabling legislation. They claim they have no authority by which they may proceed. They can put a tenant out for immoral conduct of various sorts. but they cannot put a tenant out because he or she Is a Communist. Strangely enough. in every one of these big public housing projects where investigation has been made. right at the center or core of the tenancy is some very well acknowledged Communist or left winger tucked right into the setup. For example. there is a Communist. William Allen. in the Herman Gardens in Detroit. correspondent for the Daily Worker. who pays $46 a month for a 2bedroom apartment. The rent is actually $56.23.

What would be the difference in cost to you with respect to the cotton in Connecticut and the cotton in the cottonfields of Alabama?\" He said it was 2 cents a pound. I do not know how big a differential that is. but it indicated to me that it was large enough to make him want to turn to the source of his raw material. the cottonflelds of Alabama.

Census figures show that costs of power per unit in New England are 52 percent higher than in the country as a whole. 80 percent higher than in North Carolina. and 236 percent higher than in Tennessee. In woolens and worsteds. the rated average cost of purchased electric power in Massachusetts and Rhode Island was 75 percent in excess of the rated average in the Carolinas and Georgia. The November 1952 report of the New England Governors Committee on the Textile Industry said that the higher power costs and the relatively small development of hydroelectric power were among the factors causing the decline of the textile industry in New England the lack of new industrial establishments. This committee. headed by Prof. Seymour E. Harris. of Harvard University. pointed out that the cost of electricity as a percentage of value added in textiles has been declining. falling from 3.34 percent in 1939 to 1.86 percent in They then went on to show the great differential in power. and. in his research study on the \"Competitive Position of the New England Textile Industry\" Dr. Harris. who. I understand. is one of the outstanding economists of the country. said: It would help if New England were more hospitable to the development of hydroelectric power. It is significant that whereas there are more than 150 Federal hydroelectric projects In the country there Is not one In New England.",

My understanding is that there was written into the constitution of Maine a provision that no power generated in the State of Maine. from water resource. can be transported outside the boundaries of Maine.

Dr. Harris referred to a careful study of the migration of New England woolens and worsteds which points out that the most important single factor explaining higher power costs in the region is the high proportion of power generated by steam. In 1952. only 31 percent of the potential hydroelectric power of New England was under development or under license for development. Mr. President.

Now. the very contrary has happened. The TVA is not being relieved of any power liability there at Paducah. It is unfortunate that the President. through this directive. has ordered the Atomic Energy Commission to enter into a contract with a holding utility company for a period of 25 years to build a steam plant across the river from Memphis. Tenn.. over in west Arkansas. The people of Memphis. Tenn.. do not want this plant across the river in West Memphis because of the proximity of the plant to the city. because it will be a coalsteam plant and because of the sulfur and other objectionable factors in connection with the steamplant operation.

    "speech": "When the President made that statement he had in mind that this power be furnished by private sources. by private industry solely and exclusively. That was my idea of what was in his mind. I had not discussed it with him. This power in the TVA area is to a large degree used to supply Atomic Energy and other defense needs as well as for use through the whole zone of operations of that agency. I cannot yield further. I have only 15 minutes and I have not gotten started good yet. Now. let us look at the power picture at Paducah. TVA asked moneys for additional power production at Shawnee and for portions of two units at Gallatin. Gallatin is about 130 miles from Paducah. TVA objects to the building of a plant at West Memphis to pump into the interconnecting system 600.000 kilowatts of power on the ground that West Memphis is some 180 miles from Paducah. TVA itself fathered the idea consistently for several years and has taken similar action at this particular time in asking Congress to appropriate funds for the Fulton steam plant. which is located some 20 miles north of the city of Memphis. \"The shoe hurts the foot\" when the President of the United States decides that private industry should be called upon to furnish the 600.000 kilowatts. The annual cost for TVA to supply the power. using the rate which TVA now charges AEC at Paducah. is $19.856.000. Under the Middle South. Southern. or DixonYates proposal. the cost is $20.959.000 less Federal taxes of $820.000. or only $282.000 more than the TVA rate. The total annual cost of the power under the private contract would amount to $18.640.000. exclusive of taxes. against the TVA figure of $19.856.000-$1.216.000 less cost under the private contract -than the TVA figure when no consideration is given to the payment of taxes.

I came on the floor this afternoon to take the place of the majority leader for a few moments. while he attended another meeting. without any realization that I would come into a discussion over this AEC contract. What I have to say must necessarily be from the notes I made while I was sitting here listening. I have come to the conclusion. Mr. Speaker. that the whole discussion is like this silver dollar which I hold in my hand. The basis of the silver dollar is money. and the basis of the argument we have listened to is money and nothing else. Also. there are two sides to this silver dollar. There are very definitely two sides to the argument over the AEC contract. Mr. Speaker. I have been a member of the committee for 8 years that has been making up the budget for the TVA and also for the Atomic Energy Commission therefore. I am familiar with both sides of the argument. I have been chairman of this committee for the last 2 years. Each year we have picked up a deficit check for the TVA. One of the most interesting fairy tales that comes into the Congress at its annual sessions is that the TVA is paying back the money advanced by the Government. the assumption that the Government itself owns the property. I will discuss that more at length tomorrow. I simply point out that we have each year picked up the check for the deficit of the TVA and that now. when we take into consideration the costs of the proposed plant to be built by private industry under a contract. we must also take into consideration the offsetting cost of money which would be advanced to the TVA for the same purpose. and on which the taxpayers would have to pay interest.",

I will point out what I mean. then I will let the gentleman question me. within limitations. The gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from California laid a good deal of emphasis on the $92 million which they say the Government will spend if the contract were let by AEC. They did not mention the fact that the money to build the TVA plant would be advanced by the taxpayers of the United States. that it would be the same amount or more. approximately $100 million. and upon that money there would be paid annual interest which would in itself. with 1 or 2 other items. more than wipe out the difference in annual cost between the two plants. Now. we ought to go backand I will make this little start of the discussion todayto the fact that the TVA was created to supply energy in the territory of the Tennessee River and its tributaries. What we are talking about now is going far outside the Tennessee Valley. unless the Mississippi has become a tributary of the Tennessee. which I doubt. geographically. We find ourselves discussing first of all whether the TVA would have the legal right to go outside of this area and build a steam plant some 100 or more miles away from its area. to supply. in this case. the city of Memphis and then indirectly to supply by substitution kilowatts which could be used for the atomic energy plants. This is a legal matter. and there is a very strong feeling in the subcommittee and has been for some time that the TVA does not have that legal right. although we have in the past 2 yearsand I want to say to the gentlemen from Tennessee. properly supplied moneyto build steam plants for the furnishing of power in the Tennessee River area itself. I must say we have gone far beyond the original intent. The original intent confined the Tennessee Valley Authority to the production of hydroelectric power and such steam plants as were then operating. It authorized the TVA to sell that power. that excess hydroelectric power. if it had excess power. When the present units are finished. about 70 percent of TVA power will be produced by steam.",

If we are thinking of the merits of the Genocide Convention rather than the domestic politics of that proposal. there can be no substantial argument against it. Surely the announcement that the administration will not press for its ratification will give us little credit abroad and will deepen the cynicism with which American professions of faith are sometimes received abroad. The entire campaign against the Genocide Convention has been one based on distortions and misrepresentations. Here is a convention whose purpose is. according to its own text. to outlaw actions \"committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national. ethnical. racial. or religious group as such: (a) Killing members of the group. (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm. (c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. (e) forcibly transferring childrenof the group to another group.\" Surely there is nothing in these purposes which are not wholly consistent with the spirit of the laws of the United States and of the several States. Moreover. this convention is not selfexecuting. It requires the passage of additional legislation by the Congress to bring it into practical effect. Millions of our own citizens have indicated their support of this international agreement. It represents an international declaration of outlawry of the practices referred to.

Second. All of the 48 States have held and possessed their submerged lands. both inland and seaward. under the same rule of law. recognized for more than 100 years by the Supreme Court of the United States. Third. It would be rank discrimination against the coastal States to exclude their marginal sea lands from this rule of State ownership while continuing its application to the far greater bodies of lands beneath inland waters and the Great Lakes. Fourth. The rule of State ownership of lands under inland waters and the Great Lakes grew from the common law rule of State ownership of the lands under the marginal sea. Fifth. The coastal States have been in complete good faith in their possession and ownership of the sea bed within their historic boundaries for more than 100 years. Sixth.

Whether in high or low place. whether collectively or individually. service to his fellow man through a daily application of the virtues of the Christian faith has been his shield and buckler. It is my fervent prayer. in which. I am sure. my colleagues heartily join. that Dr. Harris may live many. many years more to continue his great work. embodied in the lines of the old hymn: A charge to keep I have. A God to glorify. A never dying soul to save And fit it for the sky. Dr. Harris. we congratulate you today on the 30th anniversary of a life so well spent in our midst.",

I wish to conclude with one statement from the report of the select committee concerning the responsibility of a Member of the Senate when he is under charges before any of its committees. Here is a statement which should go down in history. If it is not the rule now. it should be. It goes back to the days when God wrote with His own finger on the tablets of stone the Ten Commandments. It grows out of the basic concepts of Christianity. The principle has developed through the English common.law. and it stems from the best traditions of our law and government and of the governments of the free world. It should be guide for men in high office. I read: It is the opinion of the select committee that when the personal honor and official conduct of a Senator of the United States are in question before a duly constituted committee of the Senate. the Senator involved owes a duty to himself. his State. and to the Senate to appear promptly and cooperate fully when called by a Senate committee charged with the responsibility of Inquiry. This must be the rule if the dignity. honor. authority. and powers of the Senate are to be respected and maintained. This duty could not be and was not fullfilled by questioning the authority and jurisdiction of the subcommittee. by accusing its members of the dishonest expenditure of public funds. or even by charging that the subcommittee was permitting itself to be used to serve the cause of communism. When persons in high places fail to set and meet high standards. the people lose faith. If our people lose faith. our form of government cannot long endure. Let me add. Mr. President. that when a Senator takes the oath of office to defend and to support the Constitution of the United States. that pledge is not merely with reference to a documen containing certain words. It goes to the living Constitution. That living Constitution consists not only of words but the Office of the President. the Supreme Court. the Senate. and the House of Representatives which those words .create. When a Senator does or says things which injure those institutions. he is violating his oath to defend and uphold the living Constitution of the United States. Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

I am entirely in accord with the statement by the President that in the use of our forests and publicdomain lands \"the people are entitled to expect that their timber. minerals. streams and water supply. wildlife and recreational values should be safeguarded. improved. and made available not only for this but for future generations\" and also that \"at the same time public lands should be made available for their best use under conditions that promote stability for communities and individuals and encourage full development of the resources involved.\" I am confident that the people of the Mountain States will cooperate wholly with a sound program that will bring about range improvement and the protection and development of our watersheds.

Vanderpoel which appeared in the Chicago SunTimes of April 4. 1954: TAx Brus WOULD SPEED SELFPENSIONING TRUSTS (By Robert P. Vanderpoel) There are identical bills in Congress. one introduced by a Republican from Ohio. Representative THOMAS A. JENKINS. and the other by a Democrat from New York. Representative EUGENE J. KEOGH. which have thus far attracted attention only in technical circles. However. they are of such importance that they should be understood by all. Their purpose is \"to encourage the establishment of voluntary pension plans by individuals.\" To that end they would give tax relief to all workers not now covered by pension plans set up by their employers and to all selfemployed individuals who would participate in voluntary pension plans under arrangements with banks. insurance companies. or trust institutions. As it is. the individual employed by a corporation which has a pension plan either partly or entirely paid for by the company has a tax advantage. The funds credited to him in the pension fund contributed by the employer. plus the earnings of the fund. are tax free at the time the contribution is made. They are taxable at the time the pension is paid but presumably at such time the income of the recipient will be smaller and might be either entirely tax exempt or taxable at a lower rate. Quite obviously the selfemployed and those working with concerns that have no pension plan are thus put at a disadvantage. Their individual savings for oldage are taxed at todays high rates and the earnings on such savings also are taxed at current rates.",

His broadcast caused great concern among the parents of the children who have already been inoculated with this vaccine. We have been assured by the United States Public Health Service. the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. and several pharmaceutical firms who are engaged in making the vaccine that it is as safe as modern scientific tests can make it. Public Health Service officials have stated that the vaccine goes through 9 tests in 3 different laboratories to make sure that it contains no live virus before it is released for inoculations.

I think we should consider this question of seeing that the veteran is not imposed upon by the builder and that he will obtain the house he contracted for. And a reliable builder. I should think. would have no objection to signing this warranty because if he expects to do the job. as he has contracted to do it. the warranty would mean nothing to him. I agree with the gentleman from Alabama it is a matter that should be given some study in the future in order that we may pass adequate laws to protect the veterans. I might also say that this is an extension of the housing program of the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. It is a program which in its inception was called socialistic. Now that it has been in operation for 20 years. no one would deny that it has been beneficial to the people. Housing is essential to our people.

Generally that amount is 10 percent of the contract price. There Is no reason in the world why such a provision should not be written into law. or I see no reason why the Administrator cannot rule than 10 percent must he held back until the plans and specifications have been completely complied with. I see no other way to force a shyster contractor. as they have been referred to. to do the job according to plans and specifications. other than to hold back a part of the pay for that contract. And certainly they cannot object to it because unless they want to cheat. and I said before. it is standard practice all over this country in private industry. and good reliable contractors expect it. So I would recommend that the Committee on Banking and Currency of the House and Senate insist that at least 10 percent of the contract price shall be held back until such time as the owner is completely satisfied that he is getting the house that he has bargained for. according to the plans and specifications.",

I suggest that they consider signing this petition at an early date. Petitions like this. of course. can only be signed while the House is in session. To the argument that is made that the proposal is inflationary. I desire to say that this question was not raised during the time the policy was in effect to support Government securities at par for more than 10 years preceding 1951. including all of World War II. during the most dangerous inflationary period in the history of the United States of America. So if it was not raised then. why should it be raised now? Furthermore. the action of the Federal Reserve Board last week in reducing reserve requirements will permit the banks to create $6 billion in new money on their books. and if the actual money is called for. it will be obtained from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing here in Washington and delivered to those who request it. This is certainly several times more inflationary than supporting Government bonds at par. Since the Federal Reserve System decided to reverse its restrictive policy. it should have used its own instrument. the Open Markets Policy Committee. to ease credit and at the same time it should have announced that bonds hereafter will be supported at par. It is senseless to talk about relying on a socalled free market for money when the United States Government. which is all the people. is by far the most dominant controlling force in the money market since it is by far the largest borrower and the largest debtor.

I cannot support this bill to provide for another Assistant Postmaster General. Mr. Chairman. just a short time ago today a bill flitted through the House with the greatest of ease calling for the expenditure of $150.000 to stuff the skins of a bunch of foreigners with liquor and food. Through the years Congress has compelled American taxpayers to dig up more than $600.000 to send junketing Congressmen who were delegates to this Interparliamentary Union over to Europe. where they were wined and dined. Now it is the foreigners turn to come to Washington and get theirs. I ask the Members of this House. When are you going to do something about economy that you talk about so much?

I cannot help but feel suspicious about this proposal because of what has happened since last January. It indicates to me a very serious trend away from the merit system in the Federal service and a return to the spoils system in the Post Office and the other. agencies of the Federal Government. I am suspicious. too. at the decisions made by the Postmaster General and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission in throwing out some 1.700 civilservice registers throughout the country for postmaster positions. I do not think it is necessary to create more topsalary jobs if it is true that thousands of Federal employees have been dismissed. It should require less toplevel jobs. not more. I am also concerned over the steps being taken to tear down the merit system under the guise of strengthening it. President Eisenhower before he was elected proiised that employees in the Federal service had no reason to fear the loss of their jobs. Today the morale of Federal workers is low because of administration policy. I believe that the administration should be given authority to carry out its program. but propocals like this seem very confusing to some of us who have heard so much criticism about the growing bureaucracy in the Federal service.",

In the few years since that date. atomic technology in the United States has reached a stage where the use of atomic energy for Industrial purposes can reasonably be foreseen. Of the various uses of atomic energy which in time will be made. one of the closest to practical realization is the utilization of atomic energy in the generation of electric power. Until now the sources of economical power have been coal. oil. gas. and falling water. Power prices in our country have been lowest where these natural resources have abounded. The development of atomic energy as a new source of power means that within a period of about 10 years. highcost power areas may have made available to them at reasonable prices power produced from fissionable materials. Within 20 years. power from atomic energy may be as economical in any area as power now produced from conventional fuels.",

Syngman Rhee. of Korea. I have seen and come to know Dr. Rhee on three trips to Koreain 1949. 1951. and 1953. I understand and appreciate his wonderful devotion to his country and his sincerity. The editorial to which I have referred appropriately points out that despite the continuous provocation of several hundred thousand Red Chinese aggressors who daily violate the truce in Korea. Dr. Rhee has faithfully kept the truce. And in the face of a campaign of calumny throughout the world he and his Government conducted a fair and peaceful ballot last week despite the fact that the results were barely favorable to President Rhees party. And although the United Nations itself considers the South Korean Government to be the legally constituted Government for all Korea. Mr. Rhees Foreign Minister has informed the Conference at Geneva that. in the interests of peace. South Korea would agree to countrywide elections despite the fact that their constitution calls for no election for another 4 years. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that this welldeserved tribute to Dr. Rhee be printed in the body of the RECORD as a part of my remarks.",

For the past 2 months Charles L. Watkins. the Parliamentarian of the Senate. has not been at the Clerks desk to answer our many questions. On March 20. Charlie was stricken with a virus infection which has caused his first absence from the Senate for illness during a period of service of almost half a century. Mr. Watkins entered the service of the Senate in 1904 after his graduation from the Law College of the University of Arkansas. He came to Washington with the late Senator James P. Clarke. of Arkansas. and several years later became the Senators private secretary. After serving the Senate in various other positions at the desk he became the Parliamentarian of the Senate in 1935. He also acted as Parliamentarian for the organization of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. as the outstanding Parliamentarian of our day. On December 1 of this year Charlie will have completed 50 years of service and will have served under 11 Vice Presidents. By virtue of his important duty he has not only witnessed but played a leading part in the molding of the pattern of our legislative history. I am very happy to report that he Is now recovering from his recent illness at Emergency Hospital.

They are using it without any restraint of any kind whatsoever before letting what is left flow back into the Treasury. In doing that they are paying this man who is head of a New York bank $60.000 a year out of that money.

One of the reasons the Federal Reserve Act was passed was to put a damper on local banks sending their money to New York to be used on the stock market. Now. of course. that was stopped.

But I will say to my distinguished friend that I have permission to revise and extend and will put further facts and figures in the RECORD.

We are already paying interest on this nearly $4 billion at 3 percent. or $120 million a year. and here you want to go out and borrow more money from the very same banks that have our money. and pay more interest. I want you to think about that. it just does not make sense to me. Secretary Humphrey made it clear to Members of Congress in July and August last year that the Government retains substantial deposits in all 11.000 banks where deposits are kept. One case was cited where a little bank had some $70.000 to $250.000 deposit. with the understanding from the Secretary of the Treasury that it would not be reduced below $70.000. It should be pointed out that the Treasury does not draw checks on the 11.000 banks. or any of them. to pay Government bills. When the money is needed. the banks are requested to turn a certain percentage of their deposits into the Federal Reserve bank serving the area. Then checks are given on the Federal Reserve bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act. the Federal Reserve banks are fiscal agents of the Government. When this was determined the subtreasuries then existing over the country were abolished. It was never contemplated that the Secretary of the Treasury would make deposits in local commercial banks. but it was contemplated that all money belonging to the Government would be immediately deposited with the Federal Reserve banks in the same way it had formerly been held in subtreasuries offices in various parts of the country. which were abolished in favor of the Federal Reserve banks. The New York Times of January 26. 1954. contained the following news item concerning the call for funds by the Treasury:",

May I correct the gentleman that the Treasury does not draw on these 11.000 banks. on your bank or my bank. for any of that money. not one penny. The nine subtreasuries were abolished in 1913 and the Federal Reserve banks made the fiscal agent of the Government. All of this money has got to go into the Federal Reserve System and the checks are drawn on the Federal Reserve System. and the money in the commercial banks can be sent there overnight.

I have never sought to qualify as an expert. but I say when you draw the account of the Government down to the point where you have less than a 10day supply. you are getting reckless with the affairs of the Government.

The Commodity Credit Corporation. created by the Congress. with a lending capacity of $6.750.000.000. is confronted with an impairment of capital for which we are responsible. It involves a loss of the Corporation. Now all the Committee on Appropriations is doing is to replenish the coffers of the Commodity Credit Corporation to the extent that those coffers have been impaired.

That is because it is expected that more of the surplus commodities will have to be taken over by the Commodity Credit Corporation. As I say. we voted for it. We have to meet that responsibility.

The second absolutely new proposal is for a socalled special weapons program. It really is not a program. I have read what purports to be the justification. and it is clear that the Administrator does not have anything definite in mind in this connection. and neither do the others who testified in support of this item. The original item was one of $250 million. Now it has been reduced to $50 million. No one has yet justified it on any specific basis. The idea is that perchance in connection with something which might be developed. the United States taxpayers should provide aid. Under the present law and under the provisions of the pending bill. the President has and will have authority to transfer 15 percent of the funds herein appropriated or previously appropriated in similar bills and yet unexpended. Therefore. ample flexibility is provided for such development. if found worth while. I wonder whether the chairman of the committee will not accept this amendment. I shall not state the names of those to whom I have talked about this item. but I have gone to certain members of the Foreign Relations Committee and have asked them what they believe to be the weakest spot in this bill. They have pointed to this spot. This item can be eliminated without hurting any program now in existence. and I believe this item can be eliminated without hurting any program in the future.",

The bill was approved by the President on July 14. 1952. There was a political atmosphere in the country at the time. The political conventions had been meeting in Chicago. It came on at that time.

The President had the choice of accepting it at the time. or of delaying the use of the money appropriated by the bill for necessary military instrumentalities. Under the circumstances. what was he to do? Was he to veto it. and thus prevent the military installations having the funds needed. or should he call Congress back at that time? He was under a very practical difficulty. Consequently that situation cannot be cited. in my judgment. as a precedent. However. we come to grips with it now. I may say that the question came up in a less complicated form. in H. R. 6839. which was vetoed on the 19th of July 1952. It was a bill to provide and extend the authority of the Postmaster General to lease quarters for postoffice purposes. and there the question came up without too much complication. and in a very short but I think very effective message the President of the United States vetoed the bill.

In this instance Congress proposes to surrender that function to the Postmaster General with regard to post offices. and I assume to the Administrator of the General Services Administration with regard to other buildings. If Congress surrenders that power it does make sense that it should retain some right to examine what is being done. The same thing was done. to a limited extent. with respect to Armed Forces construction. In a completely different field. in the field of reorganization. Congress surrendered its power to pass on the organization of executive agencies. but Congress retained more or less a veto power. to give Congress an opportunity to check on the activities of the executive.

The article indicates that the White House itself is involved in this raid on civilservice jobs within the Government. Certainly the Washington Star cannot be considered a Democratic newspaper. My observation indicates that it has always leaned more the other way. The article to which I refer appeared. however. in the Washington Star of Thursday. August 5. 1954. and was written by their authority on Government affairs. Mr. Joseph Young. Mr. Young has had long years of experience of covering news involving Government agencies and civilservice employees. He is well qualified to present a true and factual picture on this matter. It would seem to me that the nonpartisan National Civil Service League should show its nonpartisanship and give vigorous support now to the protection of the merit system in Government. It is difficult to explain the reason for the tardiness of this organization in failing to criticize the Eisenhower administration in its effort to return to the spoils system in Government employment. The White House itself is directly involved in this effort to destroy civil service. Only the adverse publicity given to a White House order prevented a major patronage raid on civilservice jobs. Perhaps a little more adverse publicity will serve to protect the civilservice system from Republican attacks.",

This view may be prompted by the slowness with which our highway needs are being met in many parts of the country today. Twolane roads which were constructed more than 30 years ago are still in use. sometimes as main traffic arteries between large communities. Turnpike construction. speeded up in many parts of the country. is still available in only relatively few areas by contrast with increasing traffic demands. A5842 President Eisenhowers proposal that the Nation ought to plan on a $50 billion highway development in the next 10 years is realistic approach with everything to commend it. From the viewpoint of civilian traffic. every motorist understands the personal satisfaction of traveling safely and reasonably rapidly over sixlane highways. and the frustration of crawling home at peak hours over incredibly slowmoving clotted roads. This factor is only one element of the total picture. Military needs. preparation for any eventuality. certainly dictate prompt action and the expansion of cities into suburban areas which has been proceeding at an amazing rate everywhere makes the job mandatory.

It is unfortunate that the legislation as passed did not accomplish all that he desired. However. with the exception of the public housing section. which fell short of what the President desired. the law did establish many worthwhile features that will greatly benefit citizens of modest income and be helpful to them in procuring either new or used homes. The law goes further than any previous legislation in providing ways and means that will facilitate the financing of homes for those whose income has not heretofore been sufficient to meet the requirements. The President rightly refers to this as a major advance toward meeting Americas housing needs. In my judgment. good housing constitutes one of the most essential elements in building a strong America. Consequently. all through the years I have given my full support to every effort that has been made to improve living conditions. and with particular reference to slum clearance. It is regrettable that in this latter category so little has been accomplished. considering the many years the subject has been before Congress. Even today some conditions exist in our cities. large and small. that are unbelievable. Too many individuals have a feeling that all is well because in their own little world everything is all right. But. seeing is believing. and I have seen. I have made it my business to see. I have been astounded by some of the unbelievable conditions that I have found to exist in my own city of 125.000 population. Having seen the need with my own eyes.

    "speech": "Mr. President. this amendment is for the purpose of averaging the excessprofits tax. Determination of excessprofits tax on a yearbyyear basis has caused serious inequities for taxpayers earning more than their excessprofits credits in some years and less in others. Some corporations have paid excessprofits tax even though their total income for the period the tax was in effect was less than their total excessprofits credits. A taxpayers excess profits have not been measured fairly if he is required to pay excessprofits tax for some years while he has an unused normalearnings credit for other years. The only fair method of measuring excess profits is to total a taxpayers income over the entire life of the tax. and to compare this amount with the total of the taxpayers normal earnings credits during the life of the tax. It was not practical to do this while the excessprofits tax was still in effect. Now. however. the tax has expired after 31/2 years. The short period the tax was in effect is a reasonable and practical averaging period. and in fairness to taxpayers with fluctuating incomes. their income subject to excessprofits tax should be limited to the excess of their average excess profits net income over their average normal earnings credit. As a policy matter. the complete fairness of the averaging proposal is readily apparent. As to the technical aspects of drafting the proposal. however. the tax should not be less than the tax which would be imposed by permitting an unused excessprofits credit to be carried backward or forward to all other years subject to the tax.

R. 8300 could enable a taxpayer to subdivide and sell a tract of property owned by him without having the proceeds of the sale treated as having accrued in the ordinary course of trade or business. and therefore the proceeds would be considered as a capital gain. provided certain conditions were met. One condition is that the taxpayer had held the property for 5 years. Another is that he had held the tract for some purpose other than subdivision or sale. The third provision. the one to which my amendment is directed. is that no substantial improvements which would enhance the value of the property had been made by the taxpayer. While there is no definition of substantial improvement in the bill. there is a statement in the committee report. I believe. which says that a substantial improvement would be confined to a dirt road. The reason the matter has come to my attention is that when farmers and other people who hold property at the edge of a city or small town find their property surrounded by city property. they are then forced to sell their property or to attempt to hold it and pay heavy taxes. The statement has been made by some of them that the provision as to substantial improvements is so limited that it would actually prevent their selling the property at the marketable price. considering other property in the vicinity. The amendment which I have offered would provide that they could make improvements such as for roads or for water or for sewers. provided that the Commissioner determined that those improvements would bring the sale price up only to the marketable price in the vicinity. I wish to make it clear that I am not certain that the amendment which I have offered is not too expensive. On the other hand. I believe the definition of the committee is too limited. I am offering my amendment in the hope that the chairman of the committee will accept it and that in the conference committee he may be able to work out some definition of substantial improvement which will be a fair definition for property owners in that type of situation.",

There is no mention on that boulder of his having been President. no mention of the earthly honors which came to him.

It is my belief that in our intellectual combat with the Communist philosophy of a stateowned. statedirected economy we should not hesitate on every occasion to crusade for our principles of free individual choice and free economy based upon private ownership of the processes of production and distribution. Mr. Speaker. my attention has been drawn to an address by the president of the National Association of Manufacturers in Paris last week advancing the philosophy of a dynamic expanding private enterprise economy. I was particularly impressed with three passages of Mr. McClellans remarks to the American Club in Paris. They are: Above everything else. we must have sound investment of venture capital. Every American businessman knows that our economy cannot remain dynamic without new investment any more than a human body can retain life without constant nourishment to make new blood. When I say investment I mean both domestic and foreign investment. On this subject Im happy to have the honor of telling our European friends that businessmen at home have only praise for the Presidents liberal foreign economic policy which embraces private investment abroad. They recognize that building up international trade and foreign investment promote an expanding and prosperous economyand uphold the principle of free enterprise at home. But. as business In America can grow and develop only in the proper atmosphere. so must foreign governments. of their own volition. create a favorable climate for the investment of funds from abroad. American venture capital must have the protection of political stability and it must have guaranties against property nationalization and the assurance of monetary convertibility. Mr. Speaker. under leave heretofore granted. I include the text of Mr. McClellans address at this point in my remarks:",

Other rules have been offered and are being considered by the Committee on Rules and Administration. of which the distinguished junior Senator from Indiana is chairman.

I suggestand this is a matter which I have discussed with the junior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. McCARTYIthat until the ad hoe committee acts and its recommendations are made known. the Senate should postpone action by the present Subcommittee on Investigations.

During the course of the recent hearings. in dealing with one phase of the investigatory problems. repeatedly we were called to face a problem generally known by Members of the Senate. and that is that one of the spots where our security program was weak was the failure to have developed in our methods up t3 now an effective means for utilizing reports that the FBI was carefully. effectively. and efficiently producing as a result of its field studies. We found that. after the FBI had made its studies and reports to the varicus departments there is an understandable reluctance on the part of administrative heads to take prompt action with regard to the reports they have. The Department head is inexperienced in evaluating such reports. It is a difficult decision to make. So there is a tendency to defer and delay making a decision. The Senator from South Dakota has on his desk a bill that he has worked over which contains a proposal for meeting this problem. and I understand that the President. also. by executive action. may make some kind of determination which will reach this particular point.

The most constructive thing that could result from a debate at this time would be. at long last. to find a solution to the problem created by the failure to act promptly and effectively on FBI security reports. Up to now no effective or intelligent manner has been found for utilizing the FBI reports which are submitted to heads of departments. It is easy to criticize a Cabinet member or the head of a bureau. when an FBI report has cast doubts and suspicions. and has made allegations against an employee in his department. It is easy to criticize him for not summarily dismissing such employee. But I suppose many of us in that position. if we received such a report. would also consider making such a decision a distasteful duty. Human nature being what it is. it is easy to delay and defer and put such a report in the file. As a result. we had the Harry Dexter White and Alger Hiss developments. as well as others. So. if some method were developedand I am sure we are intelligent enough to devlop oneI am confident a method under the executive head could be evolved for correcting this weakness. If that is not the proper approach. perhaps something along the line the Senator from South Dakota has suggested would be proper. My proposal would create a group on evaluation which would be skillful and determined in evaluating reports the FBI produced. and then make action on the part of the executive agency mandatory. There would be little work for executive investigating committees to do if a method were found for evaluating reports produced by the FBI. and then requiring prompt corrective action.

It would be my hope that the proposed committee suggested by the Senator from New Jersey. if it is created. would have broad enough power to make recommendations in this area. after consultation not only with the appropriate Members of Congress. but also with the proper authorities within the executive branch. There should be a definition of what is the proper responsibility of the executive in connection with personnel reports. and what is the proper authority of Congress. in connection with such personnel reports. We have had arguments and quibbles on that question in the American Congress since the days of George Washington. It was not so serious then. but when we are confronted with a worldwide conspiracy such as communism. it is important. The problem was not serious prior to our recognition of Russia. but now Russia has an Embassy on 16th Street which \"doubles in brass\" as an organization having diplomatic immunity and at the same time being an outpost for spies.

The letter from the Veterans Administration discusses the conditions precedent to eligibility for treatment for serviceconnected and nonserviceconnected disabilities. However. as pointed out above. this veteran had been previously treated without any question as to the status of his disability. The committee does not desire that this determination be considered a precedent. and it does not by inference or otherwise wish to reflect upon any individual or branch of the Veterans Administration. The committee therefore recommends favorable consideration of the bill.",

For a second offense of rape the sentence is 7 years. For a second offense of assault with a dangerous weapon on a police officer. and for illegal possession of a pistol. as well as for illegal possession of burglar tools. the minimum sentence is 1 year. As I pointed out the other day. 42 of the 48 States have mandatory minimum sentences of more than that for each of these crimes for the first offense. The proposed legislation in the form in which it will be after the amendments which have been submitted and accepted are adopted. will provide that the mandatory minimum sentence shall apply only in the case of a second conviction..

The other provision would be for a minimum of 1 year for assault upon a police officer with a dangerous weapon. for possession of a pistol illegally. and for possession of burglary tools where a second conviction is proved. So it seems to me that the committee has agreed upon a very liberal and very reasonable provision for second offenses only. Certainly if we are to take some corrective measures to improve the situation in the District of Columbia. where the crime rate is reported to be 2 12 times the national average. we must provide some strict penalties.

United States Senate. Washington. D. C. My DEAR SENATOR TAFT: We who are opposing the bill to give away the federally owned offshore oil to a few States (S. J. Res. 13) are very anxious that the necessary debate on this bill. which is so vital to a public understanding of the tremendous Issues and amounts which are at stake. should not be used by the majority leadership to delay the discussion of the economiccontrols bill. We believe that the public is not yet fully informed about the offshoreoil bill and there are many among us who have thorough and completely germane speeches to deliver about it. But we also recognize that it is Important that the Congress take action very soon on priorities and allocations. credit facilities. and rent control before the present authorizations expire on April 30. Failure to deal with these subjects would create havoc. particularly in our large cities. and would be a defeat for the program of the President which we want to support. We therefore declare our readiness to lay aside the debate on the offshoreoil bill upon the completion of Senator HILLs speech and to resume debate on this topic only after the controls bill has been disposed of one way or another. Then. when debate on the offshoreoil bill is again taken up. we would be glad to agree that the speeches already made on this subject can be charged against the number allowed each Senator. We therefore would not gain any parliamentary advantage from such an arrangement. We believe that this is a satisfactory method of expediting the work of the Senate which we. who are opposing the giveaway bill. are happy to offer.

Of course I shall do nothing of the kind so far as I have any power to make the determination.

They assume the responsibility for the expiration of the Defense Controls Act. to such extent as it does expire on April 30. I certainly shall oppose any attempt whatever to lay aside consideration of the pending joint resolution until we have finished with it. and Senators might as well understand that now. Mr. President. on the joint resolution now pending before the Senate. up through Wednesday night. at which time there had been more than 2 weeks of debate on it. the proponents have used 22.000 lines of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. and the opponents have used 33.000 lines.

I ask unanimous consent with reference to Senate Joint Resolution 13 that beginning Wednesday. April 22. no Senator shall speak more than once or more than onehalf hour on the resolution or any substitute or amendment thereto or on any appeal or on any question of order. that if no vote is obtained by Thursday.

In the course of that investigation we could find only a relatively small supply of bauxite in the United States of America. The chief supply comes from the Caribbean areafrom Jamaica. Dutch Guiana.

Under the bill as it now stands. we grant a great favor to 1 or 2 of the large aluminum companies. but at the same time we strike a death blow at the others. The 1 or 2 large aluminum companies have the Arkansas deposits and other deposits in the United States sewed up. but even then. those companies are able to obtain in the United States only about 30 percent of the necessary supply. and the rest must be imported from the Caribbean area.

If we do we will produce a far greater cost in the armament program and in all other rehabilitation costs. if our civilization survives after the war.

I say to the people on the other side of the aisle. who are trying to .meet the promise to balance the budget. that the only way they will ever do it and reduce taxes is to find some way to cut mutual security costs. The only way to cut security costs is not by closing your eyes and saying. \"We havent got any problem.\" but by developing a trade system with the rest of the free world.

This leaves $8.500.000 available for contribution to the United Nations technical assistance program for the calendar year 1954. as compared with the $12.750.000 authorized. It is my understanding that. inasmuch as the full United States contribution will not be required by the United Nations until well along in the calendar year 1954. the committee did not wish to recommend the appropriation at this time of an amount which would not be required in full until a considerably later date. I hope it is agreed that the President may properly request the $4.250.000 balance in the form of a supplemental appropriation at a later date. and that in the interim the United States representative at the United Nations may pledge the $12.750.000 authorized. provided he makes it abundantly clear that this pledge is subject to the appropriation by this Congress of the amount not appropriated.

Sixtyseven countries have participated and contributed to it. It has been an asset to United States foreign policy. It has helped nonCommunist countries we could not reach with our bilateral agreements. It has been a strong arm in the effort to ameliorate hunger. disease. and poverty. the causes which encourage the advent of communism. It creates good will for the United States as the people of underdeveloped countries are helped by our experts. A farm county agent. like those we have throughout this country. or our doctors. our sanitation experts. teachers. and engineers probably create more good will for the United States in underdeveloped countries than millions of dollars would do.

    "speech": "Mr. \ufffd President. the amendment proposes that an overall limitation of $4.014.023.788 on the amount available for expenditure. I propose that figure because it is the amount of additional authorizations the House has proposed. Referring to page 6 of the committee report. it will be noted that the difference between the House and the Senate figures is $548.630.023. My amendment would make the amount in additional funds to be provided by this Nation under the pending bill the same as that approved by the House. The House had a rather complicated way of reducing the amount of expenditures available. in that most of the House reduction came through requiring funds already appropriated but not committed to be used for purposes proposed under the mutualassistance bill of this year. My amendment does not employ the precise language used by the House. I think it would be better. in conference. that discretion be allowed. so that the House and Senate could adjust differences. item by item. but that the overall amount appropriated by the Senate would be the same amount as the overall amount appropriated by the House. Following that plan it would be possible to make the best advice of the administration available to the conferees. to enable them to determine precisely which items should be reduced and which should not be reduced. and there would be very little quarrel. in conference. so far the overall amount was concerned. because it would be the same in both hills.",

In my own judgment. there is a billion dollars in this bill that is waste. from which we will never get a dollars worth of benefit. There is so much covered up in the bill. listed under the title Military Assistance. and when we sift it out we find there is a great deal of economic aid and assistance covered up in it. I do not believe the Senate would want to vote for it if it were exposed and laid out on the table in front of us. I am perfectly willing to go along with some military aid. where discretion is used in spending the money so as to get dollar value received in collective security. But for the past 5 or 6 years we have been pouring out money for Europe *for economic aid. We have rehabilitated the economies of some countries to the point where their productive capacity is from 30 to 50 percent in excess of their productive capacity before the war. I may say to the distinguished Senator that if we take the case of Great Britain we shall find that in the item for military aid for Great Britain in this bill there is included $100 million of economic aid. That is not exposed. it is not in there for us to see. but it is there. Much of it will be used f6r the purchase of agricultural commodities or the products of agricultural commodities. But I will say to the distinguished Senator that we are still financing the economy of Europe in order to help them keep a balanced budget while we continue to pile up mounting deficits of our own in this country. I am opposed to it. Those nations can stand on their own feet. and they should. Economic aid should not be appropriated in the name of military assistance.

At the particular time I was unavoidably detained from the floor of the House. If I had been present I would have voted in support of the resolution. I am conscious of the opposition to the proposed investigation of certain foundations. education. philanthropic. et cetera. contemplated by the resolution. With full respect to those who hold contrary views. I am of the opinion that no other committee of the House can at this time conduct precisely the kind of inquiry that is unquestionably required to explore the wide ramifications of the activities of many such foundations. There is much more than subversion involved in this question. There is much more than an ordinary question of tax exemption. The device of the foundation is one of the most significant economic and social developments of our times. If it further extends itself throughout the economy. multiplying greatly in number as it has been doing. steadily expanding its influence in the educational. social. cultural. and commercial life of the Nation. as it has so manifestly been doing. while lifting literally billions of dollars out of the national tax levy. it is clear that there will ensue very many undesirable changes in the entire economy. The influence of these foundations has grown and spread in recent years in a veritably fabulous. though quite frequently inconspicuous and unheralded manner. and the time is at hand. I believe. when. in view of developments known to many Members of the House and giving concern to very many Americans for one reason or other. the Congress should move to explore the whole question in a penetrating and thoroughgoing way. I have abundant confidence that under the leadership of my able and distinguished friend. the gentleman from Tennessee . that this investigation will be fairly and impartially conducted. that it will consider all germane areas affecting this Government and this great economic system. the security of the Nation. the equities of all our American taxpayers and bring back a report that will be entirely just and fair to the foundations as well as indicative of the measures and remedies necessary. if any. to bring this powerful significant device into proper alinement with our free institutions.",

Since I shall be serving as a member of the United States delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations this fall. I am very much interested in the recommendation of the Committee on Appropriations on the administrations request for the United Nations technicalassistance program. I note that the committee has allowed $9.957.621 of the $17.958.000 authorized for the program for fiscal year 1955. I understand this is to cover the amount pledged last year by representatives of the United States to the United Nations for the calendar year 1954. for carrying out the multilateral program. No funds are provided for the calendar year 1955. I should appreciate having the distinguished chairman of the committee clear up certain language in one paragraph in the committee report. which I do not fully understand. The language is as follows: This appropriation is made with the understanding that no further pledge shall be made to the United Nations for the expanded technicalassistance program by any representative of the United States Government without prior authorization by the Congress of the United States. I am entirely in accord with that statement. but I desire to be certain as to its meaning. so that those who are planning to attend the General Assembly this year can be governed by the interpretation made by the chairman of the committee. Am I correct in assuming that at the conference which is to be held at the United Nations this fall during the General Assembly. the United States representative may tentatively commit the $8 million already authorized in the mutual security bill for the first half of the calendar year 1955. subject to the appropriation of funds?",

Beyond that. we have indicated our intention during the interim to study the situation and the various elements which enter into it. so that as of the first of the year we shall be prepared to pass more intelligently and accurately on the necessity for the rest of the authorized amount. The matter about which the committee and a great many other persons in Congress are concerned is that it is not desired to have representatives of the executive department. or their successors or predecessors. who will attend the United Nations meeting. pledge something which will commit Congress and the country to expenditures. until the respective committees of Congress. and Congress itself. shall have had an opportunity to pass upon them.

Of course. that is entirely correct. but what we are fearful of is that the pending measure. if passed in its present form and containing its present language. would have that effect. The Senator has spoken with great eloquence about his fear of the claim of paramount rights by the Federal Government within the respective States. and I desire to point out that. .throughout the hearings. and ever since this subject has been before the Senate. opponents of the legislation have always repudiated the idea that they were intending to claim. or were trying to claim. that the Government had ownership or paramount rights with respect to the streams or inland bodies of water. I think it was made perfectly clear by the testimony in the hearings. and by repeated statements on the floor of the Senate. that we were not attempting to claim anything of that nature. but we are fearful. nevertheless. that under the language of the pending measure. an effort might be made to write a new definition of the doctrine of the navigability of rivers which would have the effect of depriving the Federal Government of the right to go upon the navigable rivers for the purpose of carrying out programs for the development of Federal works on them. I notice that in section 7 of the pending measure there has not been included the language of the Federal Power Act of 1920. which contains a definition of the navigability of our rivers.

The reason why the specific exemption of the Federal Power Act was not placed in the joint resolution at the particular place designated by him. namely. in section 7. is because the Federal Power Commission and its advisers had been before the various committees. and had asked to be fully protected by the inclusion of subsection (d) of section 3. and also by another provision relative to waters. which is found in another subsection of section 3. which we do not need to discuss here. unless the distinguished Senator desires that we do so. But they had two requests to make. which they thought would completely protect their jurisdiction. and those requests have been written into the language of the pending measure. and have teen retained. In the drafting of the final measure by the committee. the committee members asserted again that they desired certain language as requested by the Federal Power Commission. and that language is now contained in the pending measure. They did not want it included at the place to which the Senator has adverted. At that particular place. in section 7. there is a blanket reservation to the effect that nothing in the joint resolution shall be deemed to amend. modify. or repeal certain other acts. The Senator from Florida would have to refer to his notes in order to state what all those acts are. but the principal ones are the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the Flood Control Act of 1944. and there is included not only the reservation of those 2 acts. but also of all acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto. The Senator from Florida states again that. if we cannot rely upon the statement of the Federal Power Commissioners themselves. and their learned professional adviser. as to when they are fully protected. then we are in a difficult position in trying to serve our Nation.

The important part of that description. so far as this discussion is concerned. is that when it came to the Gulf of Mexico the boundary of Louisiana on the south was described in this manner: . Thence bounded by the said Gulf to the place of beginning. including all islands within 3 leagues of the coast. It is to be noted that the Territory of Orleans. authorized to form a State of the Union. extended only to the Gulf. .The islands were added. out to 3 leagues from the coast. but there was no suggestion that any part of the Gulf itself was to become a part of the State of Louisiana. That fact was further confirmed in the act of admission of the State of Louisiana on April 8. 1812. The first act was the enabling act. The second act was the act for the admission. April 8. 1812. There again the same language was usedThence bounded by the said Gulf to the place of beginning. In other words. as nearly as I can understand the language from a laymans point of view. the State of Louisiana was cut off at the Gulf of Mexico on the south.",

I was seeking to have an amendment by which we would not get into the question of the control over the use of the funds by the States. but whereby we would simply make a per capita distribution on the basis of the children of school age. I also recognized that if. perchance. the amendment should be adopted. it would go to conference with the House of Representatives. and it would be possible there to spell out the purposes a little more fully. if that were desired. My second thought was that if we could have the amendment adopted on the simplest possible terms. even if the aid were limited to the common schools of the States. that in itself would relieve the burden on the treasuries of the common school districts. and also would lessen the demands within the States for supplemental appropriations for education. with the result that the revenues which otherwise would normally be applied to the common schools. could be applied to the specific purposes the Senator from Alabama has in mind. Of course the Senator from Alabama is familiar with the operations of the BankheadJones Act. He will recall that when it was proposed that 25 percent of the revenues from the landutilization projects be made available for return to the States for school and road purposes. there were many Members of Congress who wanted the money to go into the general fund. Other acts provide that 25 percent of the revenues from the forests be available for school and road purposes. Some persons have thought that these restrictions should be lifted. but the answer always has been. \"Well. those are purposes which everyone recognizes as being very desirable ones. and if the money is made available for school purposes. that will relieve the general drain upon the counties for other purposes. so in the long run it will be six of one and half a dozen of the other.\"",

Senators can figure out the difference. with the profits and the interest and the many other costs. and they will see what that means in the way of extra costs the Government will pay over the period of years these contracts are in force. On page 1003 of the record there appears a letter signed by Lewis L. Strauss. Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. under date of May 19 last. addessed to Representative SIDNEY P.

With reference to the point the Senator has made. in order to hold this contract valid. it had to create a shortage of electricity in the operation of the Atomic Energy Commission plants. That is the way they seek to justify the legal authorization. This is what the attorney said: The increased cost to the Government of the DixonYates proposal as against the Commissions present contract with TVA would be approximately $3.685.000 annually. However. if the President directs the Commission and TVA to modify their existing arrangement so as to release to TVA 600.000 kilowatts under the present contract. and we do not question the Presidents authority to do this. then the Commission has authority to make the best contract it can for the replacement of power thus released. In other words. if they take 600.000 kilowatts of electricity they now have and put it into another channel. there is created a shortage of 600.000 kilowatts. and the statute then applies. because the electricity is needed for the operation of the plant.

My colleagues will find in the debate on the question. while it is not stated in so many words. the clear implication is that if the Senator had said on the floor. \"I am sorry. I think I did wrong.\" the charges would have been dropped. But he persisted up to the last minute in the attitude that he was right and that there was nothing wrong with what he had done. Therefore. the Senate went ahead and adopted the resolution of censure. Moreover. if at that time the Senate was willing to accept the finding of the committee as to the facts.

In the 80th Congress we struggled with that provision and in the first session shortly after February 5. our joint committee came up with the figures. We were ridiculed by many people. some on our side and many on the other side saying. \"How do you know you can do that? It can be nothing more than a target. and in the final analysis ishow much money are you going to vote in the appropriation.\" It so happened in the second session we met the February 15 requirement. and as I remember it on each occasion we kept the expenditures below the revenue.

In the last Congress. and I may say in this one. there never was even a gesture in the direction of trying to comply with that clear mandate of the law. Why was that done?

I might point out at the outset that there is a distinction between the bill which originated in the other body and the bill we are presenting to you here in the nature of amendments to the Senate bill. which amendments we hope will prevail. There is a difference in the number of judges and positions that are created. They are as follows: The bill which originated in the other body provided for 39 appointments. The bill now before the House for consideration provides for 26. These appointments I speak of have to do with district judges and circuit judges. as well as a number of temporary appointments. The difference between the two bills is this: We have eliminated. so far as we could differentiate from the bill that originated in the other body. the following judges: The one the Senate provided for in Arizona is eliminated. 1 in Michigan. 1 in Nevada. In northern Ohio where there was a request for 2. 1 was eliminated. In Pennsylvania where there was a request for 2 in eastern Pennsylvania. 1 was eliminated. In western Pennsylvania 1 was eliminated where the request was for 2. A request for a judge for the State of Utah was eliminated. 1 in Washington. 1 in Alaska. Puerto Rico. and in Florida where there was a request made for 2 this bill confines the appointment to 1. The language of this bill spells all this out specifically. There is also a difference in the nature of their terms. The bill. S. 15. provides that there shall be 3 temporary judgeships created in the State of New York. The bill before the House at the present time does away with the 3 temporary judgeships and provides for 2 permanents.",

There was also the caseload and other factors that enter into a determination of a question of this kind.

Now. just one other comment about the overall picture that we have before us. I am not going to try to enter into a detailed or dramatic discussion dealing with the necessity of creating additional judicial positions. There are in this House probably by a great preponderance. as compared to all occupations. a great many lawyers. and they know and ought to know and I am sure do know the necessity for creating judgeships whenever there is a backlog of cases. and that justice is denied to the people in any given community when the courts cannot function efficiently. I cannot tell you all that the investigations have disclosed. I cannot detail specifically all of the conditions existing in some of the areas in the various States. I think the .distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania . a member of the Committee on the Judiciary. will point out more ably than I can point out the difficulty they have in the State of Pennsylvania. We had this information before our committee. In one district they had to cease trying civil cases entirely. They were compelled to give attention to criminal cases of record only because of the crowded calendar. The civil calendar is completely abandoned for the time being. I hope this bill will not meet with any objection and I hope the House will accept the bill in the spirit in which it has been presented. We have endeavored to try to fulfill the needs of the various areas that we believe were justly and rightfully entitled to an additional judge. We are not in accord in some respects. as to the number of circuit judges. We eliminated one in the State of California and added one in the State of Texas.

Mr. Bowles states: \"Further to distort -his [the Asiatics] impression of America is our trashy literature which crowds Asian newsstands and the blood and thunder comics brought home by his wideeyed child.\" The Philippine Government has advised this country that its Bureau of Customs has discovered huge quantities of indecent publications are being sold in the American military post exchanges that are barred by Philippine law. In fact. the Philippine Bureau of Customs has gone so far as to charge that the American military post exchanges have become smuggling points for the importation of indecent publications into that country. French people visiting the United States are amazed at obscene books and magazines publicly displayed and being sold to young people in residential areas. This material can be bought surreptitiously in the back alleys of Paris. but the head of the French family unit is noted for the way he resolutely protects his children from degrading influences.",

Most all of them maintain homes for their husbands and millions of them have young dependent children. It has long been the law for business to take a deduction on its income tax for every ordinary and necessary expense arising in the production of its income. It occurs to me that this same principle should apply to the individual wage earner as well as business. It seems consistent that under this principle the working mothers should be allowed to deduct the cost of domestic help ordinary and necessary in the production of their income. The deduction would apply only with respect to children who are living with the mother and who are under 16 years of age. In addition. the deduction would apply only to those childcare expenses which are ordinary and reasonable under -the circumstances. and so much of the expenses for any one week as exceeded $40could not be deducted. The deduction would be available only to those working mothers whose adjusted gross income for the taxable year in question does not exceed $6.000. plus $500 for each child for whom she is entitled to deduct care expenses under the bill. The bill. if enacted by the Congress. would apply to returns filed by working mothers for the calendar year 1953 and for all subsequent taxable years. Representative KENNETH ROBERTS. of Alabama. has introduced a similar bill in the House. I hope this provision may be accepted by the House as a part of the pending tax bill recently reported by the House Ways and Means Committee. If it is not accepted. then I shall plan to offer it as an amendment when the tax bill comes to the Senate. Mr. President.

Mr. Chairman. the President of the United States in his state of the Union message to the Congress had this to say on the school construction law and this deficiency which we are talking about at the present time: This law should be renewed. and. likewise. the partial payments for current operating expenses for these particular school districts should be made. including the deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year. That is what we have before the Committee at the present time. the deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year to pay these school districts 100 percent of what the Congress promised them they would get to operate and maintain schools in these federally impacted areas. It might seem rather strange that I as a Democrat should be getting up here on the floor of the House pleading for something that a Republican President wants at the present time. but this is a matter that I have been interested in since its inception. In 1949 and 1950 the Committee on Education and Labor selected a subcommittee to study the requirements of these various federally impacted areas. The committee spent 3 or 4 long hard months going all over the country to determine the requirements that were necessary under the Federal obligation. That subcommittee came back and reported to the Committee on Education and Labor and after 8 or 9 months of hearings in 1950 they produced a bill. which the Congress passed. the school construction law known as 815 and also a law known as 874 for the maintenance and operation of these school districts where a Federal impact existed on these particular districts.",

I favor aid to school districts adversely affected by Federal activities. I have seen many of these districts. Also. I know the situation in regard to the delays in filing applications for entitlements in the fiscal year. Many of the districts cannot know their daily average attendance until near May or June. practically at the end of the school session. Fortyeight and a half million dollars was spent last year and the applications are running ahead of last year at the present time. It was estimated- from a surve& the additional pupils expected in the districts affected by Federal activities that they would have an increase to such an extent that an estimated $60 million would be spent for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1953. The Commissioner of Education has already received an appropriation for these activities of approximately $40 million. So you can see the reason for the $20 million or $201/2 million additional which is proposed in the pending amendment.

I do not know why we should consider the merits of the legislation which is now public law. The only question is: Are we going to meet the formula and meet the estimates which have been set up? I feel that if the House fails to approve this $24 million item we would be breaking faith with the people who had a right to and did rely upon the legislation which does exist. These school districts have obligated themselves by their employment contracts. by their purchases of school material and books. and if we fail to appropriate this money many will go into the red. They had a right to rely on existing legislation. and I think we fail in our duty if we do not provide the money we obligated ourselves under previous legislation to appropriate.",

I was tremendously interested in the remarks of the gentleman from Kansas when he said he felt the rules. regulations. and formula governing this bill could be rewritten and improved. I was likewise impressed and pleased to hear the remarks of the gentleman from West Virginia in which he said that continued study of this situation was being had by the subcommittee. and that certain rules. regulations. and formulas may be adopted by the present Congress to include other needed school districts. Those remarks give me some hope that a situation in my home district in Kentucky may be included in this very beneficial program. They have been operating on what they call the countyunit basis. but many of the counties I have the honor to represent do not have a great increase in the overall number of pupils in any one county. The Federal Government has gone into my district and created a great dam and a great lake more than 100 miles long. It has flooded out dozens and scores of school districts which have required those. -school pupils to go to the county seats of several counties and overcrowd them. This has greatly increased the attendance in those countyseat schools and they do not have sufficient room or facilities to take care of them. Also the Government has greatly reduced the amount of taxes going to the school districts. as well as to the counties themselves. by taking many thousands of acres of good land which is now taxfree. This situation should be met and taken care of by the appropriate committee rewriting the formula by which this money is allocated to the schools. Before my time to speak Is up. I want to sincerely compliment the Appropriations Committee for their overall work on this supplemental appropriation bill. They have saved the taxpayers more than a billion dollarswhether this amendment is passed. They are to be congratulated.",

I could not help but think awhile ago. when they were talking about Texas and what should be done. that the worst thing that could ever happen to this Nation would be for the rest of the country to tell Texas or any other State that had a disaster that she had to meet it entirely by herself.

The effect of raising the average annual rate threefourths of 1 percent. and establishing the prewar ratio of bonds to shortterm debts (45 percent of all marketable debt was in longterm issues in 1939) will be to increase the total value of bonds maturing in 5 years or more from $40 billions to $63 billions.

The administrative officer of the agency had a duty to bring these policy changes to the attention of the Congress of the United States. It is this body that is supposed to protect the rights and the liberties and the opportunities of the people.

It includes. as one of its basic arguments. a fundamental statement of the law of the United States of America. as affecting the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. namely. the paragraph which reads: The extent of the territorial jurisdiction of Massachusetts over the sea adjacent to its coast is that of an independent nation. and. except so far as any right of control over this territory has been granted to the United States. this control remains with the State.",

I simply desire to say that as applied to offshore lands the quotation read by the Senator from Florida evidences the confusion that has existed throughout this debate and throughout public discussion of the issue. namely. the confusion between boundaries and ownership. It does not matter what the boundaries of the State of Massachusetts are seaward from the lowwater mark. The existence of those boundaries out beyond lowwater mark does not provide to the coastal State the ownership of the submerged lands beneath those waters. This is the clear holding of the Supreme Court in the offshore oil cases. and the Court expressly distinguishes the Manchester case on the grounds I have stated. The Senator from Florida and other Senators. in arguing as if boundaries and ownership mean the same thing. are committing a logical and legal error. The State of Massachusetts does not own all the land within its land boundaries. It is divided. with some in private ownership and some in municipal ownership. For instance. the mere fact that the boundaries of Massachusetts touch New York. Vermont. New Hampshire. Maine. Rhode Island. and Connecticut along given lines does not mean that within those boundaries the State of Massachusetts owns all the land. Not at all. Massachusetts owns only a very small fraction of that land. Similarly. the fact that its boundaries have been placed at sea. does not mean that Massachusetts owns the submerged lands out to such a line. That is the issue. and it is very important to keep that distinction in mind. I thank .the Senator from Massachu setts for his graciousness.",

If we view it only from a purely defense standpoint it is a dangerous omen because we all recognize the fact that if we skeletonize existing divisions that are within the zone of the interior we are going to be putting ourselves at least in part back where we were when we started the buildup of our national defense after the Korean war began. We all know. that if a division is not up to strength before the division has any military value it must be brought up to strength. then trained with its new replacements so that it can function as a unit.

Recently a survey. which was made in four counties in Oklahoma by the joint staffs of the Department of Public Welfare and the Vocational Rehabilitation Division. developed some very interesting facts. According to that survey. 1.000 families in the State were receiving aid for dependent children because the heads of the families were disabled. In each case the family could be removed from the status of having dependent children on the rolls if vocational rehabilitation were made available to thehead of the family. On the average. these families have been on publicassistance rolls for a period of approximately 3 years. and it is estimated that if $500.000 had been expended in rehabilitation 3 years ago. it would have resulted in the saving -of approximately $5 million. As I recall. there are approximately 5 dependent children. on the average. for each 2 disabled heads of families. Assistance fo the one who is disabled. making him a contributor to society instead of a recipient. a producer instead of one who is only a consumer. is of the utmost importance. but of equal importance is what it does for the children to have the confidence and the moralebuilding effect of knowing that their father. instead of being a disabled person. receiving aid and having to accept it for his dependent children. has become one who can hold his head up and his shoulders back among those who support their families and are upstanding. producing American citizens.

It will still require the signature of the President of the United States. If we are to be realistic and practical about it.

He stood before the joint session of Congress in January and made specific recommendations with respect to the Post Office. first. a shortterm recommendation for an adjustment of postal rates. and. second. a recommendation for the long pull. in the form of a board similar to that provided for in the bill I introduced some time ago. which board would have the power to survey and make a recommendation to Congress. leaving always in the hands of Congress the authority finally to determine the rates. What good would it do to pass a bill without the rate amendments which are before the Senate at the present time. only to have it vetoed ultimately. because it is not consonant with the budget program?

The bill was reported to this body by our beloved and respected colleague the junior Senator from Kansas . It was reported with the recommendation of each member of that committee. Who are we to select 13 Members and ask them to go into the committee room and discharge their duties and their responsibilities. and to hold hearings and take testimony and weigh the recommendations and make concessions to each other. and then finally when they reach unanimous agreement. set it aside in favor of a new amendment which is brought in at the last minute. and which none of those Members has had a chance to weigh or to consider? Mr. President. I do not think the Senate will wish to legislate in this manner. and I hope the Senate does not do so.",

I merely wish to say again to the Senate that it is my firm belief that the only way by which we shall have a postal pay bill and a classified service pay bill enacted into law at this session will be by providing for some offsetting revenues. Despite what the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island said. I do not normally obtain my information from either newspaper accounts or rumors. I am the majority leader of the Senate. and I sit in on the Monday morning White House conferences. and I think I keep in reasonably close touch with the administrations views. It is my judgment that a postal pay bill will not be enacted into law unless provision is made for offsetting revenues. Mr. President. although the committee has spent time on the bill and has reported the bill to the Senate. the bulk of the bill as reported by the committee. insofar as a pay increase for postal employees is concerned. is the same as the amendment I have offered. There are some changes insofar as the pay increase for the classified service is concerned. but there is not a great deal of change. The real change comes only in respect to the offsetting revenue features of the amendment. To that extent. as I have pointed out before. the figures used in the amendment are exactly the same as the figures which were brought before the Senate just 2 years ago. by means of the report and action of the same committee. then under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina . and the Senate passed that bill. and sent it to the House. That measure provided for a 1cent increase in the rate on firstclass mail. and provided for bringing the secondclass rates up to what the Senate decided. namely. 20. 20. and 20. The conference decided on 10. 10. and 10. This amendment will restore the additional 10. 10. and 10 in the case of the secondclass mail rates. Under those circumstances. I think the amendment is a sound one if the postal workers and the classified workers are to receive this pay increase for their benefit at this session of Congress.",

Identical legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative HALE and Representative JAVITS. If enacted. this bill will be called the National Health Act of 1953 and will provide a voluntary program of health insurance in response to the health needs of the people of the United States. This is substantially the same bill which we cosponsored and introduced in 1949 in the first session of the 81st Congress. We are reintroducing it in modified form. in the belief that it is designed to provide adequate health care in a manner consistent with our countrys traditions of freedom. and that it should be considered along with other proposals having a similar purpose. which may come before the Senate. By such a course of action. the health needs of the Nation can be met realistically within the framework of our free institutions and without resort to Government intervention and control. The cornerstone of the national .healthinsurance program advocated in this bill is the local. voluntary. prepayment health service plan. Many such plans are in operation today. Unfortunately. their cost is beyond the means of a large segment of the population. The increasing popularity of these plans. however. demonstrates that the voluntary approach to the exigencies imposed by ill health is the solution desired by the majority of the peopleif it is designed in consideration of their financial resources. The voluntary health and medical service program embodied in this bill basically is financial assistance to voluntary. nonprofit. prepayment. health plans. Primary responsibility for the development of adequate health services is placed in the States and local communities. with the fullest encouragement to local initiative. The people are thus offered the maximum in assistance with the minimum of governmental interference. Through this proposed legislation. the health problems of the Nation are met in terms of present available services. while the necessary incentives are provided for additional medical facilities.",

It is a situation which I hope will be ironed out and corrected. There is another thing involved. not only the question of what the Department has done. but at the time the young men who are now graduating were taken into the ROTC there was a firm commitment by the Congress of the United States that we were going ahead with the program to expand the wings of the Air Force to 143. About this time last year. or a little later. the budget for the Air Force came before the Congress. and they were cut back from 143 to 120. It is anticipated that this year they are going to be permitted to go up to 137. So that the responsibility is not entirely on the part of the Air Force. The Congress itself must take its portion of the responsibility. because we sustained budget cuts in the Air Force last year and cut them back to 120 wings. We are now going up to 137. and I hope that in a short period it will be possible to place the young men who were taken in under expectation that we would have a larger Air Force than it turned out to be will be commissioned.",

My purpose in rising now is not to follow that through. but to make a few observations of some thoughts that have been on my mind for quite a while. I discussed them briefly today with my distinguished friend the gentleman from Illinois . I discussed them briefly the other day with the distinguished chairman of the Armed Service Committee . I had no intention of making any remarks today. but this bill comes up by unanimous consent. I am glad the discussion took place. because it is very helpful to know the history of the bill and the reasons for it. I think now is the proper time to make a few remarks. at least to get my mind purged of some thoughts that have disturbed me considerably. * I have been very much concerned for some time about the feeling in the minds of those in our armed services. that the general public did not respect them as much as they should. I am talking now about all of the armed services. and I am talking about a matter that should be of deep concern to each and every one of us. I want to say to the members of our armed services whether they serve as enlisted men or as officers that the American citizen respects the uniform of our country. When I walk along any street whether it is F Street in Washington or Washington Street in Boston or any place else and I see a person wearing the uniform of our country. whether it is a man or a woman. I respect that person because I have profound respect for the uniform. My only purpose today is to make these few simple observations. in no way critical but trying only to be constructive in the hope that it may brush aside the mists in front of the eyes of some of those in the service. They should know that the American people profoundly respect the uniform and are deeply grateful to those who wear that uniform for the service they render and the sacrifice they make.",

That act gave the President the tariff and trademaking powers that the Constitution placed in the legislative branch. Essentially it was an abdication. of power by the Congress. a dodging of an obligation and a responsibility that constitutionally belongs to the Congress. That act can be said to be the result of a strongwilled Executive working with and upon a weakwilled Congress. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was an emergency measure. definitely described as such. It contained a 3year limitation. and gave President Roosevelt the power to make trade agreements with other nations. Like most New Deal emergency measures the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has been extended and extended until today it is 20 years old.

One of the most compelling and forceful reasons for supporting this measure. Inadequate as it Is. arises out of the alarming current unemployment trend throughout the country. We all. I know. earnestly and sincerely hope this trend is short lived and will be eliminated when the administration readjustment policies and programs are completed. Nevertheless. and without any partisanship. we would indeed be lax in our duty If we pretended that dangerous unemployment did not now exist. It is. therefore. imperative and timely that some effort must be made to increase consumer purchasing power. thereby stimulating production and helping to reverse the rising unemployment rate. It is fundamental in the American system that our tax policy should. to the fullest possible extent. encourage a constant expanding economy. I greatly hope the Members of this body will remember that fundamental tax principle when we are called upon to consider higher tax exemptions on individual Incomes next week. Let us plan now. barring any national or world emergency. to expand this program of excisetax reduction and elimination so that the entire American purchasing public and all affected Industries will be treated alike with fairness and justice.

It affects a $12billion investment of the American taxpayers. and whatever final law we enact will reach into the destiny of many generations to come. It is. therefore. my earnest hope and plea that the leadership will insure that no restriction of time be placed upon discussion of perhaps the most vital subject yet to be presented to this Congress or indeed any other Congress. As the bill now reads. it Is objectionable to me. and I think a great many others. primarily because it negatives the nonpartisan public power policy of this country that has been developed since 1902. That occurs because of the current absence in the measure of any reliable safeguard against exploitation of atomic power by private utilities. It practically forbids the Atomic Energy Commission to operate in the commercial power field which simply means that the taxpayers will have to pay for further experimentation. from which the private utilities will ultimately benefit. There are many deficiencies in the bill as it now stands but. in the public interest and recognition of the tremendous amount of money that has come out of the average taxpayers pocket. two major improvements must be inserted in the act before. in my judgment. it should be approved. The present patent provision must be corrected to insure that no atomic development monopoly can be established by those few firms privileged to carry out the original atomic energy research under Government contract and subsidy. The provision restricting the Atomic Energy Commission from producing atomic power for Governmentoperated plant uses and also making it available for public consumption through rural electric cooperatives and municipal agencies must also be removed in deference to the powerconsuming public and protection against unjust profiteering.

In recent decisions. as late as 1950. the Supreme Court of the United States fixed the amount of water that can be diverted. I refer to the hearings on page 105 and quote the Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin. He said: It is for this principal reason that the State of Wisconsin. along with the other Lake States. was compelled to initiate action in the Supreme Court of the United States. which after long and costly litigation resulted in the decree of April 21. 1930. which ordered the Sanitary District of Chicago to reduce its diversion to the present level of 1.500 cubic feet per second. plus domestic pumpage. which makes a total of 3.200 cubic feet per second (278 U. S. 367 (1929). 281 U. S. 179 (1930)). We say that the Supreme Court has retained jurisdiction and it still retains jurisdiction.

I have heard various gentlemen from Wisconsin outline their opposition to this bill and their support of the Ford amendinent. Their support of the Ford amendment is based upon the damage that the bill would do to those who represent districts bordering on Lake Michigan in the State of Wisconsin. I have not heard anyone speak for those who represent districts bordering on the Illinois River. which is the area so adversely affected by this bill. About 86 miles of the Illinois River runs through my congressional district. That makes 172 miles of shoreline owned by riparian owners. At the present time I have no way of knowing nor do I have any way of telling my constituents the amount of damage this bill will do. and we will not have any way of explaining to our constituents the amount of damage it will do until we get a formal report from the Secretary of the Army and the Corps of Engineers. Now this river has been running ever since God created it. The lake has been there and it has been changing levels constantly. The Illinois River has ample roller dam projects whereby the level of the river can be controlled at the present time without any help from you fine Members from Chicago. I believe therefore that this bill must be defeated. I believe that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. FonD]. should pass.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. the way this bill reads at the present time a total annual average of 2.500 cubic feet of water per second could be diverted from Lake Michigan into the Illinois Canal and thence into the Illinois River. At the same time there is no limit upon the amount of water at any one time that can be diverted. The sanitary drainage district could divert 10.000 cubic feet per second of sewage and water. if they so desired. This causes a situation further down the river that is similar to what we know as flash floods. The amendment. which I have introduced. prevents that from happening. My amendment would limit the amount of water that could be diverted at any one time to 2.500 cubic feet per second. thus tending to thwart plans that the sanitary drainage district might have to cause us flash floods downstate and thus cause a hardship on the riparian landowners and all those good citizens who live along the Illinois River and its tributaries We along the Illinois River have a system to control the level of the river both for navigation and for other purposes. It is the roller dam system. The amount of diversion from Lake Michigan allowed by this bill could cause serious difficulty with the operation of the roller dam system. I believe this amendment is a good amendment. Not only will it regulate the level. or help to regulate the level of Lake Michigan by not taking too much water out at any time. but it will regulate the level of the Illinois River without any chance of socalled flash floods. I asked the gentleman from Illinois yesterday just what the purpose of this bill really was. It says first of all that it is a bill to regulate the level of Lake Michigan and then to regulate also the level of the Illinois River. I believe this is a subterfuge for the purpose of dumping more sewage from the city of Chicago down the Illinois River on the rest of us riparian landowners along the river.",

My only request is that when the Illinois River is at flood stage. the Army Chief of Engineers. through the Secretary of War. has the right and authority to say whether or not any increased diversion shall come from that stream toward the homes in our cities along the Illinois River.

Now. I want to relate that cumulative loss to the cumulative gain. If you relate this $1.300.000.000 accumulated losses over 21 years to the accumulated gains in farm incomeI mean that which the farmers received over and above what they would have received had we stayed at the level of 20 years agohere is what it amounts to: Total net income from agriculture 195253 was $264.155.000.000. Now relate that to the little $1 billion that I was talking about. If such income had remained at the 1932 level. this total would have been only $69.652.000.000. or a difference of $194.503.00.000. Let me move one step further. The accumulated increase in net income from agriculture from 1932 through 1953 is $13.599.000.000. The accumulated increase in national income overall was $236.011.000.000 for the same period. Now. move it up one step further. It shows you how negligible these losses are. Comparing 1953 with 1932. the net income from agriculture was 530 percent and the national income was 642 percent. Over the period from 1932 through 1953. the actual net income from agriculture totaled $264.155.000.000. or $194.503.000.000 greater than the total would have been had net income from agriculture remained at the 1932 level. Now. the national income during this 22year period totaled $3.015.445.000.000. or $2.057.257.000.000 greater than it would have been had the income remained unchanged from the 1932 level during the 22 years.

It was at least confusing.

The Senator overlooks one fact with which we are now face to face. That is the hard and cold proposition that the international agreement which is made by the President alone. without any assistance of the Senate. is not passed on by any one else. The adoption of the amendment proposed by me. as well as the one proposed by the distinguished Senator from Ohio. would provide for the passage of a law by the Congress through application of the ordinary lawmaking processes.

I grant to the Senator there is one weakness in my proposal. a weakness which I would have liked to overcome if it had been possible. The weakness is one which the Senator was discussing a while ago. that my proposed amendment. and the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Ohio. would perpetuate the perhaps illogical distinction between executive agreements. one of which is a treaty. and the other one of which is properly an executive agreement. However. in order not to perpetuate that illogical thesis. all international agreements would have to come before this body for consideration. If the latter should occur. the Senate would have adopted such a cumbersome process that the President himself and the Senate itself probably could not operate as they should.

The agreement provides for the establishment of a commission to validate the bonds. because the evidence showed that a number of bonds had been retired by Germany and were in Berlin. and when the Russians entered Berlin. they took the bonds. which thus may have gotten into the hands of crooks. So one of the purposes the committee had in mind was to have established a commission to validate or. as the case might be. to invalidate bonds. Bonds acquired after 1945 would be invalidated. In other words. in the event the bonds were stolen by the Russians. the bonds would be invalidated. In my humble opinion.

They show that the scaling down of the German obligations is comparable to what was done in connection with other countries. But that is not the important point. There is nothing in the ECA legislation which authorizes the writing off of claims of the Government of the United States for the express purpose of settling private claims at the expense of the taxpayers. Moreover. the money involved in past claims was not expended under ECA. but in connection with a program called GARIOA. Government and Relief in Occupied Areas. The argument that the negotiators ought to have authority under ECA to make a settlement of the kind they made is to my mind utterly fallacious. Mr. President. I have taken more time than I expected. because of the interrogations. I repeat. I am anxious to see all American claimants receive as much as they are legitimately entitled to receive.

Mr. Speaker. directs the Committee on Armed Services to make a full and complete investigation of the pay. allowances and socalled fringe benefits endeavoring to work out a program calculated to attract vounteers to a military career. This investigation would have two principal objectives: First. to provide benefits for military personnel approximately equal to those which could be obtained in civilian life and. second. to attract career personnel into the Armed Forces in numbers sufficient to maintain them on a volunteer basis except in time of war. This procedure would provide our country with professional armed units which would be familiar with uptodate and modern weapons that are being developed from year to year. In this way. those reaching service age would have the opportunity of selecting E military -or civilian career. The program would save money. give adequate defense. and go a long way in preventing economic disruption. Dixie Gilmer",

Dixie Gilmer is one of the most unique and colorful characters in Oklahoma politics. He had a personal following in his own county that always enabled him to run far ahead of his party. He was a man of tremendous courage. He was a fighter. He has been ill for many years. He was ill most of the time during his short period of service in this House.

I have often thought that a true. genuine American has absolutely no trouble with his own mind or conscience when the matter of his Americanism is brought up. I have always felt that any person employed by the Government should always be ready and willing to discuss and explain to his superiors. or to a court. or to a lawful committee what he has been doing for the Government. and what information he has learned in connection with his work with the Government. I have been shocked at the many instances where Federal employees sought to hide behind the fifth amendment to the Constitution. The language in the fifth amendment behind which they seek to hide is. as follows: No person * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. Of course. if a Federal employee is questioned about matters that are outside of his Federal employment. and purely personal. and he in good conscience believes he might incriminate himself. he would be entitled to the protection of the fifth amendment. However. a Federal employee who defiantly refuses to answer a question about his work with the Government throws himself open to a suspicion that he is not willing for his superiors to know just what he has been doing in his position with the Government. Such an individual should not be permitted to hide behind the fifth amendment. Such an Appendix Coal Procurement by the TVA",

A group of automobile dealers in Jay County jointly advertised their contribution to the economy of their community. In an advertisement dated June 9 they proudly point out what they contribute to their county. They provide: First. Employment for 126 persons whose dependents number 324. or a total of 450 people who depend on the automobile business for their living. Nearly 60 percent of these people own their own homes. and all are good citizens who live. work and trade in Jay County. Second. Annual payroll of Jialfmillion dollars. The total wages paid by the 12 members of the Jay County Auto Association were $514.024. Third. Tax dollars for local needs. Annually thousands of dollars in taxes are paid by these dealers on real estate. personal property and inventory. providing funds to build streets and highways. to operate the schools and to provide adequate police and fire protection to the citizens. Every dollar contributes to a better Jay County. On Saturday. June 12. these 12 automobile dealers paid their -employees in silver dollars. Many of these dollars naturally found their way into the various retail channels in that community and thus the part played by that one industry could be identified and recognized by the flow of silver dollars into cash registers. This idea also emphasizes the fact that these dealers do their own promotion and sales work without Government subsidies to aid them. Is this not a further tribute to their industry?

    "speech": "Mr. President. last year when Congress was very near the end of its 1st session of the 83d Congress. the administration asked the legislative branch to approve an increase in the national debt limit. from $275 billion to $290 billion. an increase of $15 billion. The request was turned down. Now. this year. as adjournment is almost upon us. Secretary of the Treasury Humphrey is again asking Congress to increase the present ceiling on the national debt. I have given considerable thought to the proposal to increase the national debt limit and I do not believe that the existing situation warrants an increase. Lifting the debt limit is a matter of grave concern to many people. Legislation of such magnitude needs fulldress hearings and debate early in the session. not when we are about to complete our work for the year. The national debt is now about $274 billion. Budget receipts for the new year. which started July 1 are expected to be about $62.6 billion. Spending will amount to $65.6 billion. It means that the Government is expected to go $3 billion more in debt. I understand the United States Treasury had a cash balance at the end of the 1954 fiscal year of approximately $6.8 billion which is deposited in 12.000 banks throughout the Nation. An interesting observation in this regard is that the Government receives no interest on these deposits. It seems rather peculiar that we pay the banks interest on loans and at the same time no interest on our deposits is paid to the Federal Government. These bank deposits and the money we are still able to borrow under the debt limit certainly should be enough to take care of the estimated deficit for the fiscal year without having to increase the debt limit. While there is always a possibility of an emergency it is not a sufficient enough reason at this time to merit an increase in the debt limit even on a temporary basis as proposed by the Finance Committee. The Treasury will have to keep close tabs on the administrations expenses. There is nothing wrong with that as it promotes more efficient business. The principal reason for the debt limitation is as a goal and reminder and it should not be arbitrarily used. An increase in the debt limit at this time. in my opinion. is unnecessary.",

Most stockmen and farmers have not been in sympathy with rigid price supports. Neither do they want the Federal Government to dominate the fields of production and prices.

Cooperation with Federal agenciesyesbut a minimum of participation except in emergency situations beyond their control.

They are not much concerned with promises made during political campaigns. They do not ask. do not expect. any special favors. For the most part. as usual. stockmen and farmers rely very largely upon their own efforts for results. Given fair consideration they can maintain and improve their situation. They have long felt that what they need most is markets and not price supports. In spite of all that has happened during the more than 2 yearswith prices going down and down and production costs continuing to risethey have faith In their business. They watch the efforts of the socalled \"farm block\" In Congress with much concern. * 0 * 0 0 Because the farm situation dominates Washington thinkingand that of politicians everywhereit behooves members to attend the convention this year and help formulate the policies of the association.

No. 19. published September 12. 1952. we find this statement: Eisenhower did not commit himself at all to a Government guaranty of full parity. as many newsmen reported. On the contrary his crack at \"earning\" their fair share was a direct slur at the very principle of price supports. Let us look at what the Farmers Union Herald had to say in its issue of October 6. 1952. just 4 weeks before election: It is becoming clear that General Eisenhower has had to go beyond his partys platform to some extent on the question of price supports and on the issue of punitive taxes against farm coops. In the case of price supports he has said he is in agreement with the action of Congress last June in continuing 90 percent farm price supports until the end of 1954. He has not said that he would favor 90 percent or higher supports after that date. Let us look again at the National Union Farmer. volume 30. No. 9. October 1952: General Eisenhower promised in his speech in Kasson. Minn.. to back the 2year 90 percent of parity law. but specified that would hold good only until 1954. If my colleagues wish any further evidence that there was no misunderstanding among the Democratic Party or the Democratic fronts which served the Democratic Party at that time. they need only go through the publications of October 1952. If the Senate needs further evidence that there was no misunderstanding as to what General Eisenhower said. they can look in the Farm Bureau publication of October 1952. wherein they plainly stated that General Eisenhower had endorsed 90percent supports only through the crop year of 1954. I make these insertions in the RECORD at this time to show conclusively. Mr. President. that those who now charge the President with doubledealing are simply doubletalking themselves.",

Not only has he been a sound businessman in our community but the State bankers association of our State elected - him its president. and the American Bankers Association elected him its treasurer for two terms. I saw in a newspaper dispatchI believe the one which has been placed in the RECORDthe reference to Mr. Emmons as having been president of the American Bankers Association. He did not claim to have been its president. but said he had been its treasurer. Mr. Emmons also said he operated a country bank. He conducts a good country bank. The best testimonial for him I know is that the Indians who live in his neighborhood think he is a fine man. The Indians who have dealt with him. in season and out of season. are pleased with the business relationships they have had with him. The Navahos are an important tribe from the standpoint of business. They are making money. They are making It out of uranium. and they are going to make it out of oil. They are going to become one of the rich tribes of the United States. The Jicarilla Apaches In my State have several millions of dollars on deposit. They are also going to become a rich tribe out of oil. They are going to handle their own affairs. and when they handle their own affairs. there will be those of us who will try to make sure that they have the same educational opportunities all other children in this country have. and that they have a chance to intermingle with the children .of the white race. and as a result become integrated completely into our communities. We are trying hard to do that in New Mexico. We are trying to do it in other parts of the country.

    "speech": "I wish to answer in one respect the argument of the distinguished Senator from Nevada . The point I wish to make is that nothing in the act referred to makes Mr. McLeod any different from any other subordinate of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has full responsibility. I have stated before why I myself think we should not call a subordinate when the head of the department himself chooses to do the testifying for the Department. I wish to answer the suggestion that in some way Congress has conferred on Mr. McLeod special power that is different from that conferred on other subordinates. In the first place. this office is created under the immigration law. and wherever reference is made to \"this act.\" the reference is to the Immigration Actnot that I think that that makes a great difference. There is hereby established in the Department of State a Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs. Why are those two divisions placed together? Because immigration is generally managed by consular officersto be headed by an Administrator (with an appropriate. title to be designated by the Secretary of State) with rank and compensation equal to that of an Assistant Secretary of State. He is. in effect. an Assistant Secretary of State. The Administrator shall be a citizen of the United States. qualified by ex perience. and shall maintain close liaison with the appropriate committees of Congress in order that they may be advised regarding the administration of this ActThe Immigration Acby consular officers. That has no relation whatsoever to the present situation. He shall be charged with any and all responsibility and authority in the administratton of the Bureau and of this ActThe Immigration Actwhich are conferred on the Secretary of State as may be delegated to him by the Secretary of State or which may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. He shall also perform such other duties as the Secretary of State may prescribe. The only point I wish to make is that Mr. McLeod is a complete subordinate of the Secretary of State. I do not believe there is anything in the act which would justify the application of any different principle to his case than to that of any other subordinate in the Department.",

It seems to me that there are grave dangers in such an argument. First. If there is to be made of record the testimony of the security officer. it will parade into this body all the opinions and all the innuendos which. by policy.. the FBI does not wish to have drawn here.

Such a step would force Frances hand on the whole problem of European security and would stimulate German efforts to achieve its own salvation.

As a Democrat. I am proud to say that when my party controlled the Congress and the administration there was an honest effort to develop a sound and practical farm program. The 20 years of farm progress under Democratic leadership shows that these efforts were crowned with some success. Under the guidance of the late Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. great gains were made in formulating an enlightened farm policyin this connection I need only point to such basic legislation as the Triple A program. the Soil Conservation and Farm Credit Acts. and the ruralelectrification law. The record shows that these Democratic farm programs have been most successful in practicethey have contributed greatly to improved farm security and higher rural living standards. In 1932 some 42 percent of our farms were tenantoperated and most farm owners were burdened with heavy mortgagesin 1952 farm tenancy was down to 25 percent and the average landowner had a 91 percent equity in his land.

The article is entitled \"Lake Superiors Vacationland.\" and was written by Lodi Mihelich. a friend of mine from Calumet. Mich. It discusses the unrivaled beauty of Isle Royale National Park and the tremendous opportunities it offers for the vacationer. Isle Royale is Michigans only national park. in fact. the only national park in the Great Lakes region. which has a population of 35.000.000. Isle Royale is in the district which I represent in Congress and it is a source of considerable pride to me that Congress has now recognized the need for development of the park in order to make its facilities available to more visitors. and has appropriated funds to inaugurate a much needed construction program.",

I may say that the effect of the amendment would be to extend the time of the compulsory licensing from that which is provided in the committee bill. namely. 5 years. to a period of 15 years. In that connection. I wish to read a part of the Presidents message to Congress dated February 17. 1954. as follows: Until Industrial participation and the utilization of atomic energy acquires a broader base. considerations of fairness require some mechanism to assure that the limited number of companies. which as Government contractors now have access to the program. cannot build a patent monopoly which would exclude others desiring to enter the field. I hope that participation in the development of atomic power will have broadened sufficiently in the next 5 years to remove the need for such provisions.

I do not recognize that the only way in which you can rehouse people cleared by slums is through public housing. and I have felt in the past that many people who supported public housing said that that was the only way that you could rehouse people in the slum areas. I do not agree with that. I think many people living in the slum areasmy judgment is half the people living in the slum areas can find decent housing if they can pay for it. in lowpriced housing.

I am pleased to report that Blair Moody is well on the road back to the excellent health that marked his long tenure in Washington as a great journalist and as a great Senator. Blair was stricken with pneumonia while campaigning in Michigans vast upper peninsula. He was rushed to St. Joseph Hospital in Hancock. Mich.. where first diagnosis showed some possibility of a heart problem on top of the pneumonia. Two outstanding heart specialists. however. on thorough checking reported no heart attack and added that he was recovering rapidly from the pneumonia and soon would be able to resume his campaign. Blair will be released from the hospital very soon and will rest for several weeks. He can then resume his campaign to return to the Senate as a Democratic Senator from the great State of Michigan. I know you all join me in wishing him complete and early recovery from the pneumonia that temporarily interrupted his campaign. Those many of you who remember Blair Moody as a reporter or as a Senator will recall his prodigious energy in any task to which he set his hand. The medical opinion out of Michigan. I am reliably informed. is that he will return to his campaign. and. we Democrats hope. to the Senate. equally vigorous and energetic in his service to the people.

It follows: WHAT Is YOUR OPINION?-How WOULD YOU VOTE? DEAR FRIENDS: During the past few months a number of statewide opinion polls have been conducted in Minnesota and perhaps you have been asked to contribute your views and answers to them. The results of these polls. you may have noted. have been varied and often contradictory. What is more. they do not necessarily reflect the opinions of you who live in the Ninth Congressional District of Minnesota. Much useful information may be obtained from a public opinion poll which is properly executed. Principally. it may serve to strengthen the link between the people and their representatives in government. a link which due to obvious limitations of time and distance is not as strong as it ought to be. This brief questionnaire is principally devoted to the farm problem which is so vital an issue with us in the Ninth Congressional District. Your opinions on these and other questions will be helpful to me as your United States Representative in Congress. If there are other issues or problems not included in this form on which you would like to comment. I urge you to do so. Your suggestions. advice. and counsel always are welcome and greatly appreciated. I would like to hear from you.",

The Secretary of such a Department would have Cabinet status and would work toward peace and good will throughout the world. No action was taken by the committee. but I am still of the opinion that all the guns. all the tanks. and all the bombs we are building during these hectic times are not going to save us from our enemies at home or abroad. I firmly believe that our only salvation lies in the fact that we must revert back to the more simple life. and give more thought to that overruling power from which all blessing flow. God. in his infinite goodness. and the teachings of Jesus Christ. his son. are the only answer if we are to survive in these days of universal insecurity. Last week I was one of 160 Members of Congress who attended a breakfast honoring Evangelist Billy Graham. who has just returned from a preaching trip abroad. His audience was most attentive as he told of speaking to a total attendance of more than 2 million people in Great Britain over a period of 12 weeks. On the Continent he addressed 300.000 persons more through interpreters. Mr. Graham stated that much of the success of his meetings was due to a spiritual resurgence as the result of World War II and the fear of the atom bomb. Friends. right now is the time to start building a new world. And. we can only build a new world when we discard the old implements of war and put God back into the center of life. Let us do it now. not only for ourselves. but for generations to come. Mr. Speaker. Evangelist Billy Graham has had a great revelation. And that revelation means much responsbility. He should be supported by the Congress of the United States. and the present administration. At any cost. let us make this great Godfearing man. and his equally great team. our official ambassadors of good will and spiritual awakening. A miracle could yet happen.
