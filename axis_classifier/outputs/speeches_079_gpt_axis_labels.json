First. it would give the mines more effective labor. by preventing illness aniong the workers due to preventive medicine and to curative medicine which might be administered to the workers in hospitals or otherwise. That is the first thing. It would tend to make the coal miner a more efficient worker. and keep him in the mines more days than he otherwise would be there. The second result would be to make whole the bodies the mines had hurt. so far as medical science and care could provide for an injury or disability inflicted upon a miner. If a rock should fall. as in the case of the man Burns. from Alabama. whose case I described. who had a rock fall on him and paralyze him. does anyone deny that the mine or the mine system of this country should provide for his care? Either the mines have to do it or the public has to do it. or the poor man has to go uncared for. Is there anything wrong with adding to the cost of coal the cost to repair breakage to machines and the breakage of human bodies. which occur in the production of coal from the coal mines?

It sells the coal in the markets of the country for a profit. Yet if that mine in that community broke a mans back. or deprived him of a limb. or made him an invalid for the rest of his life. the very community. the very State. which loses that natural resource without compensation. would have to pay for the wreckage the mine operation leaves on the State itself. That is not fair. So I see nothing wrong with the principle of providing a health fund for every industry. Mr. President. I was about to refer a while ago to the degree of ill health and lack of care prevailing in the United States. and I should like to finish that subject. I pointed out that illness and accidents caused the average industrial worker to lose about 12 days from production a year. representing a loss of about 60.000.000 mandays annually. Sickness and accidents cost the United States at least $8.000.000.000 a year. When the able Senator from Illinois was talking about how much this fund would be. how much this 7 percent. if that were the figure. would cost. he failed to take into consideration how much illness cost. and that if adequate medical care could be provided we could diminish the cost of illness to the whole of society.",

At one time I myself took that position. and I was very much in favor of it. but. upon a further examination. I came to the conclusion that much of the land was bonded by the various railroads and that the situation is such that the railroads would be in an almost impossible position if they were required to turn back the land.

These investigation moneys are used for preconstruction surveys. and it is through these preconstruction surveys that irrigation projects move from the feasible to the approved stage. There is coming before the Bureau of Reclamation before long some additional reports made out In the field concerning projects that will stand on their own merits. Among these is the KennewickHighland division of the Yakima project of the State of Washington. an outstanding project. one of the most meritorious irrigation projects in the United States. It Is too bad that the Bureaus report was not in soon enough to place it before the Deficiency Appropriation Committee of the House for this appropriation bill. I am urging the Bureau of Reclamation.. through the use of these preconstruction survey moneys. to get their reSport in as soon as possible so as to make it feasible for this project to be eligible to go before the Bureau of the Budget for a request for funds for construction. There is no question but that this project should receive an excellent report and should be submitted by the Bureau to .budget and then to regular appropriation. I do hope that the Bureau will do everything within its power to get this report in so that the project can go up for appropriation. In closing my remarks. I commend the Subcommittee on Interior Department Appropriations. who are designated by the Deficiency Committee to go over these matters. likewise the Deficiency Committee of the House. for the substantial sums of moneys that were placed into the Irrigation and Reclamation program.",

Much has been said here on the floor today and yesterday and the. day before in reference to economy. but when it comes to these emergency floodcontrol projects it seems to me we are very much in the position of a man the roof of whose .house is leaking. He may look out in .good weather and figure that it costs a good deal to repair that roof and he can postpone the work of repairing it and thereby save money. but when the rains come and the storms beat upon it. he knows he has been guilty of false economy and his damage has been greatly increased. In striking out the recommendations of the Budget in reference to flood control. it is my humble opinion the committee has been guilty of false economy. In the year 1945. this country experienced its worst floods in history. Down in the Southwest especially where the floods are very bad. I refer to the States of Oklahoma. Texas. Louisiana. and Arkansas. The Army engineers estimated the damages from floods for the entire country for that 1 year to be in excess of $102.000.000. More than 15.000.000 acres were inundated by the floodwaters. If we could by building appropriate .emergency floodcontrol projects save even a reasonable percentage of the flood damage for the year 1945 we would go a long way towards repaying ourselves for the expenditures we hope this Congress will make on flood control. Some of these projects recommended by the Budget and having the support of the Army engineers as emergency projects are projects which were begun some time back and are now in varying stages of completion. There are undoubtedly other such projects. but I have in mind one that is 94 percent completed. yet we are told that that project must be reinvestigated and there must be a redetermination of the appropriation of that 6 percent additional money necessary to complete that project.",

I want to make a few remarks in reply to some of the statements which were made during theconsideration of the rule. I have been a Member of the House of Representatives for nearly 20 years. There has not been a select reorganization committee set up by the House during that time that I have not been a member of. I have been chairman of House committees. -and after the death of Senator Robinson. of Arkansas. I became chairman of the Joint Committee on Reorganization. During that period there were some very outstanding men who I have been associated with. One of them is now Secretary of State. Another is now Secretary of the Treasury. Another is now Comptroller General of the United States. The gentleman from Mississippi the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Cox]. and others. members of committees. Had this bill been brought to the floor immediately after it was reported by the committee nearly 2 weeks ago. this opposition that you hear now would not have sprung up. But the delay gave an opportunity to job holders to buttonhole Members of Congress to exempt their agencies so that they could retain their positions. The Speaker of the House of Representatives even made a public expression in reference to their interference. Are we going to listen to job holders. or do we intend to think of the interest of the taxpayers of this country? The President disapproved of what was going on. Subordinates of his in the executive branch of the Government coming to Members of Congress to try to override his recommendations. The gentleman from Indiana . I concede. has a right to talk about the Civil Aeronautics Administration. because he has been a member of the committee which considers legislation affecting the Civil Aeronautics Administration. Naturally he is interested. But if the President of the United States in the event this bill becomes a law. just as the gentleman from Mississippi said. retains the same position that he had while in the Senate to which the gentleman from Indiana referred. he can make the Civil Aeronautics Administration an independent agency. He can also return the REA to its former status.",

No. 1: The gentleman certainly knows I stated my opposition in the Rules Committee when this matter was before that committee and I have stated it publicly on many other occasions. But I certainly brought it out very definitely at the time the Rules Committee was considering the request for a rule. as the gentleman from Mississippi and the chairman of the committee know. . No. 2: I approve of the statements made by Senator Truman which I have quoted. I am disturbed by the change in his position indicated by the letter of the Bureau of the Budget stating that he is not for the recreation of the CAA as an independent agency. I am disturbed at his apparent objection to the exclusion of these independent agencies. I am disturbed at President Trumans reversing Senator Truman. . That other reorganization did not provide for the transfer of the CAA to the ICC to effect a consolidation. It shortcircuited the ICC and transferred it to the Department of Commerce. where it certainly should not be. No Government employee has spoken to me about my. opposition to this matter. not a single one has said a word to me. I am seeking to exempt these eight because they are in the same category as the three that are exempted and they should be exempted. I am motivated by principle and by conviction. not by a matter of getting votes. If there is any inconsistency it is on the part of the committee that exempts three ratemaking regulatory independent agencies and does not exempt the FCC and the Federal Power Commission and others. It is true. as the gentleman from Missouri indicated. that President Hoover submitted his plan after he was defeated. Maybe it was still a good plan. I do not know. but as I get it. the opposition was: \"We are going to wait for the incoming President to do the job.\" All I have got to say about that is that the incoming President came in. served as President for a long. long time. and if a real effective reorganization were needed then. certainly. in that long period of time the reorganization might have been effected.",

The past administration. the late President Roosevelt. had the power to provide that the Federal Power Commission should fix rates.

R. 3376 with the intention of giving to all permanent and probationary teachers and other employees of the Board of Education covered by the bill an increase in compensation of $100 for the current fiscal year over the amount of compensation such teacher or other employee would have received if the temporary bonus of $300 had been continued and if such teacher or other employee had received the $100 longevity increase to which she was entitled under then existing law. It appears that under the Senate amendment one who received a salary during the past fiscal year of $1.500 and whose basic salary is increased to $1.900 by H. R. 3376. would not receive this $100 increase. It also appears that certain probationary employees. if given an extra increase of $100 during the current fiscal year. will receive a higher salary than permanent employees who have been in the school system for a long number of years. The first five proposed amendments are to correct these inequities and to carry out the intent of Congress. . The sixth proposed amendment is to restore to the act a paragraph inadvertently omitted by the printer in printing the bill with amendments to accompany the report of the House Committee on the District of Columbia. The seventh proposed amendment is to correct a mistake of the printer in inserting a House amendment in the wrong place.

If there is one type of essential war production. essential war research. essential war planning. that should have had the very highest priority of anything in our whole country. it is the perfection and production of prosthetic appliances to help these men to meet their future life in America on as nearly a fair and decent basis as it is Within our power to create. It has been a matter of the most profound concern to me to find that apparently we are woefully behind in this work. I am making this speech not for the purpose of criticism nor for the purpose of spending even a moment talking about past failures. I am making it in order to say with all the vigor at my command that from this moment forward the experimental contracts for the production of prosthetic appliances. which I understand have been let by our Army to at least two large corporations. should be given a quadrurle A priority. if there is any such. that immediate funds should be made available for the most intensive research in this field of which the best scientific brains in this country are capable. and that the War and Navy Departments. disregarding every consideration that might in.any way deter such work. should press it with all the tremendous power at their command. I know I speak for every Member of Congress when I say that if there is a single piece of legislation or a single dollar of funds required from this body for these purposes. it will be provided immediately.",

On the floor I have called attention to the failure to have these hospitals ready. specifically for the thousands of mentallyill discharged veterans. In. the Washington TimesHerald of last night I read. and I quote: Vet hospitals get priorities: The War Production Board announced today that the Veterans Administration will be given construction priorities on an equal basis with the military in obtaining priorities for construction of new hospitals. With the War Production Board. since 1941. permitting use of materials to repair and remodel night clubs and build many kinds of other structures. it now first gives thought to the veterans who are fighting so that even the War Production Board might live. While during all these years. veterans were discharged with injuries and physical handicaps. the War Production Board has ignored the first debt of this country. It waited until men died from lack of hospitalization and the mentally deranged veterans are roaming the streets and killing their families. Hospital care comes next to bullets. for those who fight. Who is responsible in the executive side of the Government for this gross discrimination and injustice against the disabled war veterans. practiced for nearly 4 years? Why has the Veterans Administration and Board of Hospitalization not interested themselves to secure the priorities before this time. and will some one now build hospitals? It has been a national disgrace for the War Production Board to deny priorities for material to disabled war veterans for the needed hospitals.",

Unless a committee of this sort is very critical as to people who make all these charges on both sides of the fence. not because they are true but because they are trying to discredit their political opponents. it can make most serious mistakes.

With ablebodied people given gasoline for trips to go to the seashore and extra gasoline. it seems unbelievable that the OPA should not give our disabled service men and women at least 3 gallons a day. I saw a demonstration at Forest Glen the other day of automobiles with special gadgets and equipment for amputees. Yet I know that the manufacturers cannot get the priorities to manufacture the cars In order to allow the amputees to buy them if they are financially able. That is one reason I feel that an increase in the rate of compensation would help because the men could perhaps buy automobiles on the installment plan so that they could get about instead of staying at home. They are our first duty. The members of the press would be particularly interested in the work that Col. Robert S. Allen is doing at the hospital in inspiring other men to use a typewriter. that is. men who have lost an arm. just as he has given his right arm for us. I went out there the other day and he was working at a typewriter. using only his left hand. The people in charge of the reconditioning program in the hospital tell me he has so inspired the men with what he is doing that they have had to ask for two more teachers in the use of typewriters. When you read the article regarding h.m and which follows in the service magazine published at the Walter Reed Hospital. you will see he has helped to invent a different keyboard so that it will be easier for these men to write.

You will recall that in general debate on this bill I took the floor and discussed at some length the story of the FBI.

The organization is a conservative one. made up of people of high type. of high quality. of great efficiency. whose services are demanded many times by private industry. This amendment will help the FBI to keep many of these valuable employees in service. The committee in reaching the totals for the operation of the FBI for the next fiscal year may have overlooked the many additional duties which have been placed upon the FBI. After reviewing these totals your subcommittee now feels this additional amount is necessary. Therefore. Mr. Chairman. I urge the adoption of this committee amendment.",

It is only reasonable to assume that if we start this business census we will spend $15.000.000 before we complete it. My proposal is to cut out the entire business census this year. and I offer the amendment for the simple reason that never before in the history of the United States Government has our Government known more about business in the United States than at the present time. Just examine for a minute the number of questionnaires that are forwarded to all types and manner ot business by the Office of Price Administration. That is current. They are furnished every 3 months and also on an annual basis. Information from businessmen furnished to the OPA is the last word. straight from the horses mouth. The OPA claims such detailed information they know everything about American business from top to bottom. big and little. In addition. the Civilian Production Administration has control of the allocation of materials and must of necessity know exactly what the inventories and stocks of materials are in order to make the allocation of short supplies of civilian goods as well as the goods of heavy industry. Never before in the history of the country has government known more about business. and it is current. it is up to date. Particularly with reference to the Office of Price Administration. there has been a flood of businessmen and concerns trying to .et an increase in price and the reports required of businessmen are therefor even more frequent than quarterly.

If the gentleman from Missouri really wants to do something to help the small manufacturers and the small businessmen of America. let him reduce these huge appropriation bills that are being brought in by his committee to the floor of the House and are being passed by party votes. I say to you. if we really want to help business. if we want to take a load off of the small manufacturers and make it possible for them to show a profit. then. in the name of Heaven. stop sending them a lot of Government questionnaires to fill out. and thus give their employees at least a little time to devote to the manufacturing business.

Over the country during the past few days we have heard nothing on the part of the authorities but a demand for nurses: Nurses needed in cur armed forces. nurses needed in the hospitals in every community in the land. nursing facilities are very greatly needed. Yet today the proponents of this bill refuse to consider the drafting of male nurses into some sort of service to the country at large. This bill could provide that. I know that the issue will come before this House before too long regarding the possibility of getting nurses from somewhere. There are 6.000 male nurses in the armed forces of the United States. They have not been recognized. No commissions have been allowed them. However. in some situations male nurses are just as important as women nurses. They have been found in some cdses in this ghastly war to be imperative to the service in attending the wounded men at the front.",

Unfortunately. there is no provision for commissioning these men. in spite of the fact that they have been inducted into the ar:z:ed services as buck privates and have no opportunity to show their nursing ability. I am sorry this amendment cannot be considered. I think it should be considered before this debate is over. It seems strange that in spite of all the need there is for nurses. according to the War Department. no action seems to be forthcoming. We can get all the nurses we want here today by drafting male nurses and making it possible for them to be commissioned and recognized as such. just as women are.

Thereafter. in the course of the discussions. an amendment was offered which appears in the first six words on page 5. \"or the agency designated by him.\" We were told straight to the point that the purpose of those words was to take away from Mr. Byrnes or whoever might happen at the time to be Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion the responsibility behind the issuing of any regulation or order. One of the things that I find fault with and that I find the people back home find fault with today is the ability of persons to delegate to others in Washington duties for which they ought to be responsible. I feel that those words ought to be stricken out and the language left just as it was written in the original bill. so that Mr. Byrnes or whoevermay be the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion shall be responsible for any regulation issued.

A great many of those veterans have already been assigned to various schools and universities throughout the United States. in fact I know that here in the District of Columbia in the month of September some 600 men were assigned to different schools and universities in order to carry out our promise that the returned veteran would have the right to continue his education. Section 4 cuts directly across the privileges that have already been granted to returned veterans and allows the Director of the Selective Service to assign these men to jobs in industry if he sees fit. The amendment I have offered merely states that in the promulgation of these regulations he shall give full consideration to title II of the Servicemens Readjustment Act. namely. that he shall take into full consideration the promise of an uninterrupted education which we have given to returning veterans.

Formerly it used to take from 20 to 30 days. There are two amendments that I think should go into the bill.

In the loss of the late Senator Moses. the State of North Dakota has seen the passing on in the prime of life. of one of its outstanding citizens. one of its able representatives in the other branch of this Congress. The life of the late Senator is an example for all Americans to follow. Born abroad. in Norway. he came to this country and took advantage of the great educational opportunities of our country. he entered into its political life. His great mind. his sincerity. and his personal and public honesty were recognized by the people of North Dakota in electing him five times as States attorney of Mercer County. as Governor in 1938. again in 1940. and again in 1942. At the last election he received the confidence and the support of the people of North Dakota by being elected a Member of the United States Senate. As I say. his was an example of fidelity and devotion to the high ideals which noble men and women entertain. that all of us might well follow. We are deeply and profoundly moved by his passing on when he had so many years ahead of him to render valuable. constructive service to our country in the other branch of the Congress of the United States. I know I speak the sentiments of every Member of this body. the National House of Representatives. in conveying to the loved ones he has left behind. his wife and children. our profound sympithy in their great loss and sorrow.

No one who reads the record will doubt that Judge Johnson is guilty of conduct that could not be called good conduct in the ineaning of constitutional provisions. The only question is. now that he has resigned. how can we assure ourselves and the country that at some later time he or his estate shall not be able to collect the pension provided for a judge who resigns? I think this bill should be passed. I am not certain. however. that it will be a defense if this matter gets into the courts. I am afraid the court might consider this something in the nature of a bill of attainder. as an attempt by a legislative body to decide a case of a private individual without resorting to the method of trial provided by law. I think. however. if the judge should bring an action. eitier a suit for damages or an action for mandamus to compel payment. there would be a defense which the Government could set up. I believe these pensions are gratuities. Of course. the Government cannot be sued without its consent. The Government has given consent to be sued in certain contract cases. If any individual furnishes services or material to the Government he is entitled to sue in the courts for payment. However. I believe a pension given to a judge is a gratuity. and I doubt if the ccurts would entertain any suit brought by Judge Johnson for the money provided under the statute. providing pensions in certain cases. To my mind. this situation suggests the necessity for amending the general law covering pensions in cases of judges who have resigned or retired. Nevertheless. I believe the bill should be adopted for whatever good it may do in this particular case.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I want to talk on the subject of postwar requirements for national defense. It is possible to approach the subject from different directions and to arrive at varying conclusions. But reduced to its simplest elements. the immediate problem of the United States is this: First. We have emerged victorious from World War II only to find ourselves still living in an insecure and warlike world. Second. If we are ever to have a chance for peace. and for the continued pursuit of our peaceful ways of life. we must recognize the possibility of swift and devastating attack by those who envy us and seek their ends through war. Third. It follows necessarily that as a requirement of our national defense. to which we are all committed. we must have both men and weapons at least equal in effectiveness to those of any nation whose purposes we cannot trust. Although we may difter as to the formula. we can agree as to the basic requirement. We need an army. a navy. and an air force strong enough to meet a sudden threat from any quarter. What do we have? It is believed that the Navy as it stands substantially meets this requirement. Like the Army. it is passing through a period of readjustment and reshuffling. These readjustments follow inevitably in the wake of any war. But in an emergency. the Navy could shake down quickly. For all practical purposes. it appears ready to fight. We have the word of General Eisenhower that the Army is notthrough no fault of its own. Less than a year ago it was recognized by all nations as the most formidable and effective military machine the world had ever known. Today it is largely demobilized. It is an army in flux. facing an uncertain present and a more uncertain future. in distressing contrast to its recently glorious past. This discussion. therefore. is confined chiefly to the Army and its needs. and to the broader aspects of our national defense problem. This is not an academic subject. nor is it something that can wait. Other things can wait. but the national defense cannot. It should be approached with a sense of urgency. Whether we attack the problem as a whole or take it step by step. we must act definitely and act soon.",

Since that time. at every governors conference. I believe. at the last two. I knowthe governors have adopted resolutions reaffirming that stand. After some discussion. they have asked that the agency be turned back to the States after the war is over. I would very respectfully call to the attention of the Senator the fact that a year ago this same situation arose. If my memory is correct. it arose in the following way: The appropriation made by the Congress was not sufficient to cover these employment offices for the whole year. The question came up whether in our individual States employees should be dismissed and the services curtailed. With the approval of the authorities in Washington. the services were kept at full strength. There was some give and take and pull and haul. but that was the final result. Then Congress passed the deficiency bill.",

The reduction of $15.322.000 made by the House in requested appropriation for the United States Employment Sefvice threatens to reduce the staff of that service to below the level that has existed at any time since 1940. Moreover. the 600 new offices for the specific purpose of serving veterans recently authorized by Congress may not be established and there is some likelihood that the 150 offices which have already been opened will have to be closed. Of almost equal significance is the fact that the reduction in funds for general administration will probably result in closing many of the War Manpower Commission area offices. This will jeopardize the maintenance of an integrated national manpower program during the period between VEday and VJday. since It is through the area offices that the War Manpower Commission coordinates the various actions that must be taken in dealing with manpower problems. I should like to respectfully recommend that the Senate Appropriations Committee give every consideration to the restoration of the War Manpower Commission 1946 appropriation to the amount specifically requested by the President.

Mr. President. we are approaching the reconversion period. We must first carry on the Employment Service for war production plants and finish the war. Great production is vitally necessary. The second important feature to consider is this: Under the GI bill there has been added to this Service the important responsibility of looking after the returned soldier. Between January and April of this year. it was testified. approximately 400.000 returned soldiers were handled through this agency. In the last day or two we have received testimony to the effect that 2.000.000 men are to be discharged from military service during the current year. Under those circumstances we should aid those men in receiving adequate employment service. We must not eliminate the only agency now provided for taking care of the returned soldier by directing him to employment opportunities which may be open to him. The third point is that this item is essential to our recovery. This was considered by the committee. We were told that In our approach to reconversion the most vital .thing was the redistribution of the workingmen of this Nation. I assert that nothing would be more destructive to our recovery program in America than to have idle men wandering around looking for jobs which are available to them. but with which they do not find it possible to connect. Therefore we are obligated to these workers to make the necessary appropriation of funds to carry out the policy already approved by the Congress in April of this year when we instructed the agency under consideration to increase its number of offices by 600. and thereby provide a total of 2.100 offices. So. Mr. President. I believe the position of the acting chairman of the committee should be supported. Fifteen million dollars should be added to the appropriation in order to take care of employment in the war industries. to take care of our returning soldiers. and to help make the reconversion program a success.",

Mr. President. the additional amount asked for by the committee would not mean the establishing of any new offices which have not been passed upon by Congress. because. on April 25 of this year the deficiency bill specifically provided approximately $3.000.000 for the purpose of opening 600 additional local offices for employment services primarily in smaller communities in order to service returning veterans. The testimony was. I believe. that 400 of those offices had been opened. but it was necessary to withhold action with respect to the remaining 200 offices because of the House action on this bill. If the House cut prevails. it will be necessary to close the 400 offices already opened. to say nothing of not going ahead with the other 200.",

It was nearly $3.000.000. as I recall to provide for the 600 additional offices to be located close to where the veterans live. The other point which I wish to make in support of this increase is. that while the Senator from Kansas is perfectly right that the job of the War Manpower Commission in channeling available workers into jobs where they are most needed is pretty well over. although It will continue to a degree during the war with Japan. yet it now has just as big a job in reverse. We have many cutbacks. particularly in the shipbuilding plants and the aircraft plants on the West coast. where a million and a half workers have migrated from other States. and as those plants close dovn it seems to me that we must provide some agency that can advise their workers where there are job opportunities. and where they can fit back into the Nations economy. I think that is just as important a job as channeling a short supply of workers into needed jobs. and certainly it is essential to the welfare of the country.

It is true that we do need some of these offices. but the question is can they- not take employees from other jobs and assign them to this work. That is not the tendency upon the part of Government bureaus. The tendency is when they want new employees never to cut down the number of old ones. The Commission now asks for an appropriation of $15.000.000 for the purpose of aiding the veterans.

Now we are down to around 150.000 acres of beets. We find the same situation existing in many other States. At times our domestic producers of sugar beets and sugarcane have increased their acreage and they may wish to increase them again. Now they are down. Now we find the State of Florida could possibly increase their sugarcane acreage some 30.000 acres. Then we find in the.Northwest country new irrigation projects coming in. and the only cash crop I know of that will really make money for those farmers to pay for their farms in those irrigated regions will be sugar beets. * The thing that bothers me is this: Are you qnly going to provide. as time goes on. that those folks who can produce new acres in beets will have a chance to produce them under this legislation?",

However. I will admit that the Secretary ended his letter by saying that inasmuch as the policy had been determined. they were not going to object to the bill but they did point out the difficulty here. Who determined the policy I do not know. The Constitution of the United States says that the Congress shall control interstate and foreign commerce. No one else can write a policy. It was the belief of some that the Philippine Islands were entitled to a quota in this bill so that they could go back in there and build up their industry. Consequently. at one time the committee did take action. providing for a 700.000 shortton quota that would last 28 years. so American capital. Spanish capital. British capital. and Philippine capital could go back in there and rebuild their industries and know that over a long period of time they had a share in our market. That action also provided that the Congress of the United States might raise that from 700.000 to 850.000 short tons. in other words. it was a combination of the two theories. It was eminently fair. It was fair to the Filipinos. That provision should have remained in the bill. I want to point out that there are a great many wellinformed people who believe that you are doing an injustice to the Filipinos when you give a direct encouragement for them to stay with a onecrop economy. I want to call as my witness. Francis B. Sayre. former United States High Commissioner to the Philippines. who stated in an article in March 1945. in the Atlantic Monthly: If the new Philippine government after the war is wise enough and strong enough to prevent a return to prewar sugar production figures. one of the greatest milestones on the way to economic progress will be passed. I sincerely hope that when this bill goes over to the Senate this matter can be explored and possibly public hearings held on it.

As a result. the committee. in its final consideration. by a rather close vote. took out my amendment and accepted a compromise fixing an absolute quota of 850.000 short tons% It is my understanding that the proponents of the bill accepted this compromise. In all fairness to the Philippines. the figure is too high but it appears to be the best that can be done in the House. If the existing provision becomes law. the Philippines will be the only producers of sugar that have a guaranteed portion of our market for 28 years. During this 28 years Congress cannot change it. There are no restrictions on Philippine producers of sugar in their right to produce sugar for their own use. or to sell to the rest of the world. That is not true of our domestic producers of sugar.

No one has more respect for the patriotism of former Senator Byrnes than have I. but he will not be capable of entirely administering the law any more than will the President.

They were employees on strike because of the labor dispute which existed. and this situation was not materially changed by the resumption of operations on June 20. even though the company announced that those employees who desired to work must go to work on that day.. And so on. I call attention to other short excerpts from other cases. In the case of Fryns v. Fair Lawn Fur Dressing Company (114 N. J. Equity. 462. 168 At.. 862 to 865) the court said: It is true that complainants went on strike. but even while on strike. they remained. for the present purpose. employees of defendant. Again in Uden v. Schaefer (110 Wash.. 391. 11 A. L. R. 1031) the court saidand I shall read only a sentence: A \"strike.\" in such common acceptance. is the act of quitting work by a body of workmen for the purpose of coercing their employer to accede to some demand they have made upon him. and which he has refused. That is it Is not a voluntary discontinuance of employment. In another case. State v. Personett (114 Kans. 680). it is stated in this way: It may be noted that a strike is not a quitting of employment. The man who goes on a strike does not profess to quit his employment. He still lays claim to his position and asserts a right to go back and take it at more advantageous terms. Those are only a few citations. but they illustrate the point and they are not all based on a specific statute relating to labor relations.",

I intend to speak at some length on this bill at a later day. but I want to say in regard to the point that the distinguished Senator from Ohio has raised for discussion that we must keep in mind a certain technique that is used in attempting to settle some strikes or disputes. and that is the taking over of plants by the Government in the face of a strike. When the Government takes over a plant in the face of a strike and opens the plant to employment to any person who wants to work in the plant it is not the practice to look upon the employees on strike as any longer employees. It seems to me that under the provisions of the bill as now framed the penalty clause would apply. and certainly it would be easy to make it apply by the promulgation of a regulation by the Director. Of course. I think the Senator from Utah confesses a great weakness in this bill when he says that if we cannot have confidence in cur Government. then. of course. in effect. all is lost. I have confidence in my Government if the dministrators under the Government are properly checked in accordance with our theory of government. But I know of no bill that has come before the Senate in a long time which has given such arbitrary power to an administrative officer as this bill gives to the Director of War Mobilization. I speak of him as a close friend. but I would refer to him as \"Mr. X\" so far as the application of the principles about which I wish to talk is concerned.

It is my considered opinion that any appropriations which the Federal Government makes for the construction of transmission lines in the Central Valley. as described in the amendment. will not bring electricity to one more user than is presently provided by the lines of the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. It was brought out in the evidence. as I understood it. that there would be no reduction in the rate charged to consumers of electricity transmitted over federally financed lines. In other words. electricity would not be furnished to more users than are now using electricity. and would not be furnished at a rate less than that which is now being charged. So far as bringing water is concerned to the lands in that section which must be irrigated. nothing of that kind will be accomplished as a result of the proposed appropriation. It is fairly well established. in my opinion. that the electricity for pumping water can be transmitted over the presently established line of a privately owned taxpaying utility which is already furnishing electricity to the citizens of California at very low rates. So if the amendment were adopted the tax income from that large company would be lost. Electricity would not be provided to the users at a lower rate. but the Federal debt would be increased. and there would be no chance of getting back the money for a long period of years. Therefore. I am inclined to ask the Senate to uphold the committeeapproved amendment and to vote against the amendment which is now pending.",

I must conclude. To many of us the overwhelming reason that the passage of this bill is so tremendously urgent is the threat of starvation overseas. It was apparent and was mentioned in our report of a similar bill last November. but it has now become almost a reality. Dare we deny our President the power of allocating food for a starving world?

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 10 minutes. Mr. Chairman. a number of questions have been asked as to why it is necessary to extend these war powers. The simplest way to answer those questions is to read briefly from the testimony of Hon. John W. Snyder. Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion. and Commodore John D. Small. Director of Civilian Production Administration. Mr. Snyder said: If there is not an early extension of the Second War Powers Act. we can soon expect a disorderly scramble for materials on the part of producers. and for finished goods on the part of dealers. Hoarding would be inevitable. But an even worse situation would doubtless develop. In the scramble for goods. many would be left behind in the rush. A tendency to delay production and distribution would follow. Price pressures would increase. And let me repeat the warning of our President. any such tendency would seriously hamper reconversion. and would add a new and dangerous inflationary factor to the many already existing. Then. again. he calls attention to the specific need for the exercise of allocation and priority powers. He says: There are the needs for controls in the use of building materials. and controls to assure an adequate supply of lowcost clothing. In addition. the need for controlling and allocating such scarce materials as rubber. lead. zinc. and leather are well known to all of us. Then he calls attention to the fact that without priorities it is impossible to break bottlenecks in the reconversion process. He quotes an old maxim that \"For want of a nail the battle was lost.\" Let me give you a few other examples. For want of linings. tire production is reduced. Priority powers are necessary if we are to be able to meet our foreign commitments. including food and other relief needed throughout the world.",

It -would be stupid to say that they will have to do it blindly or by guesswork. Mr. Chairman. some of the members of the committee felt as I do. when the bill was under consideration. that we should extend these powers for short periods only. that we should keep a tight rein on the control agencies. and before extending the powers we should require them to come to us at short intervals and demonstrate clearly the necessity for further extensions. Many of us felt that extensions should not be granted for a period in excess of 6 months. but. as the gentleman -from Alabama pointed out. .we are assured by our leaders that Congress will adjourn sine die sometime in July and it is quite possible that some of these powers of priority and allocation will have to be extended beyond December 31. The need will become apparent. if at all. in the fall. If we extend them until December 31 only. and it becomes imperative to further extend the powers. it would be necessary to call a special session to consider the legislation. Others on the committee would like to extend these powers. from year to year. We reached a compromise and decided on March 31. -1947. an extension of 9 months.

We are all in favor of having the children of America well fed. I believe that the cost of their food should be paid now by their parents and by the local school authorities. This legislation would require these little children to pay for their own food by adding it to the national debt. Even after the Federal Budget is balanced. the passage of this legislation will mean passing on to our children a greater portion of our unpaid national debt. Mr. Chairman. these children are intelligent. You cannot fool them. If the Federal Government undertakes to pay the cost when a child is born. provide him with a free school nursery. give him medical care throughout his life. give him free lunches. unemployment compensation and oldage security. then he is going to ask. \"What will the Federal Government demand of me?\" All of these socalled benefits mean additional burdens in taxes throughout the productive years of our children. This Congress has nothing to give to the children of America except that which it later takes away from them in taxes. plus a heavy load of interest and administrative expenses. We are deceiving our children when we say that the GoVernment has wealth to give away. We should stop talking about Government benefits and tell the truth about the burdens of Government. There is a further reason why this legislation is wrong. It is a false education. it is statism in its worst form. Already hundreds of little children have been instructed to write the politicians in Washington for something to eat. Shall we teach them that one must labor for his daily bread or that he need only join a political lobby? Others may join in an insidious educational program to teach the children of America to pray: \"Our politicians. who art in Washington. give us this day our daily bread.\" instead of praying: \"Our Father. who art in Heaven. give us this day our daily bread\". but I cannot do that.",

But in comparison it shines with the luster of the morning star. For be it remembered that only a few generations ago Gov. William Berkeley. of Virginia. said in his report to the Commissioner of Colonies: I thank God there are no free schools. no printing. and I hope we shall not have them these hundred years: for learning has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into the world. and printing has divulged them. Happily. the gentleman from Virginia and many other Members of the Congress know that progress and humanitarianism exalt a nation and that standpatism and reaction are a reproach to any people. Certain arguments that have been made against the bill cause me. to fear that some of those who oppose it may entertain a philosophy that is not wholly unrelated to that expounded by Governor Berkeley. For examples. yesterday the \ufffd1946 gentleman from New York . a distinguished former United States Senator. the eloquent gentleman from Texas . and the able gentleman from Illinois vigorously assailed the bill. The capability of these legislators is such that anyone of them could. with little immodesty and no exaggeration. repeat the boast of the stoical philosopher Chrysippus: \"Give me a theory and I will find an argument to support it.\" Fortunately for the friends of Federal aid to the schoollunch programs. the argumentation of the opposition. including that of the gentlemen named. is by no means as logical and as convincing as it is eloquent and seductive.

    "speech": "Attempts in the House to limit the fund to its alleged purposes of temporary assistance for currency stabilization purposes only have been rejected by the Treasury. and so the fund is little more than a loaning agency during the transition period. As such it Is even more unsound than the bank. for every member nation is entitled to draw its share of the fund. regardless of its needs. The fund looks entirely to governments for repayment. and not to productive enterprise. However desirable its purpose may be. it is today only an addition to the profligate lending policy which I have been discussing. Mr. President. I respectfully suggest. therefore. that the Senate consider carefully the implications of these policies before the bill is presented next week. Basically. the question is whether we are willing to commit this Government to a Iermanent policy of Governmentguaranteed f6reign investment and widespread loans to foreign governments. I cannot imagine that the American people will really wish to embark. at Government expense. on a vast policy of scattering our assets around a world from which they may never be recovered. I cannot imagine they wish to embark on a policy which was repudiated by every intelligent economist in the twenties. I cannot imagine they will approve the method proposed. by which our assets would be put into a pool and dispensed by a board controlled by the debtors that are anxious to secure our dollars. Again I suggest that we postpone consideration of this elaborate plan. designed to meet the condition of a stable world. and that we authorize the Executive to deal directly with the emergency conditions we now face. That is an American job and a government job. and only the American Government can undertake it. If we postpone this bill. I suggest that we increase at once the direct lending powers of the ExportImport Bank.",

When the French Government returned to power after having been supplanted for 4 years by Nazi control. the entire economic life of France was found to be disorganized and nobody knew what was the value of the franc. It was necessary to come to some understanding with reference to the relationship existing between the dollar and the franc. In the First World War the franc was worth approximately 15 cents. It was stabilized at the end of the present war at 2 cents.. or at the rate of 50 francs for a dollar. Many persons were in the possession of francs who did not have very much faith in the value of the franc because they were not sure of what would happen to France. They were willing to sell francs in exchange for dollars and receive a greater number of francs in return. During blackmarket operations some persons were willing to give 250 francs for $1. However. there is no way by which that situation can be corrected except by France herself. because we cannot expect our soldiers to go on the black market and obtain more than 50 francs in order to have francs with which to purchase. articles In France.",

I think every Senator present coming from the States in question is familiar with the fact that even life insurance policies are not exempt. Certainly it is not fair that these 17 States. out of 48.-should require the old pioneers who live within their borders to transfer their property before they may receive oldage assistance. In my opinion it is not fair that England should be loaned three or four billion dollars. money which is to be sent abroad. before the old pioneers. who made this country what it is. are reimbursed.

I ask unanimous consent to introduce for appropriate reference another bill. prohibiting the making of a loan to Great Britain until certain crop5 production and harvesting loans shall have been canceled. During the period of the great drought in this country. at a time when there was a tremendous food shortage all over America. hundreds of thousands of farmers in the United States did not have a single penny with which to seed a crop. They went to the Government and secured feed and seed loans. Some of these loans were made in 1931. others in 1932. others in 1933. and in 1934. 1935. 1936. and so on. When I came to the Senate I introduced a bill giving the Department of Agriculture authority to cancel or to adjust this indebtedness. There were instances among the farmers in the dust bowl where men had worked and slaved with their families for 30 or 35 years. Then came the drought. Then came 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 and in some places 10 years without a crop. Nevertheless our Government is still charging interest on those loans. Time and time again in cases where farmers owed money by reason of seed loans. the Government has taken all the profit from the farm in payment of the old feed and seed loans and the interest thereon. and the widows and children have gone upon relief. If any Senator doubts that statement I can produce scores of letters to prove it. and I can show it even by the records of the Federal Government itself. Mi. President. I believe that rather than help the farmers or the taxpayers of any foreign country to whom it is proposed that we lend $4.400.000.000. that we should help the farmers of our own country. who went through that trying period and produced food for this country. and that the loans made at that time should be canceled before loans are made to any foreign country.

The most important phrase in many acts today is: \"Blank agency shall have the power to issue rules and regulations to carry out this act.\" We have built up volumes of administrative law which the Transport Division of the Army would be burdened to carry from one point to another. My theory about how this will work is derived from some experience. It will work by a continuous surveillance. oversight. watchfulness of the particular standing committee and its staff over the manner in which the department or agency is exercising the broad delegation of legislative power given to it so as to make certain that the power is being exercised as was intended by the Congress. It will have no power to tell the head of a department or agency. \"We abrogate this regulation.\" but it will become familiar. as the process goes along from month to month and year to year. with the manner in which the department or agency is administering the power bestowed upon it.

We have reached the point where practically every measure of any great magnitude that passes Congress contains a general delegation of legislative power.

There is not a Senator. so far as I know. who will now contend that. so far as food products are concerned. in fact. so far as concerns practically all commodities which today are handled in commerce. there is not a black market in them.

If any of you know anything about muskeg you know it is a bottomless water. earth. and sand formation. and they have to build what are called corduroy roads or a type of floating roadway. As you go up the Alcan Highway from Edmonton to Fairbanks there are several glacier formations which melt in the summer sun and which. with other precipitations during the warm season. cause flooding and serious washout problems at a number of points along this highway. This. of course. involves heavy expense in maintenance. In the winter season of heavy snows you can well imagine that snow removal is a continuous and expensive maintenance cost. The bridges are washed out. at times and have to be replaced. This muskeg condition. of course. is a semifluid condition and it can be maintained only at great expense.

Dividing this committee up into subcommittees and sending them on an exploratory or Investigating trip around the world cannot in my opinion be productive of any good results. I would not entertain the fears that I have as to any ill effects that might result from such visits made by any other committee of this House. and I do not mean by that that I have less confidence in the pcrsonnel of this committee than in other committees. but having them represent this country as diplomatic representatives. in a sense. is in my judgment as unwise thing to do. I do not believe that this resolution would be here except for injured vanity. except for the feeling on the part of this great committee that it loses something oi its importance and of its standing unless it. too. do some visiting abroad. It has not as yet been disclosed to me as to what this committee could investigate with the slightest hope of better equipping them to deal with the problems that normally come to the committee. I do not want to characterize all these visits as junketing trips taken at the expense of the people. but in the main they are largely pleasure trips. nothing more and nothing less. I have great confidence in the wisdom of the chairman of this committee. I have confidence in the wisdom of many other members of the committee. But to say that this committee shall be divided into groups of five and sent around the world on an inquisitorial sort of mission strikes me as being an extreme proposal. What are they going to Investigate? Where are they going? What are the groups into which the committee is to divide Itself? Are they to be steered by this wise and good manthat heads the committee as its chairman. or are they to be left togo wherever Interest directs?",

We know under the provisions of that authorization. which is in all of our current appropriation bills. we have just sent a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations to Europe. which subcommittee says it is going into all of the European countries to investigate for the State Department the conditions with reference to the embassies to see which have been bombed and which have not. and what repairs are needed. et cetera.

I am not a military expert. but I say that if one uses his common sense. it would tell him that we do not need 4C0.000 men to occupy our portion of Germany.

I certainly hope that neither the offimials of the Army nor anyone else in our Government is going to try to keep a great number of our soldiers in France or Italy or Greece or some other country simply for the purpose of trying to preserve order there.

He is one of the most dynamic individuals in public life today. He is one of the greatest soldiers of our day and generation and one of the greatest leaders of men this war has produced. He summed up his military career in a short conversation with me in my office a day or two ago when he said he applied the tactics of our great military leaders of the past to mechanized equipment. He is indeed a military genius who looks forward and not backward. He is not only a great military leader* but he is one of the most popular generals with the rank and file of the soldiers under him that this country has ever had. He never sends a man where he is not willing to go himself. That was demonstrated when he plunged into the Sure River amidst snow and ice to lead his valiant troops to victory. From the highest general on his staff to the lowliest private in the ranks. General Patton is respected. loved. and admired. As Secretary of War he would clean house in the War Department and put a stop to the commissioning of individuals who are not in sympathy with our form of government. as well as to the dissemination of injurious propaganda.

I am certain every Member of Congress is aware of the fact that the Government propaganda mills. along with special interests. try to color the thinking of not only Congress but the people at home. We in Washington are much closer to the propaganda and get daily inoculations. The folks at home have sufficient time to think through and see some of the false statements which constantly flood the country. It is difficult here in Washington to properly evaluate the legislation Under those circumstances. It seems to me that much of the legislation has been 51 percent good and 49 percent bad. This Congress has considered much legislation which is of doubtful character. It has been put through under the guise of war necessity. I am certain that if the country really understood all of the things that this Congress has considered and done. there would be a tremendous revolt. It may be rather difficult for some of us to answer to the folks at home but it ought to be done. I doubt if many folks in the country were informed of the testimony of Dean Acheson of the State Department before the Committee on Banking and Currency when he put into the record the fact that there are 48 different agencies spending. lending. and giving away the resources of this country in foreign lands. These agencies employ more than 400.OOC people outside of the United States. We have nearly 3.000.000 others on the pay roll in this country. This Congress has entered upon a spending spree. The time has arrived to stop. look. and listen. We should take another look at LendLease. UNRRA. Bretton Woods. and the ExportImport Bank. and many other Government agencies which are now in operation. I think it is well for the Members to get back home andtalk to their constituents. It is a time of sober reflection and thinking and getting ready for cutbacks in Government expenditures. The war in Japan may well be over when we return.

I have introduced in the House today a bill to amend the War Mobilization and Reconversion Act of 1944. to provide for an orderly transition from a war to a peacetime economy through supplementation of.unemployment compensation payable under State laws. This bill is identical to the Kilgore bill introduced in the Senate on July 17. It carries out the recommendations of President Truman. recently made in his message to Congress. My reason for introducing this bill is that when the Ways and Means Committee takes up the consideration of the bill H. R. 3736. introduced by the. gentleman from North Carolina. Chairman DOUGHTON. of our committee. the committee will have before it at the same time my bill which is somewhat broader in scope than the Doughton bill. inasmuch as it first provides increased benefits for returning veterans. second. it starts payments under the act without waiting for mass unemployment to descend upon the Nation. third. it provides coverage for Federal employees and maritime workers under the District of Columbia Unemployment Compensation Act. fourth. it includes processing workers: and. fifth. it provides travel allowance for displaced workers. The question of employee displacements during the reconversion period is one that cannot be ignored. We must maintain a high national income during the coming years. We have already enacted legislation to assist business and commerce to reconvert to peacetime production in the hope that there may be as little unemployment as possible. Jobs must be provided and the purchasing power maintained. I believe this can be done. and it will be done if management. labor. and Government cooperate during peacetime as they have done during wartime.

The administration was headed by an American. The beneficiaries of that re.lief received aid from an American source. and it was so understood by everyone. What happened? We did not have enough to go around. We did not give everyone all he wanted. and when we came out of it we gained no particular credit.

    "speech": "Mr. President. my attention has just been called to a story in one of the Washington papers of a funereal. memorial dinner that was held last night at one of the local hotels in memory of the passing of one Aubrey Williams. Some of the chief mourners alleged to have been present were Mrs. Roosevelt. Secretaries Wallace and Wickard. and a distinguished Republican Senator. The Secretary of Commerce. who has just recently encountered considerable delay and trouble in getting over a senatorial hurdle. was bold to declare that notwithstanding the very decided. and affirmative rejection of Williams and his governmental philosophies by the Senate. he need not worry about a job in the Government. Personally. I think that the head of any Government agency. or even the President for that matter. would show very poor judgment in defying the good will of the Senate. which refused by such a decided majority to advise and consent to the use of this man in the administration of governmental affairs. by giving Williams any appointment in the Government. Mrs. Roosevelts presence. together with her audacious statement that Williams Is a leader of democracy. will be hard for a great many Senators and Democratic leaders to understand. She asserted that the cause of liberalism \"had not even lost a round\" with the defeat of Mr. Williams. Now. I. who claim to be at least a quasi liberal in Government. would like to suggest to the mourners on this occasion that if they propose to hold up Williams with his record and announce him as the leader and spearhead of American liberalism. the Democratic Party will have to do a little house cleaning or our Republican friends will have little trouble in taking over. The American people can stand a whole lot to maintain party loyalty. but they will eventually get fed up on certain philosophies advanced by quack leaders. The only job in the Democratic administration. in my judgment. that Williams could properly fill would be in the socalled F. E. P. C.. if and when it shall be established by law. or it may be that Henry Wallace could find him an assignment to Liberia in his foreign commerce setup. where Williams could find a full and complete outlet for his views. sentiments. and philosophies.",

Voigt. who was formerly editor of the Manchester Guardian. and one of the ablest editors in Great Britain. He has written an article entitled \"Greece. Yugoslavia. and Poland.\" which appeared in the February 1945 issue of The Nineteenth Century and After. In the article. on page 54. he tells of what is going on in Yugoslavia. as follows: The Yugoslav Partisans have achieved what the Greek Partisans failed to achieve. They are masters of \"liberated\" Yugoslavia. They occupied Belgrade in September 1944. But they established such a reign of terror that the population rose against them and turned them out. After 3 days they returned. and with Russian help recaptured the city. A massacre followed and the reign of terror was reestablished. It is today raging wherever Tito and his Partisans are in control. Mr. Churchill said in the House of Commons on January 18 Marshal Tito \"is undoubtedly at this time its (Yugoslavias undisputed master.\" Yet he represents but a small minority of its people. He has been made so by Great Britain. much more so than by Russia. for it is with the help of British arms and supplies and British propaganda that he has been able to conquer his own country. a country which repudiates his political principles and regards him with loathing as a peculiarly inhuman usurper. tyrant. and extortioner. So much so that it is hard to believe that his conquest can endure. Despite his immense superiority In arms. he Is so intolerable a tyrant that he can hardly fail to engender a national rising which must destroy him and his Partisans unless they continue to receive help Irom outside.

When he has satisfactorily completed the advanced course. .and if he is otherwise qualified. he is commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps. Many members of the armed forces doubtless will enroll in colleges and universities after the war who will wish to take the advanced Reserve Officers Training Corps training and qualify themselves for Reserve commissions. but they will be deterred from taking such advanced work if they are not given credit for the military training that they have already received. Such a situation is manifestly undesirable. and the purpose of this bill is to remedy it by granting proper credit for prior military service. I might say that the War Department informs us that they have now applications from returning war veterans who have been in the service for 1. 2. or 3 years. and It Is the desire of the Department to have their combat service credited in connection with the R. 0.

It really in itself is not inflationary. It does not stimulate the issue of currency. but it makes it possible to issue an increased amount of currency resulting from the inflation which is brought about by the deficit financing of the war. which is exactly the same thing. Mr. President. as a practical matter. we have no choice. any more than we had a choice respecting the matter of increasing the public debt. It is an inflationary measure. but I should say that the passage of the bill is not in itself going to increase the amount of currency. It makes it possible. if forced by other things. for the currency to be increased. It makes it possible to issue a larger amount of currency. On the other hand. if we come to the point where we cannot issue any more currency we would be in pretty bad shape. I do not know how we could then conduct or finance the war. Consequently we are practically up against the gun. We have to permit the increase of currency. The real fault is the deficit financing of the war. which has resulted in increasing the debt $50.000.000.000 a year.

Division of Research and Statistics: The reserves required to be held by member banks at the Federal Reserve banks amount to about 16 percent of their total deposits. Against these memberbank reserves. the Reserve banks must hold a xeserve of 35 percent. The prcduct of these two ratios measures the demand made by memberbank deposits on gold reserves. The ratio is less than 6 percent. The following is a footnote: The basic statutory requirement for member banks on.net demand deposits is 13 percent for central reserve city banks. 10 percent for reserve cty banks. and 7 percent for country banks. with 3 percent on time deposits at all classes of banks. United States Government warloan balances are not subject to these requirements. The Board of Governors has administrative authority to raise these requirements for any class of bank. or .either class of deposit to not more than twice the statutory minima. The prevailing requirements are: For net demand depbslts at central reserve city bank:. 20 percent. reserve city banks. 20 percent. country banks. 14 percent. for all time deposits. 6 percent. Because of varying distribution of deposits among classes of banks and between types of deposit. the aggregate member bank ratio of requirements varies from time to time but at the end of 1914 it averaged about 16 percent.",

We would reach our limit. The Government would then try to sell bonds and the banks would say. \"We are sorry. but we cannot sell any more bonds because we do not have the necessary cash to put into the Federal Reserve bank which we are required by law to do.\" So the financing of the war would stop. If a man wished to Pay his employees he would go to a banker and tell him that he needed money. The banker would say. \"We are sorry. there is no more currency.\" The first thing we wouldhave would be a fear that there was no money. We would have runs on our banks. and such a condition generally that Congress overnight would probably do something more radical than we are proposing now to do. Mr. President. what we are doing here is similar to the recent increase in the debt limit. We had to increase the debt limit. We have no choice about this reserve under present conditions.

During his latter years of service in the House Judge HEIDINGER was a member of the Committee on Naval Affairs. I doubt if there was a member of the committee more loyal. more interested in the work of that committee than Judge HEIDINGER. He attended all of the meetings. My impression of him was that he was not so much interested in the number of ships that were built. or their size. or the number of airplanes. his interest was in the welfare of the people who ran the ships and the airplanes. This was symbolic of the mans character. It indicated his complete humaneness. his love of mankind rather than matter. So even though he was a member of that committee for comparatively few years. during that period of time he contributed in a large way to the building of the Navy of this country which is our great pride and which is the awe of the world. Every member of the committee came to love Judge HEIDINGER because of that human interest that he constantly displayed. I think one of the finest compensations we who serve in this House have is the opportunity that is given us in working here to become associated with grand. lovable characters. and in that way perhaps to enrich our own lives and our own character. The feeling of the members of the Committee on Naval Affairs toward Judge HEIDINGER in that regard is shared by every Member of this House who knew that fine gentleman. that lovable man. Judge HEIDINGER. Because of his service here each one of us has been enriched. The country has benefited immeasurably by his service.

The resolution pays tribute to the actions of the Italian people in overthrowing Mussolini and the forces of fascism. and likewise commends them for their cooperation with the Allied forces in the struggle against a common foe. The resolution gives voice to the plea of the Italian people that Italy be declared an ally of the United States. and that an invitation. be accorded to Italy to participate in the forthcoming San Francisco Conference. The diplomatic and political relations between Italy and the United Nations have been steadily progressing since President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill addressed the Italian people prior to the landing of the liberation forces in Italy. In that first message to the Italian people they were asked to overthrow the forces of Hitler and Mussolini. Later President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill promised that selfgovernment would be restored to Italy as speedily as possible. and those pledges have been kept.

We are told we must hold the line. We have not had any legislation which would go any further. toward breaking the line than this legislation putting a support price on commodities far above parity.

The burley growers have no direct interest in the dark types of tobacco but are indirectly interested in that there is a sort of relationship among all the types. such a relationship as possibly does not exist in connection with any other crop in this country. Besides. there is also a tendency on the part of growers in some areas to switch from one type to another as prices are up or down. this throws the relationship and production out of balance.

I wish to say that I believe the proposed legislation is in the right direction. I think it should be considered now because it will clarify the provision of the original GI bill and serve to eliminate a great deal of red tape and delays that have been encountered that the Congress did not anticipate when the legislation was enacted. I wish to further assure the House that I am as much interested and have consistently supported and aided in the passage of legislation in the interest and for the benefit of the veterans of all wars as any other Member of this House. and intend especially to see that the boys who are now returning receive all possible aid and help that this great Government owes and must extend to them.",

The committee bill makes provision for that. The only difference between the committee bill and the Crosser bill in that regard is that the committee bill holds that the disability must arise out of an injury or illness connected with the employment and not be just any disability that might arise by reason of any cause apart from that.

The amendment would make available $300.000.000 for forestry research. mostly in the southeastern section of the country. A substantial number of Member.of the House appeared before the Committee on Appropriations when it was conducting its hearings in the House. and asked that such provision be made for further experimentation in the matter of forestry. Unfortunately. the House committee did not see fit to go along with that suggestion. and I understand wanted some further time to study the question. But the Senate inserted this item. and it is a matter of much concern to many of US. The question of forestry is a most important matter. During the war period our forests have been called upon to bear the greatest burden of furnishing material. lumber. pulpwood. and various forrest products. all out of line with the normal demands. The result has been considerable depletion of our national forest resources. This Is not a sectional or local matter. It is a matter that affects the entire country. It is a matter that affects the postwar period of this country which we hope to shortly enterthe question of replenishing this great national resource. our national forests. So a number of forestry associations and a number of people who have studied the forestry question have interested themselves and have come forward with this idea of stimulating the growth of our forests. experimentation in the expansion of our national forests. and it was found that. additional funds were necessary for that purpose.

The people of America have in about 150 years largely denuded this country of virgin timber. We once had the finest forests in the world. Now. our forests are largely gone and we have millions of acres that have no commercial timber to speak of and that is resulting in erosion to a degree that is alarming. The restoration of our forests is a national problem. It is as much a national problem as the restoration of our lands. and we have long ago regarded that as a national problem. We have already learned that in tur wakim southern climate. southern pine will grow very fast. The growth of southern pine on land that is protected from fires affords land owners a pretty good financial return. But the growing of timber is a matter of paramount interest to the Nation. The preceding generations have used up our forests. The coming generations are not going to have timber unless we take the proper steps to grow timber. It is -an obligation of this generation to take those steps so that our children and our childrens children may have the benefit of forests and timber products. This amendment. therefore. to provide these experiment stations to further study and promote reforestation is of tremendous importance. not only to the sections directly involved. but to the whole Nation.

In this operation. coal and clay are removed by delving Into the surface of the earth with a steam shovel to such depths as is necessary to reach the mineral deposits. The overburden so removed is left in spoil banks. sometimes 10 or 15 feet high. Opposite to these are the deep valleys left by the excavation. It is proposed with the money allowed in this amendment to have the United States Forest Service. probably through the Experiment Station. at Columbus. Ohio. find cut what kind of trees can be successfully grown on these abandoned lands. as a guide in returning them to useful production. There are some experts who say that if the banks are leveled it might create soil conditions making successful reforestation hazardous. This Is one of the things we want the experts to investigate. and this probably can be done only by staking off planting plot& for experimental use. It is conceivable that such forestation might provide wood pulp. fence posts. and other useful products. In some sections. fruit orchards have been planted. In Ohio the legislature is now concerned with trying to regulate strip mining. with the idea of having the lands leveled off in the future. when new operations are undertaken.

It would be almost impossible for the Army to operate under any such mandate. We would. in effect. have to put thousands upon thousands of men \"on the shelf\" after their essential training had been completed before we could use them. In the Air Corps alone possibly 500.000 such -men would be Involved. Incidentally. the Navy and the Marine Corps enlist men of 17. and I am told that the average age of the entire .corps is below 20. . That was the attitude of the Department. The Department was eager to give .those men 12 months training whenever and wherever it was necessary. but it saw clearly that it would be Impossible to carry on efficiently if by statute we should fix an arbitrary time limit on -the training which each mdn of the age of 18 should receive.

It is a great sacrifice for parents to lose their boys through any cause. But. at that time we were legislating on the basis of two sound fundamental truths. One of them was that we had been told by many Army officialsand it was generally understoodthat we would have a much stronger army if we inducted younger boys because they made better soldiers than the older ones.

All this resolution does is to continue a committee which was created shortly before the last Congress adjourned. the purpose of which was to make a general survey of the whole congressional setup and then report its findings back to the Congress with its recommendations. The resolution provides that that committee must make a preliminary report not later than April 1 of this year. I discussed the resolution fully in this forum. just a few weeks ago. when the original resolution was before the House. I can add nothing to that explanation other than to say that there was one provision in the original resolution which limited the committee in making recommendations concerning certain changes in the organization of the House. By agreement of those interested in the subject. the language in this resolution has now been- amplified so that the hobbles are taken off the committee and the committee can recommend just what it thinks should be done to improve the efficiency of the Congress.

I have always found JOHN MURPHY to be upright. courteous. and. above all. sincere in hiis convictions. His genial personality and kindly disposition have won the acclaim of all who have been privileged to know him. Pennsylvania is justly proud of JOHN MURPHY. and his splendid educational background and prominence in legal circles are sufficient guaranty that he is eminently qualified for appointment as a Federal judge. The congressional district so ably represented by JOHN MURPHY has suffered a loss by his resignation but there is compensation in the fact that he is assuming important judicial duties and that his services to the Federal Government will not be terminated. May good health continue to attend him and may he enjoy a long and successful career as a Federal jurist is my sincere wish. Similar honors have been conferred upon my good friend the gentleman from Texas. LUTHER A. JOHNSON. whom I had the pleasure of accompanying on a recent trip as a member of a congressional delegation. I have learned from his devoted wife that LUTHER JOHNSONS ambition in life was to serve in the Congress of the United States. This objective was realized. and his years of honorable and faithful service are a testimonial of his depth of character and spotless reputation. His distinctive service. ability as a leader. and his courage and fidelity are a few of the many attributes that qualify him for the position as a Federal judge. We shall miss his presence in the Halls of Congress. but he will have the opportunity of serving his country in a similar capacity through his assignment as a member of the Federal courts.

In other words. where a legal partnership is recognized within the State. it shall be so recognized by the Federal Government for purposes of taxation. It is not so recognized today. except in those States that are socalled community property States. If the Federal Government for purposes of revenue is to recognize a partnership between husband and wife in 11 States in the Union. it is my belief they should also recognize legal partnerships between husband and wife in the other 37 States of the Union for purposes of revenue. Many States. in order to correct this inequity. have become community property States. and other States are taking steps to become community property States for this very reason. It is my opinion that States of the Union should not be forced to become community property States for the sole purpose of equalizing Federal taxation. From the Internal Revenue Department. which has given considerable study to this question itself. I obtained some examples to show the preference enjoyed by partnerships in the community property States as compared with those which are not recognized as a community property State. In the case of a partnership with $5.000 taxable income. the amount of tax in Nebraska would be $844 while in California it would be $810. or a saving of $34. In the case of a $10.000 taxable income. the tax in Nebraska would be $2.300. and in California it would be $1.940. making a preference of $360 in favor of California residents. In the case of a family partnership where the husband and wife both are in business. of which there are many cases. a taxable income of $50.000 would in Nebraska require payment of $26.820 Federal income taxes. while in California the Federal income tax would be $20.300. or a saving of $6.520.",

During the depression years. the Womens Bureau gathered data on the trend of womens employment in certain States. following the application of mandatory wage orders. Figures on womens employment trends were also obtained in certain States after regulatory hour laws had been made effective.

As the penalty clause has been inserted in the bill. it follows the same structure which the representatives of labor and industry themselves followed when agreeing upon this proposition. In order to bring into operation existing uniform methods of enforcement and in order not to repeat at length paragraphs of existing law relating merely to procedure. they said in section 7 of the substitute that paragraphs (3). (4). (6). (7). and (8) of subsection (a) of section 2 of the act of June 28. 1940. as amended by title III of the Second War Powers Act of 1942. shall be applicable. I think that is a perfectly normal way to say. \"We have passed this act to meet the conditions as we see them. We therefore include by reference. as the procedure to be used in enforcing this act. the same procedure we have already enacted under the Second War Powers Act.\" However. they did not include paragraph (5). which provided for the misdemeanor penalty. All that the Committee on Military Affairs did was to put paragraph (5) in with paragraphs (3). (4). (6). (7). and (8). which already are in the bill. Therefore. the committee adopted precisely the existing procedure approved by Congress in connection with the Second War Powers Act. So the bill provides that the penalties will apply to anyone affected by the act. If this bill. in the judgment of the representatives of the public. labor. agriculture. and industry. will be most effective by placing obligations upon employers. and if such provisions are enacted into law. it is normal that whatever penalties go with such obligations should be applied to the law. and the penalties will then fall wherever they may.

I do not agree with my colleague from Minnesota. who has just demanded that Congress pass legislation authorizing the President to seize and nationalize railroads and coal mines. Such a policy would be either national socialism or communism. and I know that I speak for the vast majority of the American people. when I say that we want no traffic with either one of these isms or any other kind of ism which does not reflect true Americanism. Mr. Speaker. as a result of the railroad and coal strikes a national calamity has come to our country. Irrespective of the merits involved in these strikes. I insist that the administration and Congress must take immediate steps to secure a resumption of operations in these vital industries. The controversies involved between the operators and the men can and must be settled without the necessity of work stoppages. The President now possesses ample authority to bring about a satisfactory settlement. which action should have been taken by him yesterday before the railroad strike started. As matters stand today. these strikes are strikes against the American people. instead of against railroad companies and coalmine owners. I am convinced that just grievances on the part of workers in both industries can be peacefully settled without tying up the countrys economy. Unless operations are immediately resumed. there will be a complete collapse. and all of the people will suffer. In addition. we will also fail to meet our commitments to feed starving people in the rest of the world. who are depending upon our promises to supply food. I urge the President to use his high office to secure work resumption in both industries. and I insist that Congress must take constructive action to prevent a reoccurrence of such tragic events.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. In the present labormanagement crisis the administration is found wanting in two particulars. In the first place. for the last 13 years the RooseveltTruman administration has failed to assume an impartial and judicial attitude in reference to labor and management.. It has promoted strikes. class consciousness. and has often committed acts which have led to strikes. work stoppages. and the lack of production. In the second place. ths administration has fought all legislation that has been proposed to amend the Wagner National Labor Relations Act or to curb the acts of labor racketeers. Several bills have passed the House of Representatives. in spite of administration opposition. only to be killed in the Senate because of the administrations superior strength over in the other body. Early during my service in the Seventysixth Congress I voted for the resolution to investigate the National Labor Rela-. tions Board. That House committee rec ommended certain amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. I voted for those amendments. The administration caused those amendments to the Wagner Act to be pigeonholed in a committee in the other body. Had those amendments become the law it would have been a great step forward in the field of labormanagement relations and it would have averted much of the trouble that we have experienced in recent years. There were many other bills that passed the House which were not advanced by the Senate. The Case bill. which I also supported. should have been advanced in the Senate weeks ago. and it could have been used as a vehicle to avert the coal and rail strikes that are now paralyzing the country. Today American industry is paralyzed and production has ceased. Farmers and city people alike. including our veterans. are without the food. clothing. and shelter that they need. Fights. bordering on near riots. are taking place in our stores. The seeds that have brought forth our present situation were sown by the Government itself during the last 13 years. The group that has brought about our current strikes. and the group that has placed and kept the present administration in power. seem to be synonymous.

The present strike wave is again causing the people of this Nation to reach the boiling point. The people are demanding that labor legislation be enacted now.

There are a half dozen Government agencies dealing with veterans housing problems. It is understood the Government policy is to see that priority is given to construction of moderately priced homes for veterans. and then to others who are in dire need of them. Mr. Speaker. there are hundreds of highpriced homes being built in the larger cities in this country. including Washington. I visited a project where 125 homes are now under construction. The lowest price on any one of these houses is $25.400. They run from that figure to beyond $30.000. Those in charge of the project advise they are being supplied with all necessary building materials together with plumbing and other fixtures to complete these homes. The only requirement involved is that they first offer these homes to veterans during a period of 30 days. After that. anyone may buy who has the money. Not many veterans will buy these highpriced houses. This one project alone will total more than four and a half million dollars. The material and equipment in these homes would go a long way in building many moderatepriced homes. In my district lumber and supply dealers are able to secure only a limited supply of material and equipment to build a few moderately priced homes. If the material used in expensive homes could be used for moderately priced homes. it would help a great deal in solving the housing problem for servicemen and others. If a veteran wants to build a home in my part of the country he is required to go through reams of red tape in order to secure permission to do it. Then he meets with the further difficult.. of lack of materials. I cannot understand how. or why. priorities to big contractors to build expensive homes.

They will not be able to operate because they are dependent for their business inthousands of instances upon the success of these other enterprises which are entitled to this relief under the law. We are not giving them anything. They are entitled to this money under the law. They really loaned it to the Government and they are entitled to have it.

This activity is going to reach into every corner of the country. because he draws his supplies from all over the country. That will be true of the other automobile concerns. if and when they reconvert. There is no use carrying on a strangulation process here as far as these particular businesses are concerned. I offered an amendment in committee. which was voted down. to extend this exemption to $30.000 and to make it applicable in 1945. I offered an amendment to increase individual exemptions to help out the individual. single and married. I introduced a bill long ago to reduce the excessprofits taxes to 60 percent at the close of the European war. also to relieve the individual of 20 percent of his taxes following the Japanese war. This is nothing new. We Republicans have been offering these incentives to private enterprise and trying to get them enacted into law for many. many months. This bill is perfectly sound.

Under title III of the Social Security Act we provided for a system of unemployment compensation and if the gentleman will look back into the RECORD he will find that the Comptroller General of the United Stats held that the relationship between unemployment compensation and the administration of the Employment Service was so integrate that fom that time on practically all the funds to provide for the administration of the unemployment compensation and the Employment Service were derived from title III funds which were earmarked funds for the administration of unemployment compensation: So this talk about the original enactment of the WagnerPeyser Act. which provided authority originally for $4.000.000 of matching funds. has been out of the picture ever since 1936. It has never operated in thatway. and if the gentleman will look further he will see that under the provisions of the First Reorganization Act the President brought these two agencies together as Congress intended and put the administration of the WagnerPeyser Act. which was then in the Labor Department. in the Federal Security Agency. and brought the Social Security Agency in under one tent. so to speak. under the direction of the Director of the Social Security Agency.

I am especially interested in what is known as the Dirksen amendment which in my Judgment is the keystone in the arch. For more than 20 ybars I was associated with one of the greatest industries in this country. representing the employees as industrial relations counsel. During that long period I had to deal at first hand with the problems of employment and unemployment and of cooperation between management and men.

One of those arsenals situated at Watertown near Boston I have known for 50 years. Another one is at Springfield. Mass. - Our Picatinny Arsenal Is situated in a beautiful Morris County valley with high mountains on either side. It covers a territory of 91/2 square miles. twice the territory of the town of Dover. There is an investment in buildings and equipment of $40.000.000. During this war at the peak Picatinny employed around 18.000 people. For 65 continuous years since 1880 it has been outstanding as a center of scientific and experimental arsenal work in this country of ours. I would like to ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee If the .proposed allotment to the Ordnance Department is sufficient.

I am glad to assure the gentleman from New Jersey that it will be continued. and on a larger scale than that on which it was operated prior to the war.

Mr. Chairman. may I state that at the time the Constitution was adopted in this country we all looked upon the Nation. even though it was a nation. as a union of equal sovereign States. each with a different sphere of influence. Then there is another thing we want to remember. We had a lot of little Americans who could not conceive of this country extending from coast to coast. A good many of them were opposed to the Louisiana Purchase and every progress that we made as a real nation. May I call attention to another aspect of this matter. The Democratic Party of that day was proFrench and the Federalist Party was proEnglish. Each of them looked upon America as a small country. that was liable to be dominated by outside influences. That was one of the reasons for the adoption of the twothirds rule. Mr. Chairman. America has become industrially. spiritually. educationally. and in the knowhow the greatest country in the world. We dominate things and there is no reason why we should not have faith in ourselves. We only require a majority vote to declare war and at the same time we say that onethird of the Senate plus one. a small minority may say: \"You cannot make the peace.\" If the. word and the will of America is to have influence. it ought to be backed up by the people of these United States. It should not be stymied by any group less than a majority. I believe in having faith in ou.r country and giving it a chance to function in world affairs. but if a small minority can hamstring the will of this country and the will of the Congress I fear that we are going to have trouble ironing out international affairs. maybe not at the San Francisco Conference nor the peace conference. but in time to come by small men who might be able to join with a minority and set aside the will of the American people. Mr. Chairman. I want unity and faith In America. I believe we are entitled to it.",

Theyknew that changes would be necessary and provided four ways to amend the original document. The Constitution has been amended several times. and furthermore it has developed by statutes. judicial decisions. customs. and usages. In my opinion if the framers of the Constitution were alive today they would be the first to make this much needed and long overdue change in the treatyratifying mechanism of the Constitution. The amendment under discussion would provide for the validation of treaties by a twothirds vote of both the House and the Senate. I can think of no act that would be more disastrous to our welfare than adopting this proposal. .ihe war in Europe is won. This is VEday. and the eyes of the world are upon this House as we debate the question of revising our constitutional machinery for making peace. The world wishes to know what we intend to do in the future. Let us see what the adoption of this amendment under discussion at the present time would do. By the adoption of this amendment. making it necessary for twothirds of both Houses of Congress to ratify treaties. we would notify the entire world that we do not intend to make treaties after all hostilities have ceased. we do not intend to participate in the formulation of the peace.",

I believe in the stormy days that lie ahead. in the midst of the difficult and complex problems with which we shall have to deal. the ratification of treaties is going to be hard in any event. I believe that requiring twothirds of the Senate for such ratification is making too difficult that action which must be taken by the people who will be farsighted and have in mind the position of the United States in this complex world. and they will have too heavy a load to carry.

Mr. Chairman. not only that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana. for whom I have the highest respect. will be defeated on the ground that if it were adopted we would be taking a long backward step.. but I hope also that the resolution presented to the House by the Committee on the Judiciary will pass this House by such a substantial vote as to become an Inspiration to American public opinion so that It then may pass also through the Congress as a whole.",

Meantime. of course. everyone knows that a treaty of peace is not like a law enacted by the Congress. A treaty of peace Is something that should not be considered as lightly as a law. To repeal a treaty of peace might mean an act of war. To repeal any other treaty by act of Congress or by any other means might become a casus belli. Therefore. a treaty is not quite as light a thing as a law. Any time that the Congress chooses to do so. in conjunction with the President. it can repeal any law that has been theretofore passed. but you cannot repeal a treaty that lightly. You must consider the consequences. because there is another party to the treaty than the United States. That other party is one or more foreign countries. The effect upon them must be considered in the repeal of a treaty. The repeal of a law is nothing serious whatsoever. We can pass a law today and repeal it tomorrow and no harm. but perhaps good. may come from it. On the other hand. when you ratify a treaty. be careful what you do when you repeal it. That is a serious matter. and it should likewise be a serious matter to ratify it in the first place. A treaty is a more binding thing than a law as it is in the nature of a contract with a foreign power.",

I wish also. as one of the members of the com-. mittee. to express my appreciation for the great contribution that has been made by the ranking minority member. the gentleman from Michigan . In my judgment we could not have brought to the Congress a bill of this kind except for both influences. and it is a very happy circumstance that enables us to speak without partisanship in undertaking to protect the interests of our common country. It leads me to say that we ought also to have something more than this personal provision for eliminating partisanship in legislation of this type. We are concerned. Mr. Chairman. with something that affects the national security. Bretton Woods is one of those measures that are designed to protect the peace of the world. It is my opinion. thereforeand I ask the indulgence of the House to express it. although it is not directly related to the issues involvedit is my opinion that we ought to make official provision for the consideration of such measures as this on a bipartisan basis.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. from the first it seemed to me that a deliberate attempt was being made to draw attention .away so that the committee would never get a real understanding of the tremendous financial powers surrendered to foreign governments international bureaucrats by this Bretton Woods bill and monetary agreement. In 1919 and 1920 we lent $3.000.000.000 to foreign governments for stabilization purposes. but with no real strings attached. much as this does. These borrowers did not stabilize their currencies. They only used the money to create a price boom in the United States which ended in the sharp depression of 1921 when the American people got disgusted and stopped lending. In that depression soldier boys sold apples. Remember? Again in 1927 our Federal Reserve banks. at the request of foreign governments. adopted the loosemoney policy in order to help great Britain. It did not help Britain. It set the match to an inflationary stockmarket boom in the United States so that when. a few months later. the Federal Reserve tightened up. it was too late. It was only a matter of time until the 1929 crash. According to the book by Mr. Moley. who was President Roosevelts representative at the Conference. the Presidents adviser on the boat when he sent the wire torpedoing the Conference which agreed to the gold standdrd was Secretary Morgenthau. who has led the fight for the Bretton Woods monetary agreement. Now he gives this monetary superstate clippings from the gold dollars concerning which he said: [Extract from the hearings before the Ways and Means Committee.

So. the testing of material for the District of Columbia is done at the Bureau of Standards. The officials of the District that appeared before your subcommittee insisted that since 1934 it has cost the District of Columbia more than $100.000 in excess of what the cost would have been had the District used its own laboratory. They claim it is costing them four times as much to test material at the Bureau of Standards as it would cost if they were allowed to test it in their own laboratory. Your subcommittee. feeling that this would be one place to save money for the District taxpayers. decided to eliminate the proviso and allow the District to test its own material and accomplish this saving.

We have been more than fearful in our deliberations that dollar diplomacy. that power politics. would control the policy of this bank. and it was only after hours of good hard honest work that we were given assurances that this bank would be used primarily if not exclusively to malfe good sound economic commercial loans and should not be used to pit one nation against another or to put one nation in an advantageous position to the prejudice of another. We wrote certain language into this bill to safeguard this capital against its use for the very purposes for which the gentleman from Illinois would open the gates wide to pressure on the countries of the world to adopt our philosophy of Government. We cannot do that with $3.500.000.000. If we are going out to buy democracy in the world. it is going to cost more than $3.500.000.000. If I were the manager of a bank and fn the business of making loans to build up my community. to keep my factories going and my rmen employed. I would not care whether those men were Catholics. Jews. or Gentiles. whether they were colored or white. I would feel that they had the same right to their religion and their creed as I did. In the cold business of lending money to keep factories open and men employed you do not ask a man his religion or his political philosophy. I surely cannot contribute to any amendment to this bill which is going to compel the ExportImport Bank to predicate a loan upon whether a country has adopted a particular philosophy of government which appeals to me but which may not appeal to him.

As a matter of fact. the one hope of our cotton friends is bilateral trade. In other words. if 25 cents a pound is to be the price for Americanproduced cotton. we shall not be able to compete with the rest of the world in the sale of cotton. and gradually the rest of the world will build up a sufficient cotton production at lower prices to take care of their entire cotton needs.

    "speech": "Mr. President. in conclusion for the reasons that I have set forth. I believe the amount of this loan is unreasonable and its terms unwise. I do favor special treatment for the British people. I believe \ufffd that $1.250.000.000 would finance all of the goeds which the British can buy in this country during the next 3 years over and above what they pay for exports to this country. We thus contribute to their raw materials and to the machinery necesary to set their economic machine it order. I recognize that by reason of their vast outlay in the war. they should not be asked to repay this contribution. It is merely an appendix to the lendlease policy. No resentment can arise out of it in the future. We are doing everything that this Nation can do in the way of production supply to help the immediate British situation. Insofar as an improvement of the general world exchange situation is concerned. we have offered $6.000.000.000 to Bretton Woods fund and the Bretton Woods bank. and we should permit its machinery to operate. Therefore. Mr. President. I desire to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. as follows. to strike out all after the enacting clause and to insert the following: The President of the United States is authorized to pay to the United Kingdom not to exceed the sum of $1.250.000.400 upon the agreement of the United Kingdom that said sum will be used for purchases of goods and services in the United States during the years 1946. 1947. and 1948. Provided that the character of such purchases shall be subject to restriction under the provisions of the Export Control Act. and the President in his discretion may extend the time in which such purchases may be made. Mr. President. I realize that this is a substitute. and an amendment which may be subsequently offered will take precedence over it. but I now offer the substitute.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think the Senator from Missouri has not quite correctly Interpreted the effect of the amendment. As the language came over from the House. it would give the employees transferred absolutely no protection whatever in their jobs. no matter what they did in a civilservice examination. even though they might pass at the head of the list. Once they had been given a reasonable opportunity to acquire eligibility. the State would be perfectly free to fire. dismiss. or to retain them. as It wished. There was considerable pressure on the committee to require the States to agree to blanket all these Federal employees into the State service on the basis of merely a qualifying examination. The Senator from Missouri has interpreted this language as meaning that. However. it does not. In the merit system parlance there is a difference between qualifying and becoming eligible for appointment. What this language means Is that If the individual now holding a job in the State system. after It is transferred. takes a competitive civilservice examination in competition with all the others who are trying for that joband in most cases there will be from 10 to 100 positions in the same classification. and probably several hundred competing for themand passes the competitive examination with a sufficiently high grade. considering veterans preference. which applies to most of these positions. so that under the State merit system he is among the top three or four who are certified for appointment. the State must agree to appoint him. If the individual now in the position passes a competitive examination with a high enough grade so that he is among the top three certified. the State must agree to keep him In that position or a comparable position. This provision would not give him the right merely to pass a qualifying and noncompetitive examination and be blanketed into State employment. It seems to me that that is a reasonable protection in the interest of continuity of service to give those who have joined the service since it was transferred to the Federal Government.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I think the Senator from Minnesota has correctly interpreted the language. That is the very ground on which I object to the committee amendment. As I see it. the language of the committee amendment means that if John Smith were employed in the Federal work. and the activity were transferred to the State. if he took an examination along with 300 others. and passed the examination among the first three who would be qualified for appointment under the State act. it would be obligatory upon the State to appoint him. regardless of the comparative grades of the other two who would be eligible for appointment. It seems to me that that is an undue preference. In my opinion. the language in the House provision gives sufficient preference to Federal employees. The House language makes it possible for the Federal employee to take an examination in the grade which he has attained in Federal employment. whereas. as I understand. under the State merit system. otherwise an individual would have to take an examination at the foot of the ladder. for the lowest grade of employment open under the State merit system. So the system provided by the House language would give to the Federal employee a very considerable advantage. because it would entitle him to take the examination in the grade at which he was employed in the Federal service. The objection I have is the very fact which the Senator from Minnesota has :pointed out. namely. that after he takes the examination and is found to be among the first three. the other two of whom may have a very much higher grade than he has. may have had greater experience than he has had. and may for excellent reasons be preferable. the State would be obliged to blanket him into State employment. For that reason I do not believe that the committee amendment should be sustained.",

But it is provided that they shall be given an appointment if they pass an examination high enough to be among the top three certified for appointment. We are doing much less for the employees than the Federal Government did fo the State employees when it took over the services. because the Government. by Executive order blanketed all the State employees of the State services into the Federal civil service. at their then grades. without any examinationnot even a qualifying examination. It seems to me that the 14.000 persons involved are entitled to at least the consideration given them by the committee amendment. The House language gives them absolutely no protection. It simply provides that they shall have an opportunity to become eligible. Once they have had the opportunity. the State has no further obligation under the House language.

Under the House language of the bill those individuals might be separated from the service after having been given a reasonable opportunity to acquire eligibility. All the language of the committee amendment would afford to those personsand there are some 14.000 of themis the right to take a competitive examination under the State civilservice system in their respective States. If they pass highest on the list. very well. There would be no obligation. whatever. of the State to retain them once they had been given an opportunity to tak2 the examination and did not pass with high grades. They are not to be blanketed in under a qualifying examination. but after they take a competitive examination. if they pass the examination high enough so that they are among the top three or four to be certified for appointment. the State then is under the obligation to appoint them and retain them in the positions which they hava held. or in comparable position. That situation will obtain only so long as their services are. satisfactory. Even though they have once been appointed. they still may be separated from their employment under the State system. What the committee amendment does is only to give them a right to continue in their original employment if they pass a competitive examination with a sufficiently high grade.

When these reports were ijot accepted by the General Accountiifg Office. the Maritime Commission then converted costtype contracts into fixedprice contracts. It is apparent that the reason for the change in the form of these contracts was to avoid furnishing evidence establishing that the amounts which were represented to be the costs of the contractor were the actual costs and were proper for reimbursement by the Government. In plain words. the Maritime Commission in converting costtype contracts to fixedprice contracts clearly intended to conceal the actual cost of constructing these vessels from the General Accounting Office and to prevent that agency from performing its duties as required by law.",

You can see by that statement you are $241.540.435.090.86 in the red. and you are going in the red by leaps and bounds. You have been doing that for 12 years. Where are you going to get the money? If the time ever comes when you keep this country from going into a financial wreck. it is only going to be because of the foresight and wisdom of the Members of Congress from now on. I feel the President of the United States is going to take that course. and he is going to do what he can. But he cannot do it unless you. the Congress. aid and assist him. Now we have before us for consideration the Office of War Information. You have $35.000.000 in this bill. Yesterday the majority of the Members of the House voted to increase their salaries $2.500-$2.500. That will Tequire about $1.500.000. If you cut this one item out here you will save $35.000.000. or you will save 20 times more than you increased your salaries on yesterday. How the people back home would rejoice in that! Think what a name you can make for yourselves right here. Here is the opportunity. if you ever had it. to show that you did not want to bankrupt this Nation by voting yourselves this salary. Here you can save your constituents more taxes. We are now trying to cut out somethinr\" that can easily be eliminated and we can save $35.000.000. thus saving 20 times more than you spent yesterday by voting that $2.500 increase. Is that not good business? I say it is. I say that is a fine way to demonstrate to the people of this Nation that we mean business and we are going to do business. We are not going to interfere with anybody in the OWL They can easily get a job today. This country .needs more men 10 times over than we can eliminate from OWL Let us take those fellows and give them other jobs. some place else where it will accomplish some good and thus save $35.000.000.

These vouchers have been held up all this time. I have no authority to approve a voucher of this kind. If I do approve it.

Never in my life have I known of the question being raised before. The resolution which was adopted by the committee was substantially as follows: Resolved. That from February 1. 1945. to the end of the Seventyninth Congress each standing committee of the Senate. or any subcommittee thereof. Is hereby authorized to send for persons. books. or papers. to administer oaths. to employ a stenographer at a cost of not exceeding 25 cents per hundred wordsto report such hearings as may be held on any subject referred to said committee.

Must we come back to the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate every time we want to do something? I have held any number of hearings during my 22 years of experience in the Senate. When a resolution came to the committee asking for an investigation I have a clear recollection of asking for a preliminary hearing on the resolution in order to determine whether or -not it should be recommended by the committee. . Frequently. by holding a preliminary examination with reference to the matter the committee is in better position to determine whether they want to report favorably the resolution. or whether it is necessary to incur an expense of $20.000 or $25.000.

Usually the chairman of the particular committee involved reports to the Senate that the $5.000 which the Senate had made available to the committee has been exhausted and that further funds are needed. and no amount will be appropriated for the general use of the committee without a designation of the use of the funds in connection with some particular investigation.",

If the committee to which the resolution had been referred expended more than what was left of the original appropriation of $5.000. or wanted more money *than was available. then it was necessary to go to the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate. I remember very distinctly that at one time the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate took jurisdiction over matters which. in my judgment. were Clearly outside of that committees authority. I remember distinctly when my late colleague. Senator Walsh. of Montana. took up the question of the power of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate. A question was raised as to whether that committee had the right to question what a general committee was going to do after it had rec6mmended certain legislation. The only thing that the committee could consider was the question of the amount of money which the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate could pass upon. In other words. the committee could say whether the amount of money to be appropriated was to be $25.000. $10.000. or $5.000.

    "speech": "The Senator from Vermont and I lived with this problem in the conference committee for several weeks. There are many difficulties about it which do not appear on its face. For instance. consider the question of farm machinery. It might be that the Government could let one big dealer buy all the- surplus farm machinery ana dis. tribute it. The Government might obtain a better price by doing so. But in the act we wrote the policy that there should be an attempt to have the farm machinery placed in the hands of individual farmers. The only reason I call attention to that situation is that those of us who lived with this problem in committee for 4 solid weeks in the committee on conference trying to have the bill written. realize that many difficulties are involved. We recall the selling of surplus property after the last war. There was quite a story about the sale of raincoats at that time. A dealer came to Washington and bought all the surplus raincoats. He paid the Government what seemed to be a fairly good price for them. Certainly there was no other dealer who was willing to bid on the entire supply of raincoats. That dealer then sold the raincoats in small lots or sold them separately to individuals. and he made an enormous profit. So that question enters into the situation. If we want the surplus property to be distributed to the farmers and to other groups which we are trying to take care of. we cannot always say that any citizen may buy the surplus property. There are many different limitations of such a nature.",

So what the Senator has said with reference to that subject would not have any effect on the situation. I have received a complaint from a constituent of mine. I did not intend to bring the matter up now because I had expected to take it up with the Board. A constituent of mine wanted to buy some surplus materials. He said that he had put in a bid which was larger than the bid submitted by another person. but he was denied the right to have his bid considered because the particular property in which he was Interested was being sold for a large lump sum. It seems to me the present rule is perfectly unfair and that considerable complaint will result if it is continued in effect. I can understand that in some particular lines it may be to the advantage of the Government to sell in larger lots than in smaller lots. But clearly the Board is wrong when it says to John Smith. for example. \"You can bid on something In Chicago because that city Is in your district. but you cannot bid on similar merchandise in Seattle.\" It seems to me that it is not right to say that an American citizen cannot bid on Government property wherever it may be. A man in my State might wish to bid on some bolts. or articles of that kind. The bolts might not be for sale in his district and yet. he could not bid on them In any other district.",

I have hesitated to say anything while Senators were debating the pending business today. but I take this opportunity to commend those who represented the State of Maryland and to commend the farmers of Maryland for having secured an increase of 2 cents a pound in the price of their tobacco. Mr. President. the reason given by the Economic Stabilization Director for the increase was that the costs of labor and farm machinery and other items make it necessary. At this very moment the farmers of the Carolinas are setting out their tobaczo. plowing their fields. and attending their crops. from sun up to sun down. with but little labor. and with machinery that is quite expensive. Laborers working in the war factories nearby along the Atlantic Seaboard are paid 2. 3. 4. and sometimes 5 times as much as the farmers could afford to pay them. Mr. President. I desire to bring this matter to the attention of the Senate because in July and August our farmers will be called upon to sell their tobacco. and I hope that the same treatment will be accorded the tobacco of our farmers in their tobacco market as is given in what are known as the border markets. within 50 miles of the North CarolinaSouth Carolina line. where most of the tobacco.of the world is produced.

The area thus affected lies in the heart of one of the most highly industrialized sections of the country. The Lehigh River is approximately 100 miles long. with railroads extending for some distance along both banks. The floods experienced in the past have not only done tremendous damage to the industries located along the river but have interfered with the operation of the railroads. In May 1942 a flood caused damage estimated at nearly $15.000.000. This flood seriously affected the operation of the main plant of the Bethlehem Steel Co.. at Bethlehem. Pa. The estimated average annual benefits for the project is $589.100. which. of course. does not include the secondary benefits derived through the effect of this project on the Delaware River.

Over 75 years ago the farmers then living in this area organized and built at their own expense levees to protect them from Mississippi floods. They were protecting some of the most fertile land in Illinois as well as their homes. After these levees were built and. as time went on. improved. again at their own expense. these landowners produced bountiful crops and prospered. The area consists of approximately 110.000 acres and is probably the largest drainage district above Memphis on the Mississippi River. With the construction of the navigation dam at Cap aus Gris in the late 1930s. the situation of this area began to change. This being a gravity district and containing no pumps to dispose of the water. the Mississippi when at flood stage would flow contrary to gravity and inundate their land. At the time of the dam construction these Illinois citizens were promised by the Federal Government. and it was distinctly understood. that the water effect upon the district would be studied over a 5year period and that the inhabitants should have drainage facilities comparable with those prevailing before the dams were built. For the past 3 years. while other rich farm lands produced abundantly. this area has been flooded and property damaged. The United States Engineers have in the past year met with these citizens and outlined their plan. thereby living up to their promise. The citizens affected have approved by an overwhelming majority and agreed to the local contribution as outlined by the engineers. Governor Green. of Illinois. approved as required by law almost immediately due .to a previous study. The boaid of review engineers has approved.

It is true that I have three pretty goodsized villages that will have to be moved. In regard to the housing situation. let us be fair about that. The engineers stated it was not necessary to move most of these until 1949. They would not have to be destroyed. In fact. the majority of them. practically all of them. will be moved without even disturbing the contents of the homes. This dam will add materially to the protection of Zanesville. Malta.

If you people ever lived along a dam and saw your entire business district flooded so that you could get in a boat and row across the top of the trolley wire. then you would realize how much we are interested in flood prevention.

I wish to have the Senate understand that the Committee on Military Affairs and this subcommittee do not conceive their duty to be of an inquisitorial character. There Is no purpose on the part of this committee to hale officers of the executive branch of the Government before it for the purpose of creating a Roman holiday.

The whole concept of the study is a constructive one and not an investigatorial one. We are looking toward the prevention of evils and mistakes rather than to the investigation of mistakes which have already been made. So. Mr. President. the committee should not be regarded as one which will only investigate. It is a committee which will study the proper policy which the Government should follow. I believe that although the duties are onerous. and I should personally very much welcome being shornof responsibility in connection with them. nevertheless. I conceive of no duty which the Congress owes to the people of the United States to be greater than that of making sure that the policy which controls the disposal of surplus war property shall be wise and fully understood by the people of the United States.",

It was extremely hard for a school to get an airplane engine which had become obsolete. so far as its use in an airplane was concerned. in order that the school might use it for study in its automotive engineering course and courses of that kind.

In the first place. if a pilot can get accurate weather information and a good recent forecast before he takes off from a given airport as to what the weather may be ahead of him and over the route he is to traverse and covering the time limit which he expects to remain in the air. he is then fairly safe because he can choose the route which he will fly and determine an alternate place to land. Generally speaking. the maximum time aloft will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 or 6 hours. The fastest transport we have at the present time is. of course. the Constellation. That makes a 5hour flight from New York to Kansas City and a second 5hour flight from Kansas City to the west coast. Naturally that pilot must know what weather to expect at Kansas City before he takes off from New York or from any point of stopping before he reaches his destination. He must likewise be able to know in advance what the weather is liable to be over the intervening distance. whether or not a thunderstorm condition is going to prevail in a general area. and how far off the course he must go in order to avoid a thunderstorm area. In a few minutes the committee will discuss a special bill on the subject of thunderstorms and I want to bring that subject out at that time because it is one of the most vitally important subjects that has to do with aviation meteorology. But in all events the basic data which are used for the forecast are assembled hourly over the airways and regular forecasts are made every few hours with special forecasts intervening as needed. Each one of the various points in the United States at which weather data Is assembled is connected by teletype or telegraph with every forecasting center. All that information immediately comes in to the central forecast point in the shape of a perforated tape which is run through a printer. and the information printed in symbols. so that the meteorologist can translate those into marks on the maps and prepare what is known as a synoptic chart.",

Yet the consumption of coal in the war industry and the shortage of other types of fuel. such as oil. gas. and wood. in a winter of great severity created an unprecedented demand. Coal operators with whom I have conferred tell me that the best answer to the current coal shortage in 17 Eastern States is a 48hour workweek in the bituminous coal fields. According to the report received today from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. of the Department of Labor. the average number of hours worked in the bituminous coal fields in 1944 was 43.38. and the average of workdays lost by reason of absenteeism was 11.96. It will be observed that absenteeism among coal miners was considerably above the national average. In World War No. 1 the first action taken by the Congress to assure full production was to suspend for the duration of the war the 8hour day. In the spring of 1942. when the SmithVinson bill was pending before the Naval Affairs Committee and we were trying to win the war on the home front on the basis of a 40hour workweek. I pleaded for an hour with the committee to write into the bill a provision suspending the 40hour law for the duration of the war. It was a depression spreadthework device wholly Incompatible with an allout war effort. We would not have before us today a compulsory work bill if we had adopted a 48hour workweek .when we entered this war.

Other activities which should be made a part of the permanent program. of this Government. we hope to place in permanent Government agencies and thereby be in a position. as rapidly as commensurate with the best interests from the point of view of all to liquidate the agency. Mr. Rockefeller went on to point out that the end pf the work of the Basic Economy Department and of the educational program was in sight. that the economic development program and the transportation work should be capable of being carried on by private enterprises. that the interAmerican training group and other programs comprised. in his judgment. the peacetime activities of private interests. and that the culturalrelations program to the tune. I believe. of $1.500.000 had already been turned over to the State Department. This. he said. left largely the information program through the radio. moving pictures. and press. which. he felt very definitely. was a wartime program. In other words. he left the impression that the agency was on the road to substantial curtailment and liquidation. The war in Europe is now over. and yet we find this agency requesting an appropriation of $15.800.000 as compared with an estimated expenditure of $17.500.000 in the current fiscal year.

The requested appropriation is $485.000.000 as compared with $550.000.000 for the current fiscal year. Gross cost. however. shows an increase from $2.610.000.000 to $3.096.000.000 based on a contemplated increase in the fleet of about 22 percent. The committee has reduced the Budget estimate by $40.000.000. This entire agency. created by Executive order. in my opinion. calls for a general reappraisal. It operates in the same field with the Maritime Commission. Some confusion and duplication of effort necessarily results. It operates under one Administrator as compared with the Maritime Commission under five Commissioners. Severe criticism has been made in respect to its financial operations. Since January 1. 1943. I understand. there have been more than 211 pages of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD devoted to criticism of the WSA and the Maritime Commission. in addition to countless pages of comnmittee hearings. Attention is called to the enormous revolving fund under the control of this agency. During 1945. it is estimated that $1.459.000.000 will have been expended from that fund. On the basis of this appropriation. there will be available for 1946 the sum of $1.548.000.000. Here again. Mr. Chairman. the broad question arises as to whether this revolving fund should not be terminated with a view to tighter control over agency operations under direct appropriations. and whether WSA should not be liquidated in the near future by the transfer of its functions and funds to the fiveman United States Maritime Commission. as originally provided by Congress. All of us know of the criticism of WSA in respect to charter hire. insurance. and purchase prices allowed and paid by the agency. The Comptroller General has been highly critical of its activities in these and other matters.

The opinion was almost unanimous in that committee that if the veterans desired it there should be available to them the art or science of osteopathy and they went still further and included chiropractors. After tle First World War there were thousands of veterans trained as osteopaths and chiropractors. Advocates of the resolution also stated that after the recent war there will be still more thousands trained in that science. and if that science has any value at all then the veterans should be entitled to use it. If it has no value as a science. then the Veterans Administration should not be spending the taxpayers money to educate the returning veterans in those two professions. I have no axe to grind for or against either profession. I have friends with whom I have fished. hunted. and had social activities who were doctors of osteopathy and doctors of medicine.

But when we had an opportunity to crossexamine Dr. Fisher. who represented this organization before the committee. I was informed that the members of this profession were competent. according to his impression. to practice any type of medicine or any type of surgery. I recall he was asked this question: \"Speaking for the profession. is it intended that these doctors who may be employed would also practice surgery in the hospitals?\" \"Yes. I think that he would do the surgery if he is qualified to do so just as a capable medical surgeon would. He is certified to be a specialist in surgery and he is accredited by our national association.\" I recall having asked him: \"What contribution has your profession made to the advance of the science of surgery and medicine?\" And this doctor. who is the head of the organization. said: \"I do not know.\" So I am a little concerned and feel that these doctors will be placed on the same plane ani given the same prestige as doctors of medicine. I have nothing against this profession. I have utilized their services of manipulation for rheumatic conditions personally. and they do very fine work.

In the Military Affairs Committee we had a bill to give commissions to optometrists. The evidence was that there were thousands of optometrists in the Army. in the enlisted rank. who in civil life had been examining eyes and giving advice on eyes for a long. long time. yet the Medical Department of the Army fought that bill very. very strongly. They would not concede those men had one bit of ability or that they were entitled to any recognition In the way of a commission. I will say that our colleague the gentleman from Pennsylvania . came out in a fine way in support of the bill. The result was that we finally got a law through the House of Representatives to do justice to 60 optometrists by giving them commissions. We thus recognized the great mass of men who knew optometry. who were in the Army. and had not had a chance to use their particular skill to help our soldiers.",

My interest in this amendment grows out of several years experience as a member of the board of directors of a general hospital. I am sorry to have to disagree with my good friend the gentleman from West Virginia. These doctors are loyal. They are loyal to the fight that has been going on for years and years of the doctors trying to maintain a monopoly on doctoring people. In the past this may have been a just fight because there may have been many things that were not of high standard. But let me call to your attention the fact that an osteopath at the present time in many States has to take the same training that a medical doctor does and. further. take 2 or 3 years of special training in osteopathy. They are highly qualified to take care of a great variety of cases. They use a great many electrical gadgets. and so forth. that medical doctors cannot safely use unless they. too. take some osteopathy. Doctors specialize nowadays. and it is getting to be more and more a question of specialization. Osteopathy is one of the specialties that doctoring and medicine need in the hospitals for many types of cases. The doctors organization. the American Medical Association. judging from the past. certainly would be opposed to this. and the doctors who belong to the organization. I believe. are obliged to fight on that side. I do not think. however. that they should take advantage of their position as Members of Congress to carry on this fight for monopoly.

The great State of Pennsylvania is concerned in this matter. Since the other amendment was rejected. I want to read to you the expressions of the Medical Society of the State of Pennsylvania. through its chairman of the Committee on Public Health Legislation. when he said: We are informed that there has been Inserted over the objections of the representatives of the Veterans Administration a provision whereby osteopaths are recognized on the same level as doctors of medicine and are eligible to treat our veterans. 1. In Pennsylvania. according to several State supreme court decisions. osteopaths are not permitted to practice medicine and are not physicians legally qualified to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. 2. The board of medical education and licensure has no jurisdiction over the courses in their colleges. therefore. the board of medical education and licensure has no way of determining the educational qualifications of osteopaths in Pennsylvania. 3. Pennsylvanias osteopathic law does not require an Internship of at least 1 year in an approved hospital after their preprofessional and professional course before making application for licensure. therefore. osteopathic physicians lack at least 1 year of training which regular doctors of medicine are regularly required to have. 4. If osteopaths desire to do the same work as doctors of medicine. they should conform to the legal educational requirements of doctors of medicine. 5. Osteopaths were not qualified to have commissions in our military forces. Therefore. by inserting osteopathy into this bill. in our opinion. the Federal Congress will be responsible for lowering the quality of professional services to our veterans. That is signed by Dr. Palmer. head of the committee on publichealth legislation in the State of Pennsylvania. Now. Mr. Chairman. this House had no way of knowing what the position of General Hawley and General Bradley was on this bill. No hearings have been published.",

In all our countrys long history we have always allowed the practice of medicine and the healing arts to be under the control of the States.

However. as honest men. we can have honest differences of opinion. and we certainly have an honest difference of opinion as to the effects of the socalled Pepper amendment. I do not think the dire predictions the Senator from Vermont makes will flow from that amendment.

If the Senator from Vermont will accept June 30 as the expiration date for price controls. so far as I am concerned. as one of the sponsors of the Pepper substitute.

I certainly do not think it logically follows that because a date definite and certain is fixed in the Pepper measure. the consequence of fixing such a date and notifying the American people that as of that date the price controls will end that the results suggested by the Senatpr from Vermont would automatically follow. Mr. President. I do not have such a lack of confidence in the operation of American business as to believe that American business would use such methods to heap cruelty upon the American people as suggested by the Senator from Vermont. I have only one more point to make as I close. I think we already have evidence available to the Senate and to the country in regard to what is going to happen in the remaining portion of the reconversion period if we do not keep on some effective price controls. There is still a complete outofbalance between the totality of supply of consumer goods in this country and the purchasing power oi the American people. So long as that .economic fact exists. the danger of inflation will be knocking at our door. As I said earlier this evening. and I repeat it now. I think when the socalled Barkley measure is passed. we shall find that in operation it will be an invitation for runaway inflation in this country. But if in 6 months that does not come to pass. I shall be perfectly willing to eat those words and to thank God that I have an opportunity to do so. But if what I suggest is true. then let me say the responsibility for that inflation cannot be passed to any other group except the Congress of the United States.

Mr. President. if the amendment were adopted. whether the joint resolution would ever go to conference. If it did not go to conference it would end all price control and all chance for price control. In my judgment. if we are unable to get some sort of price control under the joint resolution which we are now considering. there is no chance to get it at all. We may as well consider that if we cannot get it under the pending measure. price control is over with and out the window. I am not satisfied with the pending joint resolution. I do not have to say that. I have been fighting to the extent of my ability against some of the amendments to it. I do not know what will happen to them if the joint resolution goes to conference.

They tell a not too nice story of who were responsible for that crime. The American people have not been fooled by testimony that was presented to the Pearl Harbor Committee. and I am sure that General Marshall and Admiral Stark knew where they were on December 6. although they swore before the committee they did not know. The President knew the orderly knew where to find Admiral Stark. However. this particular bill has merit. We pension our Federal and other judges when they reach retirement age. and it does seem to me that such a bill gives men like General MacArthur.

We are providing for the retirement of officers in the armed forces. This is nothing new. The Congress has been doing this for a long period. The bill will provide for an increase in the amount that the retired officer can be paid. Under this policy. which I say has existed for a long time. the officers are entitled to be retired and they receive a very liberal retirement allowance. every dollar of which comes out of the United States Treasury. Of course. whatever is in the United States Treasury comes out of the pockets of the taxpayers. The officer is not required to make any contribution whatsoever to any retirement fund. Under the Retirement Act providing for the retirement of Federal civilian employees those employees make a monthly contribution based upon their salary. In other words they create an annuity and when they have had a certain length of service and reach a certain age they are subject to retirement and receive the annuity for the rest of their lives. The reason I am making this statement is that in a few days we are expected to consider a bill which will provide an amendment to the Retirement Act for civilian employees that will grant recognition to Members of Congress. provided the Members of Congress make a contribution equal to that paid by all Federal employees. Now if we can provide laws such as this certainly we should not hesitate to enable ourselves to create an annuity for ourselves. provided. as I say. that we make a monthly contribution based upon our salary.

I am proposing in this amendment that when a man volunteers or is ordered to go to another place of employment he shall also be given allowances for his family and his household effects. not to exceed $300 for any one such trip. I think we recognize that if the law Is goingto function there will be men with families who will be required to move from one place to another. It seems to me that the least we can do in those situations is to permit the family to be moved along with the worker. In other democratic countries that have legislation of this nature this is a usual provision in such laws. Most of th2m. in fact. go a good deal further. I am not. at this time. proposing anything beyond permitting families to be kept intact. and that wives and children and their necessary household effects can be moved along with the worker. I think the adoption of this amendment would bring more volunteers under the act than you would get otherwise. I think it would be a matter of simple justice to any worker who is required to move by order.",

Incidentally. if this matter of the 5 oclock hour irks any of you. why. you can give us some assistance in returning Gods time to the Nation. Mr. Chairman. I was greatly interested in the remarks of the chairman a few moments ago. and on another occasion today when he made some statements about the powerful bureaucracies in this country and the fear of one dictator here in Washington. That is one of the reasons why this amendment is proposed. A similar one was offered to the Surplus War Supplies bill. a bill which we were told we should vote for because Mr. Will Clayton was to administer it. But Mr. Clayton is not administering it. We are told Mr. Byrnes will administer this bill. Maybe he will and maybe he will not. The practice provided for t this amendment is not difficult to carry out. It merely says that when any one of these agencies. whether it is the War Manpower Commission or whether it is the Selective Service or whether it is the Director of War Mobilization. when they propose to issue a rule. order. or edict they must send d copy of it to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. Then it would be referred to the Committee on Military Affairs and that committee. or a subcommittee. which knows every word and paragraph of and semicolon in this bill. and which knows the intent and purpose of it. can scan that rule. order. or edict and see for themselves whether the regulation is made in conformity with the spirit. letter. intent. and purpose of this act. and that no unusual or unexpected use of power is proposed. If such a provision had been inserted in many of the laws which we have passed heretofore we would not now be in a position of condemning many of the bureaucratic agencies for some of their questionable rulds because Congress would have kept control over its legislative child. would have seen that it obeyed the will. the intent.. and the purpose of Congress.",

Thus the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act would be amended to give to these people inducted for labor the same exemptions. the same protection against eviction for nonpayment of rent. the same relief from payment on installment contracts. the same relief from taxes and numerous other benefits that Congress has set up for the soldier or sailor away from home. unable to make his payments. unable to answer summons. and unable to make out tax returns.

The argument has been made that by this section we are giving certain benefits to these people. The inference to be drawn from that is that the benefits under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are positive benefits. or that they are benefits that are guaranteed. that we are giving them something. that they are absolute. As a matter of fact. that Is not true. What the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act does is this: It provides that when a man goes into the serviceand under this section we say the man who goes into work under the provisions of this billwhose *ability to discharge his obligation is adversely affected by the change. then he is protected. Then he is entitled to the benefits under that act. There is one other thing that I want to call attention to and that is this. that they are not absolute. They are given within the discretion of the court. The judge must be convinced that the mans ability to discharge those obligations has been adversely affected by his change in status. Unless he is so convinced there is no obligation on him whatsoever to extend the benefits of the Soldiers and Sailors Qivil Relief Act tp that person. Someone has safd we ought not give it to these men who are going to work under the terms of this bill. whereas it is not given to those who are voluntarily at work already. I simply want to call attention to this fact that even though that may sound good. you must remember that the person who is at work voluntarily has had plenty of time to adjust his personal affairs. Therefore. perhaps the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act would not be worth anything to him anyhow. because his ability to handle his obligations has not been adversely affected. whereas we are going to snatch up the men covered by this bill hurriedly and give them a change of status that may affect adversely their ability to discharge their obligations.",

The bill covers river and harbor improvements. floodcontrol items. items for the Panama Canal. items for the maintenance of soldiers homes. and items for the maintenance of soldiers cemeteries. The Corps of Engineers of the United States Army. being a branch of the War Department. requested that the Bureau of the Budget recommend and approve total appropriations for these purposes of $335.923.240. That was divided between floodcontrol projects and river and harbor projects. as follows: For flood control. $215.054.400. for rivers and harbors. $120.868.840. In response to those requests. the Bureau of the Budget approved a total sum of only $177.165.000. That sum is broken down as follows: For floodcontrol purposes. approved by the Bureau of the Budget. $124.350.000: for river and harbor projects. $52.815.000. Of the total amount approved by the Bureau of the Budget. the other body of the Congress in considering the request reduced the amount considerably. The other House approved a total sum for the two functions of only $126.161.750. which is broken down as follows: For flood control. $96.150.000. for rivers and harbors. $30.011.750. The bill came to the Senate in that shape. The Senate has a leeway in regard to the bill. over and above what the House of Representatives approved. and yet still within the total estimates of the Bureau of the Budget. as follows: For flood control. a total of $28.200.000. for rivers and harbors. a total of $22.803.250. making a total sum which it is within the purview of the Senate to approveand still be within the recommendations of the Bureau of the Budgetof $51.003.250. The Senate committee held extensive hearings on the various items. Due to the fact that. in the main. the war stopped the construction of river and harbor projects and floodcontrol projects for a long period of time. we find a great accumulation of both river and harbor projects and floodcontrol projects awaiting consideration and appropriation and construction.

If we had not had them. I simply do not know how we could possibly have equipped our troops with sufficient officers. There is nothing about the Army. so far as I know. or the Armys programs or plans which at the present time involves any change of the ROTC system. It is an admirable one. A young man who gets ROTC education is paio some compensation at the same time. and after he is commissioned a second lieutenantafter taking the required ROTC courses right along with his academic courseshe may continue his military studies by attending a camp for a certain length of time. and after he has thus further qualified himself. he is commissioned a first lieutenant in the Army. He is not bound by law to engage in extended military service unless he offers himself for it. If he makes that offer and if the Government has a place for him in the military system. he undoubtedly will have an opportunity. especially since we have provided for furnishing the necessary number of officers during the interim.",

In other words. the principle involved is that the UNO. being an organization madeup of a number of foreign governments. as well as our own. if established in this country should enjoy the same status as an embassy of the British Government. for example. or that of some other government. The Senate Finance Committee has rewritten the bill in many respects for the purpose of safeguarding against the possibility of abuse of privilege. The amendment which is now before the Senate proposes that the privileges shall be extended only to international organizations in which the United States participates pursuant to a treaty. or under authority of an act of Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation for such participation. The President is authorized to cancel the privilege if he finds it necessary to do so. or he may cancel any individual privilege. exemption. or immunity in the event it appears that any of the organizations. in their functioning. go beyond the purpose of the act.

However. the bill has been amended. It would be better If limited to soil conservation. This House should remember that this bill gives surplus property to all political subdivisions. of which the veteran is a part. This bill helps the veterans. There are very few veterans going out to buy bulldozers. draglines. and heavy machinery to move dirt with. There are irrigation districts in my State which would like to have this dirtmoving machinery to improve their districts. I hope that the proper committee brings out a surplus property bill that is favorable to the veterans and whereby they will be placed on the same priority as Federal agencies. I would support such a bill. But I would remind you that the veteran is also a part of the political subdivision. and this bill is designed to help him just as much as political subdivisions. The veteran should have number one priority just as Federal agencies and not a number four priority as under the present Surplus Property Act.",

I am sure everyone who knows about the important work of the Soil Conservation Service will agree with me that they are doing a splendid job. not only for the farmers but for America today and tomorrow. I am sure that almost everyone will agree that the conservation of our precious soil is most essential now when starvation is facing the people of many nations. because it makes for greater production of food and fiber for those who live in this world today and will insure food and fiber for the generations yet unborn. When the surplus property disposal bill was under consideration on August 21. 1944. I introduced an amendment which provided that 25 percent of all surplus dirtmoving equipment be allocated to the Soil Conservation Service districts and other public agencies and for flood control. My amendment was defeated by the narrow margin of six votes. If my amendment had prevailed a lot of this equipment now rusting away would be in good use today. Our entire country. yes the whole world. would benefit from the use of this surplus equipment by the Soil Conservation Service. Few veterans want this kind of heavy equipment except the veterans who are farmers. and bear in mind about 50 percent of our veterans are directly interested in soil conservation. and the other 50 percent will derive indirect benefits from it. I sincerely hope that if this bill is not adopted today that the Agriculture Committee can draw a bill that will be acceptable to the Congress so that this equipment can be put to use before planting time next year.",

Not only have we been permitting our war materiel overseas to be purchased for the wellknown song by foreign governments. not only have servicemen complained bitterly about the actual dumping of supplies into the Pacific Ocean.. we are now confronted with the evidence that war veterans at home are being given the most depressing runaround possible in their efforts to take advantage of the provisions of our laws designed to help them get started in business. In the course of a brief investigation it has already been revealed that Ohio veterans have been sent to Point Pleasant. W. Va.. to Camp Atterbury. Ind.. to Sandusky. Ravenna. and Warren. Ohio. to Newcastle. Ind.. to inspect and pick up property which they- had purchased. only to find that the goods were not there or that their condition had been grossly misrepresented. Surely our Government can be held to the standards of ordinary business veracity at the very least. No one seeking to engage in private industry would be permitted to misrepresent the quality of his merchandise indiscriminately without being called sharply to account by public authorities. Our Government should be subjected to a fullscale investigation on this whole completely unjustifiable. incredibly callous treatment of returning servicemen.

We believe that this property. having been paid for by American taxpayers is the property of the people of the United States. We believe that it should be used for public purposes. Now we have a clear choice here. This bill will make this surplus property available for use by public agencies. not private. There is not a dollar of private profit in it. We have seen the operation of the present bill. and there is no man or woman in America who does not know that the present bill has be6n favoring a group of speculators.

However. we did defer individuals and in a measure groups. particularly did we select the farm group for deferment. Now that we are in actual practice deferring farmers because of their need on the farms to keep the war effort in high pitch. the time has arrived when it is just as necessary for the draft boards to use the same discretion in deferring coal miners. This should be put in practice at once. In my county. Fayette County. we are 3.000 coal miners short today. I understand the new selectiveservice regulations will take 70 percent of all the coal miners in Pennsylvania between the ages of 18 and 29. This means another 12percent reduction in manpower in the industry. Practically 30 percent of the coal miners have been drafted into the servicea higher percent. we have been told. of any other one trade. We need no law to correct this. The draft boards back home can correct it if they choose. If they think they cannot correct it under the present laws or rulings. General Hershey has the power to issue them authority to defer these coal miners. We must not take any more of them away from the mines. We cannot make steel without coal and coke. We cannot make tanks without coal. We cannot make planes without coal. We cannot make guns without coal and we cannot make munitions. We have been getting tens of thousands of Mexicans. Jamaicans. and Cubans each year to help the farmers. This year we will have 70.000 German and Italian prisoners working on farms. We have nobodyno groupsno helpin the mining industry.

There should be no particular industry picked out from which to draft a certain percentage of menespecially the coal industryfor these men will be irreplaceable. It is entirely different from other industries in that coal mining requires skill. it is arduous. dangerous employment. It takes several years to become an experienced. skilled miner. Some States have a statute which requires apprenticeship for new employees. In Pennsylvania they must serve a 2year apprenticeship before they are awarded a certificate as qualified miners. To take 70 percent of the men under 29 years of age would mean a reduction of the coal production in the State of Pennsylvania of 12.750.000 tons in 1 year. Up until October 1944 the number of miners taken from the mines of the Nation was 130.000. In spite of this. the tonnage was kept within the range of consumption. Any further reduction would be hazardous to all industry. I am well aware that we cannot win the war without troops. but neither can you place the implements of war in the hands of the troops without coal. \" I have many telegrams pointing out the danger of such a procedure from the loss of production.

Some time ago the Official Reporters of Debktes ceased to take down the demonstrations that are made in the course of debate. the only parliamentary body in the world that prints a RECORD in which that has been done. that I have been able to find.

You get the RECORD of the United States Senate and. as a rule. they do not have probably so many there to applaud. but when there is applause or a demonstration. it is placed in the RECORD. Our demonstrations have been cut out of ourRECORD and I think it is a serious mistake because now a man can make a speech and extend his remarks and you have no indication as to where his speech left off and where his extension of remarks begins. I know it has been contended by a few Members in the House that the extension of those demonstrations in the RECORD have been abused. But that was done very seldom. and where the Member did abuse that privilege by inserting laughter or applause he. has been subjected to the most drastic criticism and ridicule and. as a rule. has never attempted it again. I submit that from this time on I. for one. am going to insist that whatever demonstrations are made on the floor of the House during debate be reported by the Official Reporters of Debates as it was for more than 140 years.

Now. I do not know about many of these items. but I do know about one in this list. I have been trying for years to get it done with fear in my heart lest we should not get the protection in time. This construction is not merely to furnish employment. nor is it expenditure of public funds porkbarrel fashion to gain votes. Many of these items listed in this conference report must be like the one for Arizonanecessary for protection and public safety. I am now referring to the eighth item down. on page 4 of the report. that is for flood protection on the Little Colorado River at Holbrook. Ariz. That is a dangerous stream at any place in its course but particularly dangerous at the city of Holbrook in northern Arizona. On two different occasions in recent years floods have done great damage there and caused loss of life. I called attention of the House to that situation a year ago and earlier. We regarded it a postwar project then only because materials and labor could not be had during the war. The danger was great during the war and is great today. If a flood should occur on the Little Colorado River at the 3ame time a flood occurs on a tributary entering the Little Colorado just above Holbrook-. the combined floods would be more destructive than any of the others and might entirely destroy that countyseat town. There are other floodcontrol Items in Arizona which have been examined by the Army engineers and reported on. which I hope soon to find in such a report as this. but I will not take time to discuss them here. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" and a \"Stitch in time may save nine\" in regard to the protection offered by this projected engineering work on the Little Colorado River and many other such streams. Let us not delay but carry this work forward at once. Its value cannot adequately be measured in money.",

Isabella Reservoir. for which the Senate proposed $1.000.000. We leave in the $1.000.000 for the construction work on Kings River and Tulare Lake. In the first proviso. where the Senate proposed that the Secretary of War should not proceed with the construction -until he had received certain reports from the Bureau of Reclamation. and then should make a determination as to what the allocation should be. the conference amendment inserts these words: with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior. We felt that there is a natural interest of the Secretary of the Interior in the allocations and charges for water to be used for irrigation that should be recognized in this instance even though the reservoir dam be built by the Army engineers as a floodcontrol project. There was one further change. In the Senate language it was proposed that the reports on these studies should be made not later than 9 months from the date of the enactment of the bill. We did not want to delay the construction but we did feel that some time should be provided for achieving the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War. so we made the last proviso read: That the reports from these continuing studies shall be made not later than 6 months from the date of the enactment of this act and that the agreement of concurrence shall be made not later than 9 months from the date of the enactment of this act.

It would be unwise to have the Federal agency deal directly -with local political subdivisions. The pattern used in building iational highways has worked out successfully with the National.

It is a coincidence that at the conference which was held this morning we decided to request the President of the United States to appoint a factfinding body. because a strike which spreads over seven States and paralyzes business in hundreds of communities is certainly of sufficient public interest and importance to warrant the taking of such action. We were fully aware that under the present law the President has no authority to appoint factfinding bodies except in the case of disputes occurring under the Railway Labor Act. So it is a timely thing that the President has sent to the Congress the message which was read a moment ago. and I certainly hope the Congress will move promptly to enact legislation along the line of that mentioned by the President.

That makes the situation critical even for towns which have railroad connections. Of course. there are many towns without railroad connections. The railroads have had to place embargoes on freight. Many communities are not receiving any inshipments or making any outshipments of any kind. and there is a complete tieup of transportation. Therefore. I urgently request that this trucking strike be handled by the President. just as he has stated he would handle the strike in the case of General Motors and in the case of other industries. as reported in his message which we have received this morning.

I did not know that the Presidents message which was read Just a few moments ago was coming to the Senate today. and I imagine other Senators were not aware of it. I feel that the suggestion of the appointment of a factfinding committee is a very hopeful sign. I should like to bring an additional thought to the attention of all Senators from the Middle West. namely. that in some of the States. for example. Nebraska. during the war the rails and ties on many branchline railroads have been taken up. and many communities have come to depend completely upon truck transportation. It has now been nearly 10 days since at least one of the parties to the truck strike has refused to enter into a contract under the collective bargaining theory or even to negotiate one. This morning there was held the meeting to which reference has been made. The unions did not even send a representative there to discuss whether they would negotiate. So I think the Presidents suggestion is a wholesome one and is in line with the suggestion made at the meeting of the midwestern Senators. In this connection. I feel it should be stated that today more than 200 towns are not being served by rail transportation but are entirely dependent upon truck transportation for the hauling of the food they need. Regardless of whether a factfinding committee is appointed. it seems to me the Government should step in and see that the freight is hauled. irrespective of whether the parties to the truck strike get together. because it is becoming impossible for communities which depend primarily upon truck transportation to obtain food and other necessities of life. I hope remedial legislation will be enacted. but in the meantime something must be done to get food to the communities in the Midwestern States which depend primarily upon trucks for the transportation of their food.",

I take it that the President has very properly recognized the fact that there exists not merely the interest of the parties themslves but also the predominant interest of the public. Particularly. Mr. President. is this true in the matter of common carriers. It is true of common carriers of trade and merchandise. It is true of common carriers of individuals. The public. in my opinion. has the right to require that the work of common carriers shall not be interfered with by those who will refuse to negotiate the questions at issue. So. Mr. President. without taking more time. I desire to emphasize what has been said as to the importance and urgency of the situation existing in the Midwestern States and to express the very earnest hope that negotiations may be very readily entered upon with respect to a solution of the pending problem.",

The Senator is quite right in pointing out that in this country our Constitution looks forward with the view that the process of ratification is confined to action by the Senate of the United States. Mr. President. it is suggested in the report of the Committee on Foreign Relations that under the view that the procedure by joint resolution or act of Congress is preferable: The precise details of the obligationsuch as the exact amount of the forces to be contributed and the places where they are to be stationedis not a matter for treaty consideration but for legislative sanction by the Congress under its constitutional powers to raise and support armies. to provide and maintain a navy and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces. The references made in the report of the committee are to article I. section 8. paragraphs 12. 13. and 14 of the Constitution. Those provisions read substantially as set forth in the report of the committee. namely. that the Congress \"shall have power to raise and support armies. to provide and maintain a Navy.\" and \"to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.\" But. Mr. President. can it be successfully contended for a moment that the power to raise and support armies. to provide and maintain a Navy. and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces authorizes the two Houses of Congress to enter into a treaty or to ratify or confirm a treaty simply because the subject matter of the treaty embraces one or more of those subjects?

As a matter of fact. an application for a loan from the United States has already been made by Russia. If Generalissimo Stalin Is fairly well informed about Russian affairs. as I have had a general idea that he was. he has not as yet received a very favorable response. if any at all. to his application. The first application which was made was for $6.000.000.000. According to Generalissimo Stalins advice to me. no response was .eceived to that request. The other application was for $1.000.000.000. which is the one that was lost in a pigeonhole. as Senators will recall. The Senator has suggested at least a criterion which I believe to be desirable and practicable. He has stated that the same standards should be applied to all borrowers. It would please me immensely if the Senate would lay down a standard which could be applied to all nations in their requests for loans. I am in favor of the British loan because. I believe. it would be a good transaction for Great Britain and for this country as well. But I also believe that a Russian loan would be good for this country and the remainder of the world. I believe further that a French loan. as well as some other loans. would be practical and helpful. However. I would lay down three criteria. First. could the loan. in the opinion of good businessmen. be repaid? I am willing to accept Mr. Will Clayton as a good businessman. because he has proved to be such by making approximately $20.000.000 in private enterprise. Secondly. would the loan be used for peaceful purposes? Thirdly. would the loan be used to the benefit of the United States of America? If the Senator can devise any criteria which would apply alike to all countries. I believe he would be dolLg a great service. because I am very much afraid that when Russia eventually succeeds In having her application heard. someone will say that in order to get the loan she should be willing to change her form of government. or do other things which.

The amount of money requested by the Bureau of Reclamation at this time for the purpose of making studies on this project is entirely unnecessary and is greatly in excess of any possible requirement that would be needed for them to make the studies they are authorized to do on this project. There is no need for any funds for Bureau studies on this project until such time as the Corps of Engineers completes its plans and awards a contract for the construction. This is a postwar project and the interest of the Reclamation Bureau is solely to assist in the determination of the amount of the cost of the dam which should be charged to the farmers owning the water rights for the storage of flood waters that they will incidentally benefit from.",

R. 3024 concerning appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation. with especial attention to the section beginning on page 813 and extending to page 914. relating to the Bureau of Reclamation request for funds to develop plans for a transmission line from Shasta Dam and a steam power plant in the Delta Region. I was quite impressed with the statement and testimony of Mr. Black. president of the Pacific Gas & Electric Co.. until I read the statements and testimony of representatives of the Bureau of Reclamation. I should like to review briefly some of the controversial issues as they appear to me: Mr. Black stated: First. that the companys system is the natural outlet for the Central Valley Projects power unless wasteful duplicating lines and other facilities were constructedpage 865. Second. the company is now taking all of the output of the Governments power plant at a rate satisfactory to the Secretary. pages 867 and 869. and third. the Federal Government would receive more money through disposal of its power through the companypage 870. As to the first point. Mr. Black later stated that the company will add additional facilities for serving the area and. has been spending from $20.000.000 to $30.000.000 annually on new constructionpage 884. Mr. Kenneth Markwell. Assistant Reclamation Commissioner. on page 894. stated that the companys present system is not adequate to deliver power to the sites of the new pumping plants. It is clear from this that new facilities must be built to handle Shasta power. which leads to the conclusion that the transmission line proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation is not a wasteful duplication. As to the second point. Mr. Markwell stated on page 895. that the power company was unable to use some 42.000.000 kilowatt hours of potential power. in a 3month period. It was revealed that the present contract is only a temporary measure and .would not be satisfactory over a long 15eriod. page 895.",

I think the National Guard and the Reserve officers and men should be given just as much consideration in retirement programs as the Regulars. These civilian soldiers pay the real price of war. During times of peace they devote their spare time. their nights. and their vacation periods to training and preparation and study. and when war comes they carry the burden of the fight in the field while the Regular is probably in some safe command post or at a desk in Washington.

    "speech": "Mr.. Chairman. this amendment goes to the heart of the bill. To my mind. it is a devastating amendment and will scuttle the TrumanWyatt housing program. If you will take the bill as reported by the committee. at the end of page 2 you will notice \"December 31. 1947.\" was stricken out. and the words and figures \"June 30. 1947.\" inserted instead. That means that this will end on June 30. next year. We know it is going to take some time to get this bill passedif it is passedprobably 60 days. That means that the law will be effective only about 1 year. On some things 1 year would probably be enough. but on house building it is not enough. It takes time to build houses. If you put a termination date in here. June 30. 1947. it means that all these contractors will get priorities on their materials. they can be building on their houses. and they can see the end of the law coming in a few weeks from the time the houses will be finished. What is the natural thing for them to do? The natural thing for them to do is to slow up and wait until the law has expired so they can sell the house for which they have had priorities to build at any price on earth they are able to get. They will be able to get two or three times what the houses are worth. So a vote for this amendment. to my mind. is a vote to scuttle the proposal by President Truman at the request of Mr. Wilson Wyatt. They cannot do this job In 1 year or 18 months time. The program is predicated upon 2 years. It is scheduled. it is planned. all plans are formulated for a 2year period. to build 2.700.000 houses. If you adopt this amendment you will scuttle the TrumanWyatt proposalto build houses for veterans of World War II.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. I am afraid the statement of the gentleman from Texas is a little confusing. He said this was a committee amendment. It is true that this amendment was in the Original Patman bill. but by an amendment offered by me we defeated it and we struck out the provision that this bill should expire on December 31. 1947. My amendment limited the bill to the 30th of June 1947. The reason for this limitation is that OPA has been extended only for 1 year. The present bill before my committee today proposes to extend OPA until June 30. 1947. What is in this housing bill? It contains controls similar to certain controls in the OPA bill. A new Congress will be here on January 1. and can take a look at the housing situation early next year. . Let me say that the committee voted for my amendment and I am still supporting the bill as reported by the committee. I want to say to my friend that two other amendments will be offered as committee amendments. but in reality they are not committee amendments. They were stricken out by our committee. One deals with subsidies and the other with ceilings on old houses. Mr. Chairman. if you do not standby the Patman bill as reported by our committee and vote down the amendments now offered by some members of the committee who voted for the bill as reported. then you are likely to have your bill defeated. I ask you: Why should we extend the operation of this housing bill longer than we extend the operation of OPA? It is part and parcel of the same. thing. and you are only transferring some of the authority relative to ceilings to the Housing Authority from OPA. I feel therefore that both should expire at the same time. and neither should be extended for more than 12 months.",

I dont know anything about the merits of any controversy that is pending that is causing strikes. justified or unjustified. I dont know anything about them. But I think the time has come when the public realizes that the public has an interest in these things and there should be some kind of arbitration. We have always been taught - that where there is a wrong there is a remedy. Lawyers especially have always been taught *that. And there should be a remedy. When a case of dispute between the employers and employees. and the public is involvedand they are Involved in practically all these casesthere should be some person or some court. or some board or some authority that has the right to determine the merits of the controversy and pass upon it. and that judgment should be respected and abided by the . same as the Supreme Court of the United States. I think the time has probably come when. if these strikes are not stopped rather soon. there will be such an overwhelming demand for something along that line that it will be established. I regret exceedingly that the time has come. or will come. that that will be necessary. but you see there can be monopoly on either side and there must be a remedy provided.

In this bill you want -a staff set up to make a report to the President each year. The President would then send a message to Congress. It would be your platform. only a recitation of a platform holding out more promises to the people. You tell him to study all the conditions. then bring in a report as to what he thinks we ought to do. In my opinion. it is time that the Congress itself should say what we ought to do. It is said that this report will then be sent to a joint committee and that committee will study it. Then it will come back here and we will refer the recommendations. as usual. to various committees and it would take a long time before action could be taken. I am glad you did not ask that the President report in 1946. This bill takes effect in Mr. Chairman. we will have a debt of some $300.000.000.000 or more. and a contingent debt of about as much more.

I will continue reading: Each of these charges was based upon an applicable criminal statute of the State of Arkansas. The maximum finding for conviction of charge No. 1 is $500. each of the other charges carrying a maximum fine of $1.0o0. -The corporation made no defense in the justice court where the maximum fine was assessed in each case. An appeal was then taken to the Circuit Court of Polk County and. after a great deal of procedural maneuvering the case was tried before a jury of Polk County citizens in January 1940. The college was represented by Attorney C. A. Stanfield of Hot Springs. Ark.. a very able lawyer who defended Communist Joe Stecher in the numerous attempts of the Government to deport him. More than 2 days time was consumed in the trial of this case. At the conclusion of the testimony the defendant. of course. moved for a directed verdict on each count. Judge Minor W. Mlllwee. who is now an associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court. presided at the trial. The motion in each instance was overruled and the case went to the jury. Without hurry but after due deliberation the college was convicted on each count and again the maximum fine was imposed. No appeal was taken from these convictions. although several dilatory -motions were appealed in the Supreme Court. Upon executions of the Polk County Circuit Court all their properties were sold and the life of the institution was ended.",

Twentyfive years ago I was chairman of the public utilities of Kansas and at that time and during that service I discussed rather extensively with the private public utility companies plans for energizing public lines for farm purposes. It was rather difficult. Public utilities privately owned are private institutions. and of course extending lines into farming communities where customers are not very numerous was a task involving more or less of a hazard from the private standpoint. although. Mr. President. it is fair to say that today with 2.500.000 farms supplied with electricity. 1.500.000 of them obtain it from private public utility companies. whereas the. consumers of the Rural Electrification Administration lines number about 1.100.000. So. after all. the public utility companies have done a very good job in some States. The Rural Electrification Administration does not operate at all in Rhode Island or Connecticut or Massachusetts. Electrification of farms in California. New York. and other States is very largely done by the public utility .companies. and yet the Rural Electrification Administration is so important in carrying on the business of providing electricity for the farms that it is entitled",

Mr. Speaker. the cooperative working relationship which has existed between the various members of this committee when engaged in the work specifically assigned to the committee has been of a nonpartisan and inspiring nature. Small business Is not the exclusive charge of either the Republican or Democratic Party. It is the charge of the entire Congress. whichever party may be in power. The work of the committee has served as an inspiration to me personally. and I am hopeful that the Congress will see fit to continue the existence of the committee in view of its splendid work.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. this is a resolution to renew the activities of the Special House Committee on Postwar Economic Policy and Planning. This is a committee composed of 18 Members of the House set up in January of last year. It functioned during the last year of the Congress. It has for its purpose the cushioning of the economic blow which would ordinarily follow a war of some long duration. such as the one in which we are now engaged. The committee. in the judgment of those who have expressed themselves. has done a very good job. In that period of time which the committee has been functioning we filed 5 reports. We sponsored 3 major pieces of legislation. which are now on the statute books. We were pioneering in a new field. Some people thought we should have a halfmillion dollars because of the importahce of this committee. Others thought we should have $100.000. We finally agreed to ask for a hundred thousand dollars. That $100.000 was given to us an. we used approximately $29.000 and. of course. turned the balance back into the Treasury. While we have not been niggardly in the expenditure of the funds. we have tried to watch and to keep the cost down to the lowest possible level consistent with the effective operation of the committee. I do not know what funds we are going to need for the next year. My present thought is we will ask for $100.000 again. We will use such portion of it as we see fit. or as becomes necessary. and if we need any more we will ask for it. If we do not need the full amount. we will turn the balance back. We think this. committee should continue. Personally. as chairman of the committee. I should like to forego the responsibility of the arduous task ahead. but I believe that it is just as much the duty of this Congress to prepare for the economy at the end of this war as it is the duty of the Congress to prepare for the war we are now fighting. I do not want to make a long speech about this committee. Its work speaks for itself. It has received the commendation of the Congress and the country. If there are any questions. I will be glad to yield to any Member.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Committee on Postwar Military Policy set. up by the House last May pursuant to a resolution introduced by the gentleman from New York had for its purpose the consideration of policy to meet postwar military needs. The committee was in session during the summer and fall and held hearings on the proposal to establish a single department of national defense in the postwar. a subject that has been of great interest to the service forces as well as to the public. The volume of these hearings is available and the committee filed a report with the House on that subject which undoubtedly will be of great interest when we come to the point of legislating on the postwar Military Establishment and that. I imagine. will be when we know what our postwar military commitments are going to be. The committee has also held hearings on the question of research and development. the necessity for it. the manner. means. and method in the postwar period. There are additional hearings to be held on this subject and it is anticipated that perhaps very early in this session. if the committee is continued. hearings will be held on the question of universal military service in the postwar period. This committee has no authority to report legislation. It is merely a policyforming committee. It is a forum to which the people as well as the service departments may come and give their views upon interesting subjects respecting the Military Establishment. It is made up of the ranking members of the Committee on Military Affairs. the Committee on Naval Affairs. and some of the Members of the House at large. We were given orginally $25.000 and we returned to the Treasury $19.468. having spent $5.531.64. We have no lawyers. no economists. we take no trips. We have a few stenographers who are answering the voluminous mail that comes from every congressional district in the United States about these matters in which the citizens are interested. If this committee is continued we will ask the Committee on Accounts to give us again the same sum that It gave us originally. namely. $25.000. which I am sure will be more than enough to see us through the life of the committee.",

That is a matter which belongs to the Committee on Expenditures. Not once but on two occasions the Committee on Expenditures has held lengthy hearings on that subject. We have had the officers of the Army and Navy before us. It has also taken up the question of setting up of a department of aviation and finally held hearings on a department of national defense. including a Secretary for War. a Secretary for the Navy. and a Secretary for Aviation. I just mention that to show the gentleman that the select committees of the House take up questions where jurisdiction under the rules lies with a standing committee of the House.

I want to compliment the gentleman on the small amount of money that he has used. but I will say that in the case of the three resolutions that were passed in advance of this one the chairmen wanted $100.000 each. The life of the committees are 2 years. so that this involves an expenditure of $600.000 for the three committees. if they get it. and $50.000 for the gentlemans committee for 2 years makes a total of $650.000.",

I call to the attention of the House that in 1945 after long study. the Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted to the President the recommendation that no change be made in the status of the bases in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean. the bases covered by the proposed amendment. That factor in itself should constitute sufficient evidence to cause this House to defeat the amendment. American rights are amply safeguarded under the terms of the financial agreement. we obtain broad economic concessions which will be of immense value in the future. To drag in an issue such as this is unjustifiable. and I trust that the House will vote down the proposed amendment.",

If it means only the area we are using as bases. then it means that the only thing that is put up behind the $3.750.000.000 loan would be 100.000 acres of land. with less than $500.000 land value security.

A day or so ago I spoke in support of the resolution. This amendment is offered now with the hope that the resolution itself may be strengthened and not in any way jeopardized by the adoption of the amendment. The amendment proposed simply that those bases which we received in exchange for the 50 overage destroyers and upon which we have spent some $500.000.000 to develop and use for a period of 99 years. may be used permanently by us for military operations. It Is not intended to affect the loan. The agreement will go ahead just the same. The only proposition is that the first payment from this loan shall be used to take out that 99year qualification. Sovereignty over the bases is not yielded to us under the amendment. It provides simply that the United States shall have the right to use those bases forever. In paying for the 99year right to use the land within the base area we paid the equivalent of the full value of the land in fee. so we are not taking anything away from any British subject. not taking anything out of the British Treasury. it is not costing the British Government one red cent by adopting this amendment. but its adoption would remove a constant irritant to BritishAmerican relationships which I think should be removed at the earliest possible moment. and to my mind this is the practical way to do it.",

Certainly the Dirksen amendment or other amendments having to do with furnishing collateral would be indicated if the agreement were a loan in the usual sense of the word. On the other hand. I could not support It if it were just a gift with no substantial returns to this country. The present -state of the United States Treasury does not permit ordinary gifts to Britain or to any other of the many nations which fought with us against the Axis and which are in great need and which could then *legitimately come to us and ask for a similar gift. It cannot be justified on that ground. However. as I see it. it is neither a loan nor a gift. Rather. it is a hardheaded business transaction. in which we extend a designated line of credit to the British in exchange for considerations which we think will be of even greater value to us through the years and decades ahead. namely. the removal of certain trade practices and restrictions that have been and will be increasingly detrimental to our commerce throughout the world. When I go in to buy a pair of shoes I give the storekeeper $8. He gives me the pair of shoes. It is not a gift. I get value received. If it is a. cooperative venture and if after a while he can pay me some dividends out of the business. that Is all to the good. but my primary reason for making the transaction is because I think what I am getting will be of greater value to me than what I am giving up. I am in favor of this agreement because I think it is a good. sound business transaction for the United States. It is an investment in the nation which has always been our best customer to help it pull through this period of great difficulty",

I made up my mind 2 or 3 years ago that I might probably never see this country revived to the form of government it had before 1912 for the simple reason that it has become a ship of state without a rudder. The rudder we had was the principles of the Constitution as interpreted by Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural address and also in his address regarding the Constitution. Those principles have been violated and scuttled repeatedly and increasingly in the last .30 years. until now it seems that we go from one quandary to another. leaping always more deeply into trouble. because we have no touchstone of principle against which to test these different laws that come before us. With this unconstitutional bill today it seemed to me that the American principles of government did not have a fighting chance. It may be that I was prejudiced in favor of the principles of government. and that is not just Americanism. because as one who has studied the principles as hard as I have ever since I was a young girl. I am convinced that those principles are greater than any one of us. greater even than this Nation. and that we cannot hope to see the kind of civilization that started out in 1800 come to pass within our lifetime unless once more this Nation adopts those principles and holds them aloft to the world as the Statue of Liberty does in New York Harbor.",

Whether we would like to have them under the American flag or not. we would all agree that it is their right to determine the matter. and they would lose that freedom under this amendment. As to the proposed substitute offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. COLE Iand I appreciate his fairness and the temperate presentation of his proposalit should be borne in mind that he proposes to acquire permanently that which we already have under a 99year lease. and again. without leaving it to those who live adjacent to these bases. It would involve renegotiation. and it would jeopardize this agreement. It ought not to be adopted because it involves diplomatic relations. It is not related to the financial considerations that should be paramount in this instance. It should. therefore. be voted down in spite of the fact that it is offered by a friend of this resolution. and an ardent proponent of friendly relations with the other great democracy of the world.

This amendment involves the acquisition of territoryand we have said we fought the war for no territorial aggrandizement. The acquisition of the bases would involve achange of national sovereignty and a change of allegiance of the citizens of that territory. Then. probably. as we return these bases to Britain. the citizenship of these persons would revert to that of the country to which they originally owed loyalty. Certainly no selfrespecting nation would sell its citizens in order to obtain an advantage such as this. We have a lease on these bases for 99 years. In this atomic age. we do not knowwhat the future will bring forth. In 99 years from now those bases may be entirely useless for the purposes for which they were originally acquired. Mr. Chairman.

When it became necessary to cut back the Corsair contract. as it was cut back. Goodyear was in a critical labor area. where the tire plants were crying for more workers. It was also in a Governmentowned plant. So that Goodyear would not be hurt financially by the cutback. Brewster was a privately owned concern in a noncritical area. Unfortunately. Brewster was shut down. and Goodyear permitted to go ahead at the same time when labor could not be found for the tire plants. Another point which I think may be of interest is the conflict which possibly. I fear. civilservice rules may contribute to the troubles in the Norfolk Navy Yard. The Navy. I think with the proper idea. went into its navy yards. like that at Norfolk. and subcontracted from the congested area into smaller plants great quantities of work. but unfortunately the personnel of the navy yard was not cut commensurately at the time. They still held it. and I greatly fear it was due to the fact that civilservice ratings for supervisors are based upon number of employees on the job. In other words. a mans rating all too frequently was based on the number of men who worked under him. and naturally a supervisor did not want to have the personnel cut down. because that would mean he would have to take a cut in pay.",

Another witness. by affidavit. showed that 100.000 gallons of Diesel oil were pumped into a sludge oil tank to dispose of it. Another witness described how workmen tore down their benches and built them up again because they wanted to keep busy at work. although benches were in good condition and needed no repairs.

I may state that this legislation amends the tobacco law by giving the Secretary of Agriculture the right to decrease burley tobacco allotments for this year. and by increasing the penalty on tobacco grown on acreage in excess of allotments from 10 cents per pound ..to 40 percent of the selling price. The penalty increase would not apply to fluecured tobocco until 1947. The bill also requires the Secretary. to proclaim marketing quotas for burley and fluecured for 1947. which in turn would require the holding of a referendum for each kind of tobacco In order to determine if the growers favored marketing quotas. We have an overproduction of bdrley tobacco this year. which has hammered down the price on some floors $20 per 100 pounds. It is a tragic situation. Our burley growers are losing millions of dollars. A few days ago at a meeting between the burley tobacco growers. the officials of the Department of Agriculture and the OPA. and the House Members from the burley tobacco districts. these amendments were unanimously agreed upon. As a result of the meeting this legislation was introduced. The House Committee on Agriculture the day after the legislation was introduced made a favorable report. It is of the utmost importance that we pass the legislation immediately if the growers are to receive any relief as to the present burley tobacco crop. It is thought that if the tobacco companies are given some assurance that we will not have a surpis crop next year. the price as to the balance of this years burley crop will go back to around the production cost level at least. The only way we can be assured that there will not be an increase in burley production next year is by the * passage of this legislation which gives the Secretary of Agriculture the right to decrease burley tobacco allotments for. 1946 and raises the penalty on excess allotment tobacco. Unless we get the price up in some way we are going to lose further millions of dollars. We ha--e already lost millions of dollars by reason of the ruinous prices that are now being paid.

I would make this observation: That no matter where you go. whether in the Scandinavian countries. in western Europe. in the Balkans. or in the Middle East. you find great fear of the Soviet Union. I hope nothing I say will be interpreted as antiRussian or antianyone else. No matter where one goes in any of the countries over there. one finds a fairly active Communist Party and one finds communism functioning very well in many countries. I am not surprised at the controversy in connection with Iran. We were in Teheran. Members of the Chamber of Deputies came to us and said. \"Do you thoroughly appreciate. do you understand what the political situation in this country is?\" When you would ask. \"What is it?\" they would reply. \"The Russian question. We want to be left alone.\" I talked with several of them at some length. and I said. \"It appears to me from what you have stated that you would like the United States of America to tell the Soviet Union to move out of this country.\" They agreed that that was what they would like to have done.

We would see meat that ordinarily sells for 18 cents a pound selling for 30 cents a pound by the carload because it would not be illegal to do it. We would see all other kinds of commodities sell for perhaps two or three times their actual value. In other words. during the 2 or 3 days when OPA lapsed there would be a speculators and gamblers heaven in the United States. and hundreds of millions of dollars would be made during that time when it would not be illegal to charge prices with only the sky as the limit.

I quite agree with the Senator that production is the only effective answer to inflation. and I think the introductory paragraphs of this bill are excellent in that respect. It seems to me that if business and the OPA will cooperate in administering this law for the purpose of aiding production. we may. and probably will. enjoy great benefits from the act. even though it is subject to some criticism.

If he misses it by onetenth of a cent. what difference dcpes it make? If we wish proper enforcement of price control. we must have the cooperation of the industry.

At that time I made the assertion that no more than 20 percent of the units produced by the multiunit producersthat is. producers of various articles--were priced on the basis of cost. The Senators amendment requires the finding of the 1941 cost and the intervening increases in costs. To corroborate the position which I took at that time. I sent eight telegrams to wellknown accountants throughout the country. and I have received six replies. The question which I asked in each case was the following: In connection with debate on stabilization laws. would appreciate your opinion by collect wire on following question: How generally could manufacturing and processing Industries present to OPA. on ieasonably reliable basis for pricing purpoEes but without conducting special accounting studies: First. unit total costs (including all manufacturing. selling. and administrative costs) of each major product they produce. and. second. the increase since October 1941 in unit total costs (including al! such costs) of each such major product. I shall not transgress upon the Senators time to read all the replies. If he will permit me. should like to read one telegram. It comes from Mr. E. L. Kohler. president of the American Accounting Association. I think it would be well to read it into the RECORD at this point. because it bears upon the remarks made by the Senator from Wyoming as to the difficulties which may result from costpricing. The telegram reads as follows: CHICAGO. ILL.. June 12. 1946. Senator BRIEN MCMAHON. Senate Office Building: OPA. with staff and time limitations. has no way of passing judgment on unit costs which Industry might present. Individual previews are essential to each such presentation since the present temper of business enterprise in too many instances would result In unfairly loaded costs and hence inflationary prices. The spread of manufacturing overhead offers many alternatives. permitting. under current cost accounting principles. wide cost ranges while the spread of selling and administrative costs over different products is almost always impossible. both theoretically and practically. Only solution. In my opinion. lies in permitting OPA to pass on fairness of projected overall profits of individual companies under proposed pice schedules.",

Furthermore. the burden of .proof is on the industry advisory committee. It must assemble the figures to prove the need for the increase. If it does not do so. the industry can obtain only the increase which it substantiates to the satisfaction of the Price Administrator. So it seems to me that the objections are not sound. Mr. President. I have only to conclude. As a matter of policy we should continue price control in a modified form for another year. I would prefer to continue it for 9 months. but a continuation for a year does not make very much difference. Congress will be back here by then. and Congress can end it. I hope that under our general directive. -price control will be ended sooner than that. I hope it will be gradually ended. as we have directed. I think it would be a great mistake to bring it to an end now. Although I think provision for the decontrol of meat should have been included in the conference report. nevertheless. under all the circumstances and In view of the provision that the Secretary of Agriculture shall be permitted to exercise his discretion and in view of his wellknown views. I believe that he *ill decontrol beef. even though we have not been able to persuade the House of Representatives to vote to do so.",

That will force a tremendous increase in the price of fats at the present moment. I have always been doubtful about that. As a matter of policy. I tried to see whether we could separate the decontrol of beef from the decontrol of pork and the decontrol of dairy products. I think it .could be done. just as a technical matter. But I received no support upon that suggested compromise from either the conferees on the part of the Senate or the conferees on the part of the House or from other Members of the Senate. So I decided that all of it had to get together. and that we either had to decontrol beef and- pork and dairy products all at once. or not decontrol any of them. I was doubtful whether the decontrol of all of them would be wise. As to the decontrol of beef. I have no question about that. because beef has reached a point where it cannot be controlled.

We considered this matter in the bill providing funds for the civil functions of the War Department and inserted in that bill the word \"used\" so that on certain work of the Army engineers they wofuld be allowed to purchase onlyused automobiles. In that connection we noted that the War Department itself was offering surplus cars for sale in various parts of the country and we thought it would only be appropriate that where used cars would be satisfactory that the appropriation be restricted to the purchase of used cars. We made that applicable to only one branch of the Army engineers at the time the bill passed the house. But in the other body I notice by reading the report of the Senate committee on the bill that they expanded that idea and inserted the word \"used\" in three other places. It occurs to me that if we are going to recognize this newcar and usedcar situation and limit the War Department in its civil functions to the acquisition of used cars only. that it would be appropriate to do it here. It will be noted that here is an appropriation for the purchase of 150 cars. That is 1 percent of all the new cars in the country as of January 1.
