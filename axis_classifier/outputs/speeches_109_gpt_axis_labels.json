In a moment of defiance. Americas history forever changed. On one December day in 1955. Rosa Parks defied the social injustices that were plaguing the United States and made a statement by retusing to surrender her bus seat to a white man. This historic day in Montgomery. Alabama gave a spark to the civil rights movement. In a time and place of great danger. Rosa Parks was a leader among those brave individuals who sought to overcome racial discrimination and bigotry. Rosa Parks knew the dangers and potential consequences of her actions. but she also had a greater sense of what was right and what was just. Her passion for freedom and equality should serve as an inspiration for generations to come. just as it did during the uncertain times of the 1950s and 1960s. When she refused to give away her seat. Mrs. Parks was not looking for any sort of attention or fame. She was simply asserting her fundamental rights as a woman and an American that serve as the foundation of the United States. Today. and forever. we will honor the memory of Rosa Parks. History will remember her as one of the greatest Americans. Rosa Parks will forever walk among the heroes of justice and freedom.",

Mrs. Parks was arrested for her action. As a New Yorker. I hold dearly the legacy of Judge Constance Baker Motley. That is why I introduced legislation to honor her. Constance Baker Motley won nine out of 10 civil rights cases she argued before the Supreme Court. She worked on all of the major school segregation cases. including Brown v. Board of Education. and advised civil rights leaders including Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. Judge Motley was the first AfricanAmerican woman to serve in the New York State Senate. She was the first black woman to be appointed to a Federal judgeship. Rosa Parks once said. \"Memories of our lives. of our works. and our deeds will continue in others.\" She was absolutely right.

We want to make sure that this occurred in the line of duty. So that is the way we drafted the amendment.

Sudan in light of the amount of money that is already in the 2005 bill and the amount of money that is in the supplemental for this region. However. I understand the gentleman from Illinois feels very strongly about this. He and I traveled together to the Darfur region. We saw the terrible. terrible suffering that the people there are going through. We are in complete agreement on our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution in the area. but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live in that region. and therefore I am prepared today with concurrence of the chairman of the committee to accept this en bloc amendment. and we will take a very good look at this in the conference with the Senate and see where we are at that point. We will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle on this at that point. I again want to commend the gentleman for his commitment. his dedication. his passion in offering this amendment today.",

This is what the UN Population Fund distributes to women devastated by the tsunami. By voting for this amendment. you. will affirm your support for women and children in dire need of our help. The Maloney Amendment will aid the tsunami recovery effort by providing UNFPA with muchneeded funding. Its a shame that the U.S. Government has not offered their support to this organization. Ive traveled to some of the areas hardest hit by the tsunami. and I can attest to their tremendous work. Our support for the UN Population Fund should be a top priority. because its one of the few organizations that provides resources for the care of women and newborn children. Again. were talking about soap. toothpaste. and sanitary napkinsbasic needs. UNFPA also distributes birthing kits. which are vital. Neariy halt of all women give birth without a skilled attendant present. or any medical care whatsoever. These kits are sometimes all thats available to birthing women. For women who have no access to hospitals. we must support organizations that provide these kits. Its a matter of protecting life. UNFPA provides the bare essentials. These supplies are critical to stopping the spread of diseases. like malaria. Today. Congress can make a. statement to those hit hardest by the tsunami. We can show our commitment to the recovery effort by supporing UNFPA funding. Today we have a chance to put politics aside and support the work of an organization that is promother and prochild care.

Saudi Arabia. but here in the United States this one report had it at $8.85. and it has been as high as $13. This means homeowners pay about $200 more to heat their homes. This means the United States steel. for every dollar the price of natural gas goes up. costs them $80 million. If you are a company and you ask yourself where are you going to build or where are you going to move to. we have already lost 90.000 jobs in the chemical industry. We have lost 3 million jobs in the manufacturing industry due to energy prices. 52. Pt. 7 8745 We talk about the law of supply and demand of the 1990s. Ninety percent of new electric energy plants use natural gas. World demands have gone up. It is expected about a 90 percent increase in natural gas demands in the next 10 years. but since 1982 this Nation had a selfimposed moratorium on offshore natural gas and oil drilling. Here is the real law of supply and demand we need to look at now. Americans are demanding that lawmakers increase the supply. We cannot afford to continue to have these high gas prices and send jobs to Saudi Arabia. Qatar. Oman. Iran and Russia or let other countries do with natural gas prices like they did with Ukraine and double the prices on them. We cannot compete as a nation for jobs with this. It is no wonder the building trades have come out with a very strongly worded letter and said. please. let us start lowering the prices for goods and services in America. People get up here time and time again and say China is eating us for lunch. What are we doing here? We are cutting our own legs off and destroying jobs in America.

The choice is clear: we can either increase the supply of natural gas in this country. or we can continue to pay some of the highest prices in the world for natural gas. So what is wrong with the status quo? What is wrong with high natural gas prices? First. millions of middleand lowincome working families are suffering from costly increases in their home heating and cooling bills. Those high monthly bills are straining and even breaking family budgets all across America. Second. family farmers and ranchers are already struggling with natural disasters. high diesel costs. and foreign governmentsubsidized competition. Now. high natural gas costs have driven nitrogen fertilizer costs from $100 a ton to more than $350 a ton. For many ag producers. higher fertilizer costs will be the straw that breaks the camels back. And by the way. if you like what OPEC has done for high oil prices. you will love what dependence on foreign food will do to the price of food products in American grocery stores. The third reason I oppose this amendment is that I am sick and tired of seeing goodpaying American jobs being shipped overseas. American factories run by highpriced natural gas here at home are being put at a huge disadvantage against foreign factories using lowercost natural gas. For American factories and businesses to compete with foreign factories and businesses. it is kind of like trying to run a race with a 20pound weight tied around your ankle. It just wont work. And the price for that is we are losing the race for international competition for goodpaying jobs. The final reason I oppose this amendment is that in my district the utility companies in Texas want to build five new coalfired plants for electric power. Tell me how replacing natural gasfired plants with coalfired plans. increasing mercury. C02. and other pollutants in the air. in our streams. and in our lakes Is good for America.

I want to point out something else. and that is that in the LaborHHS bill we put in a lot of money for LIHEAP. Why? Because the price of natural gas keeps going up and we. therefore. have to subsidize this with tax dollars. tax dollars that could be used for medical research. tax dollars that could be used for education and things that build the quality of life for Americans. I do not think it is fair to 280 million Americans to deny them access to an asset that belongs to all of them. the resources that lie beyond the 3mile limit. That limit is there for a reason. I also want to point out one other thing. For those that have not seen it.. the technology today is vastly improved. The drilling rigs are safe.

Now imagine yourself gazing towards the Kennedy Center. and just beyond the Kennedy Center. right there in the middle of the Potomac River. you see a big old oil rig. It is not quite as appealing any more. is it? Now. I know that we are not going to be drilling for gas or oil in the Potomac River. but I paint this scenario for a reason. That distance from the Capitol to just beyond the Kennedy Center is the same distance that Mr. PETERSON is proposing we place natural gas rigs off our Nations beaches. There are drastic and devastating environmental and economic repercussions that come with drilling into the ocean floor so close to our beaches. for my own State of Florida and for the rest of the Nation. For example. the uncontrollable discharges of mud. rock. and minerals that come with piercing a hole into our Earth would be devastating for our nearshore activities. Now. for our colleagues that feel they need to vote for something. anything. to be able to say they are trying to address gas prices. I have a reminder: cars dont run on natural gas. People who are now paying upwards of $50 to fill their gas tanks. this amendment. if we leave it in place. will do nothing to change that. Gas prices will still be astronomically high.

The President declassified today a CIA program that over the last 5 years has resulted in securing vital information in the war on terror from some of the most nefarious characters that we captured. along with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and others. The President also announced today that those same individuals. including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. who was the mastermind behind the attack on our country 5 years ago this Monday. will now be transferred to Guantanamo Bay. and the process will begin of facing a military tribunal. Five years hence. we have proven that justice will not sleep for the terrorists in this country. America remembers 9/11. and today our Commander in Chief spoke truth to the world that justice will prevail.",

Cluster bombs have always posed problems for responsible military forces like those of the United States. The weapons are very useful militarily. but they also carry a real risk of causing civilian casualties if they are used where civilians are present or if too many submunitions fail to explode when they hit the ground. This is a legitimate issue to consider and. perhaps. to legislate. But it should be done in a careful manner. after holding hearings and with proper preparation. I urge the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold hearings on the issue of cluster munitions so that we can all gain a better understanding of how to maintain their usefulness while minimizing their risks. The committee should also make sure the Defense Department lives up to its claim that it \"is working towards minimizing dud cluster munitions by phasing cluster munitions systems with more reliable or selfdestructing fuzes.\" Success in that effort would go far to reduce the risks of postwar casualties.",

There is some connection there. a connection in terms of duty and honor and commitment to country and to our creator in a way that is special. The Scouts and our military do share some ideals.

The Senator from Texas. as I know. has taken the lead on this very important and complex subject. I salute you for it. Some would say it is a thankless task. it cant be done. and will make nobody happy. But I believe you have the right principles. If the right principles are applied with the right prescriptive language. we can make great progress in this area. and I salute you for it. Frequently have I quoted Senator ALEXANDER in the phrase he has used: No child should grow up in America who doesnt know what it means to be an American. I think that is good for immigrants. too. as the Senator just said so eloquently. I salute him. I also thank the Senator from Texas for considering a critical component of this legislation he has proposed. and that is the part that deals with State and local law enforcement. I have just written a Law Review article for Stanford University to deal with that area of the law. Suffice it to say. local law enforcement does have complete authority to detain people who are violating the criminal laws of the United States. But that has been confused. Clearing this up more. setting up a mechanism so that they can participate if they choose. would be helpful to enforcing the law. That is so because we have 700.000 State and local law enforcement officers at every street corner and town in America. We have only 2.000 INS immigration officers inside the bordernot those on the Border Patrol and on the border. but those inside the border. So obviously we are not very serious about ultimately reaching a lawful system if we exclude them. I thank the Senator from Texas. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

So when cloture was not invoked. we went to this bill. which has strong bipartisan support and which will be passed. However. some on the other side did choose to filibuster the motion to proceed. as they have a right to do. That is what we are doing today. Then we will have a filibuster of the bill and we will have cloture. which I believe will be invoked. Certainly the votes appear to be there for it. I think we will get this bill done.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I thank my able colleague and will say. it is such a state we are in America that a company whose employees steal the guns and go out and shoot somebody with them gets sued for it. That is a fact of what my friend is saying. that these companies ought to be sued as a result of the theft of a gun by their employees. If the law required them to do a background check and they failed to do so. they clearly would be liable under this act. The fact of filing off a serial number is. in fact. a criminal offense for which I have prosecuted quite a number of criminals. In addition. it would trigger. of course. a civil liability. Gosh. we can talk about it a lot. and I will be glad to continue to discuss it. but the basic fact is a lot of these lawsuits are claiming that if they know. if manufacturers or distributors or sellers either know or should know that some guns will be used illegally. they should be responsible for it. That is not good law. This is against what we are about in this country. All this legislation does is say if you sell the firearm according to law. if you manufacture it according to law and somebody commits an intervening criminal act with it and shoots somebody. you should not be sued. But we have this antigun crowd which doesnt care about general principles of law that have stood us in good stead for hundreds of years. They have learned to manipulate the matter as effectively as they can to maintain lawsuits. The letter from Beretta I read earlier indicates that in the District of Columbia. the gun manufacturers who sold a gun in Minnesota and it was transported some way to Washington. DC. and was used in a crime and somebody was shot. the gun manufacturer is liable for that. And. in fact. that one jurisdiction that allows that kind of lawsuit can be enough to take down every gun manufacturing company in the United States. They have had some tough years and a lot of litigation going on. Mr. President. I have spoken again. and unless my colleague would like to reply. we will close.

SPDChas deferred its 2006 chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN. I appreciate and recognize the individual and collective efforts of certain ASEAN member states for their support of substantive political reform in Burma. This deferral serves as evidence that the illegitimate military junta does indeed respond to international pressure. particularly from its neighbors. In the wake of this news. I renew my calls for countries in the region to pressure the junta to immediately and unconditionally release Aung San Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in Burma and to continue their calls for political reform in that country. the United Nations Security Council to discuss and debate the threat the junta poses to its own people and the entire region. and the community of democracies to continue to keep freedom in Burma a top priority. The assertion by the SPDC that the deferral will allow the generals to focus on the \"democratization process\" in Burma is as hollow as it is false. The international communityespecially the United States and the United Kingdommust be clear that the junta will be judged not by what it says but by what it does. So long as Suu Kyi and other innocent Burmese remain imprisoned and without a voice in the political deliberations in Burma. there simply can be no credible democratization process in Rangoon.

Over the years. I am proud of the progress our country has made in including people with disabilities in public places and events. This sweeping legislation is perhaps one of the most significant pieces of legislation since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Under this bold law. people with disabilities were ensured nondiscrimination in employment and public accommodations. including transportation and telecommunications. Implementation has not been easy. and it is still ongoing. While meaningful progress has been made. there is still a great deal of work to do to achieve the bold goal of the Americans with Disability Act.

We also celebrate the men and women. from all across America. whose daily acts of protest. persistence and courage moved this law forward to passage 15 years ago.

But. our work is not yet complete in fulfilling the four great goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act: equal opportunity. full participation. independent living. and economic selfsufficiency for persons with disabilities. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate the anniversary of the ADA than by rededicating ourselves to these goals. I look forward to working with my fellow Senators and the disability community to building on the progress that we have made over the past 15 years. Toward that end. I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a \"Statement of Solidarity\" from over 700 disability rights and civil rights organizations. led by the American Association of Persons with Disabilities and the National Council on Independent Living. that highlights the many challenges we face as we continue on the path that leads to liberty and justice for all.

I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue. and I rise in support of H.R. 4167. the National Uniformity for Food Act of 2005. This bill takes a measured approach to national uniformity for food by providing a mechanism for a thorough. orderly review of States existing regulations that may differ from those of the Federal Government. In the United States. the food production and distribution system is truly national. Products made in one State are distributed not only in all 50 States. but also the District of Columbia. the U.S. territories. and many countries around the globe. Consumers. as well as food manufacturers. have a right to expect that rational. scientifically based and consistent standards will apply. Citizens of all States and territories deserve and expect the same level of food safety protection. Likewise. all citizens in this country will benefit from uniform standards. The House Committee on Agriculture oversees a significant portion of Americas food safety system. The Federal food safety functions over which this committee has jurisdiction have long employed uniform standards to protect public health. facilitate the marketing of agricultural commodities. and improve efficiency of the interstate trading of producers goods. The adoption of uniform standards is common practice and. indeed. the general rule when it comes to the Federal food safety efforts.",

His most famous cases included the capture of Adolf Eich51. Pt. 15 September 21. 2005 mann. the man who supervised the implementation of the \"Final Solution.\" Wiesenthal also helped locate the Gestapo officer who arrested Anne Frank.

Wiesenthal explained. when we come to the other world and meet the millions of Jews who died in the camps and they ask us. What have you done. there will be many answers.

Congress initially created the Parole Commission in 1976. However. with the creation of Federal sentencing guidelines. the Parole Commission was slated to expire 5 years after the new sentencing system was implemented. Since the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Congress has extended the Parole Commission on several occasions. Without further congressional action. the Parole Commission is currently scheduled to expire on The Parole Commission is responsible for handling parole cases for offenders who were sentenced prior to the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. which created the Sentencing Commission. and eventually led to the elimination of Federal parole for offenders sentenced after 1987. Additionally. in 1997. the Parole Commission was assigned responsibility for supervising offenders in the District of Columbia. which were previously supervised by the D.C. Board of Parole. Enacting this bill is necessary in order for the Parole Commission to continue to carry on these important functions.

At greatest risk are lowincome and minority children living in older. substandard housing. Despite these facts and the bipartisan effort to increase funding for HUDs lead hazard control grants. this bill cuts funding by approximately $48 million. risking the health and safety of children and families across the Nation. Even with last years funding level. HUD was only able to fund onethird of the requests it received from cities and States. and the cut contained in this bill would only make this situation worse.

Just as a reference. my interest is in the children and the families who live in older areas of cities. including Omaha. Nebraska that I represent. who have to deal with the lead paint and lead dust in their houses. On top of that. in my city they also deal with contaminated lead. So EPA is coming in. cleaning up the lead soil in peoples yards. but yet are not doing anything to clean up the lead poisoning from the paint inside and outside those homes. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that as many as 1.600 children in East Omaha have harmful levels of lead in their bodies. There are 86.000 residents in Omaha affected by the lead cleanup. Parents wonder whether it is safe for their children to play outside. but they must continually check windowsills for lead dust and beware of cracking paint inside their homes to help protect their children from lead poisoning. The dangers of lead poisoning are well known and heightened for young children. High levels of lead in the body can cause asthma. brain damage. mental retardation. hearing loss. hyperactivity. and developmental delays. The Federal Government will end up paying the costs of lead poisoning in Medicaid. SCHIP. and IDEA dollars unless greater resources are directed toward lead remediation efforts such as the State grant program operated by the EPAs Office on Lead Hazard Control. The amendment offered today will prevent a significant cut to this program from $166 million in fiscal year 2005 to $119 million in the TransportationHUD appropriations bill under consideration right now.

It would strip any semblance of reform out of the House bill. All reform goes out the window. If we want to talk about killing Amtrak. if you really want to kill it. this is the way to do it. In the FY 2006 grant request. Amtrak specifically stated that it cannot continue to operate all routes with $1.2 billion. all routes. The LaTourette amendment offered earlier provides less than $1.2 billion. If this amendment is adopted. the northeast corridor is in jeopardy. the northeast corridor is in real bad shape. The limitation in the bill protects the northeast corridor. This amendment does not. Amtrak supporters in the northeast need to understand that supporting this amendment redirects the funding to the highly unprofitable routes. routes that carry Federal subsidies up to $466 per passenger. routes that carry less than 20 percent of Amtraks riders. and it leaves more than 52 percent of Amtrak riders in the northeast exposed to a shutdown. 52 percent. over half. Striking the limitation on route eligibility will siphon funding from routes that chill the promise of selfsufficiency. routes that are well used. to routes that will never. never. never under any circumstances be profitable.

What is interesting about this amendment is that only 20 percent of the people are involved in the elimination of these lines. but it is 50 percent of the cost. This is like a stake in the heart of a plan to establish some reform. You know. unfortunately. our national rail service is no longer a source of pride. Amtrak has suffered mismanagement. irresponsible investments. poor service and a tremendous backlog of. maintenance that has sunk the system to a new low. Amtrak. as we know it. faces tremendous debt while operating in a fundamentally flawed management system. Amtrak goes back to 1971. and the conception at that time was to produce it as a forprofit business. And it was expected to be one within 5 years. Here it is 35 years later. Guess what. they are in worse shape than ever. As has been pointed out. unfortunately for the taxpayers. its selfsufficiency is only a pipe dream. On average. taxpayers will pay a $210 subsidy. even though you do not think you are paying it. because some pay $466. you are because the system needs an average of $210 per person. All other transportation systems in our country are paid for directly. Highways and aviation are funded through user fees and excise taxes. Rail is the only passenger transportation mode that relies solely on the generosity of taxpayers. And this charity is running out. It is funny. I have not heard one word from anybody who is complaining about shutting those lines down who is interested in doing anything locally to provide resources to keep it going. That is an option. We are not mandating the closure. And the message should be clear. In a time of flat budgets and large deficits. we cannot afford the abuse of taxpayer dollars on Irresponsible ventures. poor management and unprofitable services. I know that reform is never easy. But in Amtraks case. it is essential. We have come to the last stop. Amtrak is no longer helping us move forward. Passenger rail must be reformed. or it will end. be the end of Amtrak.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill to remove the current cap on the number of reverse mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). This legislation will ensure that eligible seniors have access to this important tool that allows them to continue to meet their expenses at a time when they have a reduced income. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator CRAPO. who is an original cosponsor of this legislation. I represent a State with the second largest senior population in the United States. Many of these seniors have worked hard throughout their years and own their own homes. Many of them are also at a time in their lives when they are having trouble making ends meet. Reverse mortgages allow senior homeowners to convert part of their home equity into taxfree income. The homeowner receives payments from the lender rather than making monthly payments as with a regular mortgage. The homeowner may receive the money in one lump sum. fixed monthly payments. a line of credit. or a combination of these. These funds can be used by seniors to pay for expenses. while allowing them to stay in their own homes as long as possible. A reverse mortgage helps make services like home healthcare. adult daycare and assisted living a possibility for more American seniors. It can also be used to pay for needed home repairs and other living expenses. Unfortunately. there is currently a statutory limitation on the number of FHAinsured reverse mortgages that can be issued. This cap has already been increased as the aggregate number of FHAinsured reverse mortgages came close to reaching the cap. Unless it is removed completely. many seniors may be denied the use of this program. which can help to make their later years more stable and comfortable. For this reason. I am pleased to introduce this legislation to permanently remove the current cap. I am also pleased to be working on this proposal with my colleague from Pennsylvania. Representative MICHAEL FITZPATRICK. who has introduced this legislation in the House. I am very hopeful that the 109th Congress will act to pass this important legislation.

I am speaking today not just as a proponent of reauthorizing the highway bill. but also to express my strong support for provisions in this bill designed to promote primary safety belt laws in the States. These laws help prevent fatalities and crippling. disabling injuries when auto accidents occur. As many of you know. primary safety belt laws allow police officers to stop and issue citations to motorists they observe who are not buckled up. Secondary safety belt laws. on the other hand. require a motorist be pulled over for another offense before he or she can be issued a ticket for failing to wear a safety belt. Today. 21 States. the District of Columbia. and Puerto Rico have primary belt laws and we know these laws are working. I am proud that in my home State of North Carolinaour home State. Mr. Presidentwhich enacted a seatbelt law in 1985. belt use rose to 86 percent in 2004. Let me review a little history. It was in July 1984. during my first full year as Secretary of Transportation under President Reagan. that we issued rule 208. resulting in the installation of airbags in passenger vehicles and the enactment of safety belt laws across the country. Rule 208 was designed to save as many lives as possible as quickly as possible. It successfully resolved a 17year dispute that spanned four administrations. The rule recognized the role of the States in automotive safety. Not a single State at the time had passed a safety belt law. Usage was at only 13 percent. and airbags were virtually nonexistent. In fact. I remember having to search high and low to find an airbagequipped car so I could put it on the White House lawn for President Reagan and the Cabinet to go out and examine.",

The point I made a year ago was that one of the major reasons for a Federal tax on gasoline in a Federal highway bill was the idea of promoting interstate commerce. Originally. the interstate system was certainly put in place for military purposesat least ostensibly for military purposesto move things around the country in a national emergency. Obviously. the more pedestrian reason. if you willprobably that is a bad word to use when we talk about highways. but nevertheless. the reason that is most often used is because it is for interstate commerce. to move goods around the country. to move people",

I just want to point out as we consider how to pay for the $200 billion potential cost of Katrina that there are two particular tax cuts that have not gone into effect yet. but will go into effect January 1. They are nicknamed PEP and Pease. the Personal Exemption Phaseout and the standard deduction phaseout. And as the gentleman has inferred. they only help the wealthy. Now. we have to show a chart. because no one will believe it unless you show a chart. This shows how that cost of PEP and Pease will be distributed. If you make under $75.000 a year. you will get zero from this tax cut. If you make $75.000 to $100.000. you might get a dollar. If you make $100.000 to $200.000. you might get $25. You can hardly see the bar. Take my word for it. there is a little bar there to show the $25 you might get. At $200.000 to $500.000. you get $558. on average. and at $.5 million to $1 million. you get over $4.000. But if you make over $1 million. this tax cut that has not even started yet but will start next year. you will get about a $19.000 benefit from that. To implement this tax cut. the 5year cost is $200 billion. We wonder how to pay for Katrina? How about not letting this tax cut go into effect. That would cover the entire potential cost of a Katrina right there. But instead we are going to ask Medicare and Medicaid. possibly veterans health care. certainly student loans and school lunches. food stamps. and those who are most in need. those programs that the Katrina victims would actually be using. those are the programs that will be cut and not a tax cut for millionaires. I think our priorities are wrong. and I appreciate the gentleman giving us the opportunity to bring this kind of chart to show what kind of tax cuts have not even gone Into effect yet. but will go into effect beginning next year.

Some of it comes from the bad economy and the fact that we have had a very sluggish recovery. Ii 1900 But you know what is not on the list is the sort of cuts that are being proposed by our Republican friends in this reconciliation bill. and that is domestic discretionary spending or for that matter domestic nondiscretionary spending.

On the other hand. we have cut $336 million from the Army Corps of Engineers. including funding for the levees on the Mississippi. We have rebuilt the Iraqi republican railway line. But in the United States there have been $2.5 billion in cuts in Amtrak. and the highspeed rail funding program has been eliminated. Community development. 3.120 community action projects completed in Iraq. $320 million cut from community services block grants in the United States. $470 million for the construction of housing and public buildings and civic centers for Iraqi citizens. in this country $250 million has been cut from community development block grants. and the Presidents budget cuts for public housing. the capital fund. have been cut by 10 percent even though it is now already deficient to meet the needs of the program. This chart shows the same thing. In Iraq. 110 primary health care centers built or renovated. In this country $10 billion has been cut or is being proposed to being cut from Medicaid.

Then. when the extreme right wing Republicans in the caucus came over and those corporate Interests here in Washington.

We cannot cut programs where people have to donate and they make big profits. Is that not a coincidence? Of all the programs we have. not one program is going to be cut in which a special interest would be hurt. What a shame. What a sham. It is a joke that we are going to ask Medicaid recipients. Head Start. free and reduced lunch. college loans. Those people are going to take the brunt of the hit to pay for a natural disaster.

This Republican Congress has talked about creating jobs. has talked about growing the economy and. at the same time. they are cutting programs that are very vital to creating jobs. Let me talk about them right now. The small business 7(a) loan program is very important to my constituents. These loans are the most basic and most used types of loans of SBAs business loan programs. Under this budget. for the second year in a row. the budget eliminates appropriations for small business 7(a) loans and proposes to run the program solely through fee increases. substantially raising the costs for small business and lenders. We talk about these rural communities again. They get out of college like at Southeastern in Durant or they are at NSU in Kulaqua. they have that degree. they are going for that seed capital. They want to start a new business. We have always been the party of small business. We have always been the party of Main Street. going out and striking out on your own. This budget slashes those programs. Another thing. SBA business information centers. joint ventures between the U.S. Small Business Administration and private partners. they provide the latest in hightech hardware. software. and telecommunications to help startup and expanding businesses. They also offer a wide array of counseling services. Under this budget. that program is eliminated. One more. Micro loan program. This program provides very small loans to startups and targets mainly lowincome entrepreneurs. In 2003. this vital program provided $26.5 million in loans and an additional $15 million in technical assistance. The micro loan program enables individuals to become selfsufficient while creating jobs and contributing to economic development In local communities. Under this budget. every single dollar is eliminated. Think about that. We are talking about growing the economy. we are talking about creating jobs.

To compete in this global economy. we need to make sure our students have 21st century skills for 21st century jobs. Vocational and technical education is an extremely important part of this effort. The Perkins Act. which provides $1.3 billion to help train more than 10 million Americans across the country. is a vital investment in our nations high schools. community colleges. and our students. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical program gives a boost to Americas workforce development system by providing funds to schools that teach technical skills ranging from auto shop to computer programming. The Perkins Act also supports practical career programs and links between secondary and postsecondary education. helping students to move up the opportunity ladder and prepare them for highskill. highwage jobs. Students who have completed Perkinssupported programs are better prepared not only for higher education but for the workplace. The President has proposed eliminating funding for all vocational and technical education programs. This is the wrong way to go. If Perkins was eliminated. high schools. technical schools. and community colleges in every state would suffer. In Maryland. our schools would lose almost $19 million. Last year. we had more than 150.000 students enrolled in career and technical programs in Maryland. In the United States. 97 percent of high school students take at least one career and technical education course. Onethird of college students are involved in career and technical programs. And almost 40 million adults attend shortterm occupational training. If these schools had to close their doors or shut down their vocational programs. where would these students go to learn the skills they need to get good paying jobs? Vocational and technical education provides students across the country with opportunities to develop academic and technical skills that are critical for economic and workforce development. It is our job in the United States Senate to make sure these opportunities are there for the people who need them and to invest in our human capital to create a world class workforce. That is why I strongly support this bipartisan bill and I oppose any cuts to the Perkins Vocational and Technical Education programs.",

Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 and supports a key goal for this countrys future: to ensure Americas students have the knowledge and skills to be competitive in todays global economy. Specifically. this legislation supports the creation of stronger partnerships between high schools. colleges. and businesses to allow for career and technical education programs to better meet the needs of the workforce. including small businesses. Also. S. 250 provides for the creation of outlines for logical sequences of courses. including high school and college courses. that will lead to an industry recognized credential. certificate. or postsecondary degree. Furthermore. this measure promotes activities to improve the recruitment and retention of career and technical education teachers. including those underrepresented in the profession. As a former member of the organization previously known as Future Farmers of America FFA. I am proud of Montanas highly successful vocational education programs. Montana has over 500 approved career and technical education programs and more than 800 certified teachers in agriculture. business. marketing. family and consumer sciences. industrial technology. and health occupations. Over 160 Montana high schools participate in the Federal Carl D. Perkins and State career and technical education grant programs in order to support and improve their career and technical education programs. These valuable programs prepare Montana K12 students for a variety of careers and post secondary education programs.

I rise today to support the reauthorization of the Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of This bill is critically important to ensure that students are entering the workforce with the academic. vocational. and technical skills they will need to be successful in todays job market. According to 2003 U.S. Census data. only 27 percent of Americans have a college degree. Therefore. vocational education programs are necessary to provide occupational training to the majority of high school students who do not go on to earn a bachelors degree. Without adequate vocational and technical training programs. these individuals have few career options. Unfortunately. high schools currently offer fewer vocational education classes than in the past. due to funding shortages. There are many ways in which Perkins funds are used. and I would like to share a few examples of how these dollars are utilized in my State of California which typically receives approximately 11 percent of Federal funding for vocational education through Perkins. The Fresno Unified School District uses about $1 million in Perkins money to fund vocational education classes in areas such as introductory business. computers. and multimedia for students in grades 710. Perkins funding also helps to pay for 10 resource center facilitators who assist students in researching colleges and registering for entrance exams. The Los Angeles Unified School District receives Perkins funds to build career and technical education. CTE. programs. With these funds. the district has created 15 \"industry clusters.\" each of which contains a specific career pathway. These industry clusters range from agriculture to the arts to engineering to medical technology. I understand the importance of Federal support for vocational and technical education. and I will continue to do all I can to ensure that all students have access to the educational opportunities that will allow them to become productive and successful adults.",

By passing this legislation today. the Senate recognizes the critical need to maintain the Perkins programthe Federal Governments single biggest investment in our nations high schools. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act provides a vital link between students and the highskilled workforce American business depends on to thrive. It funds rigorous and challenging career and technical education programs that give more than 10 million Americans the opportunity to attain the specific skills needed to successfully embark on careers and undertake further education. The Presidents decision to eliminate this program in his fiscal year 2006 budget proposal is exceedingly shortsighted. It would aggravate the skills gap that employers already face and cost our country in future competitiveness. productivity. and innovation. The President seeks to eliminate a $1.3 billion investment. $6.4 million of which would be a loss to my state. Rhode Island. Instead. the Senates action today will help ensure this programs continued success. I am especially pleased that this legislation contains provisions I authored to address the needs expressed to me by educators in Rhode Island. As I have in other education reauthorization bills. I worked to strengthen professional development programs for career and technical educators. principals. administrators. and counselors. I also ensured the legislation gives states more flexibility in their use of funding and in implementing innovative statewide initiatives. In addition. I added language to ensure schools can offer students the benefit of realworld internships and other workbased learning experiences to enhance their skills.

Our Nations bankruptcy law developed out of a recognition that the world can be a competitive. often unforgiving place. Bankruptcy reform should therefore be directed toward creating a civil society in which valuing individual responsibility is not incompatible with admitting the enduring truth that sometimes bad things happen to responsible. hardworking people. Sometimes. conscientious Americans need help and support against forces that are too big for them to stand against alone.

Senator DODD. at the event.. and I was interested to find that many of the conclusions he draws from his fathers experiences remain essential to our conduct of international justice todayand. unfortunately. they are all too often forgotten. I would first echo the remarks made by Senator DODD and salute the extraordinary work performed by Justice Robert Jackson and Thomas Dodd in their roles as the U.S. Chief Prosecutor and Deputy Prosecutor. respectively. at Nuremberg over 50 years ago. The Nuremberg Tribunal taught us many lessons: that even in the depths of war. justice is not blind. that those who practice terror. oppression. hatred. and mass murder will be punished. Perhaps equally important. however. was the notion that they should also be afforded a trial. Indeed. the United States committed itself to overcoming the passions of the moment and reaffirming the rule of law. I believe this action set an important precedent that is still applicable today. Critically. the Tribunal also helped record the horrific crimes of the Nazi regime so the whole world would see the brutality and understand the depravity of those unimaginable acts. Unfortunately. crimes against humanity have occurred since the Nuremberg Tribunals. and they continue to occur today in places such as Darfur in Sudan. I believe that it is again necessary to remind ourselves of the important lessons learned over 50 years ago when Justice Robert Jackson and then Thomas Doddsoon to be Senator Thomas Doddbrought before the world the evidence of Nazi atrocities and said. \"This cannot stand.\" I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Senator DODD at the Supreme Court on February 15. 2005. entitled. \"Justice Served.

Pt. 9 June 7. 2005 I am meeting today with 35 people here from Illinois who came to Washington to remind us that hunger is not a Democratic or Republican issue. Basic sustenance ought to be a guarantee in a civilized society. not a gamble. If childrenor adultsare hungry in America. thats a problem for all of us. And it is a problem we can do something about. For instance. we know that Federal nutrition programs work. WIC. food stamps. school lnch and breakfast programs. and other Federal nutrition programs are reaching record numbers of Americans today. and making lives better. The problem is we are not reaching enough people. There are still too many parents in this country who skip meals because there is not enough money in the family food budget for them and their children to eat every night. There are still too many babies and toddlers in America who are not getting the nutrition their minds and bodies need to develop to their fullest potential. There are still too many seniors and children who go to bed hungry. There are 36 million Americans who are hungry or at risk of hunger. In the richest Nation in the history of the world. that is unacceptable. Last week. I joined with several of my Senate colleagues to introduce the HungerFree Communities Act. The bill is designed to promote local collaboration in the fight against hunger. But it also reminds us that we as a country are committed to ending hunger. We know how. We need to muster the political will. We started this week by challenging our own offices to participate in a Senate food drive. I commend Senators LINCOLN. SMITH. and DOLE for their help in collecting food that will be donated to the Capitol Area Community Food Bank.

    "speech": "I have several concerns about Justice Browns ability to serve on this important court. On the California Supreme Court. Justice Brown has proven to be an activist judge when it suits her political agenda. Consistently. and despite precedent to the contrary. Justice Brown has ruled on the side of corporations. For example. in a cigarette sales case. she ignored relevant law and protected corporations in lieu of protecting minors. In other cases she has placed corporate interests above law that intended to shield consumers and women. Justice Brown has also attempted to remove protections for teachers. and has been hostile to such New Deal era programs as Social Security. She has called government assistance programs \"[t]he drug of choice for ... Midwestern farmers. and militant senior citizens.\" These views are out of touch with most Americans and South Dakotans. During todays debate. colleagues argued that because Justice Brown has been reelected by California voters by a 76 percent margin. she should not be considered \"out of the mainstream.\" This argument is misplaced. First. many other judges get reelected at a higher rate. It should also be noted that her retention reelection took place only 11/2 years into her tenure on the California Supreme Court. at a time before her extreme views and activist agenda could have been known by voters. Both the American Bar Association and the California Judicial Commission have questioned Justice Brown qualifications to serve on the bench. The California Judicial Commission specifically noted questions about her deviation from precedent and her \"tendency to interject her political and philosophical views into her opinions.\" We should note their concerns and seriously consider them. Justice Browns views and history of judicial activism is especially dangerous in the DC Circuit. She is a nominee who is far outside of the mainstream. For these reasons. I stand in opposition of the confirmation and lifelong appointment of Janice Rogers Brown.",

    "speech": "spoke yesterday regarding the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act. I look forward to the Senate acting later this year on PATRIOT Act reauthorization. but today I just want to address one aspect of the Senators speech. his opposition to administrative subpoena power. In his speech. the Senator argued that any reauthorization should not extend those subpoena powers to FBI terrorism investigators. He correctly noted that Intelligence Committee Chairman ROBERTS has held hearings about extending this authority. which is common within the Government. to FBI agents investigating terrorism. I was happy to see Chairman ROBERTS do this because last year I cosponsored S. 2555. the Judicially Enforceable Terrorism Subpoenas Act. On June 22. 2004. I chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism. Technology. and Homeland Security that examined this subpoena power and heard testimony regarding how the subpoenas work and how the government protects civil liberties when using them. One of the things that struck me as I learned about administrative subpoena power was how widespread it is in our Government and how unremarkable a law enforcement tool it really is. It was for that reason that I asked the Senate Republican Policy Committee. which I chair. to examine this issue in greater detail. to study the constitutional and civil liberties questions that critics have raised. and to identify the other contexts where the Federal Government has this power. The resulting report was consistent with my previous research and the testimony that I had heard during my subcommittee hearings. We give this subpoena power to postal investigators and Small Business Administration bank loan auditors and IRS agents. and we do not have a problem with Government abuse or deprivation of civil liberties. Shouldnt we also give it to those who are charged with rooting out terrorism before it strikes our neighborhoods? I look forward to the upcoming debate on PATRIOT Act reauthorization. and I certainly intend to support it. At the same time. I commend Chairman ROBERTS for his efforts and hope that we will have the opportunity to ensure that our FBI terrorism investigators are not hamstrung as they continue to work to protect our Nation.

Estelle Griswold and Dr. Lee Buxton were arrested and convicted for counseling married couples on birth control methods. and prescribing married couples contraceptives. They challenged their convictions. and the Supreme Court overturned them. ruling that the Connecticut law under which they were charged was unconstitutional. The Court found that the Government had no place in interfering in the intimately private marital bedroom. Justice William 0. Douglas. in writing the Courts opinion. scoffed at the notion of police searching private bedrooms for evidence of contraceptive use. This landmark decision. cited in countless numbers of decisions since then on the constitutional right to privacy. guarantees the right of married couples to use birth control. Yet the relevance of this decision goes far beyond contraceptive use. In rendering its decision. the Court recognized a \"zone of privacy\" arising from several constitutional guarantees. The Court acknowledged that while the right of privacy is not enumerated specifically in anyone place. it is inherent in several areas within the Bill of Rights and throughout the Constitution. This very American notion of privacy served as a cornerstone of precedent. paving the way for other decisions and further solidifying as established law the constitutional right to privacy. Roe v. Wade. guaranteeing a womans right to choose. was a logical application of Griswold. Today. Americans privacy rights are threatened on many fronts. The Govermment is asserting greater and greater investigative powers. Some pharmacists are refusing to fill prescriptions for legal contraceptives. The anniversary of Griswold gives us all an opportunity to reflect on the importance of preserving our privacy rights. The Court recognized that we are born with privacy rights as Americans. and we have a particular responsibility as Senators to protect these rights for our constituents.",

In 2002 I cosponsored. and Congress passed. the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. commonly referred to as TRIA. This important legislation provided a Government backstop for the terrorism insurance market that disappeared after the attacks of September 11. The primary purpose behind TRIA. and the reason it needs to be extended. is to make sure that the American economy and markets function in the face of a terrorist threat. September 11 proved that there needs to be a mechanism in place to allow the economy to rebound more quickly and to protect American jobs in the unfortunate event of another terrorist attack here in the United States. Since it became law. TRIA has proven to be an effective program that has made terrorism risk insurance available and provided businesses meaningful access to coverage in a post9/11 world. TRIA is a temporary program set to expire at the end of this year. which created significant uncertainty in the terrorism insurance market and threatened to stall construction and building projects across the country. Most lenders who finance these projects require borrowers to have terrorism risk coverage. but in the face of TRIAs looming expiration. that coverage became more difficult and expensive to get. making those projects infeasible. Recognizing these problems early in the year. Senator DODD and Senator BENNETT drafted TRIA extension legislation. which I cosponsored. Mr. President. although slightly different from the bill that Senator DODD introduced earlier this Congress. and that I and other Democrats cosponsored. the legislation that passed out of the committee yesterday essentially maintains the structure of TRIA and extends the program through the end of 2007. I am disappointed that group life insurance will not be covered under the program and that other lines originally covered have been excluded. But my colleagues. Senators DODD. SARBANES. SHELBY. and BENNETT. worked closely with others on the Banking Committee to construct a product that all of us in the Senate should be able to support.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today I rise to pay tribute to the Frank and Ocllo Boykin Hunting Lodge on the occasion of its 100th year. Stories of Congressman Frank Boykin are certainly not unfamiliar to many in this chamber. For nearly three decades. spanning much of the Depression. World War II. the Korean War. and the space exploration and civil rights eras. Congressman Boykin tirelessly served as the representative of Alabamas First Congressional District. During this time. \"Mr. Frank\" invited some of the most prominent government. military and business leaders to his hunting lodge in Washington County. Alabama. He worked tirelessly on behalf of the residents of southwest Alabama. ensuring that their needs and concerns were always heard and that their individual problems received the attention they deserved over the course of his 14 terms in the House of Representatives. To say that he loved the people of his district would be an understatement. even the sign at the Boykin Lodge underscored his very love of life . . . \"Where everything is made for love.\" Starting with his first year in Congress. Congressman Boykin would bring congressional colleagues and other officials to his hunting lodge on a chartered Pullman car. Guests of the Boykin Lodge included three different Speakers of the House and almost every Alabama governor during the congressmans career. The hunts are held a few days after Thanksgiving every year and are attended. even to this day. by local and statewide officials. Stories of a Boykin hunt weekend almost always included hound dogs. barbecue. cold \"adult beverages.\" a game or two of cards and shotguns. In addition to the hunting stories. the lodge also served as a place for colleagues to relax. enjoy being away from Washington. D.C.. and to bond with one another. Many of the friendships fostered at the Boykin Lodge extended far beyond the boundaries of this rural part of Washington County. It is my sincere hope that the Frank and Ocllo Boykin Hunting Lodge will continue to be such a source of relaxation. good fellowship and camaraderie for another 100 years. and I rise today to salute this proud family and the many contributions they have made toward the betterment of south Alabama.",

That was all supposed to change on Monday when liberal radio talk show host Ed Schultzs show was set to debut. However. 15 minutes before our soldiers could finally hear a differing opinion. the Pentagon abruptly cancelled the show. Ed Schultzs producer received a call from a Pentagon official informing him that the show would not be debuting on AFN. Why exactly is the Pentagon keeping our troops from hearing differing opinions? Could it be that the Pentagon is a little embarrassed by the staging of a Presidential teleconference last week? We see the same staffer that informed Schultz of his cancellation was the same woman seen coaching American troops last week in what was supposed to be an unscripted conversation with our troops in Iraq.

It is reassuring to see the Congress is taking measures to help rid our court system of lawsuits that are costly and hurt those consumers and businesses in our country. Twelve million people in this country are employed by businesses in the food industry. making it the Nations largest private sector employer. This is an industry that has a direct impact on the Nations economy. and these fastfood obesity lawsuits are opposed by nearly nine in 10 Americans. The idea that holding the food industry liable for the excess of some individuals will combat obesity is unfounded. Individuals. not restaurants. are responsible for food choices that they make freely in their own daily lives. In addition. the food addressed by this legislation is legal and unadulterated. and the rights of individuals to pursue lawsuits resulting from claims like the mislabeling of food or food safety issues is preserved. Our country has a history of providing its citizens with a safe and affordable food supply. It is unacceptable to make arguments that certain types of food that are sold in certain types of restaurants as a result of consumer demand are somehow dangerous and that the average consumer must bear the burden in higher food costs because of the overindulgence by some individuals who file these types of lawsuits. This bill Is not about whether fast food causes obesity. The bill is about selfresponsibility. Today. the Congress of the United States is saying to a select group of lawyers that laws are not intended to protect people from these types of excesses. from essentially eating too much. and the courtrooms were never meant for that reason. It Is really pretty simple. If you eat too much. you get fat. It is your fault. Do not try to blame somebody else.",

Unfortunately. the food industry has been targeted by a variety of unfounded legal claims which allege businesses should pay monetary damages and be subject to equitable remedies based on novel legal theories of liability for the overconsumption of its legal products. Obesity is a problem in America. but it is not evident that the availability of highfat food or restaurants are the sole cause. A number of studies have shown that a lack of physical activity. that is. not exercising. has contributed to the rise of obesity and not solely ones caloric intake. In the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. which I chaired last Congress. we explored the threat the food industry and its workers face from frivolous litigation. the threat to personal responsibility posed by the proliferation of such litigation. and the need for passage of the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act. 0] 1100 Since the gentleman from Florida",

I rise in strong support of H.R. 554. the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act. and I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for moving this legislation to the floor. This legislation will help prevent frivolous lawsuits that allege that the consumption of lawful food products caused injuries resulting from obesity or weight gain. The food service industry employs some 11.7 million people. making it the Nations largest employer outside of the government. However. this vital industry has recently come under attack by waves of lawsuits arguing that it should be liable for the misuse or \"overconsumption\" of its legal food products by others. It is common sense that individuals should take responsibility for their own dietary and eating habits. Unfortunately. trial lawyers have ulterior motives for these lawsuits. They have made their intentions quite clear. calling the fast food industry the next tobacco. They estimate potential profits of $40 billion from obesityrelated lawsuits. It is crucial that something be done to guard against these aggressive attacks. These illconceived lawsuits require businesses to devote hardearned dollars to litigate unmerited claims. In order to help ensure that America continues to be a good place to do business. and to help create and maintain American jobs. it is important that we not allow opportunistic trial lawyers to extort money from legitimate companies. This bill also protects our Nations farmers and ranchers from the potentially farreaching effects of these lawsuits. American agriculture produces the safest. most affordable and abundant food supply in the world and should be protected from trial lawyers attempts to reach as far up the food chain as possible with unfounded claims seeking unjust enrichment. While preventing frivolous claims. this legislation would protect legitimate lawsuits. It would allow claims to go forward in several circumstances. including cases in which a State or Federal law was broken. Other types of foodrelated lawsuits not dealing with obesity would also be protected. The American public understands the importance of this effort. According to a recent Gallup poll. almost 90 percent of Americans oppose holding restaurant owners responsible for the dietrelated health problems of regular fast food consumers. H.R. 554 is a common sense bill that will protect legitimate businesses from frivolous lawsuits. and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.",

They said. we need a debate on health care. and I am pleased to engage in that debate. I am reminded of the book that talks about everything I need to know in life I learned in kindergarten. I have learned a few things here. Lawsuits do not lower obesity rates. Lawsuits do not improve the nutrition habits of children. Lawsuits do not reduce the $127 million annual medical costs that our Nation incurs on obesityrelated conditions in children and the increase in obesity rates. Mr. Chairman. parents need to teach their children at early ages to eat healthy meals and to establish exercise routines for their families. School districts need to make sure they have gym classes and serve the right kinds of food as an option. Proper diet and exercise will help reduce medical complications that are increasingly common in children. such as hypertension. diabetes. high cholesterol. and heart disease which were once found almost exclusively in adults. In my years working as a psychologist and oftentimes consulting with courts. I have yet to find a court that can replace a parent. When will we learn we cannot litigate compassion. we cannot mandate common sense. and we certainly cannot legislate personal responsibility. H.R. 554 will do more than restrict lawsuits against food and manufacturers for weightrelated cases. It forces us to take personal responsibility for ourselves and our families and put a priority on establishing healthy lifestyles. Here are the facts. If you touch a flame. you are going to get burned. If you eat a lot and do not exercise. you are going to gain weight. We need to take personal responsibility for that. The bill before us directly protects individual freedoms of all Americans from a tiny minority who try to exploit the legal system for personal gain.

We do not always get the result we want. but the courts are there to make a determination of what results are appropriate and not under the laws that exist. The State legislatures are responding.

The most important step we can take to curb obesity is to impart to everyone in this country that obesity can be controlled when we take personal responsibility.

We must get away from the notion there is anything remotely approaching a quick tix to obesity. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle requires a lifelong dedication to ones own wellbeing.

You may have heard about the overweight maintenance worker from New York. who sued McDonalds. Wendys. Burger King. and KFC for causing his two heart attacks and diabetes. Or the classaction lawsuit against McDonalds where the lawyers named children as the defendants. These stories may sound funny. but the facts show these types of frivolous lawsuits bankrupt businesses. deplete pensions. gouge consumers and deprive Americans with real complaints access to their day in court. American consumers actually pay $1.200 more for goods and services every year because of lawsuit abuse. Studies also found that the cost of litigation accounts for onethird of the price of an 8foot aluminum ladder. it doubles the price of a football helmet. it adds $500 to the sticker price of a new car. and increases the cost of a pacemaker by $3.000. We all end up paying a huge price for lawsuit abuse. But perhaps the most potentially disastrous effect of frivolous lawsuits is the cost of American jobs. American businesses are a consistent target of frivolous claims. which bleed the essential capital they need to create jobs. And with such a lawsuit happy nation. many companies simply choose to pack up shop and move overseas. At what point will we say enough is enough? At what point will we start supporting personal responsibility and stop supporting personal injury lawyers? Options on a menu do not lead to obesity. but unhealthy habits do. At what point are we going to stop the frivolous lawsuits from personal injury trial lawyers that are simply trying to make an easy buck off of overweight Americans? Mr. Chairman. I urge all my colleagues to pass H.R. 554. Lets take a stand for personal responsibility and freedom. Lets stamp out frivolous lawsuits.

H.R. 554. the socalled \"Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act\" is a measure that seeks to give federal immunity to food manufacturers. sellers. and advertisers for obesityrelated claims. The reality is there is only one such pending suit in the entire country. so I am hard pressed to see why we need to take up this measure today. especially since there are so many other important issues we need to address. I do not think it is the role of the United States Congress to intervene in every individual and private issue in America. Our Nation is plagued by childhood obesity and heart disease. and we should be looking into real solutions to this problem. we should not be focusing our efforts on getting rid of one lawsuit currently pending against a fast food outlet. Furthermore. the language in H.R. 554 is so broad it would cut off legitimate claims against the food industry. even where the industry acted to deceive the public and even where it violated State or Federal law. For instance. those in the food industry who fraudulently or deceptively market or sell lowfat products that are not really lowfat should be held accountable but this measure would let them off the hook. Lawsuits aimed at unscrupulous tactics help to change the behavior of the bad actors in the industry we should allow our legal system to process these legitimate cases. Mr. Chairman. our legal system has multiple procedural safeguards to ensure that frivolous litigation is thrown out and that meritorious claims are preserved. That is why I oppose H.R. 554.",

In other words. the muchfeared milliondollar settlement for someone who eats 12 Big Macs a day is not going to happen. Thats why there are only a few obesity cases in court right now and why the only reason were considering this bill today is because the wellheeled McDonalds Corporation doesnt want to face a legitimate lawsuit for false advertising. Many of the pending cases are for false advertising. claiming food is low fat when its really not. and this bill is so broadly worded that it would preclude such cases from going forward. The threat of legitimate lawsuits against fastfood corporations is as much a part of creating social change as is the threat of a Congressional investigation. I believe that both are equally legitimate and democratic. We wouldnt want judges to ban us from holding hearings and nor should we ban them from hearing cases Even more important than the issue of obesity or Congressional meddling in the judicial branch is the fundamental right of every American to have their day in court. Even if you eat 12 Big Macs a day. you have a right to plead your case before a judge.

Now the only reason why a woman would be taken from a State with a parental involvement law to one that doesnt is to prevent the parents from knowing that the woman is having an abortion. Now we are talking about minors here. girls under the age of 18. A parent is responsible for providing for the health. safety. and welfare of minor children that are either their own children or that they have been named as guardians of by a competent court: and to avoid the parents responsibility of providing medical care by hiding the fact that the woman is going across a State line to have an abortion is wrong. Now I think a lot of people dont like parental involvement laws. The polling shows exactly the opposite. In my opening remarks.

It contains funding for some very inventive programs and industries located in my district and throughout Oregon that will prove vital to strengthening our national security and military preparedness. This conference report also provides funding to the Department of Defense to begin researching and expanding its unexploded ordnance cleanup capabilities. Recently a pilot program has been implemented for the first wide area assessment which has already yielded valuable information for improving our ordnance removal methods. It is my hope that this is only the beginning of what will hopefully become a comprehensive approach to cleaning up unexploded bombs here at home as well as abroad. Another important program that will receive funding from this bill is the Northwest Manufacturing Initiative. which gives small businesses from my area involved with defense and military applications the ability to contract on a level playing field with the rest of the defense industry. Through this program. a coordinated effort between state. local. and the private industry. the Pacific Northwest is able to make its contributions to our Nations security.

I am pleased with the commitment we have shown to both the Navy and to our Nations shipbuilding industrial base. By funding five new ships this fiscal year. as well as continuing to adequately fund ships currently under construction like the LPD17 and the LHA Replacement. we are ensuring the Navy will maintain its prominence on the worid stage.

In addition. this legislation improves upon the Presidents request of only 40 percent of the communitys counterterrorism funding needs. This departure is important because this measure is the first authorization bill to come to the floor since passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108458)-the families of the victims of 9/11 as well as the entire international community still look to us for responsible action in the area of intelligence.

The reports of detainee abuse are undermining one of our Nations most valuable assets: our reputation for respect for human rights. The Pentagons internal investigations of the abuse allegations have resulted in conflicting conclusions. Some of these reports have been little more than whitewashes. Congress has failed to conduct a comprehensive public investigation of detainee abuse allegations at Guantanamo. Abu Ghraib. Bagram and other facilities. We have abdicated our constitutional duty to conduct responsible oversight. My motion to recommit would fill the huge oversight gap. A lack of oversight leads to a lack of accountability. and no accountability breeds arrogance and abuse of power.

Military historians often talk about the \"fog of war.\" I believe our intelligence professionals operate in a fog of law. a confusing patchwork of treaties. laws. memos and policies. Article I. section 8 of the Constitution says that it is Congress responsibility to establish rules concerning captures on land and water. I hope that we will seize this responsibility. But as Congress studies the policy options going forward. it is vital that we have the facts. Only a bipartisan. independent commission can get to the bottom of what happened among administration policymakers within the military chain of command and out in the field. The steady stream of revelations about Guantanamo and other facilities around the world erode our moral credibility. just as we are trying to win the hearts and minds of the Arab and Muslim world. It is vital to our national security. Mr. Speaker. that we fix this problem so that our detention and interrogation policies get us actionable intelligence without creating a whole new generation of terrorist recruits.

What our Republican friends are doing. if we look at what they do and not what they say. they have decided that the most important thing in this country is to increase payments for interest on the national debt. It makes no sense. but that is what they are doing. And let me give a couple of numbers. In 2004. the Federal Government paid $160 billion for net interest on the Federal debt held by public investors. By 2010. we will be spending about $312 billion. almost double the $160 billion that we spent last year. So it is pretty clear when we look at the chart in front of us here today that over the next 6 years education spending will not go up much at all. environmental spending will be about the same. spending on veterans benefits will go up slightly. but there is an explosion in interest on the national debt. So the Republicans in this House are basically saying we are not spending enough on interest on the national debt. The trouble with that is that it Is of virtually no use. virtually no use to any of us. Think about the contrast between fiscal year 2005. which we are in. and fiscal year 2006. the coming year. There is an increase in spending on interest on the national debt of $36 billion. That is with a \"B.\" Thirtysix billion dollars. that is what we will spend on interest in the national debt next year more than we have spent this year. And then let us look at what we are doing. This year how much is the increase that the Department of Education is getting from Labor. Health and Human Services. and Education bill? $118 million. That is the increase in the bill. a tiny increase. Far less than 1 percent. $36 billion more this coming year for interest on the national debt. $118 million more for education.

Number two. we need to give them a healthy start in life. We have to provide them with quality health care. Number three. we have to create opportunity for them. and that means investing in education. giving them a chance to succeed in life.

But they are cutting the Maternal and Child Health block grant by $24 million. or 3 percent. They are failing to raise the maximum Pell grant by even $100. They are doing that by only $50. The bill is making a 5 percent cut in the Healthy Start Initiative. which makes targeted grants to improve prenatal and infant care in areas with high infant mortality rates.

That was based on constitutional grounds. and Congress proposed and the States ratified three amendments. the 13th. 14th and 15th amendment. to make sure that the mistake that was made by the Dred Scott decision would never be repeated again. There was a decision early in the countrys history under the Constitution that related to the judicial power of the United States. The 11th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that. And the Supreme Court also decided that levying income taxes violated the provision of the Constitution on apportionment of taxes. and the 16th amendment was proposed and ratified to correct that problem. So when there is a court decision that has resulted in consequences that the Congress and the States collectively deem are so bad that it requires an amendment to the Constitution. this Congress has not hesitated to propose an amendment to the Constitution. and the States have ratified it. Here we have had resolutions of all 50 State legislatures asking that we propose this amendment and send it to the States for ratification. and that is because the instances of flag desecration that have occurred have been deemed by them to be over the line and that the Supreme Court of the United States was wrong in its decision and it needs correction. I just go back to the quote that I made of the Wisconsin Supreme Court when they effectively invalidated my States flag desecration amendment. It is up to the people through the constitutional amendment process to make the correction. and that is why we are here today. Mr. Speaker. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan .",

And who can forget the flag that hangs in the American History Museum here in Washington. D.C. that was draped over the scarred Pentagon as a show of our Nations resolve? We should not. we must not. and we cannot allow the desecration of our national symbol as some form of protest. Some things in this Nation are sacred. and the flag is the most sacred symbol of all. The flag binds our Nation together and must be protected. Let us take this action together today. Honor the service and sacrifice of those who have fought behind the flag in defense of our freedom.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. symbols matter. Certainly the cross has special meaning for millions of people. The menorah. the Koran. we saw that recently where false reports on desecration of the Koran led to riots and hundreds of people dying. The statue sometimes has special meaning. The symbolic meaning of the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein was not lost on the Iraqi people or the other people around the world. Buildings have symbolic value. The buildings that were destroyed or attempted to be destroyed during 9/11 were not randomly chosen. The World Trade Center symbolized the U.S. economy. The Pentagon symbolized our military might. and probably this building was also targeted because it symbolized the government. And so for millions of Americans. the flag symbolizes the very essence of this country. It is more than fabric. It is what gives this Nation meaning. Millions have fought under this banner. Hundreds of thousands have died under the banner. Many have died on the battlefield simply protecting the flag itself. keeping it from being captured or from even hitting the ground. And so for 200 years. this was a commonly accepted understanding of the importance of the flag. the symbolic meaning of the flag. And then came two 54 Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s which allowed flag desecration under the banner of free speech. which has really offended a great many people in this country. I think an overwhelming number of States. more than 80 percent of U.S. citizens. disagree with those Supreme Court decisions. So I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Resolution 10. which states. \"The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States of America.\" Mr. Speaker.

For me. that would be a badge of honor. But I think this constitutional amendment is an overreaction to a nonexisting problem. Keep in mind the Constitution has only been amended 17 times since the Bill of Rights was passed in 1791. This is the same Constitution that eventually outlawed slavery. gave blacks and women the right to vote. and guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Amending the Constitution is a very serious matter. I do not think we should allow a few obnoxious attentionseekers to push us into a corner. especially since no one is burning the flag now without an amendment. I agree with Secretary Powell. who when he served as Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staffs. wrote. \"It was a mistake to amend the Constitution. that great shield of democracy to hamper a few miscreants.\" When I think of the flag. I think about the courageous men and women who have died defending it and the families they left behind.

But I am even more opposed to weakening the First Amendment. one of the most important things for which the flag itself stands. I think that point was well put by Bill Holen of Littleton. Colorado. who wrote to express agreement with a recent Denver Post editorial against this proposed constitutional amendment. As he put it. \"As a Vietnam veteran and one who fought honorably for this nation... Like Colin Powell. while I personally abhor the thought of anyone burning the American flag. the symbol under which I fought for this nation. I believe the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are far more important.\" I do not think there is a real need for this amendment. On that point. I agree with the Rocky Mountain News that \"Flagburning is not really a problem. as actual incidents of It are rare. It is disproportionately denounced rather than actually done. And defining desecration is tricky. especially given the widespread commercial and decorative use of the flag.\" And. in particular. I share that newspapers view that \"More importantly. tampering with the First Amendment opens the way to those laws of the kind that less democratic governments impose to shield themselves from criticism.\" Mr. Speaker. every day. at home and abroad. our brave men and women in uniform are on guard to defend our country and our constitution from those who have no respect for either.

CDBG needs the kinds of things that CDBG does. both for the larger communities of 50.000 or more. called \"entitlement cities.\" but also what we should be doing here is providing to the Governors of the affected States funding which they could use in their CDBG programming. because they get onethird of it. for those communities that are in areas of less than 50.000 population. that is. they are the Small Communities Program. and we should be increasing the funding there.

I had many of the parishioners say to me that they owned land in Louisiana or in Texas and they would like to donate their land for the siting of manufactured housing or even for RVs or something of that nature. They were not sure. but they knew they wanted to put the land to use for the victims of the hurricane. So I think we should find a way by which to do that. In addition. CDBG is such a good program that I could not help but wonder as I sat here whether or not some of the money that may not be well spent in FEMA should be transferred in some way over to CDBG. Because. again. I wonder about those persons who lost their homes and all of their furnishings and they have no flood insurance. They will receive FEMA assistance of $26.000. some of which will go toward rent. and then it will run out. but the house is still left there. to be rehabilitated if it can be. or to be rebuilt and furnishings need to be purchased. et cetera. et cetera.

In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. the Federal and local governments now face the Herculean task of coordinating the relocation of thousands upon thousands of individuals and families whose lives have been torn apart by devastation and rising flood waters.

Second. although the community participation provision is an important part of the CDBG program. it is not currently feasible for affected localities to hold a public hearing.

Hitlers Nazi regime was responsible for the murders of nearly six million Jewish men. women. and children and more than 11 million people overall. Today. the relentless efforts of Simon Wiesenthal have led to the conviction of more than 1.000 of these Nazi war criminals.

The organization actively promotes awareness of antiSemitism while continuing to bring to justice surviving Nazi war criminals. Although its headquarters are located in Los Angeles. I am proud that my district is home to the Simon Wiesenthal New York Tolerance Center. I urge the House today to reaffirm our commitment to the fight against antiSemitism and all forms of prejudice. Simon Wiesenthals legacy teaches us that the perpetrators of genocide cannot be allowed to continue their path of persecution. It is crucial for Congress to continue to support Holocaust organizations like the Simon Wiesenthal Center so that history does not repeat itself. Simon Wiesenthal once said. \"When we come to the other world [after death] and meet the millions of Jews who died in the camps and they ask us. What have you done?. . . I will say.

In part. this bill will sei ve as an extension to several important health care programs that already exist to assist lowincome families. You will hear more about these programs from later speakers. I want to take this opportunity. though. to talk to you about another part of the bill that will offer immediate assistance to the workers that have lost their jobs due to Hurricane Katrina. Since Hurricane Katrina roared through my home State and Mississippi and Alabama. more than 150.000 people just in Louisiana alone have filed for unemployment assistance. The infrastructure in New Orleans and surrounding areas has been severely compromised. It is not known when these workers will be able to return to work or if they will have jobs to return to.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. let me just. if I might. illustrate the problem that is faced by unemployed workers in these three States. so that everybody understands that while this bill helps the States. it is unlikely to help any of the unemployed. and that is too bad. About 400.000 people became unemployed after Katrina. 6.000 already have exhausted their benefits in these three States since Katrina. and about 20.000 more are likely to exhaust their benefits. Next. the amounts that are paid in these three States would leave a family of four way below the poverty level. way below the poverty level. So what we Democrats suggested was to provide moneys to the States so that they could cover all of the additional costs. This bill only will provide perhaps half. There should be an extension of unemployment compensation benefits for those people and also we should elevate the amount of money going to people. These are people without fault. who lose unemployment through no fault of their own. a hurricane. It befuddles me why we have to settle on this floor for such an inadequate response to Katrina. And it is not the fault of the gentleman from Louisiana who spoke. I am sure of that because I think he wanted more. But as I understand it. talks broke down. and the hopes for a bipartisan bill that would indeed meet the needs of the unemployed. those hopes were essentially shelved. Why? Partly because of this terrible budget crunch that the majority really has brought into operation. I would also guess because they have always opposed in recent times the extension of benefits. and they do not want to do anything to elevate the benefit structure even though it is way below the normal. I say. in a word. we are adding something tragic to tragedy. and we should not be doing that. The gentleman from Louisiana said it is a first step. When would the second step be? I think there is no plan for a second step. So. essentially. in real terms. we are saying to the unemployed. it is a half a loaf. and it is hard to feed a family on a half a loaf.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. and I rise to express concern about the legislation we are considering. I heard the gentleman from Louisiana talk about the fact that we would like to do better. But let me just point out that we have $25 billion in a Federal unemployment trust account today. Those funds should be used for emergency circumstances. If there was ever an emergency. what happened to the workers of those three States as a result of Katrina is clearly an emergency. This is the time that we should be releasing unemployment moneys so that we can extend benefits beyond the statutory period that is currently in law. Through no fault of their own. the victims of Katrina are unable to find employment. and we should be able to provide extended benefits. And the funds are there in the Federal unemployment trust account. So quite frankly. I do not understand what the delay is. The people are hurting. We should be doing everything we can to help. and I would expect that we would have had a stronger bill come out that would protect the workers who cannot find employment. So. Mr. Speaker. I am disappointed that we have a bill before us that obviously is an important bill to move forward because it provides relief by extension of several programs that are important to the people that are affected by this. but I really do believe that we should be looking at a comprehensive approach to deal with people who have been victimized. Unfortunately. this bill does not really do it for those people who are unemployed. have exhausted their benefits and are looking to the Federal Government for help.",

If it is not reauthorized within days. over 160.000 lowincome seniors and those with disabilities will lose this crucial assistance on which they rely to cover their health care costs. That means that some people who make less than $1.092 a month will lose almost 10 percent of their income. This is simply unnecessary. since QIs extension has strong and broad support. It is supported by 35 separate health advocacy organizations. In addition. the gentleman from Ohio and I have a bill to extend the benefit that has bipartisan cosponsorship. In fact. a similar extension passed the House last year by a voice vote. This bill before us today will make sure our seniors do not lose their income by extending the benefit for 1 year. In doing so. it builds on a consistent history of temporary extensions in recent years. If this bill becomes law. I urge Congress to turn its attention to a more permanent solution. Every year the benefit has strong support. and more often than not we find ourselves rushing at the last minute to keep it alive. My hope is that before it expires again next year. Congress will pass a permanent reauthorization.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. while I recognize there are good things In this bill. today I will be voting against the Agriculture appropriations conference report for two primary reasons. One. it delays the implementation of the country- oforigin labeling for beef and other foods. U.S. consumers deserve to know where their food is grown and processed. and domestic producers deserve the opportunity to differentiate their products from foreign imports. While mandatory countryoforigin food labeling passed as part of the 2002 farm law. its implementation continues to be delayed and this bill would delay it an additional 2 years. My other primary concern is that the bill cuts funding for many important conservation programs. such as the Conservation Security Program. Since the farm bill was enacted in 2002. the USDA conservation programs have taken hits year after year. They have been used repeatedly as a source of offsets to fund other needs. Including this conference report. the annual appropriations measures from fiscal year 2003 through fiscal year 2006 have cut $1.13 billion in mandatory funds that we dedicated to conservation in the farm bill. I appreciate the hard work of the chairman and the ranking member. but what came back from the House is not good for our Nations farmers. it is not good for consumers. and it is not good for conservation.

It funds important research in North Dakota and across the country that will greatly benefit American agriculture. I voted against the conference report because of how it treats an important issue called countryoforigin labeling. The 2002 farm bill required that fruits. vegetables. seafood. and meat sold in grocery stores and supermarkets be labeled with its country of origin. This is a consumerfriendly. farmerfriendly. rancherfriendly law. and I strongly supported it. After all. if we can look at a label on our Tshirt and know where it came from. we should be able to do the same with the Tbone steak on our dinner plate. Countryoforigin labeling. or COOL. was supposed to begin in September 2004. If we had followed the law we passed in the farm bill. American consumers would today be able to know where their food comes from. and our farmers and ranchers would be reaping the benefits. Unfortunately. 2 years ago. opponents of this commonsense law hid a provision in a massive spending bill that delayed the start date for COOL until 2006. COOL is the law of the land. The Senate has voted overwhelmingly in favor of it. It should have gone into effect years ago. So I was outraged to learn there was another 2year delay of COOL in this years Agriculture Appropriations bill. I knew some opponents of COOL wanted to delay this important program. But I expected that when the conference committee met to write a final version of the Agriculture appropriations bill. we would get a chance to debate this issue and vote on it. in public. Instead. a handful of Republican Senators and Representatives went behind closed doors and decided on their own to delay the program for an additional 2 years. That is an outrage. I voted no today because I think we should send this bill back to the conference committee and force the conference committee to vote on this issue.",

Mr. Harner and Mr. Trainer took it upon themselves to create the Pine Forge Athletic Association in order to give the youth of the community an opportunity to play baseball and softball with their friends and neighbors. The Association started with a philosophy and a mission to provide insightful instruction on the basic fundamentals of baseball and softball. while at the same time instilling the players with moral values and good sportsmanship. The Association also emphasized giving each team member an opportunity to play in each game. The first team in 1970 had approximately 1215 players and played at a small field at the Pine Forge Elementary School. Since the early 1970s. the Pine Forge Athletic Association has grown tremendously in size. Today. there are nine different divisions in the Association that accommodate players from the ages of five to nineteen.

Malakoff has been home to fine families and a wondertul community rich in the traditions of East Texas. According to the Handbook of Texas. the area we now know as Malakoff was first settled by Jane Irvine. a widow from Alabama. who immigrated with her family to the area before 1835. Once settled in Texas. they built a gristmill on Caney Creek. and a small community grew up around the mill. In 1852 the name was changed to Mitcham Chapel after a Methodist church of the same name organized by the Rev. Hezekiah Mitcham. Around 1855 the city fathers applied for a post office under the suggested names of Mitcham or Purdon. Both names had already been used. The Postmaster. who had been reading about the Crimean War. suggested the name Malakoff. after a Russian town that had gained prominence during the war. Since that time. Malakoff has grown. but it is has always maintained its small town East Texas roots. Lying at the gateway of East Texas. Malakoff boasts awardwinning schools and plays host to the annual Malakoff Cornbread Festival. During their Sesquicentennial celebration this year. the citizens of Malakoff can be proud of their past and optimistic about their future. As Congressman for the Fifth District of Texas. it is a privilege to represent them in the United States House of Representatives. On this important occasion.

The center provides bilingual highquality and costeffective primary and preventive medical care to over 5.000 Sussex County residents who are uninsured. underinsured or face other barriers to medical care. La Reds importance is highlighted by the fact that the United States Census Bureau finds Sussex County to possess the fastest growing Latino and African American populations in Delaware. With such growth. there are limited medical resources to meet the unique needs of these populations. For this reason. La Reds recent attainment of federally qualified health center status by the U.S Department of Health and Human Services is so important and exciting. The center will receive $650.000 in federal funding each year for the next three years. La Red will also receive $200.000 a year for the next three years through the Rural Health Outreach Program. to support La Reds Prenatal Program.

By focusing only on enforcement. the majority would have us ignore our Nations economic dependence on immigrant labor and does nothing to address the millions of undocumented individuals already living and working in the country today. H.R. 6094 will have the effect of restricting the rights of immigrants to due process protections. like judicial review and immigration hearings. and could have serious. possibly lifeendangering consequences for immigrants and asylumseekers. Permitting the indefinite detention of an individual. even a noncitizen. is a practice one would associate with oppressive regimes. Applying that decision retroactively is a direct violation of due process. due process is essential when you consider the number of documented failures in custody review procedures and administrative delays. The measure grants Department of Homeland Security officials. rather than immigration officials or other courts. the authority to determine whether expedited removal of individuals is admissible. The language does not specify that an individual be convicted of any crime. it instead allows lowlevel officers to play judge and jury deciding whether an individual poses a threat to public safety. In doing so it denies individuals the rights to safeguards provided by judicial review. which has been so important to protecting civil liberties in our Nation. I strongly encourage my colleagues to reject this measure and instead move forward with negotiations for comprehensive immigration reform that responsibly addresses all aspects of this critical issue.",

Real immigration reform should include a clear path to citizenship not targeting people who dont fit the Republican majoritys conception of what a citizen should look like. Under the provisions of H.R. 6094. they want to be able to single out two or three minorities walking down the street. call them a gang. and have an easy route to deport them by classifying them as a \"criminal street gang.\" Not only is that an infringement on the constitutional guarantee to right of a assembly. its indicative of the xenophobic sentiment shrouding the Republicans version of immigration reform. Real immigration reform should take meaningful steps at securing our borders like investing in infrastructure at our ports and airports. We shouldnt be deputizing local law enforcement as border police. Real immigration reform should recognize the intrinsic value that diversity through immigration has brought to our Nation and not seek to divide us as these three bills do. Unfortunately. this debate is no longer about border security. jobs. or the economy---it has become about spewing hateful. rhetoric.

These bills. and this one before us introduced just 2 days ago. are substantively flawed and do not provide for comprehensive reform. H.R. 6095 is touted as a law enforcement bill. but it is opposed by our State and local law enforcement officials. Mr. Speaker. I include for the RECORD the comments of law enforcement associations and departments. police chiefs. sheriff associations. department heads across this country. and other law enforcement individuals to demonstrate how the policy is considered dangerous in this proposal. This bill. opposed by State and local law enforcement raises the question: Why would they be opposed to a bill in which they are being invited in to take over some national law enforcement responsibilities? Well. it is because it will strain the relationship between the police and immigrants and citizens. It will obstruct police in their mission of keeping our streets safe. Essentially the bill is asking the State and local police to pick up the slack for the Federal Government. Now. title H of this same measure. the Alien Smuggler Prosecution Act. should really be examined carefully. Increasing resources for alien smuggling prosecution is quite appropriate. however. this bill will not decrease immigrant smuggling. and it will not resolve any of the fundamental flaws in our immigration system. The bill has nothing to do with the practice known as \"catch and release\" which has been referred to already. This proposal does little more than tie the hands of courts in immigration cases. Judges will be burdened with new requirements. and other civil cases will be denied their day in court.

On Monday. 2 days ago. the strangled and battered body of an as yet unidentified woman was found in a subdivision about 20 miles south of Denver. An orange tow rope was found around her neck. and her face was unrecognizable. Preliminary autopsy results indicated that the woman died of asphyxiation and head injuries after being dragged along a road for more than a mile. A suspect was arrested Tuesday night in that case. Jose Luis RubiNava. age 36. is being held without bail on a first degree murder charge at the Douglas County. Colorado. jail.

If the issue is about papers and the only reason we havent gone to conference committee is because the papers havent been delivered. I do have Senator FRISTs phone number. and I am happy to provide it. I cannot conceive that it is a matter of paperwork and process that is keeping us from going to conference committee on one of the most serious domestic issues this country has faced. Secondly. in response to the following speaker. the reason we cannot quite unite to do something here. apparently. is because we are not going to unite on a fools errand. Everyone on your side of the aisle. from the gentleman from Colorado to the chairman to others. has acknowledged over and over again we are not going to deport 12 million people. You are not going to have local law enforcement pick up the task for you of deporting 12 million people. A meaningful response is border security. because there are people there who are national security issues and there are people who are aiming to hurt us who want to cross this border illegally. and dealing with 12 million people who are operating under false identifiers. some of whom are bad people. and finding some system to either isolate and narrow that group or have them come forward. and most important of all. to get an employer verification system in place. None of these bills does anything about it. We are going to leave here in a week doing nothing about it. I dont understand how you are going to explain to your constituents and the people who are understandably upset about this issue that this Congress has addressed a very serious. urgent issue in a serious and coherent fashion.

It is about a pretty important paper that has served our country well called the Constitution of the United States. Article I. section 7 says: \"All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills. The \"comprehensive amnesty immigration bill\" that the Senate passed and didnt message contains $50 billion in new taxes.

It is very interesting. Everybody is expressing the same desire. yet we cant quite get there. That is hard to understand. I would like to make one comment to my friend from Illinois about conferees. One. I am confident it will be a fair conference. Obviously. in my personal view. the Judiciary Committee will be the appropriate conference. But that is a privilege and a right and a responsibility of the majority leader. We know the way it works around here. The majority leader appoints conferees. The majority leader wants to resolve this. He doesnt want the legislation gutted or destroyed in conference. We have worked too hard to get where we are. We have to proceed. at least a little bit. in good faith. recognizing if at some point as we are moving along that confidence is not there. you can derail it at any time. You can start the procedure that we have been in for the last 9 or 10 days. That seems to me the right thing to do. and I hope the discussion between the two leaders in 10 minutes will yield us an agreement to move forward. The KylCornyn amendment has been pending for 10 days. We have on your side Senator DORGAN who feels strongly about his amendment. and so does the Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Those are issues we could work through and then see the end of the tunnel. We all know what happens. I think we are down to something like 20 amendments on our side. and it would probably be less than that. But there are only so many major issues associated with this bill.

John has served as the Commissioner of Reclamation since July 2001. Prior to that. he spent 34 years as a career employee with the Bureau. starting as a civil and hydraulic engineer. He spent many years in my part of the country. serving as the PacificNorthwest regional director for 12 years prior to his retirement in 1998. Johns tenure as Commissioner coincided with the worst five years of drought in the past 5 centuries. John had to deal with growing. often conflicting. demands for water in the arid West. He initiated the Water 2025 program to help States and water districts address these competing needs. He is a consensus builder who helped craft a historic agreement on the use of Colorado River water. Throughout his tenure. he made resolving water conflicts in the Klamath Basin. on the OregonCalifornia border. a top priority for the Bureau. John is a commercial airline pilot and a white water enthusiast. He used to average about 300 flight hours a year. often flying for organizations like Angel Flight.

    "speech": "Madam President. I am sending to the desk today legislation captioned as the \"Oil and Gas Industry Antitrust Act of 2006.\" legislation on behalf of myself and Senator DEWINE. Senator KOHL. Senator LEAHY. Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator DURBIN. The Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the escalating price of gasoline. which has risen some 25 percent in the past year. from $1.85 per gallon nationally in January of 2005 to $2.38 a gallon early this year. We have seen rapid consolidation in the oil and gas industry. with many mergers which are specified in the written statement I will have included in the RECORD and enormous profits characterized by the profits reported by ExxonMobil. which earned over $36 billion in 2005. the largest corporate profit in U.S. history. The legislation we are introducing will do a number of things. First. it will eliminate the judgemade doctrines that prevent OPECs members from being sued for violating the antitrust laws. There is no doubt that they take joint action when deciding how much oil to sell. actions would normally constitute unlawful price fixing. This legislation would make them subject to our antitrust laws. With fewer players in the industry. anticompetitive acts. including the withholding of supply and information 152. Pt. 4 5553 sharing. become easier. The bill would prohibit oil and gas companies from diverting. exporting. or refusing to sell existing supplies with the specific intention of raising prices. The bill also requires the FTC and the Attorney General to consider whether future oil and gas mergers should receive closer scrutiny. It requires the GAO to evaluate whether the divestitures required by the antitrust agencies for past mergers were adequate to preserve competition. There is significant evidence that the concentration in the industr has been a contributing factor to increasing gasoline and oil prices. There are other factors. but it is not explained simply by the increase in the cost of crude oil. This bill takes a firm stand to protect the American consumer from enormous increases in gasoline prices and in oil pricessomething very serious when we have insufficient funds in LIHEAP to take care of people who are unable to pay for the increasing costs of heating oil.

I am offering this amendment today with the gentleman from Idaho . my fellow cochairman of the PATRIOT Act Reform Caucus. This amendment addresses two important issues regarding delayed notification of the socalled sneakandpeek searches. The amendment removes the clause that allows judges. when deciding whether initially to grant a sneakandpeek search. to allow it for the reason that it would unduly delay a trial to notify the target of the search. This amendment strikes \"unduly delaying a trial\" because we believe it is too low a standard to allow for a delayed notification search under the adverse impact clause of section 2705 of title XVIII. This amendment also requires on an annual basis that the Administrative Office of the Courts must report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the number of search warrants granted and the number of delayed notices authorized. The AOC would also be required to indicate the cause of delay in each instance. This important information will help improve Congress oversight role on delayed notification for socalled sneakandpeak searches in the future by providing Members with this information on an annual basis. Again. I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Chairman SENSENBRENNER) and his staff for once again working to address the concerns we had on delayed notification.

I do not think that there should be a delayed notification warrant excuse for unduly delaying a trial. but we have heard an awful lot about delayed notification warrants here. Let me again repeat the fact that delayed notification warrants were not created by the PATRIOT Act when it was passed 31/2 years ago. It was existing law for drugtrafficking and racketeering investigations. and the PATRIOT Act only expanded it to include terrorism investigations. Mr. Chairman. I would like to give Members today a very vivid pictorial example on how these warrants work. Using a delayed notification search warrant. the DEA and other Federal agents entered a home along the border between Washington State and Canada on July 2. 2005. because there was information that the firstever tunnel under the border between Canada and the United States has being used for drug trafficking. What did they find? They found a very sophisticated tunnel. and took a picture of it. There were various camera devices and listening devices that the agents put into this tunnel. and they ended up finding that the tunnel had been used to transport 93 pounds of marijuana from Canada into the United States. This is a picture of the U.S. entrance to the tunnel on our side of the border. very close to Canada. It probably is best described as the U.S. exit. But on the Canadian side of the border the entrance to the tunnel was in a building. So the contraband was stored in this building. was put into the tunnel. taken underneath the border and exited in the United States. Now. the tunnel that I showed in the first picture was big enough to smuggle terrorists across the border. should it be used for that purpose. All this ended up being exposed as a result of a delayed notification warrant. The amendment is a good one. so are delayed notification warrants.",

We have been fighting the war on terror longer than we fought World War II. and it appears to be that this is going to be in the American landscape for as far into the future as we can see. This amendment helps get a handle on the sneakandpeak provisions. Section 213. which authorizes the sneakandpeak investigation. is not restricted to terrorists or terrorism offenses. It may be used in connection with any Federal crime. including misdemeanors. The PATRIOT Act did not establish oversight standards for these investigations. The public has a right to know how these activities are being undertaken. We saw one of these searches in Oregon go sideways and devastate the life of a local attorney. Brandon Mayfield was jailed for 2 weeks as his name was leaked to the media. falsely linking him to the Madrid bombing. Now this man is suing the FBI. but he will never. never be able to clear his name. I appreciate what my friends. the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman fom Idaho . have attempted to do here. narrowing the application and providing more information to Congress.

In 2001. just days after 911. we rushed through a bill that simply cast aside the important byproducts that were developed by the Committee on the Judiciary on a bipartisan basis. I am hopeful that this is going to give us a chance to work together to deal with the important security provisions. Nobody wants America at risk. but it is important that we narrow provisions. wherever possible. that we have appropriate sunset provisions and that we are monitoring carefully.

What we found out in our examination. the staff examination. is that 90 percent of the uses of the sneakandpeak authority have been for nonterrorism cases. It seems to me that this amendment goes along in that same direction.",

Keeping America safe is not a partisan issue: but. unfortunately. several provisions of H.R. 3199 are. Now. we could have had a bipartisan solution that extends the provisions that are effective and modifies those that need changes. This amendment addresses one of those changes by preventing the use of sneakandpeek searches when the sole purpose of the delayed notification is to postpone a trial. The current provision is too broad. and this amendment would limit these searches to terrorism cases. Now. I recognize the need for our laws to keep pace with new technology and a changing world. and I am committed to ensuring that our law enforcement has the tools they need to keep our Nation safe. However. providing these tools need not come at the expense of the liberties and freedoms that we hold so dear. If we cede these. we have already given up the very values the terrorists are trying to destroy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make many changes to H.R. 3199 to fight terrorism and to protect our freedoms. I urge the Senate to take a more bipartisan approach to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. and I hope that they are more open to sunsets which require Congress to review the act. extend what is working. and change what is not. Sunsets would make the bill better. but the rule does not permit us to vote on this important modification. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this responsible amendment.",

But 1 should point out that in committee we considered another halfaloaf amendment. if you will. to section 213. and that amendment by myself and the gentleman from New York clarified or. not clarified. but actually put in some false stops with regard to delayed notification searches where you have to appear before a judge after 80 days to justify delayed notifications. After 90day increments beyond that time. you have to appear again and justify that search as well. That is the other half a loaf.

The U.S. Justice Department estimated that from 2000 to 2002. the percentage of rapes and sexual assaults occurring at the workplace jumped from 2 percent to 10 percent of the total number of rapes and sexual assaults occurring in the United States yearly. Yet. many of these victims are told their only remedy is workers compensation. When rape occurs on the job. employers should not be able to hide behind a system designed to compensate for jobrelated accidents. My bill sends a clear message: Rape is not all in a days work. This bill gives victims of workplace violence across the Nation a remedy outside the workers compensation system. It does this by creating a Federal civil rights cause of action. under certain conditions. for employees who have been the victims of gendermotivated violence at work. This bill will not result in numerous and unwarranted lawsuits against small businesses. In fact. the legislation outlines very strict requirements regarding whether a case would fall under the purview of this bill. Workers compensation is a great systemit has created an American workplace safe from industrial accidents. But the job isnt done. This bill will encourage employers to create a job environment free of violent sexual assault and rape. because it is a terribly sad day in America when rape is considered all in a days work.",

Last November. the Department of Homeland Security announced the launch of the Secure Border Initiativethe Departments multibillion dollar effort to integrate technology. infrastructure. and personnel to secure our borders. While I support the Departments efforts. my subcommittee has already begun to closely monitor this program and we will hold an oversight hearing this fall on the new SBI contract. In closing. I would like to reiterate my support for this important bill and hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this important legislation.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6061. the Secure Fence Act of 2006. This bill will help secure the border and stem the unrelenting flow of illegal aliens into this country by authorizing 700 miles of twolayered reinforced fencing. mandating the Department of Homeland Security to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through various methods such as ground sensors. cameras and surveillance technology. It also requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide necessary authority to Border Patrol agents to disable fleeing vehicles. similar to the authority granted to the U.S. Coast Guard. The provisions in this bill will address our countrys vulnerability and strengthen operational controls along our borders. Border fences have a proven success rate in drastically reducing the number of illegal aliens entering our country illegally. When enacted. this bill will dramatically reduce illegal immigration and make us safer. I have long been committed to stopping the flow of illegal immigration and securing our porous borders. My constituents have made it clear to me they want our borders secure. our laws enforced and the flow of illegal immigration stopped immediately. The recent 22 immigration field hearings held across the country during the month of August yielded the same mandate from the American people. secure the borders now. The amnesty provisions contained in the Senatepassed immigration reform measure earlier this year would encourage future illegal immigration and reward those who have violated Americas laws with a quick and easy path to citizenship. There is more to be done in dealing with illegal immigration. but securing the borders must be the first step. America cannot afford to wait any longer and I will continue to push to secure our borders now.",

Ironically. that tag line comes from a Robert Frost poem entitled \"Mending Wall\" that seemingly questions whether a wall in need of repair is worth the effort. Even more ironic in this is the fact that this poem is about mending a fence. something that this bill does not pay for. In fact. H.R. 6061 does not even pay for the fence to be built. If border security is so important. why do my colleagues across the aisle refuse to do it right? Mr. REYES and I are offering this motion to recommit to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security has the resources and capabilities to address our border security problems. This motion to recommit would secure our borders and protect the American people. That is not to say there is not more to be done. Congress still must face the issues of comprehensive immigration reform. which Republicans refuse to bring to the floor and have used parliamentary procedure to keep it from discussion today.

This debate today is about whether or not this Congress can afford to micromanage what the United States Customs and Border Protection does on our border. This bill calls for a fence from Calexico to Douglas. from Laredo to Brownsville. from Columbus to El Paso. from Del Rio to Eagle Pass. and a fence in the Tecate area as well. Our position in this motion to recommit is. instead of micromanaging. let us give the Customs and Border Protection the resources that they need. Let us give them real meaningful legislative support. Under our bill we give them additional Border Patrol agents. [] 1500 Under our bill we give them security enhancements. we give them surveillance enhancements. we give them practical infrastructure enhancements. In other words. what we do is. we provide them the support and ask them. what is it that you need. tell us how you are going to enhance the ability to better monitor the border. We think that makes sense. We can do much better than micromanage from here. We wouldnt micromanage and tell generals in Iraq or Afghanistan how to fight that war. Why should we do that when we are trying to defend our homeland? We can do much better. This bill. from my perspective. and from my 26V2 years of experience with the Border Patrol. as I walked in. I listened to my colleague from California. Congressman HUNTER. He was talking about a fence that was effective. There are limited areas where fencing is effective. but to put a fence from Columbus to El Paso. a stretch of 88 miles. is ridiculous. It is not only expensive. but the maintenance and the effectiveness is going to be expensive and questionable. Part of this process has to include common sense.",

We believe on our side and a solid majority of the House of Representatives believed last December. and indeed a majority of the United States Senate believed. that a fence is essential. that a fence is important. And that is why it was passed last December. that is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support it today. and that is why we are bringing it forward now.

This measure before us is not earmark reform or any other kind of real reform. It is not accountability. and it is not transparency. It is. at best. a press release. There are so many loopholes in this measure that you could drive a Mack truck right through it. Unreported bills. managers amendments and other amendments are not subject to this socalled reform.

Let me say to my colleagues. this entire institution has suffered as a result of the corrupt practices of the Tom DeLays and the Duke Cunninghams. It has suffered under the 12 years of mismanagement by the Republican majority here. People have had it. People have lost faith in this institution. This chairman of the Rules Committee talks about how the Republican majority is interested in reining in spending. Federal spending has gone up 40 percent since George Bush took office. In terms of earmarks. they are coming late to this game. In 1995. when they took power. there were about 1.400 earmarks. There are over 14.000 earmarks as of 2005.

I want to say that I support this resolution because I take my responsibility to allocate the hardearned money of the residents of Georgias 11th District very. very seriously. There are fundamental duties of the Federal Government. tasks that the American people cannot do Individually. but they rely on the collective strength of our Nations capital to accomplish. Some of these tasks are national security. ensuring the safety of our citizens at home and abroad. and maintaining our national highways and infrastructure. However. over the years. the Federal Government has expanded this definition to encompass many extraneous projects that cannot be defended. Mr. Speaker. there is a reason earmarks have become such an integral part of the appropriation and authorization process in Congress. It is because each individual Member of Congress knows what is needed in their own districts better than anyone else. It is for this reason that I fully support this legislation. because it does not outlaw earmarks. Rather. it represents reform that is long overdue. Mr. Speaker. I have submitted earmark requests on behalf of my constituents. but I have always tried to prioritize these projects in an effort to maintain my credibility as a trustworthy steward of the taxpayer dollars. So I rise today not to condemn the earmark process. but rather to applaud the legislation that inherently reforms it. This legislation takes a stand for transparency in an effort to curl) the current trend of frivolous Federal spending.

The second session of the 109th Congress began with Members on both sides of the aisle deeply concerned that the dignity of this great institution had been tarnished. Newspapers across the country ran stories almost every day about the illegal practices of wellconnected lobbyists. Stories discussed the ways in which unethical conduct had become the cost of doing business in Congress. We read about the K Street Project. We read about legislation written in secret by lobbyists and about backroom deals to benefit narrow special interests. Editorial boards from all 50 States called for reform. In May. the House passed a fundamentally flawed approach to reform. It included some new restrictions on lobbyists. yes. but we showed no willingness to demand reform of ourselves. That sent a terrible message to our constituents. There is a better approach. I have joined many of my colleagues as a cosponsor of the Honest Leadership Open Government Act. It injects transparency and accountability into Congress itself. There would be no more K Street Project. There would be no more meals or gifts from lobbyists. No more travel on corporate jets. And it would ensure better legislation. Members would be guaranteed 24 hours to read a bill before voting on it. And we would end the common practice of lastminute provisions slipped into conference reports. The majority is interested in none of this. The legislation was rejected in May along party lines. And since then. the House has not shown any interest in moving ahead with any meaningful reform. So here we are in the waning days of the 109th Congress debating only a narrow earmark reform resolution full of exceptions and unlikely to pass. Every Member of this House knows that this bill is not what the American people demanded of us at the beginning of the year. Certainly. this resolution will not restore the integrity of the institution in which we serve. Mr. Speaker. the American people want real reform. They will not be fooled by fig leaves.

The Republican leadership has offered a very modest rules amendment. but I think we should go even further. It is in that spirit that I have introduced H.R. 1008. a resolution outlining a comprehensive approach to earmark reform that brings real transparency and publicity to the earmarking process for appropriations. authorizations and tax benefits. My comprehensive proposal. H.R. 1008. includes requirements not only for reporting the Members name along with the earmark request. it also requires that earmark requests be submitted to the committee or committees at least 7 days before an earmark request is scheduled to be voted upon. But. most importantly. most importantly. my proposal requires that information on all earmarks be posted on committee Web sites for public inspection at least 48 hours prior to the time of the vote. and also directs the Clerk of the House to establish a public Web site that provides links to all committee Web sites with information on earmark requests. By providing easily accessible information on earmarks and \"onestop shopping\" for American taxpayers. we can bring real accountability to the earmarking process. The need to control the growth of earmarks should not be a partisan issue. This is not about Democrats and Republicans. it is about a good idea and something good for the American public.

I rise in strong support of H.R. 798. the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005. I am a cosponsor of this bill. and like many of my colleagues. this bill addresses a growing concern back home in our districts needing immediate attention. Across the country. almost every community has been touched by the meth crisis. Meth is a toxic mixture of chemicals that gives its users an incredible euphoria. followed by dramatic crashes. paranoia and often violence. My home State of Indiana has the unenviable distinction as one of the leaders in the number of methamphetamine labs. Everyone in Southern Indiana is painfully aware of the tragic toll meth has taken on our communities. The danger from the meth crisis is great. not only because of the lives destroyed by intentional use and production. but also from unintentional contact with the drug by first responders. unwary home buyers and renters. and innocent children. The law enforcement officials I have met with on the topic tell me meth can be absorbed through inhalation during the manufacturing process and through the skin from contaminated soil. carpeting. drywall and other housing materials. Groundwater can be contaminated with effects that last long after the meth cooks have left the area. Few know about the longlasting problems left by the producers of methamphetamine. These makeshift labs are leaving toxic sites around our communities. our highways and our farmland. We must act and do more to clean up this invisible time bomb. This bill is a good first step in the process. We must know more about how to treat a meth lab when the first responders arrive on the scene. particularly after a fire explosion. We must know more about the longterm effects of meth on those who occupy these lab sites after the meth cooks are gone. We must know more about how to protect children who happen upon these toxic sites. Mr. Speaker. I thank our leadership for bringing this bill to the House floor. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill to protect our police. our first responders. our loved ones from the aftereffects of meth production.

While meth abuse is currently sweeping the country. causing great alarm for law enforcement and health officials. we in Californias San Joaquin Valley have been fighting rampant meth abuse. production and clean up for over 20 years. Meth is Californias largest drug threat. and the Valley suffers one of the highest rates of abuse. both in production and use. According to local law enforcement officials. over 13.500 pounds of meth have been seized over the last 3 years. In 2004. Fresno made 180 meth related felony arrests. These are significant achievements. but there is more to be done. The San Joaquin Valley law enforcement successfully reduced the number of Superlabs seizures from 27 in 2003 to 9 in 2004. However. the need to ensure the former labs are cleaned to a safe level is key to protecting our communities. Meth abusers are not the only victims of this destructive drug. The production of meth in meth labs and \"super labs\" leave dangerous biproducis. putting innocent children and law enforcement into harms way. I am a cosponsor of this legislation because it provides communities with the guidelines to properly clean up hazardous contaminants from former meth labs and improves meth lab detection tools. As a Member of the California State legislature. I authored a law raising penalties for trafficking. manufacturing. and sale of meth to the same level as heroin and cocaine. I also authored legislation authorizing the forfeiture of any boat. airplane or vehicle used to facilitate the manufacture of meth.

But now methamphetamine is made in our own backyards and particularly in areas in this country that are similar to those areas around my home in Michigan. They do not need much. They need chemicals that they can buy in a convenience store or anhydrous ammonia that people can steal from an agricultural operation someplace. It is very. very easy to make. It is very. very addictive. and it is very dangerous. both for those who use it and for those who make it. This bill deals with the residual things that happen when methamphetamine is made in a lab out someplace usually in the country. What they are left with is a chemical soup. For every pound of methamphetamine manufactured. 5 pounds of hazardous waste is created. For every lab that has to be cleaned up. somewhere between $8.000 and $15.000 worth of public money is expended. Children are put into foster care because their parents can no longer care for them. It is a huge public health and social problem. And it is so easy to make. One oxygen molecule from pseudoephedrine. which one can buy over the counter in almost any store. one oxygen molecule taken away and we have methamphetamine. Numbers of arrests coming up almost exponentially in the past 5 years. and the residual in the labs is a terrible thing. It is a horrible thing. and we have to have some systematic way to deal with that residual as we are working on ways to deal with the drug itself. This bill is a tremendously good start in that direction. And. again.

The producers. as Dr. Schwarz has indicated. can buy the product over the counter. all the ingredients to this. and then they rent an apartment or rent a motel room and quickly cook the stuff to make the final product. That is what we are concerned about. What about the atmosphere that is created? They tend to go in the more rural areas of America. bypassing the big cities. because they figure there is an undue concentration of law enforcement officials there. and maybe they can get away with it in the more rural settings. They did not reckon on guys like Sheriff Gary Howard. who has got an outstanding record of busting these guys and carting them off to where they belong. to jail. But then what? What happens to the property? The owner of the property. totally unaware of what was taking place on their property. I understand It. we can all understand that. and then the owner probably says. well. we will clean it up. we will vacuum the floor and paint the walls and it will be okay. Wrong. Not okay. We have got to do more studies. because the residue is there. and we have got to be concerned about that. That is what this is all about. a modest amount of Federal dollars to deal with a very real and meaningful problem.",

It is literally a chemical cocktail. made from hazardous. caustic substances. In the process of cooking a batch of meth. those chemicals seep into the interior of a home. Often. unsuspecting. innocent families move into these houses and apartments. completely unaware that the new home was once used to cook meth. It isnt until they become ill that they learn something is wrong. terribly wrong. DEA reported over 17.000 meth lab busts last year in 47 states. There is currently no federal standard to determine when a former lab is safe to inhabit. This bill will do that. H.R. 798 will establish a research program to develop voluntary. healthbased. model guidelines for the cleanup of former meth labs. It will establish a research program to develop meth detection equipment for use by first responders. and will require a study on the longterm health impacts on first responders and children taken from meth labs. It is important for us to know when a house used as a meth lab is sate to inhabit again. It is important that we know the health impacts of exposure to a meth lab. This bill will do both of these things. As a CoChair of the Meth Caucus. I am proud to see an important meth bill like this one finally see its day on the floor.

I am a member of the Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamines and an original cosponsor of this legislation. Before coming to Congress. I was the District Attorney of Madison County. Alabama. It was in that capacity that I learned that meth is not only a danger to adults who use the drug. but also a great danger to people who live in the homes where meth is used or manufactured. especially children. Unfortunately. the effects the exposure to meth is something that we are still learning more about. I support todays legislation because I believe it is important for our communities to understand these residual effects. H.R. 798 addresses the environmental and secondhand impacts of methamphetamine abuse. It specifically establishes research programs through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to: identify the harmful chemicals associated with meth labs. discover the impact exposure to these chemicals have. and identify any residual effects of methamphetamine labs. Additionally. this legislation creates guidelines for the clean up and decontamination of contained meth lab sites. It also requires NIST to develop and standardize methamphetamine detection methods. I would like to thank Congressman GORDON for his leadership in addressing this oftenoverlooked battle in the fight against methamphetamines. I encourage my colleagues to approve this bill.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the rapid growth in the production and use of methamphetamine is very serious problem that requires the full attention of Congress. In the State of Washington and in my Congressional district in particular. meth has rapidly become the drug of choice. The police chiefs and sheriffs in my district tell me that the percentage of criminals that are also meth users has grown astronomically over that last ten years. and now it is the most frequently used drug by both violent and nonviolent offenders. This drug is highly addictive and easy to make. As most of my colleagues are aware. meth can be made with instructions that can be found on the internet and using ingredients and equipment that can be purchased overthecounter in virtually any community. Congress must do more. in my opinion. to fight this growing menace. The byproducts of methamphetamine production are highly toxic and can linger at the point of production long after the equipment and drugs have been taken away. These byproducts. even in small amounts. can irritate. bum or even kill individuals coming across a lab site well after the drug producers have gone. As a result. state and local agencies often must take extreme measures to remove all traces of toxicity from a lab site. In my own district. state environmental cleanup engineers have had to remove entire hotel roomsincluding the furniture. appliances. dry wall and studsbecause contamination from routine production of meth has been so extensive. Cleaning up these toxic messes is the issue addressed by the legislation proposed by my good friend from the state of Tennessee. This bill calls upon the Environmental Protection Agency. together with the National Institute for Standards and Technology to help provide some expertise and guidance to state and local agencies on guidelines for to follow to safely and effectively clean up meth labs. I commend my friend for offering this sensible and needed proposal. and I encourage my colleagues in the House to support it. Mr. Speaker. I encourage all Members to support H.R. 798. and I urge my colleagues to continue to work together to eradicate this extremely dangerous and locally produce drug.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I yield myself the balance of my time. I do rise in strong opposition to the gentlemans amendment. I think this is the wrong time to send the signal to the world that the United States Congress does not fully support President Bush in his fight against terrorism and narcotics in this hemisphere. I believe that the current mix of the \"hard side\" versus the \"soft side\" of programs in Colombia has been vital to our success. The aerial spraying eradication program enjoys strong public support in Colombia. Part of the support is due to the fact that we are offering alternatives to farmers who used to cultivate coca and poppy. Illicit cultivation is not now their only option. The softside programs promoting alternatives is even more effective in Colombia due to the realization if they do not stop cultivation and take advantage of legal opportunities. their coca or poppy will be sprayed and they will not have anything available to them. The carrotandstick incentive structure has proven to be very effective in Colombia. I think we have gotten the mix right. The political will of the Uribe government is part of the reason for our success. However. Colombia has provided more than just political will. In the last 3 years. it has doubled its portion of the GDP that is devoted to public security and democracy. The narcoterrorists they face are smart. well financed. and ruthless. Therefore. both the government of Colombia and the United States must keep up the pressure to end narcoterrorism in Colombia. Our government has been a strong supporter of Colombia. and President Bush has confirmed to President Uribe our firm commitment to support Colombia in its efforts to combat narcoterrorism. Secretary Rice has also confirmed this commitment during a recent visit to Colombia. We need to consolidate the many successes of Plan Colombia. There has been almost a 33 percent reduction in coca cultivation in Colombia since 2001 and a 72 percent drop in poppy cultivation. We need to ensure that this trend continues. Our goals in Colombia are to eliminate narcoterrorism. promote respect for human rights. create economic alternatives and opportunities. respect for the rule of law. and achieving peace. Democracy is flourishing in this important ally and terrorism is being defeated. We cannot afford to lose the momentum. I urge a \"no\" vote on this amendment.",

The \"priority\" debate today is not about whether stemming the drug trade is appropriate. but the methodology of going about it. Military approaches fit war scenarios. Civil war is more problematic. criminal activities even more so. My concern is that when America enters into internal conflicts we change the nature of ongoing struggles as well as the motivations of various combatants. We become implicitly accountable for a panoply of policies of any side we back and accordingly answerable to the people for that sides allegiance or lack thereof to social fairness and the rule of law itself. In this context. would it not be better to limit our military involvement in this struggling. divided country and focus our efforts instead on alternative crop production. democracy building programs and the effective prosecution of human rights abuses? And at home wouldnt we be better off emphasizing education to reduce the demand for drugs? Military involvement simply carries too many seeds of counterproductivity as well as the prospect of escalation if policies at one level of engagement prove insufficient. Accordingly. I support the amendment before us. not out of a conviction it is an adequate answer to a real dilemma for both of our societies. but out of a belief that more balanced social involvement holds a better prospect for more productive economic and social development in Colombia and hence more comprehensive drug curtailment through national law enforcement.",

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. today I rise in support of the McGovern. McCollum and Moore Amendment to the FY06 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that will reduce counternarcotics and military funding to Colombia by $100 million. The U.S./Colombia campaign against drugs and terrorism is not working. Not only have efforts to reduce the production of cocaine in Colombia not been effective. funds from the program that should have been used to fight terrorism are instead being used by paramilitary groups to commit human rights abuses. The U.S. has invested billions of dollars into Plan Colombia and successive programs since passing the FY 2000 budget. The Bush administration wants to continue this misguided policy with a request for $734 million in the FY06 Foreign Operations Appropriations request tor the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. One of the main objectives of Plan Colombia has been to prevent the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. At the center of this effort has been the aerial spraying of herbicides on Colombias coca crops. But U.S. and UN reporls confirm that aerial spraying has not produced any appreciable reduction in coca production. In fact. cocaine production in Colombia may even have increased. According to the UN. 62 percent of Colombian coca fields detected in 2004 were new! The lack ot any appreciable reduction in production combined with an increase in production in countries such as Bolivia and Peru has actually led to an increase of supply on the global market and a decrease in the cost of cocaine in the United States. Mr. Chairman. I am also troubled by reports in the news that recently the Colombian Congress. while approving a law governing the disarmament o its countrys death squads. at the same time. granted generous concessions to paramilitary commanders accused of human rights abuses. I am concerned that U.S. assistance is being used by Colombian security forces that operate in conjunction with paramilitary forces targeting social leaders with threats. disappearance. and execution. The U.S. should not provide assistance to governments that refuse to hold perpetrators accountable for human rights abuses. Mr. Chairman. until I am convinced that the funds to Colombia are fixing the problem instead of making it worse. I cannot support full funding for aid to Colombia. That is why I support the McGovern.

Mr. Chairman. the Foreign Operations appropriations bill is one of the best vehicles Congress has to address an issue of paramount importance. the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. This bill contains important Middle East provisions. but I believe we could have done better in our efforts to bring peace to these two longsuffering peoples. I support our $2.3 billion package for Israel. Maintaining Israels military superiority in the region is a prerequisite for any peace agreement. and I am pleased that the bill fulfills the Presidents request for an additional $150 million for the Palestinians. The President believes. as do I. that it is imperative to deliver U.S. assistance quickly to improve the Palestinians quality of life and empower their democratically elected leadership. But 1 had hoped. Mr. Chairman. that the Committee on Appropriations could have seized this historic opportunity and provided direct funding to the Palestinian Authority. Instead. this bill prohibits direct funding and places excessive conditions and limitations on the aid package. Of course. we must ensure transparency and accountability.

We should join with President Bush in strengthening President Abbas. especially in the face of a strong challenge from Hamas in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

It is to return cop killers back to the United States to stand trial in our country. the same country in which they committed their unthinkable crime. The problem was brought to my attention last month after Denver Police Detective Donnie Young was allegedly executed by Raul GomezGarcia. After killing Detective Young and shooting and wounding his partner. GomezGarcia fled to Mexico. where he was tracked down and arrested weeks later. The Mexican Government now refuses to extradite him back to the U.S. if there is any chance he could spend life in prison without parole. Detective Youngs widow and his two children now face the further tragedy of either partial justice or no justice at all being served to her husbands killer. In another case. in 2002. a convicted felon who had been deported three times allegedly shot and killed a Los Angeles County sheriff following a routine traffic stop before fleeing to Mexico. where he remains today. essentially escaping justice. The U.S. should not be forced to plea bargain with other countries in order to try criminals. especially cop killers. in our own courts. As a good neighbor. Mexico should live up to their end of our extradition treaty. Killing a police officer is one of the most egregious crimes. and we should have the right to seek justice for the families of the slain officers.

There is a growing problem in this Nation where criminals will commit violent crimes. including murdering law enforcement officers. and flee to nations that refuse to extradite to the United States those criminals because of our tough sentencing laws. including mandatory minimum sentences. This amendment is simple: it will not allow taxpayer funds to go to nations that refuse to stand with us against the vile act of murdering law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers across this country are bravely fighting crime. responding to emergencies. and protecting our rights. We have an opportunity to stand up for them with this amendment here today. When countries do not extradite their criminals. it actually creates a twisted incentive to be even more violent in their crimes. The more violent the crime. the tougher the sentence here in the United States. and the tougher the sentence. the less likely they are to be subject to extradition. The BeauprezMcHenry amendment will apply the pressure that usually gets the best results. and that is withholding tax dollars to those countries.

I have had the privilege over the last 10 years now of serving as chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary meeting. I can remember when I first started attending 20 years ago. extradition was the issue that we are always talking about. We do not talk about that very much anymore. and the reason is very simple. The first 14 years of the Extradition Treaty with Mexico. from 1980 to 1994. a total of 14 years. Mexico extradited eight. a total of eight fugitives to the United States. Between 1996 and 2000. Mexico extradited an annual average of 13 fugitives each year to the United States. Mexico has extradited more fugitives everyj year between 1996 and 2000 than in the first 15 years of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty combined. In 2004 they extradited a record 34 fugitives to the U.S.. up from the record numbers of 17 in 2001. a record number of 25 in 2002. and 31 in 2003. These include 19 Mexican nationals and 17 narcotics defendants. So I think there is no question that Mexico is doing what they can do. Can there be more done? Can they do better? Do we have areas of disagreement? Yes. we do. and one of these issues is the matter of the length of term for which a person may be sentenced to prison. We are working with them on that.

It is consistent with protecting the health of pregnant women and children. among the most vulnerable members of our society. The fears about the impacts of a strong mercury rule on coal and natural gas are unfounded. I am not aware of credible evidence that shows that powerplants will switch from coal to natural gas in order to comply with a more stringent mercury rule. The Energy Information Administration tried to say that fuel switching will occur. But listen to some of the assumptions they adopted to reach that conclusion. First. they had to assume that natural gas prices would fall to $3.50 per thousand cubic feet 5 years from now in order to show that it would make economic sense for powerplants to switch from coal to natural gas. Let me tell you how much natural gas cost last week: $12. The week before Katrina hit. it was $9.50. I dont think there is any way natural gas prices are going to be $3.50 5 years from now. I hope I am wrong. but the odds are I am not. Second. the Energy Information Administration had to assume that technology to control mercury does not exist. It does exist. There are already powerplants in the Northeast that have been reducing their mercury pollution by more than 80 percent for the last 5 years. Last month. Coloradobased ADAEnvironmental Solutions was awarded another contract to install new mercury control technologies on two new powerplants being built in the Midwest. The technology has been developed.

The mercury rule is a rule that only an administration bought and paid for by big energy could love. Its a shameful rollback of the Clean Air Act to allow owners of fossil fuel power plants to avoid the expense of installing new technology to reduce dangerous emissions. Mercury is an extremely dangerous neurotoxin that accumulates in the environment. It is particularly harmful to pregnant women. and puts the fetus at risk of serious developmental disorders. The Centers for Disease Control has reported that 630.000 of the 4 million infants born in the United States each year16 percentare at risk for mercuryrelated brain damage. In the Northeast. this figure translates into over such 84.000 newborns per year. Last week. the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Center for Childrens Health and the Environment reported that the cost to the Nation of the impact of mercury on childrens brain development is $2 billion a year. These newborns are being poisoned by the mercury which coalfired power plants spew into the air and eventually pollutes the water. and enters the food chain. Mercury advisories now apply to nearly a third of the area of Americas lakes and 22 percent of the length of our rivers. Incredible as it seems. however.

I believe mercury pollution is a real problem. particularly for vulnerable populations. including children. Given these concerns. I support efforts to reduce mercury emissions from coalfired power plants. which account for 42 percent of U.S. emissions. This is In line with my support for many years for clean coal technologies. which will allow our Nation to utilize our most abundant natural resource in a cleaner. more efficient manner. Debate on this resolution has revolved around two regulatory approachesa maximum available control technology. MACT. rule or a capandtrade rule. I suggest that there is a third option that combines elements of both. A MACT system is enormously expensive on its own. costing up to $358 billion according to the Energy Information Administration. compared to $2 billion estimated by EPA for a capandtrade approach. However. a capandtradeonly system is inadequate on reducing pollution levels around specific plants. referred to as \"hot spots.\" The LeahyCollins resolution would tie EPAs hands by restricting it to a MACTonly approach. Under a third option. EPA could set a national emissions level. based on the best available science to protect public health and the environment. and implement a capandtrade system to meet this goal with the addition of measures to take care of hot spots. EPA could require reductions at specific plants. To this end.

IQ loss. mental retardation. and continues to poison children and pregnant women. Onesixth of pregnant women are affected. That is not cap and trade. This idea that we are only talking about I percent. of course. is not the case. Forty percent of the mercury comes from the United States. We are talking about the 40 percent that is affecting our rivers. our streams. our children. Do we simply ignore the proliferation of warnings all over the country that fish caught in our streams and lakes and rivers are unsafe to eat? Do we allow this rule to move forward when it has been harshly criticized by the Bush administrations own EPA inspector general? When the Government Accountability Office has said there are major shortcomings in the analysis? Or do we uphold the bipartisan work that produced the Clean Air Act that protects the health of pregnant women and children and try and clean this up now? Every one of us will give speeches about how family friendly we are. We are talking about children. We are talking about pregnant women. I cant think of anything more family friendly than to remove this threat of mercury from them. If we vote this down. we are telling a whole generation of women and children their health is less important than energy company profits. We are going to tell them. rather than go to the scientists. rather than go with what the Bush administrations own inspector general said. instead we will take the regulations that were written. in many parts. verbatim by the industry. What are we going to say to the families who live in the hotspots of today or tomorrow? This rule is a danger to Americas women and children. It is time to do it over and do it right. I hope my colleagues will support the resolution. This is not a moot point. If we pass this resolution. maybe it will be enough of a signal to have people go back and do what the inspector general of the EPA said. what the Government Accountability Office has said. and actually do it right. actually follow their own procedures.

I only have to ask the question. if you are not able to use coalfired plants. what are you going to switch to? Is it going to be windmills? There would be fuel switching. and it would have a devastating effect in terms of the problems that already exist in terms of the cost of natural gas. The Senator from Vermont is passionate on this subject. and I dont want to be critical. But in talking about hotspots. that is the same thing that they said about acid rainthere are going to be hotspots--and it didnt happen. Thirdly. the point that was brought up on being family friendly. When you look at the fact that they say studies show that not a single woman or child has a blood mercury level approaching the level at which even the smallest affect was observed in any study. where is the real problem there? If you want to be family friendly. lets be a little concerned about the cost of fertilizer. about the cost of heating our homes when winter comes. This is an exercise in futility. The President has already announced if this thing should passthey will feel good and rejoicehe will veto it. and you cant override a veto. It is a done deal. The current rule regulates mercury for the first time. The current rules cost is $2 billion. as opposed to $358 billion. a huge difference. A vote for this rule is a vote to drive the remaining chemical plants overseas. A vote for this rule is going to be a vote to increase the cost of fertilizer for every farmer in America. The cap and trade worked on acid rain. and it will work accurately now. All the talk about U.S. powerplants. They only contribute 1 percent of the mercury that is in the system now globally.

The amendment deals with trade. and because this appropriations bill deals with funding for the Department of Commerce and also the U.S. Trade Representative. this is the right place to propose that amendment. Let me begin by talking for a moment about what is happening in trade. As you know. we have the largest trade deficit in the history of our country by far. It continues to grow and grow and grow and grow. This trade deficit is dangerous. It is irresponsible for us to continue to run these kinds of trade deficits. Yet nearly every day in this country. 7 days a week. all year long. we are importing about $2 billion more than we are exporting. We are importing a substantial amount of productyes. energy and food but shirts and shoes and trinkets and trousersfrom every part of the world. and the fact is we are exporting American jobs. Let me describe a couple of those jobs. and then I am going to describe what my amendment does. A young woman named Natasha Humphries did what we are supposed to do in this country. She did everything American workers are supposed to do to compete in this global economy. She got a degree from Stanford University in 1996. She went to work for Apple Computer.

After 9/11. we worked in a bipartisan fashion and created legislation that was unique.

So we know how to effectively address issues of concern. We have done that in the past. We relied then on committees to produce legislation through the regular process. I believe that is what I heard the majority leader say. We are willing to do that. But in following through on that. we have to be able to have some time on the floor to debate and vote on those issues. That is what we need to do.

So lets empower every one of our chairmen and ranking members to sit down together and see what the committees can produce to address the needs of the survivors in the communities hit by this catastrophe. And then lets commit to give them the floor time to deal with their legislation. We badly need to do that. Yes. we have had two emergency supplemental appropriations bills for more than $60 billion. but a lot of that money cannot go to the people who need it because it is illegal.

The program cannot continue to grow at its current rate and meet the needs of those that its covers. Oftentimes health care policy is a study in crisis management.

Some think that the Bureau of Industry and Security is actually too weak. and I may be in that category. American industry is being hampered in the international marketplace by the long processing time of export license applications. This amendment would roll back the progress that we have made in reducing the average processing time from 44 days to 32 days since 2003. With additional money we could probably get that down. The trade deficit. the trade imbalance. this would really create a greater problem to deal with that. Quite frankly. I do not think this administration has done enough to deal with the trade deficit. the trade imbalance.

I simply rise neither to speak for nor against this amendment. but simply to make an observation about it. The situation that the gentleman from Ohio finds himself in on this issue is a very difficult one. because he is trying to balance between two legitimate claims on the Federal Treasury. We have seen. as was observed in the Washington Post article this morning. a parade of Members come down to the floor yesterday and today trying to wiggle out from the consequences of the budget resolution which was imposed on the entire House by the passage of that resolution. Now. I do not like to be in that position. I have a little less sympathy for the gentleman from Ohio than I do for myself on this issue. because he voted for the budget resolution and I did not. But that being said. there is no right position on an amendment like this. This issue simply demonstrates that when the money that you provide for education is inadequate. when it is inadequate to the needs of the Nation. then we are going to be eating each others favorite programs. then you are going to have all kinds of interest groups in this country chewing on each other and each trying to get out from under at the expense of everybody else. So I can actually understand why the gentleman opposes this amendment. because he needs some flexibility in conference to deal with some of the legitimate concerns that Members have. I love the program the gentleman from Georgia is trying to add money to. I had a son in the gifted and talented program. He was a National Merit scholar. Yet I would have a great deal of difficulty voting to add money for that program at the expense of programs that went to help less gifted and less advantaged children in this society.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. after having their wages frozen since 1997. it is time to give a long overdue raise to millions of Americans who work hard but are paid only $5.15 per hour. The Federal minimum wage is the lowest it has been. adjusted for inflation. in more than 50 years. Nine years have passed since the last increase and yet education. energy and healthcare costs have skyrocketed. No one can house. feed. and educate a household by earning the current Federal minimum wage. Luckily in Oregon. voters passed a statewide initiative in 2002 which raises our own minimum wage that provides an automatic inflation adjustment. With the increase. we have seen significant benefits for our workforce without any ill effects for our economy. Instead of doomsayer predictions of job losses. Oregon has experienced the 8th fastest job growth amongst states since the legislation was enacted. After months of stalling. the Republican leadership was finally forced to allow a vote. Unfortunately it was not a simple vote on minimum wage. but a loaded bill with costly and unnecessary provisions. This bill provides permanent estate tax relief for the wealthy by increasing estate and gift tax exemptions and lowering tax rates. Even worse. the intent to raise the existing minimum wage is actually decreasing the wages of some workers due to the tip credit provision. This provision provides that tips must be counted towards the minimum wage. In Oregon restaurant workers are paid $7.50 per hour and yet this legislation would reduce their wage to only $5.15 per hour. The bill is so poorly drafted that one interpretation would potentially double the minimum wage for select workers. while the other would show a decrease in the same jobs. This bill should be firmly rejected. The minimum wage needs to be increased by crafting a simple and clear solution that protects states with existing legislation. Under no circumstance should the Federal government undercut what Oregon voters have already established.",

Some argue that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment and prices. This is true only if the minimum wage is set too high or phased in too quickly. If done properly. there should be little to no impact on employment or prices. I am also pleased we are lowering the estate tax. but adopting a far more rational approach than full repeal. Under this legislation. small business owners will be able to know their businesses can be left with their families when they pass on because of a significantly reduced tax rate. Wealthy individuals would still pay something. between 15 and 30 percent on their estates. but not the 46 percent in existing law. Because estate and gift taxes has a harmful impact on small businessesmany of which are forced to liquidate assets simply to pay estate taxes which fluctuates in crazy fashion. from 46 percent this year. to 0 percent in 2010 and way back up to 55 percent 2011we must intervene and provide relief.

It is shameful that millions of Americans are suffering the economic injustice of working a fulltime job and eaming a wage that leaves them below the poverty line. It is unconscionable that we stand here tonight debating provisions on the estate tax and the extension of expiring tax provisions. These provisions only serve as a political ploy to kill any increase to the minimum wage. Workingclass Americans have waited too long. close to a decade in fact. for an increase in the minimum wage. This has been the second longest period without a pay raise since the Federal minimum wage law was first enacted in 1938. Over this last decade while the minimum wage has remained stagnant. the cost of basic necessities such as energy and healthcare have skyrocketedmeaning that the minimum wage is no longer a livable wage. Today a minimum wage eamer has to work a day and a half just to pay for a full tank of gas. That is simply shameful. As Americans we have always been told that if you have a job. and you work hard. you will have a secure future in our Nation. Yet. millions of Americans who do have jobs and who do work hard everyday have joined the ranks of the \"working poor.\" In fact. the number of fulltime yearround workers who are poor has more than doubled since the late 1970s. Let there be no doubt. a vote to increase the minimum wage to $7.25/hour is a vote to alleviate poverty in America. and it is a vote to help eliminate the term \"working poor\" from our reality. Members of this body should be allowed a straight upordown vote on legislation to raise the minimum wage to a true livable wage of $7.25/hour over the next 2 years. But instead the Republican leadership here in the House of Representatives has chosen to play dirty politics and attach poison pill provisions to this legislation with the implicit expeclation of killing a real minimum wage increase. It is quite simply a slap in the face for workingclass Americans.",

The bill is full of poison pillstax breaks for the wealthy and handouts for special interests. This is nothing more than a backdoor attempt to put money in the pockets of the wealthiest among us. Were playing politics and decent hardworking Americans are the ones paying the price. The reality is that there are millions of workers trying to support their families on $5.15 per hour. Each day millions of minimum wage workers are forced to choose between food. shelter. health care or clothing. No American who works hard for a living should have to make those types of choices. Mr. Speaker. it is time for a new direction that truly reflects our core American values. These hardworking Americans deserve an upordown vote on a clean minimum wage bill.",

They have watched as the purchasing power of their paycheck has crumbled. giving way to inflation. Many are working families. struggling to make ends meet. yet for 9 years Congress has ignored them and refused to pass a clean. simple increase in the minimum wage. Nearly 44 percent of minimum wage workers work full time. nearly twothirds of whom are women. Even working full time. they often remain below the poverty line. They are unable to buy their own home. cannot afford health insurance for themselves and their children. and often take a second job just to pay the bills. Mr. Speaker it is time to increase the Federal minimum wage. I strongly support implementing a 2year plan that would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 an hour. However. I also strongly support passing such legislation cleanly. without attachments of tax cuts. without attachment of controversial language or convoluted provisions. We must demonstrate that we support those American families. those who are wondering why they are working 50hour work weeks yet cannot seem to make ends meet.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of providing American workers a living wage with which to support and improve their families livelihoods. Those in America who receive the minimum wage for their labors are particularly vulnerable to experiencing greater financial pressures and a lower overall quality of life. The national minimum wage has not been increased in 9 years and has not kept pace with household expenses. Raising the minimum wage will help lift many families on Guam out of poverty. An increase in the Federal minimum wage is long overdue. as evidenced by the recent actions taken by the Guam Legislature and the Governor to increase the local minimum wage. Living wages help families ensure that their children receive proper nutrition. quality education. and good health care. These are essential to ensuring that children have happy. productive and healthy childhoods. Living wages earned by American workers also help American families realize important financial goals as well as improving. longterm financial wellbeing. Eliminating highinterest debt. achieving home ownership. and investing now for a childs future higher education costs and a parents retirement. for instance. are goals more easily realized by workers who eam a living wage. Americans have proven to be productive. innovative. and resourceful workers. Their wages should reflect this reality. A workers wage represents his or her worth to an employer. But it also represents much more. Wages and salaries are the foundations upon which families are begun. Living wages and salaries provide the financial security under which those families can grow. A workers wage or salary helps ensure his or her financial future. Receiving a living wage is well deserved by American workers.",

In fact. if the minimum wage had just kept up with inflation since 1968. it would have been $8.88 in 2005. That is still. quite frankly. a pittance for what people need to live. But this increase is in jeopardy by a cynical. political ploy on the part of the House Republican leadership. Mr. Speaker. this sham minimum wage legislation contains \"poison pills.\" Namely. the incorporation of the estate tax cut and further tax cut extensions into the minimum wage bill. Even worse. under this sham Republican legislation 1.8 million workers will have to wait until June 2009 before the minimum wage reaches $7.25.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. the Gasoline for Americas Security Act has a nice name. but it does little to help Missouris farmers and rural commuters who are experiencing record high energy costs. Motorists in Missouri and across the Nation are paying a premium for gasoline and diesel fuel. especially in the wake of severe weather in the Gulf of Mexico. Missouris Fourth Congressional District is primarily rural. and residents rely heavily on transportation in going about their daily lives. This is especially true for farmers who are also facing additional costs for natural gas. propane. fertilizer. and pesticides. As energy expenses have skyrocketed over the past few weeks. many Missourians have expressed concern and skepticism about high prices and simultaneous reports of record oil industry profits. In order to make sure consumers are being treated fairiy. the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department should be given explicit authority to investigate collusion and price gouging within the oil industry. Penalties must have teeth and must be severe. And. importantly. the government must be guaranteed broader authority to look into potentially illegal behavior within other energy sectors. at least during times of national emergency. The bill being considered by the House today contains scant assistance for the rural Americans I am privileged to represent. It will not lower their energy prices and it puts in place weak price gouging standards. It also does little to promote additional refining capacity. while gutting important environmental safeguards and creating additional corporate tax breaks. Waiving environmental protections and offering federal tax breaks to oil companies will not entice them to build new oil refineries. While more refineries would certainly help produce more gasoline. oil companies have had the opportunity and financial capability for years to increase their refining capacity.

Just last week. I received a letter from a constituent of mine. Paul Perry of Dunn. North Carolina. a small businessman struggling to make ends meet. He wrote: \"We just broke ground on a new brick plant and should be in operation by August of 2006. I just hope gas prices dont break us before we get the new plant in production.\" The American people desperately need effective new energy policies. but H.R. 3893 is simply more of the same failed giveaways to Big Oil. The bill on the floor today is nothing more than a giveaway to big oil companies. and on top of this. it contains environmental rollbacks that the Administration has been unsuccessfully pursuing for years for gas and coal fired power plants. These provisions would relax existing pollution controls on thousands of industrial facilities across the country in what one energy industry official even called the most blatant attack on state and local environmental authority that hes ever seen. This legislation would throw out provisions my state of North Carolina implemented when we passed our own clean smokestacks legislation. This legislation would cap penalties levied against big oil companies and refineries caught price gouging to meager amounts at a time when they are recording record profits. Finally. this bill would give tax breaks to those 51. Pt. 17 22687 same oil companies at a time of record budget deficits. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. and to support the substitute that provides real provisions to crack down on price gouging. The substitute bill provides real help to the American people. It punishes price gougers. not just the gas stations but the refineries. the wholesalers. and any of the big oil companies if they are caught taking advantage of the American people. The substitute also creates a strategic refining capacity for the country in times of a national emergency. without jeopardizing the environmental safeguards put in place by the Congress to protect our air. water. land. and public health.

H.R. 3893 would delay existing smog cleanup deadlines in cities with some of the most persistent smog problemsa provision that would likely hurt minority and lowincome areas the worst. In addition. this legislation is not only harmful to the environment but it also creates a fiscally irresponsible \"Standby Refinery Support Account.\" which would compensate corporations if their refinery construction is delayed by State or local laws or litigations. At a time when some refineries are turning record profits. taxpayers should not be paying for the legal costs of refineries. when they are facing legitimate challenges to their evasion of State. local. or Federal regulations. Instead. I supported a substitute amendment offered by Representative Bart Stupak. which would: Create a strategic refinery reserve based upon the strategic petroleum reserve. allow the President to declare a \"Federal energy emergency\". and prohibit gasoline price gouging in times of such emergencies. Under this substitute amendment. the Department of Energy. DOE. would operate a strategic refinery reserve from either constructing new refineries or opening closed refineries to create this reserve. which would have a capacity of 5 percent of the daily U.S. demand for gasoline. home heating oil. and other refined petroleum products. I believe this is an important proposal. which would help address our strained refining capacity in times of emergency. In addition. the substitute amendment would provide explicit authority for the FTC to define price gouging for the first time. and would provide them with the authority to prosecute any entity in the chain of gasoline production. including refineries and not just retailers. for engaging in price gouging. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita further highlighted the instability of energy prices and the fragility of our Nations energy infrastructure. particularly our domestic refining capacity. Prior to Hurricane Katrina. our domestic refining industry was already operating at near capacity. with 176 refineries closing in the U.S. over the past 25 years.

We can all agree there were some good provisions in the first energy bill. but Katrina exposed its shortcomings. as well as vulnerabilities that still exist in the energy market. We can also agree that the hurricane made it harder to meet the challenge of delivering relief to families struggling to pay their energy bills and that a rash of price gouging compounded this problem. Our substitute takes direct aim at these challenges by creating a strong deterrent to price gouging that keeps gas prices stable. The underlying bill sets an $11.000 fine for price gouging. That may sound like a lot to the average middle class family. but it is not much to the ExxonMobils of this world who earn record profits.

I want to address a serious problem with the underlying bill. and that is that it relies exclusively on the Federal Trade Commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedy in the bill. I think we should all remember this is the same FTC that said. we do not have any authority to investigate price gouging in this area. we do not need any authority in this area. Everything is just fine. thank you very much: and then. when pressed further. said we do not want any authority in this area because we will just make a bad situation worse. Well. Mr. Speaker. relying on a sorry bunch of people that do not know their job. do not care about their job. and do not believe in their job is like going hunting and having to tote the dog. Our substitute corrects this problem by giving the States attorneys general the same authority to enforce the price gouging remedies that we give the FTC. The attorneys general of our States are elected by our constituents. they know the conditions in their States better than we do. they have the resources and the discretion under the substitute to decide whether or not It is in the best interest of their constituents. our constituents. for them to act when we do not. This is Federalism at its best. I urge everybody to support the substitute for this reason. if none other. Any attorney general doing something is better than the FTC doing nothing.",

Mr. Speaker. the issue is about refining capacity and the ability for us to convert crude oil into gasoline and other products. The record is pretty clear on both sides that we have not built a new refinery since 1976. In 1981. we had 324 refineries in production. Today. we have 148. We refine about 17 million barrels of gasoline a day. and we use about 21 million. We are importing gasoline. and. obviously. one of the choke points in the supply system is the ability to convert crude oil into gasoline. What this bill does. and I am speaking against the substitute and in favor of the underlying bill. is that it removes a regulatory burden that many folks who want to build a refinery have to submit themselves to. It takes about 3 years to build a refinery. exclusive of the permitting process. Major investments are needed in order to construct a refinery. and businesses simply are not willing to put those dollars at risk subject to a regulatory approval permitting scene that is disjointed at best. Under the bill. we allow the Governor to designate a particular site subject to these provisions. We put the DOE in charge of shepherding the permitting process. not making the decisions on behalf of the State and the Federal regulators. but simply encouraging them to get it done on a timely basis. Most businesses can deal with an answer. but a maybe or a give me more information or a delay is what is killing us. So I am standing in favor of the original bill. the managers amendment and speaking against the Stupak substitute.",

The Illinois Technology Transition Centers objective is to stimulate enterprise growth by helping technology companies realize their commercial potential. The center offers entrepreneurial services. technology transition support. and commercialization support. Again. this is a defense bill. yet we are offering this funding. I support the technology center. I encourage growth in it. I think all of us do. It is a great source of entrepreneurship and innovation. The United States has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in the world. Technological progress is responsible for onehalf of the growth of the U.S. economy. Competition is a driving force in this innovation. We all know that free markets flourish when there is less government involvement. I am all for seeing the technology sector in Illinois grow. just as I do hope that it grows in Arizona or any other State. However. in this defense bill the American taxpayers are being asked to pay for support services for the private sector. I dont think that that is appropriate in a defense bill. Our troops are fighting insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. We ought to be spending money in the defense bill on equipment. on helmets. on body armor. on other things. rather than subsidizing the technological center in one particular State. I should note I believe the Illinois Technology Transition Center was established by a contract with the Department of the Navy. the Office of Naval Research. in 2005.

I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona to strike the funding for the Northwest Manufacturing Initiative. The Northwest Manufacturing Initiative encompasses Oregon and southwest Washington. The initiative is organized as a regional coalition. and its purpose is to make the Northwest regions diverse manufacturing sector a stronger contributor to the Nations defense and national security. The initiative seeks to provide to the Defense Department a coordinated. regional resource for assessing products and services being offered by the private sector that meets our Nations future defense needs. A key goal of the initiative is to increase the contribution of the Northwest coast to the Nations industrial preparedness and security. A focus of this project is to assist small and mediumsized manufacturers to become providers of products to defense contractors. My colleague talked about HemCon. he talked about another company. Danner Boots. I could name several companies. There is another company. Hydration. which allows you with a membrane to fill water into this CamelBak and give you clean drinking water from the filthiest water you can find. Those are the kind of companies. These are small. innovative companies. This is where we get our innovation. The Oregon Manufacturing Initiative is a key component of the Oregon business plan and economic development plans in communities across Oregon and southwest Washington. Local. regional and State funding has been used to plan and develop the initiative. As manufacturing has declined in many parts of the Nation. it has become more urgent that small to mediumsized companies are mobilized to provide the necessary goods demanded by a modern military and the Nations security. Through the Northwest Manufacturing Initiative. the Defense Department will have a onestop resource when it needs information on what companies are providing to meet defense needs or when it seeks critical manufacturing research and development. The Northwest Manufacturing Initiative is a regional model designed to create efficiencies and cost savings. While I appreciate the intentions of the gentleman from Arizona.

Mr. Chairman. the Lewis Center has hosted more than 100.000 students. teachers. and parents participating in educational activities. The centers Web site contains a wish list for funding for three log cabins for third graders. an amphitheater. a schoolhouse shed. a large water wheel for panning gold during the gold rush educational fourth grade outreach program. and similar activities to that. Mr. Chairman. these are undoubtedly worthy educational tools. My question is this: Why are Federal tax dollars intended for our national defense being used to fund this type of institution? It seems that corporate sponsors of the center abound. including corporations like JPL. Allied Signal. Boeing. Verizon. Lucent Technologies. Lomac Information System. Mitsubishi. RFG. Rockwell Rocketdyne Aerospace. Surely these donations can keep the center in good stead. The center has already received $3 million in earmarked funds in fiscal year 2004 and an additional $2.5 million in 2005. It looks as if the center is back for more in this bill to the tune of $4 million. The description of the earmark in this bill provides no detail on how the $4 million is to be spent on the Lewis Center. If there is a defense angle for this earmark. I am simply not seeing it. Again. it seems as if we are debating the LaborHHS bill at this point or some other education bill and not the defense bill.

He and I have been discussing it for several days. I think it is difficult to proceed without knowing what the administrations plans are. As the Senator from Iowa correctly notes. action has to be taken. When the administration decides on a plan and picks a figure. there is going to have to be congressional action. and we are nearing the end of this session. A supplemental or an emergency appropriations bill is always difficult to structure. So there are sound reasons to take a look at it now and make some judgment. We have been in touch with the White House on a number of occasions to try to find out what the position is of the administration. So far they are unprepared to give us an answer. We are working to see if it is possible to structure an appropriation. subject to the Secretarys discretion. and how it will be in consultation and would be an emergency. There is no doubt there ought to be planning now for this emergency. What the proper figure is I dont know. That is a figure that would be more within the scope of understanding. knowledge. and projection of the administration. and the experts at CDC and NIH. I wanted to make those few comments. We are going to carry this over until tomorrow. I know the administration will be aware of what is happening on the floor today. and perhaps that will motivate them or enable them to come forward to help us grapple with this issue and find some realistic and practical solution at this time.",

That is absolutely necessary as we approach the winter with rising fuel prices. rising natural gas prices. Our amendment will help all States. I want to make it very clear all of our funding goes into the State block grant program. so no State will be disadvantaged. My colleague from New Hampshire has introduced a complementary amendment that does not provide. in my view. sufficient funding. At his level of funding. States such as Minnesota. Washington. and Wisconsin will receive no new money. I think that is unfortunate because those States and the citizens of those States deserve the kind of support that will be necessary this winter. Fiftythree Senators have already joined us to support the increase in LIHEAP spending to the $5.1 billion total mark. I hope they will continue to support us. There is a second storm surge coming from Katrina. and that is rising energy prices that have overwhelmed vulnerable families throughout this country. In addition. my colleague from New Hampshire is proposing to fund this with an acrosstheboard cut. That acrosstheboard cut will disappear in conference. As Chairman SPECTER has pointed out. this bill is bare bones. When the conferees arrive and look at the funding for Head Start and look at funding for other critical programs. I do not think they are going to allow this supposed increase in LIHEAP funding. Also. we are paying for this LIHEAP Increase by taking away valuable programs: 37.000 students in title I will be denied services because of these cuts. We are going to reduce IDEA spending. We are going to reduce Head Start spending. We are essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. taking from some who need to give to others who need. That is not fair.

Senators on that side of the aisle say they want to increase funding for LIHEAP and other things. but they want to take it out of other programs. These amendments are phony. These acrosstheboard cuts will never get passed into law. My good friend from New Hampshire says: Well. it is just 1 percent or just 2 percent or whatever it might be. Lets take a look at what the Senator from New Hampshires cuts really mean. He said it will not affect anybody. Well. it is a .98percent cut. That does not sound like much. but in terms of No Child Left Behind. it means that 39.400 kids will not be served by title I. I guess they do not count. It means that we will cut special education by $105 million. It means that 9.300 Head Start kids will not get Head Start programs. That is why this amendment is phony. That is why we have to adopt the Reed amendment. Again. the Senator from New Hampshire always said he wanted to increase funding for special education. Right now the Federal Government is paying 18.6 percent of the excess costs of special education. We are supposed to go to 40 percent. Under Senator GREGGs amendment. the share will drop to 17.8 percent. We will go in the wrong direction. So we will never reach the goal of full funding for special education if we adopt the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. So do not be fooled by these acrosstheboard cuts. It hurts people. It hurts poor kids. It hurts special education. And it hurts title I kids. We do not want to hurt them in order to give money for lowincome elderly so they can buy heating oil and pay their gas bills this winter. That is unfair. It is unconscionable.

American policies should promote global trade that is both fair and free. Trade agreements that meet this standard improve the quality of life for American families by expanding export markets for our products while also providing economic opportunity. human dignity and political stability for workers around the world. Unfortunately. the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement is another step towards a lowestcommondenominator global economy where sinking labor and environmental standards undermine American competitiveness and global security. The intellectual property provisions of the agreement will hinder the spread of lower priced generic drugs. which could improve public health and stabilize populations in Oman. The agreements only enforceable labor protection is a requirement that Oman enforce its own labor laws. even though the countrys laws fail to comply with basic international labor standards in ten specific areas. Rather than requiring improvements in Omans labor law. H.R. 5684. accepts unenforceable promises from Omans government. Even the most basic labor safeguards in this agreement have been crippled: the Bush Administration subverted the will of Congress and stripped out a provision inserted by the Senate Finance Committee stipulating that goods made in Oman with forced labor may not benefit from the trade agreement. Global trade is the keystone of Americas economic success. Expanding trade promotes economic growth in our country and the quest for higher living standards and opportunity abroad. And. as with foreign policy. Americas trade policy is an expression of our values and a tool to advance our global vision. Unfortunately. this Oman Free Trade Agreement contradicts Americas muchtouted commitment to foster global democracy and freedom. If America is to find success in our efforts to spread democracy. serious commitments to the conditions that support democracy: economic stability. environmental sustainability and human dignity.

Most of America thinks that the rides at these parks are subject to oversight by the Nations top consumer safety watchdogthe Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). But this is not true.

This was the wisdom behind the words of President John Kennedy. who reminded us that \"tolerance implies no lack of commitment to ones own beliefs. Rather it condemns the oppression or persecution of others.\" I introduce this Resolution today as a reminder that we must still strive to condemn bigotry and religious intolerance. and recognize that holy books of every religion should be treated with dignity and respect. Our dedication to this struggle has never been more important than it is today. with recent events both at home and abroad. We can begin to fulfill this obligation with a renewed effort to continued education and the dispelling of stereotypes. For example. much of the public is not aware that the word Islam comes from the Arabic root word meaning \"peace\" and \"submission.\" Terrorism cannot be justified under any valid interpretation of the Islamic faith. There are an estimated 7 million Muslims in America. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 8 from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. The holy book of Islam. the Quran. is recited by Muslims during prayer. From the Quran. Muslims learn valuable lessons about peace. humanity and spirituality. This Resolution recognizes that believers of all religions. including the faiths of Christianity. Judaism and Islam. should be treated with respect and dignity. The mistreatment of prisoners and disrespect toward the holy book of any religion is unacceptable and against civilized humanity. I am concerned as anyone that our nation would disparage the Ouran or the Muslim religion. This Resolution therefore makes it clear that it is not the official policy of the U.S. government to disparage the Quran. Islam or any other faith. I hope this Resolution will help us recognize that we need to embrace the Muslim people and tolerance if we are truly interested in supporting democracy around the world.",

Act 1647 (the Terrorism Prevention in Hazardous Materials Transportation Temporary Act of 2005). which calls for the rerouting of hazardous materials around Washington. DC. While rerouting hazardous materials from the Capitol area of Washington. DC sounds wellintentioned. it only shifts the risk of that transportation to other neighborhoods and other modes of transportation. The additional switching of these cars will add to the congestion in the yards. and back up traffic on CSXT main lines. potentially affecting their entire network. including Amtrak. VRE. and MARC. It also means that chemical containers could be sitting for hours. if not days. in rail yards waiting to be moved. Longer transit times and distances. increased car handlings and dwell times are factors that tend to increase the inherent risk of transporting hazardous materials. This would also add significant cost to the shippers. and potentially disrupt the flow of commerce for those customers like water treatment plants. pharmaceutical companies. gas stations. etc. The Federal Government has always had the ultimate authority over interstate commerce. The transportation of hazardous materials is governed by Federal regulations as proscribed under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. which gives the authority to DOT. And it is important to note that the railroads are governed by the common carrier duty. which means we must carry what is legally tendered to them by law. Finally. the Department of Justice. the National Industrial Transportation League. the American Trucking Associations. the United Transportation Union.

Rene Antonio Le6n Rodriguez regarding police brutality against Salvadoran government officials: DEAR AMBASSADOR LEON: It has just been brought to our attention that Salvadoran diputados Dr. Salvador Arias and Zoila Quijada were victims of police brutality yesterday while defending protesters of the Social Security Doctors Union (SIMETRISSS). The protesters were members of the doctors union who were upset about the unjust decision to deport Dr. Pedro Bachon Rodriguez. an Ecuadorian doctor and adviser to the doctors union who has been a legal resident of El Salvador for the past 8 years. Diputado Arias and Quijada stepped in to mediate between the doctors union and the police an to defend the protesters. and the police responded by beating them too. They identified themselves to the police as members of the Legislative Assembly. but the police continued to beat them. Fortunately their bodyguards stepped in to protect them before the were terribly injured. We disapprove of in the strongest terms the use of police violence against the government officials. This unconscionable violation of human rights and democracy threatens the 1992 Peace Accords and could lead to grave consequences. Furthermore. we strongly disapprove of the police violence against protesters. This violence has been increasing recently with antiCAFTA protests in El Salvador. The Salvadoran Interior Minister endorsed the police violence against protesters that occurred on April 14 and wrongfully called the protesters \"ter orists.\" This is not acceptable. This will not go unnoticed by the United States and by international human rights movements. Be assured that. we will pursue an investigation into this matter to the fullest. On May 3. 2005. Ambassador Leon sent the following reply: DEAR REPRESENTATIVE KUCINICH: We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated April 29. 2005 in which you express your concern on the apparent use of police force against two congresspeople of the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I would like to draw attention to the first annual National Asian and Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day today. May 19. 2005. This day seeks to raise awareness among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders about the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on their community and to highlight AIDS prevention and treatment opportunities. AIDS has claimed the lives of over 20 million people worldwide since it was first diagnosed in 1981. and the numbers continue to grow at an alarming rate. An estimated 5.500 of 750.000 Americans who face the perils of AIDS today are Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. but with the fastestgrowing racial/ ethnic population in the nation. this number is increasing at a staggering rate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). the number of AA/Pls living with AIDS has increased 10 percent annually over the past five years. Many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders living with HIV/AIDS too often do not take the steps necessary to prevent and combat the disease due to cultural stigmas around issues ot sex. sexuality. and drug use. Other obstacles include the fact that nearly 40 percent of AA/Pls have limited English proficiency and 13 percent live below the federal poverty line. Nearly one in five are uninsured. and many others lack adequate health insurance. That is why this day is immensely important in communicating the facts and preventative practices regarding HIV/AIDS. With increased national awareness and improved communication. HIV/AIDS information will become more widely available and more effective in crossing the social. linguistic. and economic barriers this population faces. It is also critically important that we expand the budgets of the CDC. especially the Office of Minority Health and the National Institutes of Health. and reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act to ensure that HIV/AIDS is addressed seriously and with adequate resources. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face a serious health threat. and they are just one segment of the American population which battles this deadly disease on a daily basis. Our financial support is critical in providing information. medicine. care. and ultimately a cure for this debilitating disease. Mr. Speaker.

The election of Abu Mazen is a hopeful first step. Eight hundred international observers monitored the recent Palestinian presidential elections and agreed that the will of the Palestinians was adequately expressed. Palestinians from all walks of life participated in the elections. representing approximately 70 percent of eligible voters. The Palestinian Central Election Commission has been recognized for facilitating a process whereby Palestinians could vote in a positive voting atmosphere. Commission representatives trained more than 16.000 electoral officials to staff the 2.800 polling sites throughout the West Bank and Gaza and conducted their operations in a professional way. The Palestinian presidential election of January 9 of this year and the upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for this July represent an opportunity for Palestinians to affirm their desire to end the violence and to forge a government that can respond to their needs.

Already President Abbas has made statements condemning terrorism and deployed Palestinian patrols into the areas of Gaza that have been mounting mortar attacks against Israeli communities. He has also begun to tamp down on antiIsrael and antiSemitic incitement in the official Palestinian media and lay the groundwork to reduce tensions. The path ahead is difficult. President Abbass success will depend on his willingness and ability to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas. Islamic Jihad. and other groups. His consolidation of power in Gaza will be essential for the Palestinian people to constructively take advantage of opportunity created by Israels disengagement plan. But he must follow a path charted with hope rather than hate. and democracy instead of demagoguery. The Roadmap for Peace set forth a vision of two states living side by side in peace and security that was indefinitely delayed because of Arafats intransigence. Let us all hope that these elections and President Abbass leadership will finally be a first step back in the right direction.",

These weapons will be built in France and pointed directly at the people who serve in the United States Navy. In lifting the arms embargo against China. Europe will be making an enormous mistake. Europes shortterm concern with the corporate bottom line will lead to greater conflict and increased peril for Americans serving in uniform. Since 1989. China has been almost cut off from European technology. and Chinas leaders have responded by a cooperative foreign policy designed to lift this embargo so they can arm to the teeth as the rising power of Asia to challenge the other powers. all democracies on her periphery. If you are proU.S. Navy. you should be against this. If you are proJapanese. you should be against this. If you are proIndian. you should be against this.

The U.S. and European Union. as we have heard. established arms embargoes against the Peoples Republic of China following the June. 1989. Tiananmen Square Massacre. The U.S embargo continues today in light of the widespread human rights abuses that continue under the Communist regime. But the European Union. in a move that can only be described as reckless. is moving to lift its ban on weapons sales. EU states are even today selling China socalled nonlethal technologies that enhance its offensive capabilities. Advanced radar systems sold to China. for example. allow its military to better target U.S. warships and aircraft. For this reason. I introduced in the defense authorization bill last year a provision to prohibit the Defense Department from buying weapons from foreign companies that sell weapons to the Peoples Republic of China. My measure. which passed the House. also would have made it U.S. policy to deny China defense technology that could threaten the U.S. or destabilize the Western Pacific region. Unfortunately. this provision was dropped in conference as a result of Senate objections. But we are here again today discussing this vitally important issue.

Pt. 1 February 2. 2005 imposed a ban on arms sales to the Peoples Republic of China following the Tiananmen Square Massacre back in 1989. In recent months it has become apparent that European nations. seeing an opportunity to profit from Chinas largescale military modernization program. may well be prepared to lift that embargo in the near future. and I believe that would be a terrible mistake. In a November 30. 2004. letter to the President of the European Union. 25 Members of this body who opposed the lifting of the arms embargo stressed that such a decision would alter the current fragile military balance across the Taiwan Straits. It would rapidly tip the balance in the PRCs favor. In the last year alone. China has added more than 100 missiles to its arsenal. bringing to more than 600 the number pointed directly across the Taiwan Straits at Taiwan. The EUs imminent decision to lift the arms embargo would further isolate that island nation and endanger its sovereignty and the safety of its citizens. A lifting of the European arms embargo and further modernization of Chinas army would also create new dangers for the United States and its Asian allies. If we were ever to be called upon. and I hope this never happens. but if we were ever called upon to intervene in an Asian military crisis. the lives of our servicemen and women would be increasingly endangered. Mr. Speaker. our European neighbors need to think long and hard about the short- and longterm negative effects of the lifting of the arms embargo. Stability in Asia is all too important to dismiss for the sake of shortterm profits for European arms dealers.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment. The amendment acknowledges that immigration fraud has become endemic and. even more seriously. that internal corruption at U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services threatens the national security and erodes the integrty of our immigration system. The extent and seriousness of the problem was brought to light in a closed bipartisan session of the Subcommittee on Immigration. Border Security and Claims of the Judiciary Committee earlier this year. Although the serious allegations and investigations discussed there cannot be discussed in the open. I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to pass this important amendment. The ease with which unscrupulous immigration officials can be tempted to issue visas or benefits in return for money. goods. or favors was brought to light a month ago with the issuance of a Government Accountability Office report on consular malfeasance. In that report. it was revealed that the Diplomatic Security Service had investigated 28 cases of visa selling by State Department employees in the last few years. Those were only the cases that were discovered in the some 200 consular sections located abroad. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services conducts its application processing in the United States. and yet thousands of allegations of misconduct. some involving criminal acts and foreign influence. have yet to be investigated because of lack of focus. resources. and confusion of subagency jurisdiction. This amendment would ensure that an internal law enforcement division within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would receive. process. and investigate allegations of misconduct and internal corruption in a timely manner. To fund this office. a $10 fee will be charged to all visa applicants. The amendment would also provide that the Director of the division would have the authority to subpoena documents. reports. and data. and to appoint such officers as necessary to carry out the internal affairs functions. I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment.",

And in order to make it timely. in the amendment. we provide the revenue by having aliens who use our immigration system pay a modest security fee. That provides the very resources necessary here. What do those resources go to besides to ensure this is done in a timely manner? Well. this amendment also consolidates the datagathering function of the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security in a lawenforcement focused division whose mission is to detect. investigate and prosecute fraud and corruption. whether internal or external to USCIS. and to serve as a centralized securityrelated information clearinghouse for USCIS. So this information is shared. and it encourages the criminal investigators responsible for rooting out corruption and preventing immigration benefits fraud to partner with the adjudications officers so that fraud may be detected and prevented early in the application process. For all of these reasons. I think this answers the very concerns raised by the gentlewomans objection. and it certainly provides the additional resources to do it. Thus. I urge adoption of the amendment. and I would just close by pointing out the one inescapable fact of the 94 terrorists studied in this country since 9/11: Twothirds of these foreignborn terrorists committed fraud. got past our immigration system prior to taking part in attempted terrorist operations in our country. It only makes sense to tighten the system and ensure that we have the proper investigations to catch the flags which had we caught prior to 9/11 might have prevented a terrorist attack.

That means that we are screening more carefully the visas as individuals are requesting to come into the country. We have implemented a number of new efforts to ensure that we are in fact keeping terrorists away from the United States. But. again. the concerns that I have are clearly that the resources are not there in order to do the vetting that the gentleman is speaking of. And the question is whether or not benefits will be held up while we are attempting to vet without the necessary resources. I would hope as this amendment makes its way through the Congress that we will find a way to also push the Department of Homeland Security. push the Federal Government to comply with the recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission and put in place the procedures and the dollars that it takes to make the system work. As I indicated to you. background checks and the attendant investigations are important. It is important for the government to identify and pursue the tiny handful of individuals who really come to do us harm. But we have to separate the overwhelming majority who wish only to contribute to this country. We want reform. We have to reform the process.

While I believe that immigration reform is urgently needed and must include strong and effective enforcement provisions. this legislation will not solve our Nations immigration problems. It falls to address many of the most important elements of immigration reform. including backlogs in family visas. regulation of the future flow of immigrants. and the presence of a sizable undocumented community in the United States. Instead it harms American families. businesses. and communities. Its impact on the Latino and immigrant communities would also be devastating. Among the many antiimmigrant measures in H.R. 4437 are provisions that would: (1) strip citizenship opportunities that are currently available to legal immigrants. (2) curtail crucial due process rights in immigration proceedings. (3) make it a criminal offense to remain in the country illegally after entering legally. and (4) deputize local law enforcement officials to enforce Federal immigration laws over the objections of many such officials. who believe that this authority undercuts their ability to protect the public safety. This enforcementonly approach has not worked in the past and will not work in the future if it is not combined with measures that address the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. That is why I support and have cosponsored H.R. 2330. the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill sponsored by Representatives JiM KOLBE. JEFF FLAKE. and Luis GUTIERREZ. This bill combines tough enforcement with realistic admission policies. has bipartisan support. and is workable. All Americans want effective reforms of the Nations immigration laws. not shortsighted measures that appear tough on immigration but do not resolve the underlying problems. Only a comprehensive approach that provides a path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants. creates new legal channels for future flows of needed immigrants. reduces family immigration backlogs. and protects worker rights will reduce undocumented immigration and bring order to our immigration system. H.R. 4437 does not take us down the path of real immigration reform. I stand shouldtoshoulder with groups like the AFLCIO. ACLU. AntiDefamation League. U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Human Rights Watch.

Unfortunately. this bill lets down immigrants. those who depend on them. and our Nation on the whole. There is a lot that is troubling in this bill. but also troubling is what is not in this bill. Real immigration reform and security improvements cannot end with a discussion on enforcement anymore than you can make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. Immigration is about so much more. Immigration is also about bringing families together. and supplying a pathway to citizenship for those who come here and contribute. Moreover. it is foolish to pretend that we have somehow solved our immigration or security concerns by simply making it harder for people to come or stay here. That is simply increasing the incentive for immigrants to immigrate. live and work in the shadows. And that is a loss for immigrants. their families. society. and national security. Make no mistakeour immigration system needs reform. And it is appropriate to discuss how to best enforce our laws and secure our borders. Certainly none of my constituents in New York City are interested in making things easier on terrorists who use our immigration system to harm America. But lets make sure the enforcement tactics were talking about make sense. And lets make sure our tactics actually make us safer. And lets make sure that immigration reform does not end with enforcement. Because at the end of the day. immigration is too important to just take the most simplistic response and label it a solution. Fortunately. there is a better billa bipartisan bill offered by Congressmen KOLBE. FLAKE. and GUTIERREZ. A bill that reduces immigration backlogs and helps family reunification.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. it is absolutely critical that Congress pass meaningful and effective border security and immigration reform. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Congress has taken significant steps to secure our border and prevent another terrorist attack on our soil. Congress created the Department of Homeland Security. DHS. and a strong Director of National Intelligence. which constituted the largest reorganization of our law enforcement and intelligence services since World War II. I supported the bipartisan version of the homeland security and immigration reform bill that passed the House Homeland Security Committee last month. As a former member of the committee. I agree that the United States must: move rapidly to establish operation control of all borders and ports. end our \"catch and release\" practice of aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally. effectively organize the border security agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. and promote international policies to deter illegal immigration. I also agree with the former 9/11 Commissioners. who recently issued a report which concluded that Congress and the administration have much more work to do to make America safer. and gave our Government fair to poor grades for our current level of border security. I agree that Congress and the administration should take immediate action to: produce a terrorist travel strategy to intercept and disrupt their operations. create a comprehensive screening system for travelers. create a biometric entryexit screening system for all land borders. improve international collaboration on borders and document security. and standardize secure identifications. I am disappointed. therefore. that the leadership of the House of Representatives has failed to allow the House to take up a comprehensive homeland security and immigration reform bill that addresses the pressing vulnerabilities in our border security. The bill before the House. passed on a partyline vote in the Judiciary Committee. is not a balanced. thoughtful approach to the issue. This bill is a punitive bill which is neither enforceable nor workable. This bill has little chance of enactment. Border security is too important and should be included in legislation that can be quickly enacted. This legislation is opposed by a vast number of groups from across the political spectrum. including businesses. labor unions. faithbased organizations. civil rights organizations. human rights organizations. and immigrant advocacy organizations.

The managers amendment amends Title VII of H.R. 4437 by including language that I authored that prevents the mandatory construction of day labor facilities by private businesses in order for them to conduct business. An increasing number of local governmental entities are requiring businesses to undertake new. onerous obligations with regard to day laborers as a condition of getting a use permit necessary to conduct business. Examples include requirements that businesses build structures with toilets and water fountains at or near their private property to house day laborers. while they wait for employment opportunities with contractors or customers of the business. The local ordinances typically require that a business maintain the structures. including providing security and janitorial services. These obligations are costly and represent an unwarranted interference by govemmental entities with the rights of businesses to use and operate their private property. Worse. these local ordinances are unreasonable because they go beyond safety issues. They force businesses to use their property to facilitate employment through the creation of a de facto hiring hall. These ordinances expose the businesses to potential liability on a number of fronts. I offered language that amends the existing preemption of the employer sanctions provisions of the INA (8 U.S.C. \ufffd1324a) as they relate to State and local governments. Enacted in 1986. this section preempts State and local governments from applying the employer sanctions provisions of the INA. The language of Section 708 included in the managers amendment adds an additional preemption paragraph that preempts any State or local law that requires a private business to build and maintain what is essentially a hiring hall as the price of doing business in that city. I understand and empathize with the State and local governments as they grapple with illegal immigration. but immigration is a national problem that must be addressed by Congress. Piecemeal and patchwork local ordinances only add to the confusion surrounding this issue. I thank the Chairmen for working with me to resolve this issue.",

Dave sold the paper and worked for the San Francisco Examiner for several years before getting the paper back due to payment default. Described as everything from \"intelligent. scrappy. and folksy\" to \"controversial. opinionated. and hardheaded.\" Dave always presented the news in a lively. personal manner and encouraged his readers to participate through letters and columns. He considered himself a muckraker and determinedly pursued deceit and corruption where he saw it. In 1979 he and Cathy won a Pulitzer Prize for their expose of the Synanon cult. West Mann has changed during Daves tenure. and the Ught chronicled issues such as politics. immigration (even sending reporters to the Azores. Italy. and Jalisco. Mexico. where many were from). relations between Point Reyes National Seashore and the community. and the struggles of ranchers to remain viable as the towns became more gentrified. The paper was always challenged financially as Dave used an inheritance to subsidize it. and he sometimes suffered from severe burnout as he worked long hours to keep both the finances and the news activities in line. After achieving financial stability. he sold the paper in November. 2005. to Robert Plotkin who made a commitment to maintain its community focus. Mr. Speaker. David Mitchell has provided a vital service to West Marin as well as setting high standards for community newspapers. I know he will continue as a fixture on the local scene and maintain his passion for the issues he championed.",

Her coworkers told us that Peaches fought cancer every step of the way. never giving up. She wanted to keep busy and go back to work. but eventually lost her battle.

May the Gwyn and Perkins families be comforted by peaceful memories and may they find strength in Peaches spirit which lives on through everyone she touched.",

I would also like to make a special honor of Congressman BILIRAKIS. who is celebrating his last Greek Independence Day as a Member of the House of Representatives. I commend him for his service not only to our country but his indefatigable support of Hellenic issues. I know he will be missed not only by his constituents in Florida. his colleagues here and by all Hellenic Americans. March 25th is a date that will live in the hearts and minds of Greeks all around the world. After close to 400 years of Ottoman rule. on March 25. 1821. the people of Greece rose up against the Turks and won their independence. The Greeks have a history dating back almost 4.000 years. Greece is the cradle of democracy and its great philosophers were an invaluable inspiration for our founding fathers. In ancient Athens they found a model for the new democracy that our forefathers used to establish our democracy in America. We are joined by blood. culture. and a profound commitment to shared values. Greek ideals of democracy and freedom inspired our Nations founders and breathed life into Americas experiment with democratic selfgovernment. Mr. Speaker. I have the great honor of representing a number of GreekAmericans in the Seventh District of New York. Their influence and active participation in the life of their communities has fostered economic. political and social growth throughout New York City. Generations of Greek Americans have enriched every aspect of our national life. in the arts. sciences. business. politics and sports. Through hard work. love of family and community. they have contributed greatly to the prosperity and peace that we all enjoy as Americans today. But as we celebrate Greek independence. we must keep in mind the ongoing struggle for freedom and demand for human rights on the island of Cyprus. I believe the United States and the international community must remain steadfast in our resolve to bring peace and unity to an island that has been home to violence and division for far. far too long. Mr. Speaker. let me reiterate my strong commitment to Greek communities in my district. the country. and throughout the world. Their strength and dedication to democracy and peace in the world has made them a shining star of modern civilization.",

Secondly. when it comes to the college loan program that the gentleman referred to that there were cuts. if the gentleman would look at the bill. he will realize that we widened the ability of more students to get to college under this program than we have ever had. The fact is there are higher numbers for grant programs. higher numbers for what you can borrow from the program. and it could not be working any better.

Every year. more than 33.000 Americans are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. and even more startling is the fact that the overwhelming majority of those patients will die of pancreatic cancer. Only about 4 percent are currently expected to live beyond 5 years. As Mr. DAVIS said. pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States. After years of research. we are not significantly closer to understanding what causes pancreatic cancer. Most cancers are caused by environmental. dietary or lifestyle factors. and most pancreatic cancer is believed to be no different. However. the specific link between the onset of pancreatic cancer and any one or a combination of these extraneous factors has yet to be determined. A significant body of research is developing around a possible hereditary link in pancreatic cancer. but even the results of these studies have shown that only 5 to 10 percent of cases have genetic links. Although awareness of cancers prevalence in the United States improves and medical advances in the field abound. pancreatic cancer has largely been absent from the list of major success stories. Surgical procedures may have increased the survival chances of some with the disease. but there has been little momentum in advancing diagnostics or nonsurgical oncological treatments beyond palliative care. Mr. Speaker. I think this is an important piece of legislation that draws attention to this devastating disease. We need to make people more aware of it.

He was the mayor of Manassas for 18 years and later became an active member of the Virginia General Assembly where he rose to be chairman of the finance committee in the House of Delegates.

I also want to thank Ranking Member WAXMAN for considering this resolution. and also Representative Foxx for her leadership. Mr. Speaker. this resolution supports the goals and ideals of a National Myositis Awareness Day. I was first introduced to the myositis community through my work to improve Medicare access to intravenous immune globulin. or IVIG. The myositis community is one of many patient groups that rely on IVIG. However. since there are several forms of myositis that affect different people in different ways. the disease is often misunderstood and cannot be treated with a single remedy. This is one of many reasons that it is important that we pass this resolution. As the chairman said. each year an estimated 30.000 to 50.000 Americans are affected by myositis. a general term used to describe swelling of the muscles. Myositis patients suffer from their immune systems attacking their bodys own normal tissue. resulting in inflammation or swelling. The disease can cause muscle weakness. and patients often live in chronic pain and have longterm health problems that can lead to permanent disabilities. Myositis affects individuals of all ages and can come in many different forms. Many patients with treatable forms of myositis often have severe longterm disabilities because of failure to diagnose and treat the disease. In addition. the effects of inflammatory myopathies are much more severe than just inflammation. They are thought to be autoimmune diseases such as that the bodys immune system. which normally fights infections and viruses. does not stop fighting once the infection or virus is gone. Mr. Speaker. because myositis varies so much from patient to patient. no single existing treatment works for everyone. Myositis can be treated with steroids. various medicines and intravenous immune globulin. The Myositis Association is the national patient advocacy organization serving the myositis community and has designated September 21 as Myositis Awareness Day. Myositis advocates traveled to Capitol Hill last Thursday in an effort to educate the public and Congress on the need for more research funding. accurate diagnosis. and effective treatments for this disease. This resolution thanks them for their work and dedicates the United States Congress to continuing the research for treatments.",

He was elected to the town council of Manassas. Virginia. in 1951. and held that position until 1963 when he was elected mayor. He served in that capacity until 1981. During his 12 years as town councilman and 18 years as mayor. he guided the transformation of Manassas from a small Virginia town to a thriving. lively suburb. Mr. Parrish became a delegate in the Virginia General Assembly In 1982 and was elected to 13 terms in the Virginia House of Delegates. including serving as chairman of the Finance Committee starting in 2000. At the time of his passing in March at the age of 84. he was the oldest serving member of the House of Delegates. As a member of the House of Delegates. he was known for conducting himself in a bipartisan manner. putting Virginia first. At Harrys funeral. current Governor Kaine was there. a Democrat. former Governor Warner. a Democrat. It was a bipartisan group. If only this body could become like that. whereby there could be a bipartisanship that we saw with Harry Parrish. I was proud to call Harry my friend. He was a true Virginia gentleman in the truest sense of the word. His public service started in the U.S. Air Force. where he was a decorated World War II pilot. As part of the British Royal Air Force during WWII. he flew C47s over the Himalayas. delivering supplies. weapons and other cargo from India to China. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal for his valiant efforts. He served as an Air Force reservist in the Korean and Vietnam wars before retiring as colonel.

The permanent charter was granted March 28. 1932. After being without their own building for several years. the members decided to construct a permanent home for Post 31.

Activities held in the new building. such as movies and dances with live bands. constituted some of the first entertainment in Boulder City.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Let me say to my friend from New York. I appreciate very much the intention of the amendment. I have got to oppose it in its current form. It seems to me that this Act has some very good attributes to it. and the argument may be in some of the designated industry groups that are listed. One of the problems Is that the participating agencies currently will designate areas that are currently dominated by small businesses as small business setasides. These are areas that in full and open competition. small businesses are going to win anyway. and by using their percentages in these areas. it means that small businesses who could use the setasides in other areas are not able to use it. So I think what we have here is the law of unintended consequences. We are taking areas such as lawn services. roofing. siding contractors. glass and glazing contractors. masonry. areas that in full and open competition. small businesses are winning by overwhelming margins. but the agencies are taking these areas and saying we are going to designate these as small business setasides and use their percentages in these areas. and that means that small businesses cannot penetrate other areas. So it is really for these reasons that I rise to oppose the amendment. because I think it shifts the burden in these cases where small businesses are currently winning open competition. and it uses the allocation for setasides into these areas that I think small businesses could benefit in other areas. in some of the technology areas. in some of the IT areas. That is my concern. Let me just make one point. I think the argument ought to be some of the designated industry groups in this case where maybe we see large businesses coming in and taking over. and we could work under those areas appropriately if the case can be made that small business dominance in these areas is not hit. but without that we have not added a nickel to what small businesses get under the setaside programs. We have not added a percentage. We just shift the burden.",

I know I would be happy to work with her. and I am sure the chairman of the Committee on Small Business. to look at some of these designated industry groups where perhaps small business is not dominating and was intended to. and we work on that rather than gutting the whole provision. That would be the approach that I would take. I would be happy to work with the gentlewoman on that. But this amendment guts the whole program. and I think ultimately it is not good for the government because I think the government is not getting small business setasides in some of the innovative areas where they can go and they are giving it to areas where small businesses tend to dominate in full and open competition.

I will refer the gentlewoman. frankly. to the statute in the areas that are the designated industry groups under the statute. and I think it is clear looking at this that many of these areas. siding contractors. roofing. masonry. framing contractors. these are areas that are traditionally dominated by small business and will continue to be.

    "speech": "Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. this Velazquez amendment is an effort to kill the Small Business Comp Demonstration program. The issue is more appropriately settled in the authorizing committee and not on an appropriations bill. First of all. the Comp Demonstration program does not cost the taxpayers one dime. There is no money appropriated for it. The Small Business Competitive Demonstration program began in 1988 with three purposes: first. to help emerging small businesses. second. to expand the participation of small businesses and industries that were traditionally dominated by large businesses. and. third. to test the competitiveness of small businesses in industries in which small businesses are well represented. The Comp Demo program was renewed in 1992. made permanent in 1997. and slightly expanded in 2004 as a part of larger bills that passed by wide margins or unanimous consent. Prior to the adoption of the Comp Demonstration program. small businesses were relegated to industries dominated by small businesses. Federal agencies could say they met their overall small business goals while not doing much to provide more contracts to small businesses in more higherend. higherpaying industries. The Comp Demo program ended this practice all while showing that small businesses are still competitive in the industries where they have been historically well represented. These industries include construction. garbage collection. architectural engineering. surveying and mapping. non nuclear shipbuilding and ship repair. landscaping. and pest control. The Comp Demo program requires that small businesses receive a \"fair proportion\" of government contracts in each industry rather than just a few. The principles upon which the program were established are still valid. Emerging small businesses still need help. Small businesses need to participate in industries in which they have traditionally not had a chance to obtain a Federal contract.

That might have been the theory behind the program in 1988 when it was created. but that has not been the case. Different industries offer different opportunities. some are very favorable to small businesses. The Department of Defense has not achieved its small business goal for the past 4 years. That is the reality. So. clearly. they are not making up the difference someplace else. Under the comp demo program. small businesses are guaranteed 40 percent participation in the targeted industries. If the agency does not achieve 40 percent with small firms. it can reinstate small businesses setasides. One need look no further than the goal for architectural and engineering services. which has never been achieved. We have asked the Department of Defense. They do not reinstate setasides when the achievement with small businesses is less than 40 percent. Forty percent small business participation is a good thing. Normally. small businesses only get 23 percent. If a small businesss participation decreases from 78 percent to 40 percent. that is the loss of 38 percent. and that is what is happening now. The bottom line. Mr. Chairman. is. if you support small business opportunity in the Federal marketplace. you should support this amendment.",

I just want to thank the gentleman for the very hard work that he consistently does for the security of our Nation. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss an issue that is of great importance. and that is ensuring that our Federal defense dollars are not used to support groups or individuals engaged in efforts to overthrow democratically elected governments. Mr. Chairman. in an ideal world. we would not need to have to explicitly stipulate this. but events in Haiti last year and. more recently in Venezuela. have led me to wonder whether we need to codify this straightforward. nonpartisan position. Furthermore. the administration has committed its second term to spreading democracy around the world. This is an important sentiment. Mr. Chairman. but we need to be sure that if this administration. or equally any future administration. does not agree with certain democratically elected governments. that it does not use the Department of Defense funds to overthrow those democratically elected governments. Such actions fly in the face of our own fundamental democratic principles. I would like to ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania if he could comment on this and what his views are with regard to the ideas that we are presenting today.",

They have very few hours at night with their families. because they are here many times all night long. That is when you hear about. something was done in the dark of night.

Most acknowledge that CAFTA countries lack the financial resources and technical expertise to enforce good labor and environmental practices. but we are not providing funding that could help overcome these obstacles. Additionally. CAFTA would seriously harm these countries that rely heavily on their agricultural sectors. Our egregious farm bill has locked us into subsidies that do not promote free trade and have already caused much harm to other countries farmers.

Of the 21 million barrels of oil consumed by the U.S. each day. 14 million are imported from other countries. Most are imported from the Middle East. where as we know democracy is not pervasive. This lack of democracy allow the authoritarian leaders of many Middle East countries to pocket billions of dollars each year from American oil purchases. So while the leaders of these countries are becoming increasingly wealthy. the rest of their people fail to benefit from the oil proceeds. Sadly. this economic disparity allows the powerful elite to tighten their hold over their people. This repressive power structure allows the conditions which give rise to terrorism. resource scarcity. extreme poverty. and lack of education to run rampant. It is quite clear that we need to decrease our dependance on foreign oil in order to keep America safe from the threat of terrorism. But there is a right way. and there is a wrong way to accomplish this goal. Many Members of Congress have suggested. today in fact. that we can simply drill for gas and oil off the coasts of our shores. or in places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to solve our energy crisis. Unfortunately this suggestion is just plain wrong. In fact. drilling for oil in the United States would do little to immediately reduce our dependance on foreign oil. because it would take at",

But Mr. Speaker what makes this team so special is how well they exemplified what it means to be a team. Winning the five games on their way to claiming their fourth national championship. three different players led the team in scoring and four players led the team in rebounding. Sean May certainly earned the honor of tournament MVP. But the road to the finals required the collective effort of the entire team. After two easy wins again. Oakland and Iowa. Carolina fans collectively held their breath when the referees whistle blew in the final seconds against Villanova. Fear of a shooting foul turned into the joy of a traveling call against Villanova. and the Heels held on for the onepoint win. A strong game against Wisconsin then sent Carolina on to the final game in St. Louis. The game brought together the two best teams in the country. It was a fitting finale to a memorable season and an exciting NCAA tournament. Fittingly. the game was full of tension and drama until the waning seconds. Illinois showed the perseverance and will that had resulted in 37 wins. while Carolina showed the determination. the unity. and the cohesion needed to overcome a team that went undefeated for much of the season. This Carolina team. Mr. Speaker. would have made Dean Smith proud. because they won using a primary tenet of his Carolina way: They shared the ball and they played unselfishly. By playing as a team. they led the Nation in scoring and assists. and they played at a pace very few teams could manage. Therefore. on behalf of the citizens of the First Congressional District of North Carolina. my congratulations go to Coach Williams and to every member of the University of North Carolina basketball team. You have made us proud across our State and you have shown us the great benefit of working as a team. Congratulations and best wishes.",

My name was added to the list unbeknownst to me and my staff due to a clerical mistake made by the House Judiciary Committee Majority Staff. For the record. I did not ask to be added to the list of cosponsors. Sexual crimes against children are terrible and reprehensible acts. I believe that it is vital that we take every precaution to protect our children from sexual violence and that we punish those criminals who prey on our children. However. I stand today in opposition to H.R. 3132. the Childrens Safety Act. While I support many of its provisions. I am concerned that this bill would expand the use of the death penalty. impose mandatory minimum sentences. and punish more young people as adults. Although I believe that harsh penalties and aggressive prosecution of sex offenders are necessary. I oppose this bill because it would create at least two new death penalty provisions. I strongly oppose the death penalty because it is fraught with problems such as inadequate representation for the accused. lack of access to DNA testing. police misconduct. racial bias and other errors. Experts have found a national error rate of 68 percent. which means over twothirds of all capital convictions and sentences are reversed because of serious error during trial or sentencing phase. In fact. former Illinois Governor Ryan declared a moratorium in 2000 after 13 people were released from death row because of innocence. The error rate in Illinois is 66 percent. Therefore. I believe capital punishment is inconsistent with Constitutional requirements of fairness. justice. equality and due process. This bill would also create 36 new mandatory minimum sentences which are arbitrary. ineffective at reducing crime. and unfair. The United States Sentencing Commission found that minorities were substantially more likely than whites under comparable circumstances to receive mandatory minimums sentences with no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences had any more impact in reducing crime than sentences where the judges had",

Let me briefly summarize some of the most important provisions. First. the amendment includes a requirement that the Bureau of Prisons provide adequate treatment programs for sex offenders in all six of the regions and that they have adequate access to treatment in both residential and nonresidential programs. Second. the amendment authorizes grants to States for prosecution of cases solved by DNA evidence. With the overwhelming passage of the Justice for All Act last Congress. this body recognized that DNA is a valuable tool for solving crimes. The amendment incorporates the proposal by the gentleman from California which will further assist States in hiring more prosecutors and investigators for cases solved by DNA evidence. Third. the amendment includes proposals contained in H.R. 3687. offered by the gentleman from Minnesota . the gentleman from Massachusetts . and the gentleman from Texas . and specifically authorizes technical assistance grants to improve the quality of criminal investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases. Fourth. the amendment expands on the pilot program for electronic monitoring programs for sex offenders.

It is estimated that at least 15.000 sex offenders have been relocated from the affected area as a part of disaster relief efforts. Criminal records and sex offender information are. in many cases. not available to law enforcement or the community to track these offenders as they move to new areas. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. It has been reported by the Texas Department of Justice. for example. that the State is experiencing significant increases in violent crime. There are 1.350 sex offenders unaccounted for in Houston alone after being evacuated from Louisiana. The parole department in Louisiana has no idea where these people are and can provide no identifying information. fingerprints or photos. Reports also indicate that crimes against children in Texas shelters are rising. These States are in desperate need of Federal assistance. My amendment does just that by directing the Justice Department to provide technical assistance to help law enforcement in these areas and to identify sex offenders who have been relocated.

The training and technology amendment addresses several key issues for law enforcement throughout the country when dealing with Internet crime against children. These cimes committed against children on the Internet are facilitated by the latest technologies and advances in computers and the Internet. Without properly equipping law enforcement. these cases will not be investigated and prosecuted effectively. allowing many predators to slip through the cracks in our criminal justice system. Furthermore. many cases involving exploitation and enticement of children on the Internet cross jurisdictional lines and even international boundaries. There is a great need for law enforcement prosecutors and investigators to have the ability to share information quickly as cases unfold. To address these needs. the training and technology amendment funds the Department of Justice $3 million to do two things: (1) Train law enforcement to use the most up to date technology while investigating and collecting evidence from a suspected internet predatorfor example. recovering files from hard drives of suspected child pornographers. (2) Provide hardware and training to use software that Microsoft is developing and donating to the Department of Justice. A similar project has successfully been implemented in Canada. The software would link Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preventions 46 regional Internet Crimes Against Children Units with one database. This will allow law enforcement across the country and even internationally to work together and share information on cases that cross jurisdictions.

FBI data has also revealed that a disproportionately high percentage of both the victims and the perpetrators of hate violence were children. young people under 18 years of age. The FBIs annual Hate Crime Statistics Act report provides the best snapshot of the magnitude of the hate violence problem in America. However. there is a paucity of regularly published information about juvenile hate crime offenses because the statute does not require data analysis for gender or juvenile categories. This is an important omission. as indicated by a special DOJ report on the subject in 2001. This report. which carefully analyzed nearly 3.000 of the 24.000 hate crimes to the FBI from 1997 to 1999. revealed that a disproportionately high percentage of both the victims and the perpetrators of hate violence were young people under 18 years of age.

Without the boards leadership and dedication this day may not have been possible.

Since those dark days. enormous progress has been made in promoting a life full of possibilities for blind and visually impaired men and women. Leaders like Helen Keller changed hearts and minds by showing us all that what is often seen as a limitation can be a blessing in disguise. But much of the credit also goes to local organizations such as the memorial foundation. that cared about these basic issues and stood up for civil rights. It represents the best in progressive philanthropic organizations that changed communities one at a time. and encouraged the rest of the Nation to follow suit. Their great legacy is a stronger and fairer America. In Worcester County. the foundation operated a special home and provided support services for many years. making sure that a safe and welcoming shelter existed in the community. In 1960 it shifted its focus to providing financial assistance to one and later on to many agencies and organizations in the community that exemplify its giving spirit. They continue to do so today. adapting to new developments. supporting assistive technologies and giving blind and visually impaired men and women unprecedented new independence.

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I am introducing the Communications Security Act of 2005. The events of 9/11 uncovered manifest structural weaknesses in our communications system. which were then highlighted by the 9/11 Commission. At the time. public safety and emergency response officials were not able to communicate at a basic level. We have not taken adequate steps to fix that dangerous problem. and Hurricane Katrina has bluntly demonstrated that. Much of the communications system was knocked offline along the Gulf Coast. It was remarkable to watch as the television news crews had better luck communicating than our first responders. As the disaster unfolded. our first responders and emergency officials repeatedly cited communications failures as a major obstacle to the disaster response effort. We need a redundant communications system that will work in times of emergency. Dramatic advances in technology and the availability of new spectrum as part of the DTV transition offer opportunities to address this problem. The Communications Security Act of 2005 requires the technical experts at the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission evaluate the feasibility and cost of deploying a backup emergency communications system. The agencies will evaluate all reasonable options. including satellites. wireless and terrestrialbased systems. They will evaluate all available public and private resources that could provide such a system and submit a report to Congress detailing the findings. The DHS is then authorized to request appropriations to implement the system. Congress would then be in position to put in place whatever programs and funding are needed to get the job done. This proposal will not resolve all of our longterm needs in preparedness and interoperability. and I am pleased that many of my colleagues are working on the various pieces of this puzzle. However. in the interim. we must ensure that we can respond in emergency situations with an eye toward building a reliable. redundant system for the long term.

    "speech": "Mr. President. a Federal District Court judge in the Ninth Circuit has once again declared that the reference to God in the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. Just a couple of years ago. the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in the case of Newdow v. U.S. Congress. I am now. as I was then. surprised and disappointed with this new ruling by the District Court. Today I am reintroducing a proposed constitutional amendment that simply says that references to God in the Pledge of Allegiance and on our currency do not affect an establishment of religion under the First Amendment. References to God are found in every one of our founding documents from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution. as well as in the Pledge of Allegiance. The phrase \"In God We Trust\" appears on all of our currency and on many public buildings. Every day. we begin Senate sessions with a prayer and the Pledge. I firmly believe that the framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment did not want to ban all references to God from public discourse when they wrote the Establishment Clause. What they wanted to prevent was the establishment of an official national religion and to keep the government from getting intimately involved in the organization of one religion over another. These references to God are ceremonial. Certainly. they do have meaning. but individuals are free to put whatever meaning on the word they choose. Indeed. I fully respect and support the rights of people not to participate in the Pledge or in ceremonial prayer and my amendment will not coerce anyone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in public or in school. I had hoped that the Supreme Court. which took the Newdow case up on appeal. would have settled this question once and for all. It did not. The Court dismissed the case saying Mr. Newdow lacked standing. The Supreme Court may have the opportunity to hear arguments in this case later on. If the Supreme Court should decide not to hear the case or to overrule the lower court. then Congress should restore the appropriate balance between church and state that I believe was the intent of the framers. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed in the RECORD.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today to condemn the recent \"anti -secession law\" proposed by the \"legislature\" of the Peoples Republic of China. I believe it is clear to even the most casual observer that this move by Chinas rubberstamp National Peoples Congress is little more than a thinly veiled attempt by Beijing to create a \"legal framework\" for starting a war with Taiwan. Should Chinas unelected parliament enact this law. it will represent a clearcut. belligerent and dangerous step toward a military attack of a peaceful and democratic ally of the United States. Moreover. it underscores once again that the government in Beijing is not sincere about resolving its differences with Taiwan in a peaceful or rational manner. Americas position is clear: Any change in the status quo between the Peoples Republic of China and Taiwan must have the assent of the people of Taiwan. As such. resolving the differences between these two nations can only be achieved through honest and direct statetostate negotiations without preconditions. They cannot be resolved by intimidation. indignant bluster or threats of military force from Beijing. Mr. Speaker. the truth is that Taiwan and China are not united. They are not \"one country\" as the communists in Beijing are so fond of asserting. If they were there would be no talk of \"unification.\" China must accept that it does not have jurisdiction over Taiwan. and abandon this kind of counterproductive saber rattling. The simple fact is this: Regardless of whether the puppet legislature in Beijing enacts this \"law\" or not. Taiwan will remain free. independent and outside of the control of communist China. Those. Mr. Speaker. are the facts. Nonetheless. world reaction to this P.R.C. \"trial balloon\" will be significant and watched with great interest by the autocrats in Beijing. Hard liners in Beijing will observe how civilized and modern nations respond to the explicit threat that the \"antisecession law\" represents. In short. they are feeling out the free world to determine its commitment to the safety and security of Taiwanand its more than twenty million citizens. I hope the family of free nations will condemn the \"antisecession law\" with a unified voice. making it clear to China that any resolution of crossstraits tensions must be peaceful and above all acceptable to the people of Taiwan.",

He took his first job after his Navy service back at ACU in 1956 and remained a vital part of the universitys administration until 1993. when he retired as Senior Vice President. The degrees he earned in his time at ACU were just his first. He has gone on to be honored with no fewer than seven honorary doctorate degrees.

Twenty Representatives are original cosponsors to this important legislation. I introduce this bill after the Chicago City Council took a strong stand for workers by passing a living wage ordinance for employees of bigbox retailers. The ordinance is an important victory in the fight for living wages for all workers. That fight now needs to come here. to Washington. where it is long overdue. The bill I am introducing today will hopefully move us closer to delivering all workers in America a fair and equitable wage. No fulltime worker deserves to live in poverty. And certainly. the federal government should not be in the business of paying federal workers. or federally contracted workers. subpoverty wages. Although Congress passed laws. such as the DavisBacon Act and the Service Contract Act. to help ensure that employees of Federal contracts earn a decent wage. thousands of Federal workers and federally contracted workers still do not earn enough to support themselves and their families. This legislation will allow hardworking individuals to earn quality wages and to increase their savings for such essential needs as their retirement and their childrens education. The Federal government must take responsible. workable steps to reward working Americans and to help keep them out of poverty.

Mr. Santos Hem~ndez is a member of the prodemocracy opposition that seeks to return sovereignty. democracy and human rights to the Cuban people. According to reports. he is a member of the Cuban Liberal Movement. the director of an independent library and the national coordinator for the Eastern Democratic Alliance. Independent librarians in Cuba. such as Mr. Santos Hernandez. provide the indispensable service of circulating truth. These vital librarians loan out the classics of antitotalitarian literature. including authors such as Vaclav Havel and Martin Luther King.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. last year I introduced duty suspension legislation for highquality woven cotton shirting fabrics that are not currently produced in the United States. Today. after receiving valuable input from the International Trade Commission. ITC. and the National Council of Textile Organizations. NCTO. I am happy to reintroduce a slightly revised version of this legislation. The highquality cotton fabrics affected by this legislation are used in the domestic production of fine mens and boys dress shirts. Unfortunately. several American companies that produce these shirts are being unfairly penalized by tariffs on the cotton they must import for this purpose. But because this type of cotton is not produced domestically. these tariffs protect no American interest. Whats more. Canada has eliminated its tariffs on this type of imported woven shirting fabrics. and under a provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement. NAFTA. Canadian shirt makers can export large quantities of these shirts to the U.S. dutyfree. This further puts U.S.-based shirt manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. Last year. following a request for public comments by the House Ways and Means Committee on all tariff relief trade bills. the NCTO raised a concern about the scope of fabrics that could conceivably be covered by my original bill. H.R. 1945. In addition. the Ways and Means Committee requested technical comments on all tariff relief bills from the ITC. Because this legislation was never intended to cover other cotton fabricsand to alleviate any perceived concerns about the scope of the billI have adjusted the language in the bill to specifically list the affected fabrics by number. This will make it perfectly clear that the bill only covers mens and boys cotton shirting fabrics. In addition. the bill has been adjusted to reflect minor technical corrections suggested by the ITC. I am proud to say that this newly revised bill has gained the approval of NCTO. Therefore. it is my hope that this legislation will serve as a strong demonstration of continuing House support for these duty suspensions. which are also included in companion legislation that has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. ARLEN SPECTER of Pennsylvania. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense tariff relief measure that will yield positive benefits for American companies. workers and consumers.

This landmark law was passed with strong bipartisan support and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. As we mark the 15th anniversary of this historic event. we celebrate the tremendous progress and new doors that have been opened to individuals with disabilities as a result of the ADA. The purpose of the ADA was to provide clear and comprehensive national standards to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. As a result. individuals with disabilities are now able to live in their homes and have access to new careers. Accessible busses and trains and better paratransit systems have made it possible for more people with disabilities to get to work and school. enjoy restaurants and theaters and travel. The ADA has improved society. not only for the 14 percent of Americans over the age of five who have at least one disability. Commonsense accommodations like curb cuts and close captioning have also benefited Americans without disabilities. On this important anniversary. we must remember that while we have come a long way in eliminating barriers. critical work remains to ensure all Americans can live up to their full potential. Tragically. we still have stereotypes and misconceptions that affect people with disabilities. Sadly. we still have examples like the boy in Pennsylvania who was the target of discrimination by his Tball coach. This is not an isolated incident. as I have learned of another boy in Kansas who was denied the right to play Tball like any other 7yearold because he had cerebral palsy. Fortunately. because of the ADA. that boy was eventually allowed to play Tball. Giving people with disabilities the right to participate fully in society is what this landmark legislation is all about. As cochair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus. I know that the ADA is a major achievement and much has been accomplished over the last 15 years. As we celebrate how far weve come. let us also recommit to creating a society in which no barrier stands in the way of fully participating in our society. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 13",

Florida. aboard the space shuttle Discovery. rocketing into lowearth orbit at 17.000 miles per hour. . . another small step for man. another giant leap for mankind. Yesterdays successful launch will not simply pick up where America left off two years ago after the Columbia disaster. Yesterdays launch instead opens a new era of space explorationan era defined by President Bushs ambitious new vision and made possible by the courage and brilliance of the men and women of NASA. Every resource of our space program will be dedicated to this new mission: The shuttle has retumed to flight and will work to complete the International Space Station now orbiting the earth 250 miles above our heads. Scientists and astronauts aboard the station will conduct unprecedented research on the longterm exposure of human beings to microgravity and radiation. to test our endurance for prolonged spacetravel. Meanwhile. here on earth. engineers and scientists will design a new crew exploration vehicle that will eventually replace the shuttle and take mankind back to the moon. where more historic discovery and science can be pursued. All of these endeavors will lead our space program toward our next giant leap--a manned mission to Mars. The first step of that journey was taken yesterday morning. Mr. Speaker. and once again. NASAs army of geniuses has set us on a clear path toward our destiny. I spoke with mission Commander Eileen Collins a few weeks back. and she said her crew was ready and eager to return the shuttle to flight. I also spoke with NASA Administrator Mike Griffin today. to congratulate him and the entire NASA team on a successful launch. as well as to commend him on an incredible first 3plus months on the job. The country is lucky to have a man like him in public service heading up the finest space agency in the world. Yesterday. Americans learned once again that we have the resources and the personnel to do the impossible. Mr. Speaker. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 151. Pt. 13 I commend every member of our space community for keeping the Discovery crews appointment with history. and while we wait for their safe return next week. our hopes and prayers are with them all.",

Both parties and every individual Member of the House holds our veterans in the highest regard. and the House. having the power of the purse. establishes its priorities by setting funding levels. Clearly. there is no budget within the Federal Government which has grown faster or been more plentifully supplied with funds than the Veterans Affairs health care budget. It is the fastest growing budget. I believe. within the entire Federal budget. and that is as it should be because we have a growing number of veterans from the Iraq War.

This is a good bill that takes positive steps to redress the wrongs done to veterans over the last several years when. in fact. we were cutting veterans services during a time of war. something that many of us on the floor of this House time and again said was immoral. This bill increases VA medical services by $2.5 billion over the Presidents original request. I salute this committee and the House and its leadership for doing that. I also would point out that that itself suggests that the administration has woefully underfunded veterans health care needs during a time of war. Never again should our country send young Americans into war and then scrimp on supporting those who have sacrificed the most to their service during that war.

In addition. according to agency information. it would save the taxpayers money. For decades. we have included a provision in this bill requiring the land management agencies to carry out some of their projects in partnership with the Youth Conservation Corps. In the mid1970s. we funded the YCC program at $60 million each year. Unfortunately. Congress has more or less forgotten the YCC for the last 5 years. which is how long it has been since we increased the modest setaside for the programs to about $7 million. YCC projects range from building trails and campsites. to restoring watersheds and monuments. to eradicating exotic pests and weeds. The Youth Corps bring to the agencies enthusiastic young adults that are ready to work hard to improve our public lands. The youth corps members come away with a good job and invaluable experiences. In New Mexico. for example. the Rocky Mountain Youth Corps has partnered with all of these agencies to carry our many projects over the years. One project was to create a scenic lakeside trail with an interpretive nature component in the Carson National Forest. Recently. the site was listed as one of the top 15 camping sites in New Mexico. and the lakeside trail is an integral component of that camping experience. We held a hearing on the YCC program in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources a few years ago. and the Park Service Director testified that his agency received $1.70 in benefits for every $1.00 it invested in YCC projects. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that it received $2.00 dollars for every $1.00 it invested. Supporting this program is good fiscal policy. My amendment would provide a modest increase of almost $2 million in the YCC setaside. to be spread among the four agencies. This does little more than prevent the program from shrinking from where it was 5 years ago. but it would result in tangible benefits to our youth. our public lands. and our budget. This amendment is good education policy. good public lands policy. good economic policy. good government policy. and good fiscal policy. I am gratified that this amendment was adopted.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to register my opposition to the Kyl amendment No. 1050 to H.R. 2361. the Senate Interior Appropriations bill. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program is essential for protecting public health. watersheds. and the natural environment by providing critical federal seed money for the maintenance and improvement of water infrastructure. Despite important progress in protecting and enhancing water quality since the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972. serious water pollution problems persist throughout the Nation. The need for continued Federal investment in the Nations water infrastructure is undeniable. The Environmental Protection Agencys September 30. 2002 Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap Analysis found that there will be a $535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure over the next 20 years if additional investments are not made. In November 2002. the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the annual investment in clean water infrastructure needs to be at least $13 billion for capital construction and $20.3 billion for operation and maintenance. The Kyl amendment would restructure the current formula for distributing federal funding to the states under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. SRF. Program. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries. Wildlife. and Water. with authorizing jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act and the SRF Program. I thank Senator KYL for his interest in the clean water formula. However. 1 believe the Interior appropriations bill is the wrong forum for discussion of any statutory changes to the Clean Water SRF formula. Members of the subcommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee are working closely to craft water infrastructure legislation that would authorize new funding for the Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs. as well as address the antiquated Clean Water SRF formula. Senator KYL is correct. the Clean Water SRF formula is in need of revision. Arizona is one of many States that have seen their needs grow since the last time the formula was updated in 1987. The Environment and Public Works Committee is working on the necessary changes to the SRF. and hope to move water infrastructure legislation by the end of the summer. I encourage my fellow colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment and support the ongoing process of updating the Clean Water formula by the Environment and Public Works Committee.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. to begin. let me assure my colleague that as chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee. I am fully aware of how important this issue is to his State of Arizona. His States current allocation under the Clean Water Act is well below the States proportional need. As my colleague knows. the EPW Committee has for the past two Congresses passed legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs. In those bills. the committee also rewrote the clean water formula. My colleagues Senators JEFFORDS. CHAFEE and CLINTON and I are working on a new proposal and feel confident that unlike our previous efforts. this bill will be enacted into law. My State of Oklahoma would get more money under the Kyl formula than under the current allocation. I would like to support your amendment because it brings more dollars home to Oklahoma. However. all States need more water infrastructure money as their systems age and struggle to meet the evergrowing list of Federal regulations. There is a significant nationwide shortage of funds that is affecting all States. Given current Federal appropriations. there is simply no way to rewrite the formula so that all States win. If we change the formula. without reauthorizing the State Revolving Loan Funds. some States will have to lose money. In order to assure that each State receives sufficient funds to run an effective program. we need to enact water infrastructure legislation which raises the authorization level for this important program while also addressing the formula. The committees longterm goal is to keep everyone whole because all States need more money not less. I hope all of my colleagues who care strongly about the Kyl amendment will rally around the bill that we hope to pass out of committee next month. The committee will do as the Senate promised Senator KYL during the 107th Congress and pass another formula. We will put forth a proposal that minimizes the pain to those States that will see their clean water funding cut while providing modest increases to other States. We will continue to work to increase the authorization to this important program so that the needs of all States can be met. I appreciate my colleagues willingness to withdraw his amendment and allow the committee to do its work.",

I rise today out of two affections in my life: one for the land of New Zealand. and another grows out of my enjoyment of the game of golf. Ten days ago. on June 19. Michael Campbell became the first New Zealander to win one of the United States Golf Associations major championships in 43 years. besting a field of the worlds most talented golfers. Mr. Campbell showed great perseverance and mettle throughout the Open. mastering an immensely challenging course. He was also the first player to come from behind to win a U.S. Open in 7 years. Mr. Campbells win is yet another chapter in a proud tradition of excellence in international sports for New Zealand. The Kiwis have won two of the last three Americas Cup yacht races and netted three gold and two silver medals at last summers Olympic Games in Athens. The competitive spirit and success of these athletes is reflective of the bravery and skill of New Zealands indigenous seagoing explorers. the Maori. of whom Michael Campbell is a descendent. Mr. Campbells victory in the U.S. Open also provides us with the opportunity to reflect on our relationship with New Zealand and at the same time to shape the future of our friendship. Staunch allies in the two World Wars in the 20th century. New Zealand and its people have made tremendous sacrifices and heroic efforts to help protect freedom and democracy in the world. Those efforts continue today. as New Zealand contributes regularly to international peacekeeping operations. remains steadfast in their alliance in the fight against terrorism. and has helped to reconstruct a new. democratic Iraq. Even though there have been some bumps in the roadthe deterioration of the AustraliaNew ZealandUnited States alliance comes to mindNew Zealand has been a great friend and an enduring ally over the years. It is my hope that we will continue to foster this friendship. On that note. I commend Michael Campbell and the nation of New Zealand for this momentous victory and express arohanui to the peoples of Aotearoa. our friends in the Land of the Long White Cloud.",

Like many of North Dakotas towns and cities. Jud began with the railroad. The Northern Pacific Railroad reached the present day site of Jud in 1903 and drew up a plot for the town of Gunthorpe. Shortly following this. the towns name was changed to Jud. Between 1905 and 1911 a plethora of businesses sprang up. Among other businesses. the town once had a weekly newspaper. a pool hall and even its own baseball team. Today. Jud boasts a number of businesses including The Jud Caf6.

In 1980. he was appointed county sheriff. and the people of Humphreys County reelected him to that position again and again. Sheriff Toungette has been instrumental in cleaning up the numerous methamphetamine labs that have sprouted up as Humphreys County and other communities across the country have fought to control the spread of the dangerous drug. Humphreys County has been a leader in combating meth. and Ronnies efforts on that front should not go unnoticed. Toungette and his wife. Darlene. have five grown children. Ronnie. Jr.. Stephanie.

Terrorism is never acceptable.\" The attacks have been attributed to LashkareTaiba. a Kashmid organization. One thing you have to say about Lashkar. though: normally. they take responsibility for what they do. But as Dr. Aulakh pointed out. they have not done so in this instance and the attack fits the pattern of the kinds of attacks carded out by the Indian govemment and its operatives. which the Council of Khalistan details in the release. These include the Air India bombing. the many attacks on Christian groups. the Gujarat massacre. and the fact that as the Washington Times reported. India is sponsoring crossborder terrorism in Sindh. These are not the acts of a responsible democracy. This kind of activity is the mark of a terrorist state. Mr. Speaker.

The mental health impact of this horrifying event. it cannot be measured in dollars. If trauma can disable even those who are trained for battle. we have seen police officers commit suicide already because of what they have witnessed. who can begin to even calculate the fallout on those who are most vulnerable. those who suffered trauma in the past. those who deal with mental illness every single day? In addition. there is an extreme need for those with mental illnesses who have become evacuees themselves. Untreated. their diseases can be debilitating or even fatal under extreme stress. I know that efforts are under way by SAMPHSA and FEMA and many private organizations to meet the mental health needs today and in the future. but I also know that there are never enough resources when it comes to mental health. even in the best of times. So I look forward to working with the committee to make sure that these and other needs are met in this bill.",

One year ago. this Congress responded to an unprecedented event. four hurricanes striking a State within 2 months in Florida. Little did we know that a year later this Nation would be tested beyond what we saw in Florida. Not quite 2 weeks ago now. we saw the fury and destruction that Mother Nature can unleash and we all watched as not just homes and communities were destroyed but entire cities. The images on television were horrific. I do not know a single heart in America that is not breaking as we watch hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens become victims to the worst natural disaster in the Nations history. There has been much debate. fingerpointing in the press about who is to blame for problems with relief efforts. about who allowed such a human disaster to happen. This is an important question and one to which we must find answers. but at the appropriate time. Right now. it is time to finish the job of rescuing human beings from harms way. to comfort those that have lost all of their possessions. and to help them find a sense of comfort and normalcy. This bill will provide the beginnings to do just that. We do not know yet what the total disaster costs will be. but we want to assure the victims and the Nation that we will do everything in our power to help them recover. Just an idea. Mr. Speaker. in World War I we had a thing called Liberty Bonds. I think it is time we thought about perhaps having Katrina Bonds. A lot of people are wanting to help across the Nation. This would be a way for every individual. if they chose. to find a way to help the victims of this great. horrible disaster. So I recommend that we think of that. establishment of K savings bonds.",

We understand the need for giving relief and aid to the victims as quickly as possible. I also understand that was the reason the administration requested inclusion of this provision in the supplemental. While the provision in the bill only deals with the immediate rescue and relief operations. I am concerned that. moving forward. we ensure that small businesses. particularly those in the impacted gulf areas. are able to play a significant role in the recovery.

One other point. The news media has talked often about those who were left behind in New Orleans. They are easy to see because the cameras are there and we can see the dead bodies floating in the water. But there are millions of other Americans in and outside of the region who are also being left behind in our schools. They are being left behind in health care. They are being left behind on Medicaid. I would hope that this Congress would have the decency to set aside its plans to provide billions of dollars in additional tax cuts for the most wealthy and the most prosperous and comfortable among us while the needs of so many are so apparent and while so many Americans are indeed still being left behind in the affected area and in other regions of our country.

I want to emphatically express my full support for aiding those lives and those cities devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Having been to Baton Rouge. having physically worked with the victims. there is no doubt in my mind that these people need our help. However. Mr. Speaker. we should help them in a responsible and thoughtful manner. There is no question that time is of the essence. but we are not talking about pocket change. $50 billion is not pocket change. Mr. Speaker. and fellow members of this body. we have a Constitutional duty to spend the peoples money very carefully and with deliberate consideration. Even in times of crisis. a blank check does not guarantee results and can often lead to wasteful spending. Wasteful spending will not save one life. Wasteful spending will not rebuild one destroyed house. will not clear one single road. and will not feed one starving child. Furthermore. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues in both this House and especially in the Senate to refrain from tacking on any pork. This supplemental should not be a gravy train for any special or individual interests. Every member of this body should condition their support of this supplemental upon strict oversight and follow up with sound policy changes. We cannot just throw billions of dollars at this catastrophe or any catastrophe for that matter. Mr. Speaker. we need to followup these dollars with thorough oversight and investigation to make sure that every penny. I repeat. every penny goes to help the victims. And. we need to cut down every unnecessary piece of red tape in the process. such as suspending the requirements of the DavisBacon Act to help the reconstruction of this devastated area. Lets untie the hands of those who are ready to help and rebuild. We have enough obstacles to overcome as it is. We dont need any kind of bureaucratic surcharge on saving lives. Mr. Speaker. I want to again caution my colleagues. Lets get help to the people in need but lets do so in a responsible and sound manner. The American people expect no less of us. and we owe them no less.",

I might mention only $1.4 billion has been appropriated for all of California. seven times the population. So we have been truly focusing upon that region.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. today. I am introducing the Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal Land Conveyance Act of 2005. The origins ot the bill stretch back to The Flood Control Act of 1944 which authorized a 190.000 acre irrigation project surrounding the Oahe dam and reservoir. As part of this project. the Bureau of Reclamation acquired approximately 19.000 acres of land in two South Dakota counties before organized opposition halted the project in 1977. Since then. the Bureau of Reclamation has retained ownership of the land and. even today. the original landowners continue to lease the land from the department. Recognizing that the project will not be restarted. the State of South Dakota initiated talks to resolve the ownership situation. Working with the South Dakota Department of Game Fish and Parks. local stakeholders. the Bureau of Reclamation. and others. a general consensus emerged that the best way to deal with the associated economic. tax base. wildlife mitigation. and public access concerns would be to allow the original landowners to buy back the land. Years of negotiations and meetings led to the bill I am introducing today. Under this bill. former Blunt Reservoir and Pierre Canal landowners would be allowed to repurchase their former lands. on which they currently hold preferential leases. from the Bureau of Reclamation. The bill also will transfer non -preferentiallyleased lands and unleased lands to the South Dakota Department of Game. Fish. and Parks. GFP. as part of its broader plan to restore wildlife habitat that was lost due to the construction of the Missouri River dams. The proposals in this legislation were included in an identical bill that passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year. This legislation is an important opportunity to resolve a land ownership issue left open for over 3 decades. I urge my colleagues in the House to give this bill their swift consideration.",

LEAHY. COLEMAN. CANTWELL. SALAZAR. KERRY and COBURN. has a single purpose: to ensure continuing. vigorous oversight of American tax dollars in Iraq by repealing the premature termination date for the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR). This legislation would restore SIGIRs termination date to its previous schedule of 10 months after 80 percent of Iraq reconstruction funds have been expended. It would repeal conference language in the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill that would close SIGIR on October 1. 2007. and transfer oversight to the Inspectors General of the Departments of State. Defense. and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Departmental and agency Inspectors General perform an important service with dedication and expertise. However. those offices are configured to provide audits. inspections. and investigations of continuing government operations. The traditional approach of IG oversight--extensive inquiries. lengthy preparation and delivery of reports. recommendations for corrective actionis thorough. But it also is timeconsuming and can allow wasteful or fraudulent practices to continue for some time. Iraq reconstruction is a unique situation. with enormous amounts of money being spent in a relatively short period of time on a specific range of programs and operations. A number of agencies across the federal government are active in Iraq reconstruction. including the Department of Defense. the Department of State. the U.S. Agency for International Development. the Department of Justice and others. Reconstruction managers. and ultimately the taxpayers. do not have the luxury of waiting months to receive recommendations to correct wasteful or fraudulent practices. Oversight of Iraq reconstruction requires that the Inspector General be able to cross departmental boundaries and deliver the results of his work quickly and efficiently. Effective oversight of Iraq reconstruction requires the unique approach provided by the SIGIR. Special Inspector General Stuart Bowen described this approach in testimony before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in a hearing on August 2. SIGIRs auditors and inspectors provide onthespot guidance to managers as soon as problems are discovered. so corrective action can begin immediately. This \"real time\" method allows most of his reports to document not only how problems were detected. but also how they were corrected.",

I am pleased that today the Senate has agreed to pass S. 3501. a bill to amend the Shivwits Band of the Palute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act to establish an acquisition fund for the water rights and habitat acquisition program. with an amendment that I have also offered. This bill amends the Shivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act. enacted in 2000. which ratified a negotiated settlement of the Shivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribes water entitlement to flow from the Santa Clara River in UT. S. 3501 was introduced to address a deficiency in the original statutory language of the Shivwits Water Rights Settlement Act. Section 10 of that Act authorized a water rights and habitat acquisition program. Congress appropriated $3 million that was authorized by Section 10. When the Department of the Interior attempted to implement the law. the Treasury Department advised that the language in Section 10 was insufficient for this purpose. The Treasury Department and Department of the Interior developed technical correction language to address this deficiency in the original statutory language. S. 3501 facilitates this correction in the Shivwlts Water Rights Settlement Act. However. subsequent to approval of this measure by the Indian Affairs Committee. the Congressional Budget Office determined that the language developed by Treasury and Interior. as reflected in S. 3501. could be interpreted to authorize an additional $3 million to the Acquisition Fund and thereby increase direct spending. Therefore. I have offered an amendment with the bill in an effort to avoid any ambiguity in S. 3501 concerning prior appropriations for the Acquisition Fund. The amendment strikes the potentially ambiguous language in the bill. and inserts new language. to the affect. that funds transferred to the Acquisition Fund are funds made available but not expended. The technical amendment therefore avoids the possibility of any redundant appropriations. keeping S. 3501 budget neutral. as was originally intended. and fully implements Section 10 of the Shivwits Band of Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Settlement Act of 2000.",

Father Val is a native Nebraskan and has been the fourth executive director for Girls and Boys Town USA. with 20 years of service to Girls and Boys Town. Father Peter is renowned as one of the principal supporters of youth in the world. Father Peter once said. \"We are like strong swimmers. When a child is floundering. we have a moral obligation to plunge in and help the child out of harms way. Girls and Boys Town is not only to save children from harm but to make them whole again so they can become a strong. positive force that will touch other lives.\" As the Bibles Book of Psalms. chapter 127. verses 3 through 5 says: \"Behold. children are a blessing from the Lord. Like the arrows in the hand of a warrior. so are the children of ones youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.\" Father Val is undoubtedly one of the happiest and most devoted men I have ever had the privilege to meet. Father Val Peter began his service to Girls and Boys Town in 1985. Twenty years later. as he now nears his retirement. the following words he wrote about Girls and Boys Towns ongoing work have never rung truer: \"In the midst of apathy. we bring enthusiasm. In the midst of despair. we bring hope. In the midst of burdensome bureaucracies. we bring an entrepreneurial spirit. In the midst of violence. we bring the hope of peace.\" Father Val Peter has earned the gratitude of thousands of children and families across America. Madam Speaker.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today in strong favor of abolishing one of the most unjustified taxes we have in America today: the death tax. Americans should not have to talk to their undertaker and their tax man on the same day. Small businesses and family farms should not be forced to close down in order to pay the Government money because a loved one has passed away. Unfortunately. I see this happening when I travel back to Kentucky every week. We are not looking out for our economy or our very own people when we charge them for inheriting the American dream. The mom and pop diner on the corner of our town squares and thirdgeneration farms in our rural areas are being unduly burdened by a repressive Tax Code. In fact. many are forced to close their doors or sell out. just so they can afford what the Government says they owe. Americas prosperity was created by our entrepreneurial spirit. but today it is estimated that 70 percent of all businesses never make it past the first generation. while 87 percent do not make it to the third generation. and only 1 percent make it to the fourth generation. Why? One of the big reasons is the burden of the death tax. We call this tax the death tax not only because of the time that it strikes often unsuspecting families but also because it kills American businesses and jobs. The ridiculous complexities of the death tax actually favor individuals whose tax lawyers and accountants plan for years to shield money",

Without so much as a hearing. debate. or markup in the Finance Committee. the majority is bringing the largest tax bill that will be before us this Congress with the clear intent of not allowing the minority any reasonable opportunity to amend it. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that repeal of the estate tax will require roughly $370 billion in debt financing through 2016. although a more accurate cost of 10 years of enactment is closer to $1 trillion when interest on the debt is calculated into the equation. At a time when interest rates are being raised steadily to address inflationary fears. it is hardly the time for our Government to be adding to our national debt in this magnitude for tax relief",

I also want to alert my colleagues to the fact that a new substitute amendment has been drafted which incorporates legislative language negotiated between Senator INOUYE and myself and officials from the Executive Branch to address policy concerns regarding the liability of the United States in land claims. the impact of the bill on military readiness. gaming. and civil and criminal jurisdiction in Hawaii. While I realize that we will not consider the substitute amendment until we get to the actual consideration of the bill.

Congress has historically treated Native Hawaiians. for more than a hundred years. in a manner similar to American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Mrs. Parks refusal to surrender her bus seat triggered the first organized actions in the civil rights movement. Because of her action that day. Mrs. Parks will always be remembered as the \"mother of the civil rights movement.\" Rosa Parks was bom in Tuskegee. Alabama on February 4. 1913. As a girl. she wrote. \"I had a very strong sense of what was fair.\" She led a life dedicated to improving civil rights and acted as an inspiration to many Americans. On December 1. 1955. Mrs. Parks sat in an unreserved section of a city bus. When asked to give up her seat for a white man she politely refused. It is a common misconception that Rosa Parks was unwilling to give up her seat because she was tired from a long day at work. As she told it. \"the only tired I was. was tired of giving in.\" Mrs. Parks act of civil disobedience is the popular inspiration that led to Martin Luther King Jr.s decision to lead a bus boycott that lasted an amazing 381 days. On November 13. 1956. in an important victory for the civil rights movement. the Supreme Court outlawed segregation on buses. The civil rights movement would experience many important victories. but Rosa Parks will always be remembered as its catalyst. Mrs. Parks was a shy. soft spoken woman who was uncomfortable being revered as a symbol of the civil rights movement. She only hoped to inspire young people to achieve great things. However. in 1996 her place in U.S. history was cemented when she was awarded the nations highest civilian honor. the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. Mrs. Parks passed away October 24th at the age of 92. at her home in Detroit. Rosa Parks will be remembered for her lasting contributions to society.

The Canton area. the electric. the Canton area in the Northeast Corridor needs to be maintained as well. Witness the blackout just 2 weeks ago. We need to have a modern. efficient. dependable rail passenger service in the United States. The only way we can do it is to fund it. It is the most efficient way to carry people. And I must say that no system in any industrialized country in the world is profitable. They are all subsidized. It is part of the cost of doing business.

Mr. Chairman. the Ground Hog Day. We have been through this debate over and over. and we keep putting more and more taxpayer dollars into Amtrak. And I have no problem with subsidizing mass transit or any type of long distance service or high speed service. We will need to subsidize it. But. folks. Amtrak has been and remains out of control. I served on the Rail Subcommittee for most of my time in Congress. Let us just review. if we give them a little bit more money. where that is going to go. Right now we subsidize every ticket for $47. That is absolutely outrageous. ladies and gentlemen. In fact. some tickets are subsidizedI have the report right here. the latest information627. Could you imagine that type of subsidy? They will tell you. oh. we give it to airlines. That is not true. No one is subsidized like Amtrak is. Food service. For every dollar that we take in in food service on Amtrak. it costs the taxpayers $2. That is it. just give them a little bit more money and things work out. Legal services. They spend more money on legal services than they do on equipment. The debt has risen to some $6 or $7 billion. The maintenance backlog is between $5 and $6 billion. So even if you add additional money. whoever is in this well 1 year from now will be back here trying to feed the Amtrak monster. We must have the reforms. Some of them are in the bill. The committee has done a great job in trying to get their attention. to try to get their finances in order. Their finances and accounting is worse than Enrons.

Last year. in particular. we had a very strong and vigorous debate in which we were threatened with a veto at one point and demanded reforms. This $900 million allocation is a shutdown number for Amtrak. and it would come at the worst possible time to shut down Amtrak. This is because it is part of those reforms. Amtrak was required to institute new acting procedures. It was required to institute new service contracts and plans. It was required to put in place a new business plan. The Department of Transportation Inspector General just issued a report from September 2005 to March 2006. Amtrak has saved in excess of $19 million with the institution of these new reform plans that we demanded of them. To now shut them down would go back on our word. Let me also say that Amtrak promotes fuel conservation. At this time. when we are all sensitive about that. it is something that we ought to consider.

There are two differences between this proposal and the current law. Under current law. the surplus in the Social Security fund is invested aggregately in what are called Social Security Trust Bonds. Those are government bonds. except they are not marketable. and they are not in any individuals names. The proposal that some Members of the House of Representatives propounded this week is to allow an individual to take parts of their individual payroll tax and invest it in a government security. a U.S. Treasury security in their name. which would be a marketable security. I think this proposal is long overdue. and I rise first in strong support of the Presidents proposal to reform our Social Security program and In the proposal that the Members of the House have put forward.",

I am very pleased to say that the Violence Against Women Act has been a success in terms of protecting women. but the statistics on domestic violence remain alarming. Nearly one in four women experiences at least one physical assault by a partner during her adulthood. It is important that we stand united in protecting women across America. I am delighted that two of my provisions will be included in this legislation containing issues on DNA and trafficking. We can stand together to protect women around America. and I hope this Congress will be wise enough to move this legislation along quickly so that we can stamp out the devastation of violence against women. As women are violated. children are impacted. and protecting families means protecting women. it means having strong laws. Support the Violence Against Women reauthorization for it to be reauthorized and to be able to stand tall against violence and to stand for protecting the sanctity of the family and our children.",

While I commend the Committee on Appropriations for rejecting the Presidents Strengthening Americas Communities Initiative. which would have transferred the Community Development Block Grant from HUD to the Department of Commerce for consolidation of 17 other programs. I am concerned with the gross underfunding of HUD programs in this bill. The good and decent people around this Nation need to know that the Department of Housing and Urban Developments programs are primarily designed to address the housing and community development needs of disadvantaged communities. Unfortunately. the House bill slashed its funding for a number of vital Federal programs that have been central to the revitalization efforts underway in our Nations cities. including Kansas City. Lees Summit. and Independence. Missouri. The bill proposes to fund CDBG at $250 million below fiscal year 2005 levels and provide zero funding for important programs such as section 108 loans. Youthbuild. Brownfields. Hope VI. and Empowerment Zones. Mr. Speaker. I ask that my colleagues join me in opposing these cuts. While we have all heard the Administration tout national homeownership rates. it is confusing because the House majority has proposed cutting programs that are designed to increase the homeownership rates for lowerincome and minority households.

That legislation took some muchneeded and longoverdue steps toward strengthening the system ot intelligence sharing and analysis in the United States. The bill implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report. a comprehensive collection of analyses and suggestions for improving the Nations intelligence system. in order that we might never experience another 9/11. H.R. 418. if enacted. would repeal some provisions of the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. It would rob States of the ability to issue drivers licenses and identification cards as they see fit. and further subjects the States to unfunded mandates to conform their drivers licenses and identification cards to federal standards. Police forces around the Nation are notably opposed to H.R. 418. They have grave security concerns surrounding the drivers license provisions of this legislation. the job of law enforcement is made easier when the state Department of Motor Vehicles database contains information on undocumented immigrants. As a former district attorney. I place a high priority on assisting law enforcement however possible. The asylum provisions included in this legislation are unnecessary. and will not enhance our national security. The provisions needlessly restrict the standards by which motives for persecution would qualify for asylum. I believe such a move could potentially exacerbate and multiply human rights abuses around the world by making it more difficult for victims of such abuses to seek refuge in the United States. Opposition to H.R. 418 includes a vast array of organizations. from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the American Conservative Union to the National Council of State Legislatures.

The United States is a beacon of hope for those around the world seeking safety. freedom and equality. It is vital that we remain that way.

The bill would require the asylum seeker to show documentation of their torture. This would reverse years of precedent that allow a credible testimony to be proof of their case.

Alexander holds an important place within North Dakotas history. It began on July 24. 1905. when the city was platted by Frank B. Chapman. That same year. a wide variety of businesses were constructed in the town. including the Dakota Trading Company Store. the Alexander State Bank. and the Alexander Hotel.

In 1918. the town suffered a devastating fire. however. the town rebuilt and continued to grow. Today. Alexander remains a proud community with an economy bolstered by farming. ranching. and oil extraction. In the citys park. hamburgers are served every summer Saturday evening. The town is also home to the Lewis and Clark Trail Museum. which is housed in the old school house. Each room in the museum highlights a different and unique view of the areas history. Mr. President.

Mr. Reiners will have served his country for almost 40 years. both in the military and through his public service on behalf of our Nations veterans. During his tenure at the Regional VA Office in Sioux Falls. Gale provided important counsel and advice to veterans. family members. VA officials. veterans service officers. and congressional members and their staff on a range of issues. Throughout that time. he has witnessed many changes in the VA. and has been diligent in assisting veterans with their questions. needs and issues. He has helped educate all those concerned about the everchanging scope of the veterans benefits program. Gale wanted to retire 18 months ago but was persuaded to continue his duties at the VA. At the time he announced his retirement. the VA regional offices in North Dakota and South Dakota were working to combine various veterans services. Gales experience and knowledge of those programs proved invaluable during the transition period. Mr. Reiners is a man of passion and integrity who takes his responsibility to South Dakota veterans very seriously. It will be difficult to find someone more knowledgeable than Mr. Reiners on the wide array of benefit and resource programs available to veterans. My staff has worked with Gale and his colleagues at the regional office in Sioux Falls on numerous issues impacting veterans and their families. Gale always addressed each inquiry with professionalism. I commend his dedication and commitment to making sure every veterans case or question was always handled in a timely manner. The State of South Dakota will miss Gale Reiners leadership. After 35 years of service. Mr Reiners will be spending more time with his wife Patty. and their 4 children.

    "speech": "Act would allow investors in mutual funds to keep more retirement savings invested longer and growing longer by deferring taxation of automatically reinvested capital gains until fund shares are sold. rather than allowing those longterm gainswhich generate no current income or cash in handto be taxed every year. To understand how beneficial this bill would be. it is important to understand the role of mutual funds in longterm retirement savings. Among households owning mutual funds. 92 percent are investing for retirement. with more than 70 percent saying their primary purpose in investing in funds is to prepare for retirement. Many of todays workers do not yet have in place the retirement savings supplement to Social Security that will prepare them for the future. In fact. almost half of American workers--nearly 71 million of 151 million workersare not offered any form of pension or retirement savings plan at work. Meanwhile. the number of years spent In retirement is growing and the costs individuals can expect to bear in retirement are growing. too. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that an individual retiring at age 65 in 2014 will need $285.000 just to cover health coverage premiums and expenses. Individual savings efforts also face significant obstacles. Those not covered by an employers retirement plan. for example. can set aside a deductible IRA contribution of only $4.000 this year-$4.500 if they are age 50 or older. Mutual funds are a hugely important part of American workers preparation for retirement. both through their employers retirement plans and on their own. Mutual funds now make up half of the $3.2 trillion held by American workers through 401(k) plans and other similar jobbased savings programs. About 34 million American households hold mutual funds through their defined contribution plans. More than 30 million American households are saving through taxable mutual fund accounts. either as supplements to their employers plans or because they do not have such plans.",

    "speech": "Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the PostDisaster Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This bill is designed to prohibit price gouging of oil or gas products in the immediate aftermath of a declared disaster. Hurricane Katrina had a devastating affect on the major oil and natural gas producing region of our Nation. This natural disaster has exposed our Nations vulnerability to even shortterm disruptions anywhere in the supply chain. Oil production curtailments. refinery shutdowns or pipeline disruptions can all cause price spikes in gasoline. diesel and aviation fuel. Directly following Hurricane Katrina. extreme price volatility of gasoline throughout the United States led to accusations of price gouging. Reports were made of individual retailers charging as much as $5.87 a gallon for gas. Even in my State of Oregon. which is less reliant on Gulf of Mexico production. prices spiked in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. This bill declares that for the 30 days following the Presidents declaration of a disaster. it will be unlawful to engage in price gouging of oil or gas products for sale in the affected area. or of oil and gas products produced in the affected area for sale in interstate commerce. In addition. this bill authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to determine what represents a gross disparity in pricing and to prevent violations under this act using its authorities under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Those authorities include seeking civil penalties of $11.000 per violation: assessing fines or repayment of illegal gains. freezing assets. and seeking preliminary injunctions. cease and desist orders or temporary restraining orders. Drastic increases in oil and gas products have a negative impact on consumers and businesses. That is why we must have a system in place that discourages price gouging in the wake of a disaster. and allows enough time for markets to return to normal.

I rise today to join with Ambassador Evans and other public officials who have affirmed the truth and recognize that reconciling with the past is an important first step in creating a better future. Recognition of the Armenian Genocide is widely acknowledged. One hundred and twentysix Holocaust scholars publicly affirmed the incontestable fact of the Armenian Genocide during the 30th Anniversary of the Scholars Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches. And in 1981. former President Ronald Reagan stated: \"Like the genocide of the Armenians before it. and the genocide of the Cambodians which followed itand like too many other such persecutions of too many other peoplesthe lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten.\" In addition. a recent study released by the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) on the use of the term Armenian Genocide and the applicability of the 1948 Genocide Convention to events which occurred during the early twentieth century in Ottoman Turkey. found that \"the Events. viewed collectively. can thus be said to include all of the elements of the crime of genocide as defined in the Convention. and legal scholars as well as historians. politicians. journalists and other people would be justified in continuing to so describe them.\" As we approach the 90th commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. we must ensure that we do not forget the lessons of the past. Archbishop Desmond Tutu. in the Preface to the Encyclopedia of Genocide. published in 1999 by the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem. writes: \"It is sadly true what a cynic has said. that we learn from the history that we do not learn from history. And yet it is possible that if the world had been conscious of the genocide that was committed by the Ottoman Turks against the Armenians. the first genocide of the twentieth century. then perhaps humanity might have been more alert to the warning signs that were being given before Hitlers madness was unleashed on an unbelieving world.\" Mr. Speaker. let us never forget and let us affirm the truth.",

This legislation would bring all other types of debt in line with the requirements for repaying student loans. The U.S. government should have the ability to collect each and every debt.

And the North Sea has numerous offshore rigs. Most of them built by. of course. Texans. and they can do so in a safe manner. We can drill offshore in a safe manner. We can drill in an environmentally safe manner. No one wants polluted air or water. I think the day has come now where we have to get rid of the unnecessary and abusive regulations so we can drill offshore. It will not only bring us natural gas. crude oil for gasoline. but it will bring an income to the American public. because when the Federal Government leases offshore. oil companies pay for those leases. And some estimate that the American Treasury could receive up to $7 billion a year by leasing in those areas where we have not leased before.

As our troops return home from active duty service. a growing number of them are unable to return to the jobs they left behind. In the transition back to civilian life. they are encountering problems ranging from difficulties finding employment to being passed over for promotions to getting laid off under suspicious circumstances. The Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) provides these veterans with the resources and services they need to make the transition from military to civilian life. VETS provides veterans with valuable training and job placement services as well as protecting the employment and reemployment rights of veterans. Reservists and National Guard Members. With the influx of returning soldiers. the Veterans Employment and Training Service needs additional resources to meet the growing demands of our veterans. More and more veterans will be looking for employment. which means increased demands for both job training and placement services as well as assistance with any discrimination claims. This amendment will address these issues by providing $5 million to the Veterans Employment and Training Service so they have the money they need to meet the needs of our returning troops. Of this funding. $3 million will go to the Veterans Workforce Investment Program which provides employment services to recently separated and serviceconnected disabled veterans. This program is currently funded at $7.5 million. a $1 million cut from last year. At a time when more and more soldiers are returning home and looking for jobs. we need to be providing more funding for this vital initiative. not less.

The cuts in education. energy assistance. and healthcare services are signs of what I believe are an unraveling of our economic tapestry. Our youngest and most vulnerable citizens will be disproportionately affected by Federal fiscal budget constraints in this Labor. Health and Human Services bill.

Beyond health care. our most vulnerable citizens will continue to bear the brunt of enormous tax cuts in education. Title I funding. aimed at helping lowincome children in failing schools improve their reading and math skills. will be $9.9 billion below the No Child Left Behind funding promise.

With 45 million uninsured Americans. we cannot afford to eliminate programs targeted at meeting the needs of the uninsured or remove the support systems that exist for those doctors and nurses who are serving in areas where there is a shortage of professional health services. Furthermore. in a time when scientists are just beginning to make meaningful progress on the projects they began between 1998 and 2003. it is irresponsible to fund NIH at a level 2.6 percent short of what they need to keep up with inflation in research costs. Under this legislation. NIH will be able to support about 505 fewer research grants than just two years earlier. Finally. with a record 55 million children in public schools and state budgets stretched thin. this bill proposes to cut No Child Left Behind funding by $806 million. leaving 3.1 million lowincome children behind.

Kennedy Stadium. the Republican baseball team defeated the Democrats by a score of 1910. We most appreciate everybodys participation. Mr. Speaker. this was the largest crowd in the history of this vaunted contest that goes back. in the modern era. some 45 years. We had almost 6.000 spectators. The winners in this contest were not the Republicans. really. but the charities that were involved that will benefit greatly. We raised about $125.000 for the Boys and Girls Club of Washington and the Adult Literacy Council. I want to thank all of the players who participated. particularly KEVIN BRADY. the second baseman for the Republican squad. who was voted our MVP. KEVIN has had a checkered career recently. The last two seasons before this. he did not last through the first inning because of injuries. This year he played the entire game and had a couple of hits and played well in the field and was voted our MVP. Our congratulations also go to JAY INSLEE from the Evergreen State who played magnificently at third base for the Democrats and was awarded the MVP award by the manager of the Democratic team. my good friend. MARTIN SABO. a great sportsman and a real leader. We enjoyed the game immensely. I want to publicly thank the gentleman from Maryland for hosting us for so many years up in Bowie. but we had an opportunity. as he knows. to move to the major league ballpark. and to play in a major league ballpark. I think I speak for all of our players. was like getting our youth back. at least for 2 or 3 hours out there in that contest.

But I have to say. how did something that both of these Senators. the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Iowa. supported vigorously in the 1990s suddenly become a Feingold regime? These are the paygo rules of the 1990s. This is not some new scheme or new approach. These are exactly the rules we had before that both parties worked together on and used to balance the budget. Both Senators suggest that this is goingto prevent tax cuts. I ask them: How in the world. then. did we have the 1997 tax cut bill? If this regime. as they call it. prevents tax cuts. how did that happen? These rules were in place at that time. These rules dont prevent tax cuts. These rules just say. either you pay for them or you get 60 votes. Last year there were a number of middle class tax cuts I supported. They received something like over 90 votes. We didnt prevent those tax cuts. They simply met a standard that was easily met of 60 votes. The Senator from Iowa has mischaracterlzed this amendment grossly when he says it doesnt affect spending. It is my amendment that puts some rules back on mandatory spending. It is my amendment that covers mandatory spending. The reason why we had a $400billion unfunded Medicare bill last year is because the current rules were in place rather than the amendment I have offered. This relates to spending as well as taxes. The entire argument that somehow this isnt evenhanded. that it only applies to taxes and not to spending is absolutely false. That might be why we have four or five Republican cosponsors because they would never support something that favors spending over tax cuts. It is very troubling when we have a debate and the debate is not about what is actually before us. What is before us is rules that have worked before. rules that relate to spending and taxes and merely require us to be responsible. I now very happily yield 15 minutes to my cosponsor.

How can speaker after speaker come out and say this requirement of 60 votes to go beyond the budget is preventing a tax cut? That is not the fact of what has happened. In 1997. under these very rules. significant tax cuts were enacted. I correct the Senator from Arizona regarding his statement that the rule was different then. That is untrue. He was talking about the statute. This is the rule. It does not have sequestering. That is simply inaccurate. Last year. when the question was. Do we continue the middleclass tax cuts. we voted on it. and I think it got 90 votes for the middleclass tax cuts. well over 30 votes over the 60vote requirement. How can someone say a rule of 60 votes for tax cuts somehow prevents tax cuts. The Senator from Mississippi talks about the need to deal with the alternative minimum tax. He Is absolutely right.

A lawsuit was filed by the slaughter houses. Remember. they are foreignowned. Belgian. Dutch and French. In that lawsuit. the slaughter houses owned by the foreign companies won that lawsuit because the Federal judge said that this is an interstate commerce issue. and there is Federal preemption involved. and if you are going to shut down slaughter houses in operation in interstate commerce. then the U.S. Congress has to act. Now this bill came before the Energy and Commerce Committee because of the lack of action on the Ag Committee for many years. They never wanted it to see the light of day. I would urge Members to vote for H.R. 503. As I have said before. the unwanted horse argument is not a real argument because horses being slaughtered are not unwanted. To think that we would have the responsibility of reimbursing owners who are overbreeding. who have the responsibility to take care of their own horses. they make it appear that the government has that responsibility. Owners have their own responsibility. Private property rights. this bill protects private property rights. Because of the number of horses being stolen. we are protecting those private property rights. This bill allows an owner. a rancher or farmer who owns a horse to do whatever he wants to with the horse. He can shoot it or slaughter it and eat it himself.

I understand and appreciate the views of its proponents. many of them in Colorado. who are distressed about the fact that three slaughterhouses in this country are in the business of preparing horse flesh for human consumptionprimarily in other countries. The bills supporters do not think this is appropriate. and that Congress should exercise its authority over interstate commerce in order to put an end to this business. That is what this bill is intended to do. I can understand the discomfort many Americans have about consumption of horse flesh. although of course it has been and remains an accepted practice in some places. But emotional concerns cannot be the only guiding force in legislation regarding the way livestock is managed. and prohibiting slaughter of horses for human consumptionthe main market for horse flesh at this timewould have unintended consequences this legislation fails to address. The hearings held by the Agriculture Committee made it clear that there the current horse sanctuaries do not have the capacity to care for the additional unwanted horseswhich otherwise would be handled by slaughterhouses that would result from the bills enactment. That was one reason the committee. on a bipartisan basis reported the legislation unfavorably. I voted for an amendment that would have delayed implementation of the bill until the Agriculture Department determined that adequate sanctuaries were ready. Unfortunately. that amendment was not adopted. Similarly. state and local governmentsincluding the Colorado Department of Agriculture and the Commissioners of Adams County--are concerned that shutting off the slaughterhouse outlet will lead to an increased number of unwanted horses being abandoned and left to be dealt with by local authorities. I am attaching letters from the Colorado Commissioner on Agriculture and Adams County Commissioners who oppose this legislation.

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I rise today in honor of our countrys beloved horses. It is my hope that Congress will pass H.R. 503 unamended. the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act. This bill will end horse slaughter for human consumption in the United States and the cruel practices associated with this inhumane industry. When horses are sold to slaughter they are often transported in overcrowded trucks. deprived of food and water. exposed to the elements and made to stand in their own waste. The slaughter bound horse can be sick or injured but forced to suffer a lack of appropriate veterinary care. The stress that horses are subjected to. both during transportation and at the slaughterhouse. triggers horses natural flight response. At the slaughterhouse a horse can be ineffectively stunned before dismemberment. meaning that a horse may remain conscious while being bound and then elevated by one leg prior to having its throat slit. H.R. 503 encourages responsible horse ownership. For horse owners. who are no longer able or willing to care for a horse. H.R. 503 finds appropriate alternatives to slaughter that may range from finding a new home for the horse to humane euthanasia preformed by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation from the three remaining equine slaughterhouses in the United States show that Americas wild horses have been among their victims. Additional victims include stolen. as well as healthy horses. This legislation will stop the sale of wild. stolen or healthy horses to slaughter houses for human consumption at a profit. The word humane is defined as being marked by compassion. sympathy and consideration for animals. The question we must ask ourselves is if subjecting horses to this kind of circumstance is indeed humane? Is horse slaughter marked by compassion. sympathy and consideration for the animal? The only realistic conclusion is no. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 503 and to oppose all amendments designed to weaken this important bill.",

    "speech": "Madam Chairman. I am proud to have joined 202 of my colleagues in cosponsoring the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act and I rise today in support of its passage. It is time to put a stop to a business that has been allowed to go on for far too long. Many Americans have made their stance on this issue clear: a recent poll shows that almost 7 percent of Americans are in favor of banning horse slaughter. The slaughtering process is one that is shockingly inhumanewhen transported to slaughtering houses. horses are crammed into trucks and may go unfed for as many as 28 hours. Animals that survive this ordeal often die by the captive bolt. an instrument meant to cause immediate trauma to the brain but is often used improperly. resulting in slow and painful deaths. Those who oppose this law believe H.R. 503 will result in an overpopulation of horses. Yet the Department of Agriculture has found that 5.000 horses have been imported to slaughter plants since August 2004. As the Humane Society of the United States rightly observes. there would be no reason to import horses if we have an overpopulation. Opponents of this bill have also warned that horses who would otherwise be slaughtered would not receive adequate care once they are transferred to alternate homes or rescue facilities. But horse rescue groups are required to abide by state and local animal welfare laws. California banned horse slaughter in 1998 and there has been no documented rise in cruelty and neglect cases. Similarly. there was no increase in brutality toward horses following the closing of Illinois only slaughter plant in 2002. There is no reason why the inhumane treatment of these animals should continue. particularly when our horses are being slaughtered solely for the purpose of pleasing foreign diners. I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.",

Horse meat is not eaten in the United States. but it has been exported to overseas markets. such as France. Belgium. Japan and Italy. Animals deserve to be treated humanely. and I do not support this industry. This Congress made its opposition to horse slaughter clear in the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2006. I supported an amendment introduced by Representative SWEENEY and Representative WHITFIELD that would have essentially lied the hands of the horse slaughter industry. Unfortunately the language approved by both the House and Senate. which had the clear intention of ending this industry. was altered in conference and allowed the slaughtering of horses to continue. H.R. 503 would permanently shut down this inhumane practice. This legislation has wide bipartisan support in the House as well as extensive backing from the animal welfare community.

The amendment would very simply say that until the Secretary of Agriculture can certify that sufficient sanctuary space is available to accommodate the unwanted horses created by this bill. the drastic step of a Federal mandate will be delayed. Everyone debating this issue today is dedicated to the best care possible for horses. We profoundly disagree on how to achieve that laudable goal. The cosponsors of this amendment believe it would be a tragedy to take the dramatic step of closing off a humane method of disposal of animals that the owners can no longer care for only to see them abandoned or killed wholesale at greater cost to their owners. If we are to take this drastic step. we should at least ensure that the horses for whom it is being done continue to live out their lives in humane circumstances. Nothing in this amendment would prevent the operation of H.R. 503 as long as there was assurance that a humane living alternative to the current system exists. It is impossible for me September 7. 2006 CONGR[ to believe that the supporters of H.R. 503 intend to replace the death of horses that they decry with abandonment or wholesale death at the hands of their owners. The proponents of this bill have assured us there will be no flood of unwanted horses with no place to go as a result of this bill. If this is true. and reputable organizations like the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Equine Practitioners strongly dispute that. but if it is true. our amendment will be an easy procedural step to meet. If. however. the Association of Equine Practitioners and major horseowning groups who oppose H.R. 503 are correct that hundreds of thousands of unwanted horses with no place to go would be created in just a few years. this amendment can prevent a catastrophe for horses in this country.

So if you are in favor of the ban of horse slaughter for human consumption. you need to vote against all of the amendments. This number. this establishment of an arbitrary number. is false. It will not be obtained because there are so many other options for horse owners other than horse sanctuary. but lets understand the facts. The current horse population is estimated at 9 million. As has been said. each year. roughly 900.000 horses die. About 90.000. or 1 percent. are actually slaughtered. Furthermore. in 1989. the U.S. slaughtered over 342 horses. In 2005. they slaughtered 90.000. Since then. the United States slaughtered approximately 200.000 fewer horses. So 90.000 horses can be easily absorbed into the population. And not all of these horses will need to be absorbed into rescue and sanctuary populations. Horses will die or become sick or dangerous to their owners. These horses will need to be replaced. These horses will become pets or workhorses or show horses. Both the Bureau of Land Management and hundreds of private organizations and agencies provide adoption programs for people to replace these horses by adopting new ones. Additionally. thousands of these horses are humanely euthanized each year. Madam Chairman. this amendment. this proposal. is simply meant to ensure that this bill is never enacted.

I would point out once again that each year the number of horses that have been slaughtered has been going down. We have gone from 300.000 down to 90.000. There is no evidence that society has had any problem in absorbing these horses. And I would also remind the gentleman many of these horses are stolen. so they are not unwanted horses. There is a need for them. So we know for a fact that the only purpose of any of these amendments is to make this bill ineffective. to kill this bill.

Pt. 13 17363 This is no such thing whatsoever. They say there is no problem with unwanted horses. Then there will be no problem getting a certification that there is sufficient horse sanctuary facilities around the country to take care of them. I strongly dispute that. I think the gentleman from New York and I. while we may disagree on numbers. can agree that 90.000 is 10 percent of 900.000. not 1 percent. But whatever that is. that is a substantial number of unwanted horses. And. remember. the average life expectancy of a horse is 25 years. Many of these horses have many years of life expectancy left in them. so they are going to accumulate over a period of years. In fact. the American Veterinary Medical Association says over 6 years they will grow to 272.000 in number. That is far. far more than the capacity of all the horse sanctuaries around the country that exist today. And there is no sign of their growing rapidly to meet this need because they cannot even meet the current need to take care of the unwanted horses that exist in this country right now as we speak. So I would urge my colleagues to support this very good amendment that will cure a very serious flaw in this legislation. and then we will have the opportunity to see who is correct about how many unwanted horses we are going to have in this country.

In 2001. after several years of intense labor management negotiations. the most comprehensive reform of the railroad retirement system in nearly 2 decades was enacted. The ERISAtype investment trust in which Tier II pension assets are invested has been performing extremely well. Payroll tax rates have gone down for both the railroads and workers. benefits have increased and the Investment trust has experienced a nearly 50 percent growth in asset value in those 5 short years. At the time of the 2001 legislation. we included a retirement that Tier 11 pension benefit checks be issued through a private contractor. This rested on the belief. since proven wrong. that this would be more efficient than continuing the use of the Treasury for this purpose. In fact. the Railroad Retirement Board. the trustees of the investment trust and the Congressional Budget Office have all found that by using an outside disbursing agent. actually costs to the program are increased by $2 million a year more than they would have been if we had used the Treasury. As a temporary expedient. the mandate to use an outside disbursing agent has been legislatively postponed in appropriations measures since 2001. but is it is obviously time to make the correction permanent. H.R. 5074 does this by amending the permanent Railroad Retirement Act to designate the U.S. Treasury as the disbursing agent for the benefits.

We learn that sometimes government can do better and cheaper than the private sector can. I want to repeat that. Sometimes government can do better and cheaper than the private sector can. In 2001. the Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement Act made several changes to the railroad benefit system. including requiring the Railroad Retirement Board to contract with a private firm for distributing Tier IT benefits. However. the Railroad Retirement Board quickly learned that an outside company would cost $3 million more than using the U.S. Treasury Department. Since the 2001 legislation was enacted. the Appropriations Committee has provided a waiver for this requirement. but this bill would permanently make the U.S. Treasury Department the distribution agent for Tier II railroad retirement benefits and end the need for this yearly benefit. This plan was proposed by the Railroad Retirement Board and the Railroad Retirement Investment Trustees and is supported by both railroad management and labor.

Feller was named major league baseballs Player of the Year. On the heels of that season. at a point of great promise and mounting reward. Feller took off the rich colors of his Cleveland Indians and put on the uniform of his country. Two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. he left baseball to enlist in the Navy. Feller fought as an antiaircraft gunner aboard the USS Alabama. He served with valor for 4 years and earned eight battle stars for heroism. His service and sacrifice offer the kind of inspiration that warms peoples hearts. energizes their spirits and awakens their faith in what man and woman can do for his or her country and for their fellow persons. Feller missed nearly four full seasons of the game he loved. but the story of what Feller did upon his return to baseball adds nearly unbelievable athletic feats to the heroism he displayed at sea. \"Bullet Bob.\" as he was called. pitched a second nohitter in 1946. his first full year back as a major league player. He also led the American League in wins. shutouts. strikeouts. games pitched and innings pitched that season. Feller went on to pitch for almost 10 more years and led the league in strikeouts in seven of those years.

He would have 14 agents and he would have a gillion dollars worth of offers from every club in the major leagues because pitching Is such a premium.

Bob Feller comes from a small county west of Des Moines called Dallas County. My family was originally from this county. This county produced a series of very fine athletes in a given era. One was our States great hero. a Helsman trophy winner by the name of Nile Kinnick who lost his life in World War II. Another was a first cousin of Bob Fellers named Hal Manders. Hal also pitched major league baseball. A number of years ago. Bob and Hal visited me here in Washington. and Hal gave me a small gift that I will treasure for the rest of my life. It was a picture of Bob Feller and Hal as ballplayers at about the age of 12. and they were oversized kids on a small team. and across the uniform was marked. I believe. the Braves. And I asked Bob Feller. what was the background of this little league team? And Bob said. you know. we lived kind of in the country. we didnt have a team. so our two fathers who were brothersinlaw started this team. And I said to Bob. well. what would have happened if your father and your uncle didnt start this team? And he said. well. I never would have pitched ball again. And it is kind of a beautiful story for all of us. because what he was saying was that Bob Feller would not be Bob Feller if he didnt have a father who dedicated some time to starting a little league baseball team. And that is really the American system. the American dream. the American family. I think we give honor to Bob because we give honor not just to a great athlete. but to the idea of sport and to the idea and the ideals of American competition. which he has always reflected the best of. I thank you. Steve. for this moment.",

Obviously. if the McCain amendment did create a private right of action. our amendment would bar the courts from entertaining that action. But the fact alone that the same Congress that adopted the McCain amendment also adopted the Graham/Kyl amendment tends to confirm. I would think. that the McCain amendments never were intended to create a private right of action in the first place. As a matter of fact. the Supreme Court recently has tightened the standards for spontaneously recognizing such actions in cases where Congress is silent on the matterI believe it was in the recent case of Alexander against Sandoval. The McCain amendments do not state that they create a private cause of action. They regulate the conduct our troops rather than creating rights. And we have alternative means of their enforcementas my colleague mentioned. through the system of military disciplineand thus we do not need a private cause of action to be implemented. I would be pretty surprised if. under those circumstances. anyone were to argue that the McCain amendment created a private right of action. So the senior Senator from South Carolina is correct. the GrahamLevinKyl amendment does not take away any cause of action created elsewhere in this bill. because the bill does not create any rights of action. Some members have been arguing that the McCain amendment will establish a standard that perhaps could be employed in another cause of action. That is. of course. true. But if such a cause of action is to exist. Congress will have to create it in the future. No cause of action currently available could serve as a vehicle for enforcing the McCain amendment in a private lawsuit. and I think that all the backers of that amendment consistently agree that the McCain amendments themselves did not create a private right of action. Again. it would be strange to construe this Act as intending such a private action when by the same hand this Congress would take away any forum for asserting such action.",

Id also like to say a word about the timing of this bill because we drafted this section very carefully and I want our colleagues to know exactly what they will be agreeing to. While our language does respond to the Rasul decision by effectively reversing the Supreme Courts decision in that case. we wanted to respect the courts role in this by addressing two different considerations. First. as we stated before. we wanted the CSRT process to yield decisions which will be reviewed by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. And we wanted to be sensitive to the Rasul courts concerns about a process for the detainees. So. what we did was make the substantive provisions governing the CSRTs and ARBs apply to all cases. those pending on or after the enactment date. This was to ensure that every detainee was provided with the same protections and review. Second. regarding the modification of the jurisdiction of those courts currently hearing individual habeas or other actions that have been filed by the detainees. we wanted those cases to be recast as appeals of their CSRT determinations. We believe that is the best way to balance between allowing the detainees to challenge their status. and still allowing effective detention and interrogation techniques. As we all know. a court either has jurisdiction to hear a case or it doesnt. Jurisdiction doesnt attach for all time when the case is filed. This is really no different than transferring a case from one court to another. But in this case. given the change in the substantive law as well. we were required to extinguish these habeas and other actions in order to effect a transfer of jurisdiction over these cases to the DC Circuit Court and substantive legal change as well.",

It states that the bills authorization for limited DC Circuit review of CSRTs and military commissions shall apply to pending cases. Obviously. no pending case seeks judicial review in the DC Circuit pursuant to section 1405. What this paragraph means is that. at the same time that the courts like the DC district courts kick these cases out of their courtrooms. they can also tell them where they should go next. And if. for example. a habeas action currently is in the DC Circuit. that court can simply construe that action as a request for review of the detainees CSRT pursuant to subsection (e) of 1405. and allow that claim to go forward in that form.",

But I cant imagine that the court would take away an authority clearly granted to Congress by the Constitution. regardless of what motive one might attribute to us. I am a member of this body. and would have great difficulty describing some definitive motive or intent to every law that we enact. I dont know how the Supreme Court or any other court could accurately discern such a motive. The laws that we enact have meanings that can be discerned through ordinary rules of construction. I think the rule of law is much more secure when the meaning of legislation is governed by those universally accessible rules of construction rather than through some attempt to psychoanalyze Congresss motive. And in any event. as I recall. this amendment was filed before the Supreme Court even granted review in the Hamdan case.

    "speech": "Yes. my friend from Arizona is correct. our language applies only to Guantanamo just because we understand that the Supreme Court only extended the jurisdiction of the courts over the detainees held at Guantanamo. And since the Rasul decision was based on the habeas statute in the U.S. Code. I am very comfortable amending that statute as a proper congressional response to the Courts decision. As I stated repeatedly to a number of my colleagues. we did not want to deprive the courts of jurisdiction to hear cases filed on behalf of detainees in Iraq because we are confident that. as the law stands now. those cases are already barred by previous Supreme Court decisions. which the Rasul decision left in place. We should always be careful when dealing with our coequal branches. Just as we do not appreciate it when they stray into our areas of constitutional responsibility. we should always be willing to refrain from straying into theirs unnecessarily. As I read the Rasul decision. these other cases from other parts of the world are still subject to the Eisentrager opinion and will not be considered by U.S. courts. And so. our language is limited to Guantanamo. To my friends who counseled that we should extend our jurisdiction modification to those cases being filed on behalf of Iraqis held in accordance with the Geneva Convention. I would just counsel them to be patient. I cannot imagine the Court extending its jurisdiction halfway around the world to involve what is almost exclusively an executive branch function. However. should that become necessary. I am perfectly willing to modify our courts jurisdiction again to ensure that does not happen.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I see that we are nearing the end of our allotted time. If I could quickly address a few other minor issues and summarize briefly. It is important to note that the limited judicial review authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) are not habeascorpus review. It is a limited judicial review of its own nature. All habeas actions are terminated by this bill. I hope that this change will also put to rest any arguments that extending habeas to prisoners also extends to them some type of substantive rights. I do not believe that supposition is correct because habeas is a vehicle for asserting rights. not a source of rights. The fact that an individual has access to habeas does not mean that he has any of the rights that he asserts. But in any event. because this bill leaves no habeas in place. that debate need not be rejoined. Also. some have suggested that by vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the DC circuit for the paragraph 2 and 3 appeals. this bill bars even Supreme Court appellate review. That was not the drafters intention. nor do I believe that it is a correct reading of the legislative language. Supreme Court review is implicit. or rather. authorized elsewhere in statute. for all judicial decisions. It is rarely mentioned expressly. In fact. when it is mentioned. it is sometimes to preempt Supreme Court review. Far example. the limit on successive federal habeas petitions for state prisoners in section 2244 bars petitions for certiorari following a threejudge panels decision on a successivepetition application. The clear implication of these provisions is that Supreme Court review is implicitly allowed except where expressly barred. and thus since it is not barred here. it is allowed.",

We should not wait for the grand jury. This President should root out the corruption and discharge the people responsible for these misdeeds.",

We will continue to work with you for as long as it takes to ensure that the people of your nation are able to live in peace and freedom. On September 21.

Americans rightly wondered. given this poor response to a natural disaster. is our government ready to respond to a terrorist attack? Americans now deserve the answers. and I believe those answers can best come from an independent commission to both identify what went wrong but. more importantly. to find solutions so that this failed response never happens again. Mr. Speaker. this Congress shares with the current administration a weak reputation for oversight. We need only to look back a couple of years to be reminded that it was not Congress nor the White House who demanded an appropriate oversight of 9/11 attacks. Members on the 9/11 Commission have acknowledged it was the families of those lost in the attacks that came to Washington and demanded a thorough review of what went wrong. nl 1215 Mr. Speaker. do we intend to wait for the people of Mississippi.

From the beginning. Buckleys magazine stood \"athwart history. yelling Stop. at a time when no one is inclined to do so. or to have much patience with those who so urged it.\" And for 5 decades. it has bravely and effectively espoused conservative values and ideas. with both humor and intelligence. It is no surprise that since its inception. we have seen widespread acceptance of conservative principles like economic freedom. individual responsibility. and traditional values. Buckley and National Review did much more than \"stand athwart history.\" They helped shape it and America and the world are better for it. I offer a most sincere happy birthday to William Buckley and thank him for his wonderful creation. and I congratulate the family at National Review for 50 years of fine work with hopefully many more years to come.",

Imagine being injured during the hurricane and not having any access to health coverage because your job simply no longer exists. The Federal Medicaid program has helped thousands of gulf coast residents with their health care bills over the last month. Now House Republicans are demanding that we cut Medicaid services. I know Republicans will say we need to make these cuts to address the deficit they created. but if Republicans really wanted to address the budget deficit. they would revisit their giant tax breaks for Americas millionaires. We are really helping the wealthiest elite in our Nation when there are so many people struggling from Hurricane Katrina.

Millions of Iraqis embraced the democratic process and turned out to vote for a new constitution. We will not know the final results until later this week. but the large turnout of voters and the low level of violence are themselves milestones of progress on Iraqs path to democracy. As Prime Minister Jaafari said. \"The victory for Iraq is that Iraqis are voting.\" More than 60 percent of registered voters turned out in the Sunni majority Ninewah Province compared to 17 percent in Januarys election. The higher turnout is an important change and a tribute to our political strategy which includes continued outreach to Sunni leaders. Additionally. this strong Sunni participation is evidence of a desire on their part to reject insurgent violence and place their trust in the democratic process. In addition. we know Saturdays violence did not even come close to the 347 electionday attacks reported in the January election. Mr. Speaker.

We went on a Presidential Mission to subSaharan Africa in late March of 1999 to focus specifically on children orphaned by AIDS. We visited Zambia. Uganda. and South Africa and met with a number of dynamic leaders and individuals and saw just how devastating the AIDS crisis had become and how deeply children were being affected. So out of that visit. in 1999. the White House produced an action report and began to take the first steps towards a broader U.S. role in the global fight against AIDS. And. Mr. Speaker.

When Congress established the FQHC system neariy 40 years ago. we intended a unique publicprivate partnership by providing direct funding to community organizations for the development and operation of these healthcare centers. Federal grants. on average. constitute 24 percent of the annual budget of FQHCs by assisting communities to find partners and recruit doctors and other health professionals. Todays passage of H.R. 5573 will continue that timeproven commitment and mission by helping to reduce health disparities. meeting health care needs. and providing a vital safety net in the health care system across our country and especially in my home. Mr. Speaker. I fully support the Health Centers Renewal Act and urge its expedited passage in the Senate.",

Without question. Childrens Hospitals are an integral part of this countrys health care delivery\ufffd system. They improve health outcomes by providing a unique set of specialized health care services and treatment options for children. The Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education Payment Program is designed to provide financial assistance to childrens teaching hospitals which do not receive significant Federal support for their resident and intern training programs through Medicare because of their low Medicare patient volume. By reauthorizing this important but relatively young program. we are able to help ensure that the mission of these teaching hospitals is continued. I am also proud to say that this legislation makes improvement to the program by strongly encouraging the participating hospitals to report important new data measures to the Department of Health and Human Services. I am proud to sponsor this legislation with my friend from Ohio and the ranking member of the health subcommittee. Mr. BROWN.

I was pleased to cosponsor H.R. 5574. the Childrens Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2006. and I am pleased to speak on the bill today. The Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education program has been of significant help to Childrens Hospitals across the country. like Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh. whose pediatrics department is also headed by Dr. David Perlmutter. For several years I served on the staff of Childrens Hospital in Pittsburgh and remain on the faculty of the School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh as an associate professor of pediatrics. so I have seen firsthand through many years the ongoing value of pediatric education for young physicians where they have so much of their learning that comes not from books but at the bedside. Childrens Hospitals provide the world class expertise needed to teach the next generation of medical professionals. Recently. I received a letter from Mr. Roger Oxendale. the president of the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh. who summarized the importance of the bill by saying. \"The Childrens Hospital Graduate Medical Education program provides the ability to serve all children through clinical care. research. and public health advocacy. as well as its primary purpose of the training of future pediatricians. pediatric specialists. and pediatric research scientists.\" And this bill. he said. \"means a great deal to our hospital and the future of pediatric medicine.\" That support has really echoed throughout our Nations Childrens Hospitals in terms of the service they provide but also what is needed to keep that ongoing medical education going. This payment program provides Federal funds to freestanding Childrens Hospitals to support the training of pediatric and other residents in Graduate Medical Education programs. This program compensates for the disparity in the level of Federal funding for teaching hospitals for pediatrics versus other hospitals. So I would urge all of my colleagues to support this vital and necessary legislation to reauthorize the training for pediatric programs for another 5 years and to ensure that America can continue to meet the health care needs of our Nations children with high quality.",

Back in 1998. before my colleague from Ohio. Congresswoman PRYCE. and I authored this legislation. Childrens Hospitals residencies were getting .5 percent of what Medicare provided for other teaching hospitals. Thanks to that legislation that we authored and put in place a number of years ago. Federal GME support for Childrens Hospitals approaches 80 percent of what Medicare provides to other teaching hospitals. Yes. only 80 percent. Nonetheless. as a result. Childrens Hospitals have been able to increase the number of residents they train. Including both general pediatricians and pediatric specialists. increase the number of training programs they provide. and improve the quality of the training they provide and strengthen the programs they provide not only to residents but to the communities. Between 2000 and 2005 in my own State of Connecticut. the Connecticut Childrens Medical Center increased the total number of fulltime equivalent residents by 31 percent. About 50 percent of their graduates pursue careers In primary care and 50 percent go on to subspecialty fellowship programs. In addition to so significantly strengthening our capacity to care for children with serious medical problems. they also have introduced new curricula to provide training in community pediatrics and professional development and. indeed. have had a systemic impact on the practice of pediatrics in many settings throughout the State. I am proud of what they have accomplished. I am proud of what we have done here on this floor and in preceding Congresses to strengthen the training of pediatricians and pediatric specialists. and I urge support of this legislation.

Ms. PRYCE has been instrumental In raising awareness of childhood cancers and promoting the research needed to overcome them. Every year. more than 12.000 children in our country are diagnosed with cancer. More than 2.000 of them lose their lives. Although survival rates are increasing and great progress has been made to develop new diagnostics and treatments and cures. cancer remains the number one disease killer of children. There is. of course. no tragedy comparable to the loss of a child. If we can prevent cancer from taking the life of a child. then we must prevent cancer from taking the life of a child. This resolution calls for Congress to support public and private sector efforts to promote awareness about the incidence of childhood cancer. its signs and symptoms. its treatment options and its longterm followup care. The resolution also calls for increased public and private investment in childhood cancer research. incentives to encourage health care providers to enter pediatric oncology. and incentives to spur development of better pediatric drugs and remedies.

Childhood is supposed to be a carefree and exciting time filled with joy and wonderment. Too many children. unfortunately. spend their childhood fighting for their lives against cancer. Cancer takes the lives of up to 2.300 children each year. It is imperative that we do more to combat childhood cancer. The number of childhood cancer survivors is growing. Progress is being made but more must be done. This positive trend must be increased. To do so. efforts to increase childhood cancer awareness. treatment. and research must continue. Increased public awareness of childhood cancer will help increase public and private sector investment in childhood cancer research. More and broader investment will improve prevention. treatment. and longterm survival for cancer patients. H. Res. 323 provides policies that encourage the development of pediatric treatments and enhances educational resources related to cancer treatments. By supporting H.

As part of the fellowship. the two recipients are asked to organize a local poetry event as well as attend a poetry reading at the Library of Congress. Stroud has contributed tremendously to the art. and it is fitting that we mention him today. He began his distinguished career as a professor of poetry and English at Cabrillo College in 1969 and for 35 years inspired the minds of many young and eager writers. Yet it was not until late that his literary prowess exploded on the cultural scene with the publication of his third book of poetry Below Cold Mountain. Stroud. who resides in Santa Cruz. California and Shay Creek in the Sierra Nevada. has also been active in the social diffusion of poetry locally while cohosting KUSPs \"Poetry Show\". Strouds work encompasses various typologies of poetry from shortline form to lyrical prose and rhymes. His work takes readers with him on his travels and describes topics ranging from landscapes to commonplace objects in the finest detail or the greatest abstraction. Stroud has completed works of great social and cultural importance and it is important that we recognize him for his contribution to the arts.

By seeking to promote reunion between KoreanAmericans and their family members in North Korea. it is a project with potential ramifications that are both personal and global. As Members of this body are well aware. there currently exist many challenging issues between the United States and North Korea. In the current context. the most reasonable place to begin seeking a more positive dynamic is in the field of peopletopeople relation. And the most natural and urgent way to seek those improvements is to pursue the reunion of Korean families. Although detailed statistics are not available. an estimated quarter of the 1.5 to 2 million strong KoreanAmerican community have familial and historical ties to the North. The pains of separation are felt acutely by many Americans. One of the most unique aspects of our Nation is that we are a society of immigrants with ties to many parts of the worid. Traditionally. second and third generation American citizens have taken the lead in advising Congress and the executive branch on ways and means of forging closer. more mutually beneficial relations with their ancestral homelands. and in focusing American concern on the circumstances and challenges facing their former countrymen. In our unique. citizencentered democracy. leadership on initiatives eventually undertaken by any administration often comes from outside government. For this reason. I believe that the launch of Saemsori is an appropriate occasion to retlect on the singular role that KoreanAmerican churches. civic organizations. and business leaders are playing in the way that the United States relates to the entire Korean peninsula. both North and South.

But the unconscionable cuts to student aid are reason enough to vote against this bill. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS. Vol. 152. Pt. 2 Education has always beenand continues to bethe great equalizer in this country. Student loans in particular have helped to level the playing field for thousands o1 worthy students who cannot afford the high cost of a college education. For that reason. it is shocking and disappointing that over 30 percent of the cuts in this bill are to student aid programs that help our kids afford a college education. To pass this bill. and cut funding for essential education programs. is to forsake our commitment to our childrens future and to the future of our country. Skyrocketing student loan interest rates and fees. including a new I percent \"insurance fee\" on college loans will make it even harder for many parents to send their children to college and on the road to a better and more prosperous life. Mr. Speaker. the passage of this bill will shatter the dreams of thousands of students whose only hope for a college education is through the support of federal financial aid. And it will weaken our countrys future. because we will be denied the talents and contributions of these students. whose skills we need to compete in our highly skilled global economy. If we are to remain the greatest and most powerful nation in the world. we must educate and develop the talents of all our children. Adding to the tragic consequences of this bill is that the cuts to Medicare. Medicaid. child support enforcement. and student aid do nothing to reduce the shocking 3.4 trillion dollars deficit. The Presidents cuts to these critical programs are simply for the purpose of giving more tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent of our country. Mr. Speaker. H. Res. 653 is an illconceived and misguided bill that endangers the future of our children and the future of our country. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.",

I recognize him today for his dedicated service to this country for the cause of freedom in a global community. Pvt. Joshua Morberg came from a long line of military veterans. His grandfather had been in World War II and Korea and he had many other family members who have served in every military branch. As a child Joshua was described as \"curious\". always asking questions and desiring to gain more knowledge. His uncle stated that he could never own a radio because Josh would always take it apart and never quite put it back together again. Growing up he leamed to play the violin and in high school he learned to speak Japanese. Ever since he was a little boy Joshua wanted to be a soldier. So. in 2004. he graduated early from Washoe High School to join the military. Joshua had only been in Iraq for a few weeks. On Tuesday. December 27th. while on duty in Baghdad. another patrol came under attack. Despite the clear danger. Joshua led the effort to help his fellow soldiers. Tragically. Joshua was killed. along with another soldier. when an improvised explosive device was detonated. For his brave service and individual act of courage Joshua was awarded a Bronze Star Medal with Valor device. the Purple Heart and a Good Conduct Medal. Joshua is survived by his parents. sister Grayce and \"The Rat Pack\". who had been his lifelong friends. Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the opportunity I have today. to recognize and honor Pvt. Joshua Morberg in front of my colleagues on the floor of the House.",

I rise to remember once again the timeless reggae musician Bob Marley and to enter into the RECORD an eloquent CARIBNEWS commentary by Michael Roberts commemorating what would have been the singers 61st birthday February 6 had he not died in 1981 of cancer. As Roberts mentions in his editorial. Marleys musical genius generated from his hopes of empowerment and political uplifting for his Jamaican people. \"Marley was a staunch advocate of conscious lyrics and he urged Black people to think positive and do positive things.\" Roberts explains. Not only was Marley a lyricist and a leader but he was an international ambassador advocating for the solidarity of the Caribbean. \"His music and lyrics advocated a kind of Blackcentered Christianity which would free our minds. Thus Marley. although born in Jamaica. was a citizen of the Caribbean and Third World.\" Roberts writes. Mr. Speaker. please join me again in remembering the legacy of Bob Marley during Black History Month. [From the CARIBNEWS. Feb. 6. 2006]",

    "speech": "Mr. President. today I wish to recognize a tremendous public servant for his good work in leading an important Federal Government program for the past several years. Jim Williams. who currently holds the position of Director of the USVISIT Program at the Department of Homeland Security. will soon leave this position to become the Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration. Theres little question that the Departments loss will be the Commissions gain. However. the good news is that one of our most accomplished. capable and experienced federal employees will continue serving his country. In May 2003. Jim Williams took over as Director of the USVISIT Program. a critical bordermanagement program that collects pointofentry and exit information on visitors entering and exiting the United States. The program uses biometric identifiersdigital finger scans and photographs--to make entering the United States easier for legitimate tourists. students. and business travelers. while making it more difficult for those who might do us harm to enter and stay in the United States illegally. Hundreds of thousands of visitors cross the Texas border each year. and the USVISIT system has improved security without slowing down legal trade and tourism. Mr. Williams job was to develop a solid foundation of policies and practices that would guide the program for the foreseeable future. It was a critical moment for the program. and Mr. Williams skillfully seized this opportunity. In a little more than 2 years. Mr. Williams helped develop USVISIT into a viable program. Mr. Williams built the team that developed and deployed the effort. which today is crucial to our immigration and bordermanagement system. Under Mr. Williams leadership. USVISIT has met its congressional deadlines on time and under budget and has helped establish the foundation of the U.S. Governments 21st century immigration and bordermanagement system. Jim Williams is a model public servant and leader. He has left a tremendous imprint on the USVISIT Program and on the many people who work with him at USVISIT and across the Government. Because of his leadership. USVISIT has cultivated a talented team that will guide the program in the years ahead. They will continue to help overcome the challenges that face our Nation. and Mr. Williams will continue to provide the American people with the very best of Government service. We wish Mr. Williams well and thank him for his continued service to our country.*",

They met when Bill. an Army captain. took a weekend leave. with his fellow officer and best buddy Lewis Mooney. Lew introduced Bill to his younger sister Rose Mary that weekend in Philadelphia. Shortly after the war ended. they were married and Rose Mary and Bill returned to his home State where they made their home in Sioux Falls. SD. There they built a construction business and a family. Quite a family in fact. their first child and only daughter Barbara has shared my life for the last 37 years. Barbara was followed by six sons. Theodore. Robert. Ronald. Raymond. Richard. and Stephen. During their years together. their business. Brooks Construction. and later Brooks Concrete. was always known for quality work but. most importantly. for integrity. Bill was also a founding officer of the South Dakota Air National Guard where he served until he retired as a lieutenant colonel. Then. as now. guard service required sacrifice. During the Korean war. Bill had to leave his new business and move his young family to Duluth. MN. where. once again. he served his country. They were active members and leaders in their church where Rose Mary enjoyed singing in the choir. Her Irish sensibilities and intelligence gave her grace and wit in raising the children. They were strong supporters of whatever their seven children chose to participate. Whether it was a starring role on the football team. an allday wrestling meet. a lead in a musical. or one line in a class play. Bill and Rose Mary were in the stands. Their children will tell you that they were and are wonderful parents. There are many American ideals that apply to Bill and Rose Mary.

Mobridge is a beautiful community Iccated on the Missouri River. with friendly people and a strong local economy. Long before the settlers arrived. the site of Mobridge was inhabited by mound dwellers. Following the mound dwellers were the Woodland Indians. who in turn were followed by the Mandan and Arikaras. The Sioux Indians arrived later. coming from the East. In the late 1800s settlers began moving onto the land that eventually became the site of Mobridge. General S.E. Olson owned the land on which the city was built. The idea that Mobridge should be the place where the Milwaukee Railroad met the Missouri River came to him while goose hunting. The name \"Mobridge\" came from the abbreviating of \"Missouri Bridge.\" The Milwaukee Railroad reached Mobridge on September 9. 1906. A.H. Brown contributed materially to give Mobridge a convention center and marketplace. Monuments can still be found around the town. including the A.H. Brown Library. the Mascot Theatre. the Mobridge Wholesale building. and the Brown Palace Apartments. Mobridge offers immense opportunities to those who enjoy the outdoors. With Lake Oahe near the city. Mobridge is able to hold national and regional fishing tournaments every year. The area also presents many good hunting opportunities. as well. In Mobridge. there is a school. library. nursing home. three clinics. a beautiful ninehole golf course. municipal airport. three parks. an outdoor swimming pool. the Mobridge Tribune. and 12 churches along with many other thriving businesses. Each year Mobridge offers events such as parades. carnivals. and rodeos. The Lewis and Clark Renaissance Festival reenacts the visit of the famous explorers to the area. and local jazz bands can often be heard entertaining in the gazebos of parks. The city will be celebrating this memorable occasion July 1st through the 4th with events such as a pancake breakfast. a school reunion. a dance. rodeo. parade. and fireworks along with other various activities.

At Catholic schools across my State of Pennsylvania and the Nation. students will receive the highestquality teaching in all academic subjects. But perhaps more important. beyond reading. writing. and arithmetic. students will be exposed to wellrounded. valuesbased curricula that teach the mind. the heart. the body. and the soul. Indeed. Catholic schools dont shy a away from matters of right and wrong. The late Pope John Paul II. himself a great advocate for education. challenged Catholic schools to \"foster in your students a social consciousness which will move them to meet the needs of their neighbors and to discern and to seek to remove the sources of injustice in society.\" I believe Catholic schools do promote social awareness and help make the world a better place to live. Last week. as we know. was Catholic Schools Week. and the theme was \"Catholic Schools: Character. Compassion. and Values.\" As a young student at St. Barnabas Elementary School myself and Walsh Jesuit High School. I was taught these traits at early ages. I greatly value my Catholic school education. as I do my public school education. The 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania has this diversity of many Catholic schools. 67 in Allegheny County alone. five in Washington County. 19 in Westmoreland County. With over 183.000 students educated in Catholic schools across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. the impact is huge. Eighty percent of Catholic school students go on to college. and Catholic schools saved more than $1 billion last year in taxpayer funds in Pennsylvania alone by a reduction of the dropout rate to less than 3 percent.

My Catholic education prepared me to stand up and make the hard decisions in life with the comfort of having complete confidence in who I am as a person. and the deep understanding of human dignity that is so easily forgotten in todays overly commercialized. mediadriven society. My education taught me the value of developing not only my mind. but my commitment to my family. my community and my faith.

I February 8. 2006 and share my support for House Resolution As a product of Sacred Heart School in Lake Worth. Catholic parochial education was a major part of my life and that of my family. My father first attended Sacred Heart himself as a teacher and then moved on to Cardinal Newman High School to work as coach and science teacher. At Sacred Heart. I was taught how to be a better citizen because of their focus on discipline and moral values. I often tall back on lessons learned during my formative yearsespecially in the case of November 22. 1963. I was in 4th grade and our teachers asked us to pray for our Nation and for our assassinated President. Though the shock of the tragedy could have easily given way to anger among the faculty at Sacred Heart. it instead encouraged us to focus on a compassionate tone by praying for our country and the Kennedy family. I am and have always been a strong proponent of public education. But by the virtue of its very naturepublicly funded schools cannot offer the type of spiritual education that Catholic schools have long provided. In search of a complete education with the ideals of trust. faith. understanding and compassion. many families are turning to the structure. discipline and academic standards of Catholic schools. Parochial schools in the United States are also responsible for educating students from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. including many who are nonCalholic. I think one of the unique aspects of Catholic school education is the opportunity to care for the material and intellectual needs of the child in a community atmosphere. By offering an education centered on values. the faculty in Catholic schools can create an interactive setting between parents and students that is geared toward longterm healthy character and scholastic development for all enrolled children. Please join me and my colleagues as we celebrate the contributions of Catholic schools following National Catholic Schools Week.",

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res. 657. a resolution honoring the contributions of Catholic schools across America. including those in my congressional district of El Paso. Texas. On September 21. 2005. with representatives of the school watching from the House gallery. I proudly rose to recognize the 80th anniversary of Cathedral High School in my district. Cathedral and other Catholic schools in El Paso and throughout our country offer a quality education and produce men and women committed to a broader idea of learning--one that extends beyond just textbooks. Catholic schools offer--in more than one sensea valueadded approach to education. They instill in their students a moral compass. a sense of purpose. and a commitment to service. Indeed. many of the men and women who inspired me to spend my life in public service were themselves encouraged to enter that field by the virtues conveyed through Catholic education. I count among that group Ambassador Raymond Telles. the first Hispanic mayor of El Paso. an American ambassador. an advisor to presidents. and a man February 8. 2006 CONGR whose success in life was built in large part upon the ideals he learned at Cathedral High School. Today. Catholic schools teach 2.5 million young Americans. almost 15 percent of whom are not Catholics. This resolution reaffirms the House of Representatives support for the countless Catholic school teachers and administrators who dedicate their lives to a particular vision of education. and for the values of love. charity. and hope that are tenets of a Catholic education. Again. Mr. Speaker. I wholeheartedly support H. Res. 657 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this important resolution.",

Pt. 1 1065 that Catholic schools play in educating the children of America. including in my hometown of St. Louis. Catholic schools not only teach our kids how to think. but also teach them how to live. Catholic schools have always been known for their high academic standards and excellent teachers. but I would like to draw your attention to their ability to provide more than just an excellent academic education. The Catholic schools in my district are a perfect example of thisproviding children from a young age with a moral foundation which leads them to serve their community through out their lives. It was strong religious and moral beliefs that drove our Nations Founders to develop a country where individual freedom is coupled with individual responsibility. Catholic schools across our great Nation continue to produce students who understand their responsibility and act accordingly. The values imparted and the strong faith that Catholic schools develop in their students produces citizens who understand the importance of service and diligently work for the good of our country. I am honored to represent a district where numerous Catholic schools provide a rigorous academic education and a moral compass to guide students through their lives. Catholic schools in Missouris Second Congressional District and throughout the St. Louis region produce wellrounded and morally grounded members of our community. The teachers. administrators. parents. and students of Catholic schools deserve this recognition for the tremendously positive impact they have on our Nation. These schools will continue to play a significant role in developing responsible American citizens for our future generations.",

These schools provide students with an education that instills a lifelong development of moral. intellectual. and social values in Americas young people. Our Nations Catholic schools provide excellent opportunities for learning. Today. neary 50 percent of students enrolled in U.S. private schools attend Catholic schools. In Connecticut. over 39.000 students are enrolled at 148 Catholic schools throughout the State. Catholic schools provide educational opportunities to a broad crosssection of our society. With over 7.000 schools and current matriculating classes of greater than 2.5 million students. it is estimated that about 27 percent of students enrolled are minorities. Catholic schools also encourage greater levels of studentteacher interaction through their small classsize ratio. The 160.000 faculty that teach at these schools provide students with both an intellectually stimulating and valuesbased education. As a former student of St. Roses School in East Hartford. Connecticut. I would like to praise the outstanding efforts of the Sisters of Notre Dame for providing students with strong academic and moral values. The Catholic education I received at St. Roses School has guided me throughout my career in public service. At St. Rose. I was taught the valuable lessons of good works toward others and societys special obligation to consider first the needs of the poor. The Catholic teachings have given me a valuable framework for life. and have enabled me to achieve personal and professional goals. Again. I am proud to support H. Res. 657. As we celebrate Catholic Schools Week. we must honor the role these schools play in promoting and ensuring a brighter. stronger future for this Nation. I am proud that these schools continue to nurture students dedicated to their faith. to their values. to their communities and to their families. These schools develop the leaders of tomorrow with effective leadership and character.",

I want to thank my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce Committee as well as the sponsor of this resolution. the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. KENNEDY. for their work. Like many of my colleagues. I too am a product of Catholic schools. My upbringing is a testament to the quality education and dedicated efforts of Catholic educators to produce students. whether they are Catholic or not. dedicated to improving themselves. their community. and our Nation. At Cathedral Carmel School in Lafayette. Louisiana. I developed a lifelong love of learning and reading. Through college and medical school. the lessons I leamed in high school helped me to work through classes and assignments. Even throughout my professional career as a heart surgeon and now in Congress. I find myself relying on the personal development and classroom lessons from high school. The Seventh District of Louisiana contains a strong Catholic school system. and I have met with many students. parents. and educators who believe these schools are helping to create students and young adults who will stay in Louisiana and become productive members of our community. As we recover from the devastating effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Louisiana Catholic schools have played an integral role in our relief and recovery. taking in thousands of displaced students. Keeping our students in Louisiana is a big part of restoring our states economy. These young adults provide entrepreneurship. creativity. workforce. and ingenuity to build businesses and create jobs. Again. I congratulate the Catholic schools of our great Nation and look forward to continuing to support them in my community and in Congress.",

Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address: \"With a good conscience our only sure reward. with history the final judge of our deeds. let us go forth to lead the land we love. asking His blessing and His help. but knowing that here on earth. Gods work must truly be our own.\" I rise today to thank our Catholic schools for doing Gods work here on earth for generation after generation. More than 163.000 educators teach in nearly 8.000 Catholic schools in America. and they educate nearly 2.5 million students every year. My husband and I and our five children have attended over 100 years of Catholic school education. Needless to say. we support our Nations Catholic educational system. I can tell you firsthand that Catholic schools provide exceptional education. They contribute to a students intellectual. ethical and spiritual development. As a devout Roman Catholic and the product of Catholic schools. I rely every day on the values and the sense of responsibility that were deepened for me by my Catholic education. The theme of this years Catholic Schools Week is \"Character. Compassion. Values.\" Education is about more than reading. writing. and arithmetic. although its certainly about that. But it is also about teaching each child to live and work with integrity and in a way that serves others. My Catholic education helped me appreciate that we all contain a spark of divinity. to recognize that spark of divinity in every person. and to respond to that spark with humility and awe. even when its found in \"the least of these.\" Catholic schools teach their students that our personal faith means public obligation. Simply put. faith means we have work to do. My Catholic education taught me that to minister to the needs of Gods creation is an act of worship. To ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us. That lesson should inform every debate we have here in Congress. whether it is education. health care. job creation. or the budget. which should be a statement of our national values. Our Catholic schools truly do Gods work here on earth. and they deserve our Nations gratitude. I join my colleagues in thanking all of the teachers. parents. and students of Catholic schools who bring our Nation closer to the \"beloved community\" it was meant to be.",

They want leaflets to drop during the campaign. and they are being printed en mass right now. It is the Republican Iraq strategy all over again. Different nation. same flawed approach.

This proposed legislation is contrary to the best interest of Iran and the United States. It is. unfortunately. reminiscent of the State of the Union address which declared Iran. Iraq. and North Korea as part of the Axis of Evil. and we are now very familiar with the consequences of that statement. We have seen a disastrous situation develop in Iraq. and we have also seen the revival of nuclear interest both in North Korea and in Iran. The attitude of our country toward Iran now for more than 50 years has been overly aggressive and overbearing. and the consequences of it have been very dangerous. We should be acting in a much more mature and responsible way. particularly toward this country. This is a very significant country. not only in the Middle East but in the world generally. The people of this country are good. sound. solid. reasonable people. and we need to be appealing to them on that basis. not on the basis of the language of this resolution. which continues to create this atmosphere of hostility which is. as I have indicated. has been going on now for more than 50 years. That needs to change. We need to change our attitude. change our approach to this nation. We need to engage them more objectively. more seriously. and in a much more filial way. a much more friendlier way. And if we were to do that. we would find that this country would react and respond to us in a similar fashion. Unfortunately. this proposed legislation does exactly the opposite.

I wish there were people that we could talk to on a friendly basis and reason with them and come to some kind of a compromise. But that is not what we have here. We have a belligerent regime that is pursuing nuclear weapons. that is hostile towards the United States. that is hostile towards the West. that is hostile towards Israel. You have a president of that country who has said every foul thing imaginable. denies the Holocaust. says he wants to wipe Israel off the face of the map. and says that Americans are his sworn enemy. This bill makes sense. This bill extends the current law and sanctions and provides important additional authorities to fight that threat. It is the carrot and the stick. We are having democracy building in this bill. We are being able to try to reach the Iranian people. who are good friends of the American people. but they are trapped by a repressive government and a government that doesnt have their best interests at heart. let alone anybody elses best interest.

I deeply appreciate the points raised by the gentleman from Iowa . We could end up actually making the situation worse. I am deeply troubled that we are going to ratchet up the pressure on the very people who we most need for a diplomatic solution. the people like China and Russia who are going to be key to ultimately resolving it.

We hope that all freedomloving nations are allies in this struggle for nonproliferation efforts and would. out of their own volition. take the necessary steps to hold Iran accountable for its own behavior. However. sometimes even friends need a little prodding. Writer Charles Krauthammer points out the chilling reality of the opportunity costs of not dealing effectively with Iran at this time.

But I do not believe that levying additional sanctions and encouraging regime change is the correct course. Instead. we should work with our allies to negotiate a diplomatic solution. The \"Iran Freedom Support Act\". H.R. 6198. will antagonize Irans government. Provisions calling for democracy promotion and \"the exercise of selfdetermination\" will be interpreted as a direct assault on Irans sovereignty and may prompt Iran to discontinue ongoing negotiations. Unilateral sanctions may also discourage France. Germany. Italy. and Spain from working to broker an international agreement. Our allies do not appreciate it when we \"go it alone.\" Dissidents will also be hurt by our offer of financial and political assistance. As in Iraq. individuals and groups that ally with America will see their integrity questioned and their reputations for independence undermined. Iranian families will be hurt by sanctions that prohibit foreign investment in the countrys petroleum industries. Sanctions already in place have not impacted Irans behavior. Why would new prohibitions on investment succeed where old sanctions have failed? Finally. the American people will be less secure. Antagonizing Iran will not stop or even slow nuclear weapons development. Instead. sanctions will prompt Iran to redouble its efforts as a means of saving domestic and international face. The Bush administration and Republicans in Congress have already made a mess of Iraq and allowed warlords to gain control of much of Afghanistans countryside.

His performance in New York and at the Council of Foreign Relations was a display of insanity.

These negotiations were just suspended for a week. and it would surprise no one if Iran did not return to the table. But make no mistake: as bad as the negotiation option may turn out to be. it remains our best chance of stopping Iran from ever building a nuclear weapon.

So. Mr. Chairman. what we could do today is do what has been already outlined by the Rand report. which says we could save $162 billion in direct costs because we would now not have to duplicate care if we have care now that is tracked. so we dont have to go to four different doctors and not have each doctor repeat the same test.

I am pleased this bill includes an amendment that I sponsored in the Energy and Commerce Committee with Congressman TOWNS that would provide grants for the use of health information technology to coordinate care for the uninsured. These grants are targeted to integrated health systems that have demonstrated success in the past for treating the uninsured and underinsured populations in underserved communities. This is just one example of how this bill helps to provide the necessary framework for health IT for all Americans. Mr. Chairman. I invite all of our colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. It will help establish a framework of care for all Americans as we head into the 21st century.",

When Katrina hit New Orleans. many civilian hospital record rooms were wiped out. including the medical history of thousands. Meanwhile. American veterans already had fully electronic medical records. and their medical histories were seamlessly transmitted to other VA hospitals In Baton Rouge or Houston for complete care. There is a reason why Senator CLINTON and Speaker Gingrich both so strongly support a full deployment of electronic medical records. They reduce medical errors and improve care as they already have demonstrated to do so heavily in the VA. Our Federal law already sanctions any violation of medical privacy with up to 10 years in jail and $250.000 fines.

I believe the bill before us is a thoughtful and measured approach for establishing the Federal govemments role in promoting the adoption of a national health information network. The bill before us takes the logical step of codifying the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at HHS. This will ensure longterm stability and continuity in the establishment of policies and programs relating to network interoperability. product certification. and adoption throughout the health care stakeholder community. It will also prove beneficial to both providers and public health agencies nationwide. as vital clinical. prescribing. and laboratory information will be accessible through one integrated network. Just last week. the Institute of Medicine released its report on the number error rates involved with prescribing patient medications. and how the use of eprescribing would contribute to reducing the number of annual errors in hospitals by 400.000 and save an estimated $3.5 billion this year alone. Utilizing health IT is not only economically beneficial. but will also prevent many costly and unnecessary patient injuries relating to drug interactions. I realize the bill before us is not a perfect one. and I agree with my friends who have stated that stronger protections for the security and privacy of personal health information are desperately needed. Let me be clear that Im very disappointed that some thoughtful amendments offered by my Democratic colleagues on security and privacy will not be considered today. I do not believe. however. that health IT platforms used for the preservation or transmission of identifiable patient information are any more vulnerable to security breaches than modern paperbased record systems. In fact. many providers. insurers. and hospitals have already transitioned from paper based records to electronic health record systems. while taking internal steps to ensure that appropriate security and access controls are built into their IT systems and are compliant with current law. All we are doing today is taking the next step to ensure that all who choose to utilize health IT have a blueprint for system standards to ensure optimal functionality for all participants. I thank Congresswoman JOHNSON and Congressman DEAL for their good work.",

In light of millions of electronic data records being exposed due to recent highprofile security breaches. it is troubling that this legislation does not adequately address this critical issue. Unfortunately. the House Republican leadership would not allow us the opportunity to vote on an alternative bill that was based on the bipartisan Senate health information technology legislation -which unanimously passed that chamber. This alternative proposal included safeguards for Americans to protect their personal medical records from identity thieves. Mr. Chairman. health information technology should not be a partisan issue. Congress should not miss the opportunity to transition our health care into the 21st century. but it must be done in a manner that will protect the sensitive health information of millions of Americans.

Andbut. by the way. with a guarantee of privacy.\" During the committee process. Mr. DOGGETT and I offered an amendment that would have strengthened privacy protections for individuals. Specifically. the amendment: (1) expressly recognized the right of an individual to privacy and security. (2) required individuals to consent to having their information shared. (3) allowed individuals to prohibit access to particularly sensitive information in their health record (i.e.. HIV. mental health. genetic information). (4) required individuals to be notified if their health record has been breached. and (5) allowed individuals to obtain damages from an entity that wrongfully uses or discloses identifiable health information. Unfortunately. our Republican colleagues did not share these goals and voted against these provisions on numerous occasions. Yesterday. we joined our colleagues from the Energy and Commerce Committee and offered a similar amendment again before the Rules Committee. The amendment was blocked there as well.

Just to close my portion of this commentary. people sometimes ask why I am so committed to this. Before I was in Congress. I spent 23 years as a clinical psychologist and I saw cases of families and lives devastated by meth. Since coming to Congress. I visit every high school in my district. I try to do it every 2 years. and last fall. I visited a little tiny rural school and was talking to the kids about the danger of methamphetamines. And this little 16yearold gal said quietly to her classmates. you really need to listen to what he says. I was taken aback that a young lady would speak out in front of her peers. And I gently said. you know. you must have some experience with this. And she said. I do. My mother died of methamphetamine use 3 months ago. Then I was back this spring. on our spring recess which we all just came back from a couple of weeks ago. and a woman handed me a letter that described how her 2yearold granddaughter was beaten to death by a meth addict boyfriend who was in the house at the time and was tweaking on methamphetamine. He struck her so hard she died. and then just put her in bed for someone else to find the next day. This was a little 2yearold girl. the apple of her familys eye. And as if that isnt enough. I was speaking to a rotary club about something entirely different. and a prominent leading businessman came up to me quietly. shook my hand. and said. thank you for what you are doing on the issue of methamphetamine. My 25yearold son is addicted to this drug and it would not surprise us if he died of his use of this drug. Methamphetamine. as my colleagues have said. is a devastating drug. and we must do everything in our power to keep families lives from being further destroyed by it.

Res. 556. a resolution expressing the sense o the House of Representatives that a National Methamphetamine Prevention Week should be established to increase awareness of methamphetamine and to educate the public on ways to help prevent the use of that damaging narcotic. Meth addiction is a growing problem in the United States and one that is destroying lives. families and towns. I agree that the United States must face this problem head on. However. there are many drugs that are equally as damaging and should not be overlooked. Crack cocaine has ravaged our cities for more than 20 years. Crack is very addictive. and after even a small amount o use can cause significant damage to a users health. One way the U.S. Government attempted to fight the crack epidemic was to impose mandatory minimum prison sentences. Under the terms of these mandatory minimum sentences. someone caught carrying just 5 grams of crack received an automatic 5year prison sentence. To receive the same sentence for powder cocaine. a person must be caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine under current law. As Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) notes. mandatory minimum sentences affect people of color disproportionately in three ways: More arrests for drug crimes. overall increases in the severity o drug sentences. and harsher treatment compared to white arrestees. This sad fact is clearly revealed in our Nations prison statistics: Twothirds of the 2 million Americans in jail or prison are African American or Hispanic. African Americans make up approximately 12 percent o the population and are 13 percent of the drug users. yet they constitute 38 percent of all drug arrests and 59 percent of those convicted of drug offenses. Nationwide. African American males sentenced in State courts on drug felonies receive prison sentences 52 percent of the time. while white males are sentenced to prison 34 percent o the time. Mr. Speaker. as Congress debates how best to address the meth problem. I urge my colleagues to resist the simple answer of more jail time.\" Mandatory prison sentences do not work and do not provide hope for our Nations drug users. Instead. we should push education. as this resolution calls for. We should also substantially increase funding for treatment and job training because without these tools. addiction will be a vicious cycle for most people.",

The production. trafficking. and use of methamphetamine are growing and significant substance abuse and public health issues for the United States. Methamphetamine has emerged in recent years as a leading national drug control policy challenge. Coordination between all levels of government is needed if the challenge of curbing methamphetamine use is to be met and fulfilled. Public awareness and involvement is also important to effectively preventing the use of methamphetarnine within our local communities. Guam is no exception to the alarming trends in methamphetamine use. The trafficking and use of methamphetamine on Guam has risen in recent years and directly affected the youth of our island. Today methamphetaminerelated arrests on average constitute three quarters of the adult drugrelated arrests on Guam each year. The Guam Department ot Customs and Quarantine has seized more grams of amphetamines than any other illegal narcotic over the past several years. Additionally. more than half of the individuals admitted for substance abuse treatment on Guam are methamphetamine users. The increase in the abuse of the drug spans all ethnic. cultural. and age groups. There are currently no national observances or coordinated programs dedicated to the fight against methamphetamine despite the alarming national and local trends. A \"National Meth Prevention Week\" would be the first of its kind. I strongly support H.

At a time when this Congress is embroiled in the most serious scandal in a generation. when a culture of corruption has swept over this body with no sign the Ethics Committee is addressing it. this body should be devoting the precious few days it has here to reforming its own culture and practices. Today. the Republicans are doing what they so often do. They are trying to gag their opponents and further empower their supporters. They again abuse their legislative power to assault their adversaries. This is not reform. It is retaliation. It is ironic that so many of the Republican leadership in opposing campaign finance reform argued so strenuously against campaign expenditure limits but now advocate limitations. not because of principle but because of political power and the abuse of that power. The Republican leadership has chosen to take on political organizations in a cynical attempt to appear serious about reform and divert attention from its own ethical failures. Mr. Speaker. the problem confronting our polity is not independent groups whose political activities are legal and are disclosed regularly to either the IRS or the FEC. We know who spends this money. The public can make a judgment. Rather. it is the degree to which the Republican leadership has sacrificed the public interest. good public policy. and its own ethical conduct in order to amass. consolidate and perpetuate power through unseemly and unethical alliances with special interests like Jack Abramoff.

Bill began working for the Boulder City Police Department in 1986. He started as patrol officer and worked his way through the ranks as a Detective. Sergeant. Lieutenant. and finally. as Chief of Police. Even though he was Chief of Police. he was always ready to serve as backup if needed. He learned this philosophy from the much larger Oklahoma City Police department where he served for ten years prior to coming to Boulder City. One night. he was responding to a call and requested another officer to assist him. When the dispatch said no units were available. he was stunned when the citys police chief himself showed up minutes later. The Chief had been listening to the radio traffic from his scanner at home. Bill left Oklahoma City seeking a department where he could actually have time to solve problems he was called out to. Boulder City. with its low crime rate. fit the bill. Many officers have the belief they need to make as many arrests and citations as possible. but not Bill Turk. He believed in Community Policing. Boulder City residents would often notice pink slips on their cars. warning them of a parking violation. instead of tickets. Cars also received courtesy reminders if their doors were left unlocked. Once. several businesses were repeatedly complaining about kids leaving their bikes all over the sidewalk by a pizza parlor they frequented. The problem was the kids had no other place to put their bikes. Sitting behind the police station was a bike rack that never got used. The department donated the rack to the pizza parlor. Problem solved. These are just a few examples of how Bill worked hard not only to make the town safe but also to make it a better community. Mr. Speaker. Bill Turk is a wellrespected model of honesty and integrity. His career will stand as an example to all those who set forth to protect and serve. It is an honor to recognize him on the floor of the House and I wish him the best with retirement.",

The work of this Foundation centers around the use of umbilical cord blood. a safe and painless way to retrieve valuable stem cells. which can be used to save the lives of many Americans. I welcome the initiative taken by the partnership of Christiana Care Hospital. the The Elie Katz Umbilical Cord Blood Program at Community Blood Services. and the Brady Kohn Foundation to publicly bank cord blood. This is the first step into truly cutting edge medical research. I am very familiar with the dedication of The Brady Kohn Foundations founding members. Carolyn and Andy have worked tirelessly to achieve a partnership that would enable expectant mothers to have their umbilical cord blood publicly banked at no cost. The Brady Kohn Foundation will be the leader in education. awareness. and promotion of this project. inspiring expectant mothers to bank their cord blood in hopes of saving the lives of others. Christiana Care is an excellent choice for this project as they are home to approximately 7.000 deliveries per year. Of the cord blood collected. roughly 60 percent will be banked and used for medical procedures such as bone marrow transplants. while the other 40 percent will be used for research that has the potential to heal countless diseases in the future. I recognize the struggle that the Kohns have gone through to reach their goal of providing a public umbilical cord banking system. I would like to thank Carolyn.

This contingent authorization would protect over 200.000 people in their homes. but the contingent authorization expired due to a delayed chiefs report. The citizens of Louisiana that live behind this future levee system have passed a tax on themselves that generates roughly $5 million per year in funds dedicated strictly to fund this hurricane protection system. They have waited 6 years to begin construction on this project that Congress directed to be constructed due to a delayed report from the Corps of Engineers. H.R. 6428. introduced by Congressmen BAKER and MELANCON. authorizes only a small portion of the project as a whole. This bill would allow the people in Terrebonne Parish to begin protecting themselves while we work towards a complete water resources bill. The MelanconBaker partial authorization bill includes only two reaches of levees. tying into the already existing system of levees. These levees would provide the most protection possible with the limited resources currently available. The bill also authorizes the lock complex on the Houma Navigation Canal to protect against devastating storm surges. such as the one during Hurricane Katrina that ran up the Mississippi RiverGulf outlet and destroyed St. Bernard Parish. In addition. Houma would be protected from salt water intrusion in their drinking water and the degradation of the wetlands.

This bipartisan legislation is the product of tireless negotiations over the last year. The bill will sustain both the fish stocks and our fishing communities. I was proud to work so closely with our ranking member. NICK RAHALL. on this particular legislation. to strengthen key conservation provisions and also to protect our fishing communities from excessive consolidation of the fishing industry. I do care deeply about the Limited Access Privilege Program. or LAPPs. These programs are marketbased management tools that allocate percentages of the annual catchs quota shares among fishermen. LAPPs can be a legitimate fisheries management tool. but without strong Federal standards. they privatize the public resources by granting shares of the fishery in perpetuity. Moreover. in the drive toward Industry efficiency. they can cause excessive and inequitable consolidation at the expense of smallscale fishermen. For the past 3 years I have been advocating for a LAPPs legislation that would protect public ownership of the fishery and ensure that managers and program participants are held accountable for program success. while still allowing LAPPs to be used. This bill reaches that result. The bill includes a 10year renewable term limit on quota shares granted under a LAPP. This will also protect smaller fishermen by keeping quota prices affordable. Maine has a fishing industry that is hundreds of years old. It is part of a heritage that defines our State and makes our State a special place. Maine fishermen want policies that not only allow them to catch fish today but also ensure a longterm sustainable fishery so that they can pass their way of life on to their children and they grandchildren. Maine fishermen and fishermen throughout the Nation need policies in place that ensure a level playing field that give them economic certainty and protect the fish stocks. This bill serves those ends. and I am proud to support it. I do want to thank",

This effort is extremely timely. Poverty has a devastating effect on the lives of those in developing countries. and creates structural problems for the global economy that ultimately harm our own economic wellbeing. The U.N.s Millennium Development Goals call for progress in eight key sectors. including education. healthcare. environmental sustainability and gender equity.

In reality. addressing global poverty requires us to confront the impact of debt on developing countries ability to invest in the infrastructure and social services needed to improve the quality of their citizens lives. The weight of the international debt that many developing countries carry poses an enormous obstacle to real progress toward eradicating poverty. Debt payments to international creditors inhibit many countries efforts to recover from natural disasters. or establish healthcare. education and clean water programs. Impoverished countries in Africa pay on average $14 per person in debt service payments to international financial institutions. but spend only $5 per person on heaithcare.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I rise to strongly support House Resolution 276. This resolution will help increase awareness about a horrible disease: Pancreatic cancer. Few Americans may understand that pancreatic cancer is a horrific killer. This year alone. over 32.180 people will be diagnosed with this disease. Because there are no early detection tools for this cancer. 99% of those diagnosed will lose their lives. Many Americans are not aware that pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers. most patients only survive 3 to 6 months after diagnosis. This is why it is a moral imperative for Congress to work to increase awareness of this deadly cancer. Currently. the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (known as \"Pan CAN\") is the only national advocacy organization available for pancreatic cancer patients and their families and friends. I became aware of Pan CAN through a constituent of mine. Bob Hammen. who lost his wife to this terrible disease. Pan CAN provides patient support and professional education about this disease. while coordinating advocacy programs to focus national attention on finding a cure for pancreatic cancer. Pan CAN regards each November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. With the passage of H. Res. 276. Congress will be supporting Pan CANs efforts to raise awareness about pancreatic cancer so that scientific advancements can lead to early detection programs and effective treatments. Mr. Speaker. because all of our fellow citizens have family. friends and neighbors who are regrettably vulnerable to this dreaded disease. I urge support from my distinguished colleagues for this resolution here today.",

The award was created to publicly recognize American employers who provide exceptional support to their employees who serve the Nation in the National Guard and Reserve. Mr. Speaker. let me express my admiration for SDSU and the South Dakota National Guard and Reserve. South Dakota has one of the highest rates of mobilization in the Nation. This high rate of service is a reflection of the hard work and pride South Dakota National Guard and Reserve members maintain. I am grateful for SDSUs tremendous support of the National Guard and Reserve. The university represents South Dakota principles with remarkable distinction. SDSU provides differential pay for its employees for the entire length of their activation and student academic progression support. In addition. it grants employees 40 hours of paid personal leave for preparation of a deployment. SDSUs support for its National Guard and Reserve employees and students is admirable and serves as an example for other institutions of higher learning to emulate.

I extend my sincere congratulations to town officials. residents and supporters on this occasion. which symbolizes an accumulation of 150 years of hard work and diligence by a community. On an early autumn day in October 1855. the village of Nelsonville was born and with it a quaint community founded on good will and hard work. Some say the essence of the village can be seen in the elaborate picture painted by the landscape of historical buildings on the villages timeless Main Street. This can be seen in the current Village Hall which. prior to 1955. housed the local the Fish and Fur Club for over half a century. Nelsonville commemorates their 150th Anniversary this month with a parade which surely will prove memorable as local leaders. organizations and community members come together to remember an impressive history that has provided the building blocks for an promising future. Undoubtedly. the success of Nelsonville could not have been realized without the support and kinship of the surrounding town of Philipstown and Putnam County. For years to come. Nelsonville will remain a great place to live following the lessons of the past and by continuing participation in camaraderie with surrounding communities. There have been over 30 mayors since the villages inception. From Mayor Purdy in 1855 to Mayor Mitch Dul in 2005. the village has seen many challenges. but has always stayed on steady course. The village retains a timeless quality easily identifiable by those taking a walk down its streets. On behalf of the people of the 19th Congressional District of New York.

The owner from whom the property was taken had no recourse once the king or ruler had made the decision to transfer the property. To back up the transfer. the tyrannical despot would make clear that the full weight of his military or local law enforcement could be brought to bear against anyone who attempted to stand in the way of the transfer. In the recent Supreme Court case of Kelo et al. v. City of New London et al.. the elaborate 20page majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court is one of the most eloquent. articulate. intellectual efforts to ever rationalize or try to cerebrally legitimize the forced transfer from the legal. legitimate owner of nonblighted property to someone who is in greater favor with the ruler of that area. It is something that our high court can point to with pride that they almost make it sound fair that private property can be taken from one legitimate owner and forcibly transferred to one who offers greater financial rewards to the ruler of that area. What a great day for the intellectual superiority of the highest court of the land as it gets a 10 rating in the field of mental gymnastics. even from the Russian judge.

Additionally. children who are raised in families that own their own homes have shown greater academic success as well as greater levels of selfesteem. Two years ago. we passed the American Dream Downpayment Act which I introduced to help more American families enter the market for quality. affordable housing.

This spring and summer. the Houses restructured Committee on Appropriations and its staff have worked under an accelerated schedule and within an extremely disciplined fiscal budget environment. and they have produced bills that are worthy of the needs and values of the American people. When the final two of the Houses 11 spending bills are passed this week. Foreign Operations and the Transportation. Treasury and Housing and Urban Development bills. the House will have put us on track to hold domestic discretionary spending next year below this years level. If we hold to these levels. the Federal Government will realize a real cut in domestic discretionary spending in 2006 for the first time since the Reagan administration. By the end of this week. we will have targeted more than 100 lowpriority government programs for termination. more than even President Bush proposed in his austere budget. These difficult. but necessary. reductions will tighten the Federal Governments belt to the tune of $4.6 billion. In these bills. the House has met our Nations pressing needs here at home and around the world. but at the same time has held every program accountable to the American people. Passage of these bills puts us on a path to deficit reduction. just as Republicans promised at the beginning of this Congress.

For example. the year we are in now. they say the deficit will be $371 billion. but the debt is going to go up by about $650 billion. Our friends on the other side do not want to pay the bills. They want to spend the money. but they do not want to raise the revenue to cover their spending. That is what is really going on. They are unwilling to cut the spending to match the revenue they are willing to raise. and they are unwilling to raise the revenue to meet their spending. Either way. they will not cut the spending to match the revenue. and they will not raise the revenue to match their spending. The result is they tack it on the debt. Borrow. borrow. borrow. They say things are getting better. Really? Things are getting better? Here it is. Here is what will happen if this budget passes. They will add to the debt every year for the next 5 years more than $600 billion a year until we get to a point of over $11.8 trillion in debt. The proof is in the pudding. Later today. they will come before the Senate and ask to raise the debt limit in one fell swoop by $781 billiona further confirmation of the policy of this administration and our colleagues. which is a policy of borrow and spend. spend and borrow. borrow. borrow. borrow. run up the debt.

There is a reason that AARP strongly supports the SnoweWyden amendment. There is a reason that Secretary Thompson. before he left the Health and Human Services Department. said he wanted this authority. and that is this is just plain common sense. Everybody else in the marketplace who is in a position to use their clout does it but not Medicare. I want to set the record straight on a couple of comments that were made by my friend. the chairman of the Finance Committee. Again. at lines 13 and 14 of the bipartisan SnoweWyden amendment. in addition to the prohibition against price controls. there is a prohibition against a uniform formulary. So we are using all of the same forces in the marketplace of the private sector under this amendment that go on all across the land today. There are no price controls. There is no uniform formulary. For colleagues who want to see the language. it is at line 13 and line 14 of the SnoweWyden amendment. Let us have some practical. smart shopping with respect to this program. where the costs are going Into the stratosphere. I dont know of anybody in the United States who would shop the way Medicare is shopping today for prescription drugs. It would be one thing if it was working. AARP supports this amendment because the cost of medicine is rising twice the rate of inflation. So if you want to say to the seniors when you go home next week that you took some practical steps to control the costs of medicine. you will support the SnoweWyden amendment. If you think everything is working fine right nowand we dontthen I guess you oppose us. But I hope colleagues will. as they did last November. a majority of them. support us because now they can make a difference. They can make a difference for older people. They can make a difference for taxpayers. I hope my colleagues. when Senator SNOWE wraps up for our side this afternoon. will support this bipartisan amendment because it is just plain shopping smart at a crucial time when older people need that approach to hold down the cost of health care.

I will vote in favor of this amendment because much more needs to be done to insure that Americans will not be forced to give up their medications because of rising prices. However. I know that a number of veterans in West Virginia are concerned about what a Governmentwide prescription drug negotiation program would mean to the prices of medicines dispensed through hospitals in the Department of Veterans Affairs. There are concerns that veterans would lose access to the medications they need at advantageous prices. It is important for West Virginians to understand that the SnoweWyden amendment does not have the force of law. and. even if it should be adopted today. the amendment would have no impact on the VAs ability to negotiate favorable drug prices for our veterans. Additional legislation would have to be passed by Congress and signed into law before any changes to the VAs prescription drug negotiating power could be made. I will continue to keep the concerns of West Virginias veterans in mind should the Senate take up a debate on legislation that relates to the price of prescription drugs.",

This amendment addresses the question of whether the Federal Government should play a role in negotiating the prices of Medicare prescription drug plans. In the past. I have supported similar measures that would allow the Federal Government to negotiate prescription drug plan prices. based on the idea that there was a need to contain rising prescription drug costs and that negotiation would have the effect of driving down costs. However. we are now seeing dramatically lower costs than we had anticipated. Specifically. CMS recently announced that the average premium of a Medicare prescription drug plan is $25. this Is thirty twopercent reduction from the premium estimates of 1 year ago. Also. CMS has reported almost doubling of discounts and rebates of drugs under the Medicare prescription drug program from original projections. These effects are a result of the fact that under the Medicare prescription drug program. similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. numerous plans are in competition to offer consumers the lowest possible prices. In view of this. today. I am voting not to support this amendment. and instead. am lending my support to offering Americas seniors the lowest and most affordable prices on their prescription drugs. We now have evidence that the lowest prices are offered through what makes this nations economy one of the most robust in the worldhealthy competition.",

To the Senator from Oregon. drug companies want cashpaying customers with no coverage because those people. as we all know. pay the highest prices. The drug companies dont have to negotiate with anyone when seniors dont have any drug coverage. such as they didnt have before this law went into effect. Part D provides that drug coverage. and now the drug companies have to compete to offer lower prices and to get plans to put their drugs on their preferred drug list. It is very necessary. They would like to have the environment that you want: No formulary. Then they have everything the way they want it. That is how negotiations work. to drive down prices. to get your plan approved. and that is how competition works to reduce prices. and that is what we see after 21/2 months of the operation of this legislation.

Today. technology. space. and defense industries have a major presence in Huntsville with the Armys Redstone Arsenal. NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center. and Cummings Research Park. The city is home to several Fortune 500 companies and also offers a broad base of manufacturing. retail and service industries. In fact. Huntsville was recently named by CNN and Money Magazine as one of the best cities in the Nation to live and work. Huntsville is most well known as Americas Space Capital. In the 1950s. German Rocket Scientist Wernher von Braun and his team came to Redstone Arsenal to develop rockets for the U.S. Army. The von Braun team eventually developed the rockets which put the first American in space and transported the first astronauts to the moon. Huntsvilles space legacy continues today at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Space and Rocket Center.

Samuel Shapiro & Company began to expand. opening up offices in Norfolk. Dulles and BaltimoreWashington (then Friendship) Airport. The company was passed on to Sam Shapiros son Sigmund who guided it through the many technological transformations of the second half of the 20th century. The new millennium has brought a new generation of Shapiro family members to manage the expanding company. which now has eight offices from New York to Savannah. Sig Shapiros son Robert is now the companys lawyer and his daughter Majorie has taken his place as President and CEO. Under Majorie Shapiro. Samuel Shapiro & Company has maintained its reputation for delivering the highest quality of personalized customer service while using the most modern techniques available to provide that service.

We also streamline funding by consolidating the TechPrep program with a basic State grant. The bill also focuses on success at the local level. Under the bill. local communities will establish achievement targets. and to reward increased academic achievement. States and local communities can receive incentive grants for success.

Members have worked hard to balance planning for academic courses and introductory training to create a seamless move from secondary to postsecondary education. In my district there are several community colleges which offer excellent training for nursing and the health support occupations. as do the universities. But the truth is that high school students need to have taken the math and science courses that will enable them to move Into these postsecondary courses directly. They deserve to progress quickly to qualify for these needed and available jobs. But I have to reiterate the concern that I expressed in committee when I offered a sense of the Congress amendment to state that this Act must not only be reauthorized. but also funded. Unfortunately. that amendment failed on a partyline vote. I appreciate the sentiments that were expressed saying that well. of course appropriations would be made for the program. But Members. we have failed to do that. Last week we passed a budget which omits funding for this program as well as for programs like Trio and GearUp that also help high school students prepare for postsecondary education. So it is only wishful thinking.

I rise in support of H.R. 366 as it reauthorizes the Perkins Act. which provides critical funding for occupational preparation and vocational and technical education at secondary and postsecondary education levels. It is the largest Federal investment in secondary education. Although I am concerned about some provisions of this bill. like the merger of tech prep into the basic State grants. on balance. H.R. 366 makes many improvements to current law. and I will vote to pass it. But let me say. we started the tech prep in North Carolina. and I share with my colleagues that merging raises some real concerns. More flexibility without more funding is not necessarily what we need. Talk to any educator. and what they need is resources to get the job done. The American people need to understand what this charade is about. Although H.R. 366 reauthorizes critically important education programs under the Perkins Act. Republicans in Congress last week passed a budget that eliminates those very same initiatives. Only in Washington. D.C. could Congress eliminate a program one week and reauthorize it the next week. In North Carolina. we have one of the strongest community college systems in this country. Our community colleges work in partnership with our universities and the public schools to provide career training and critical technical skills. My State has suffered hundreds of thousands of layoffs in recent years in agriculture. furniture and in the textile industry. To a mill worker laid off from the only job he or she has ever known. the services provided through the Perkins Act literally are a lifeline. These services are the difference between hope of gainful employment and the despondency of unemployment and dependence on others. Brown University has conducted a study that demonstrates that obtaining a high school equivalency makes a clear difference between moving into a new job after a layoff and not. These are real people that we are talking about. We ought not to be cutting out the only real hope that they have for a better life for themselves and their families. In conclusion. I encourage and urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 366. But more importantly. I urge my Republican colleagues and leadership and the administration to restore these devastating education budget cuts.

It is unfortunate that the President has attempted to undermine these programs through proposals for spending cuts totaling nearly $700 million since he took office. We have lost nearly 2 million private sector jobs in the last 4 years and hundreds of thousands of American jobs have been outsourced to other countries.

This is a very important piece of legislation. the Vocational and Technical Education for the Future Act. This legislation is so important for many reasons. Specifically. it is vital to my district. the 37th District in California. But. first of all. it reauthorizes the Perkins Vocational Program that provides for many citizens the ability to learn a marketable skill that allows them the ability to partake in a career that allows upward mobility and job satisfaction. Experienced trade workers can earn up to sixfigure salaries with the right type of training. Perkins programs have traditionally provided this type of skills training. In California. only 8 percent of the ninth graders will complete the high school years and college in 10 years. The Perkins programs provide opportunities for students who need to develop the different skills for them to grow and to have career choices. With vocational training. students will aspire to entering into a career path that allows them to make a comfortable living. having the same ability to do so as students who attend a 4year college or university. Second. students who avail themselves of this training are able to enter into fields where there is a ready supply of jobs. They are currently more jobs available in these industries than there are students enrolled in vocational tech training. There is a large demand for skilled technicians. These programs. when they are adequately funded through the Perkins Act. prepares students for these jobs. Finally. Mr. Chairman. I ask Members to support this legislation because it provides for programs and resources for women and girls to obtain education and training for highwage/highskill and nontraditional jobs. When I was director of Gender Equity. I was responsible for bringing a lot of the nontraditional jobs to the forefront.

There is nothing right about this decision. Now. tax revenues are more important than neighborhoods. Mr. Speaker. with this decision. the rights of our citizens are now competing with tax revenue and private developments. The Constitution is meant to protect the rights of our citizens. not compete with the bottom line. What is clear at this moment is that the Supreme Court has thrown the protection of individual property rights right out the window. These Justices need to be reined back in by both State action and loud condemnation of this outrageous finding. Public use has been redefined so boldly by this Supreme Court decision that its no wonder citizens are concerned about their homes and property. In the short term. all states are encouraged to adopt strict and narrow definitions of \"public use.\" In the long term. we in Congress must determine whether more clarity needs to be brought to the court on this matter.

It is clear that those who encourage content theft are responsible for their conduct even it they themselves are not stealing. With this ruling. creators will be encouraged to take advantage ot the digital marketplace and provide consumers with even more digital content. For years. consumers have been clamoring for access to digital content. Because content protection technology and content owners had not caught up with the Internet. music lovers turned to illegal download sites like Napster and Kazaa for digital content. We had heard that. if the content industry would just create a legal avenue for obtaining digital music. consumers would embrace it. The premonition was largely true. The record industry and hightech worked together to develop digital content protection. to clear the rights needed to get music online. and to get music on the Intemet. According to the Pew Intemet and American Life Project. the response to legitimate digital content has been overwhelming: in 2004. only twentyfour percent of music downloaders had tried legitimate download sites. in 2005 to date. the number jumped to fortythree percent. Internet sites like Apple iTunes. Napster. and Rhapsody offer consumers a variety of ways of obtaining music. from onetime downloads to monthly subscriptions. In just the past few years. over 300 million songs were sold on just a single website. No matter how you view it. the marketplace is working. Todays Supreme Court decision makes it clear that encouraging others to steal is as nefarious as stealing directly.

But. with the explosion of the Internet. the theft of copyright material has become a crisis. Just today. the Supreme Court. in an unanimous decision. stepped forward and protected Intellectual Property. In MGM v. Grokster. the Supreme Court struck a fine balance that must exist to ensure consumers rights and protect music and video content. The Court clearly stated that \"the record is replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and Streamcast began to distribute free software. each one clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download copyrighted works. and each took active steps to encourage infringement.\" Neither of these programs offered themselves as legitimate devices such as a VCR. A great majority of users knew and intended to subvert copyright and deny not just the record and movie companies compensation. but take money out of the pockets of songwriters. studio personnel. camera men and makeup artists. We are also undertaking an effort to move to digital television. In the future. it the Congress does not act. copying and uploading a broadcast show will be all too easy. Many of us have worked on the \"Broadcast Flag.\" which is a technology that will allow consumers to continue to record a show for later viewing. but prevent the mass redistribution. The Federal Communications Commission had instituted a rule to this end. but the federal courts found the FCC lacked such authority. Thus. it falls on us in Congress to continue to update our laws in the digital era to stop copyright infringement. I hope we can do so quickly or.

I would now like to further this conversation tonight. this Special Order and this discussion with the American people. and I would like to say a few words about the interrelationship between immigration and homeland security. While so many immigrants who come to this country do so legally and with the sole intention of seeking a better life. there are those who have links to terrorist organizations or who come here to do us harm. To be fully effective. then. the homeland security programs need to contain measures to curb illegal immigration and to prevent those who would seek to propagate acts of violence from crossing international borders. Legislation recently passed in the House contains these kinds of measures. The Real ID Act is one such provision. It serves to protect the homeland in four distinct ways. First. it establishes rigorous proof of identity for all drivers license applicants and strong security requirements for all licenses and Stateissued identity cards. It further requires that Federal agencies only accept Stateissued licenses and ID cards from those States that have confirmed by substantial evidence that the applicant is lawfully present within the jurisdiction. These measures are important because they make it more difficult for wouldbe terrorists to utilize phony or temporary licenses or secure cover for their nefarious activities here In the U.S. As the 9/11 Commission states: \"It is elemental to border security to know who is coming into the country. Today more than 9 million people are in the United States outside the legal immigration system. All but one of the 9/11 hijackers acquired some form of U.S. Identification document. some by fraud.\" \"Acquisition of these forms of identification would have assisted them in boarding commercial flights. renting cars. and other necessary activities.\" That is from the 9/11 Commission.",

Prior to REAL ID. individuals who allegedly committed certain terrorist acts could be denied admission to the U.S.. but an anomaly within U.S. immigration law provided that once here. individuals who had committed these same acts could not be deported. The REAL ID Act rectifies this situation. In addition. terrorist organizations have been using front organizations and alleged charities to support and provide cover for their terrorist activities. As President Bush has stated. \"International terrorist networks make frequent use of charitable or humanitarian organizations to obtain clandestine. financial and other support for their activities.\" Money given to terrorist organizations is fungible. Unfortunately. prior to the act. an alien could provide funding or other material support to many terrorist organizations and then escape deportation merely by claiming he did not know the funds would be spent on weapons or explosives.",

The 30Something Working Group has taken a step in another direction as far as our billboards. We are going to go with handdrawn charts. It is like we are in the locker room during halftime of the football game. I think it is important to know where we end up after the second proposal that is circulating around Congress. Democrats have not seen one plan yet. but the important thing for the American people to understand is the second proposal that is now circulating around Congress ends up at the same exact place that the first proposal put us. So here we have on our little chart here everything broken down. The original Bush proposal is on the right. and the new proposal that is circulating in Congress is on the left. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Florida may remember that the first proposal was out of the 12plus percent. 12.4 percent you pay into Social Security. half by the employer and half by the employee. the Bush proposal was saying that the employee could take up to 4 percent of that and put it in this side private account. Right out of your paycheck. you could give 4 percent and put it into a private account. The rest of yours. the 2.2 left from yours and I think the 2.2 left from the employer. would go into the Social Security trust fund. The employer was actually getting a break. They would not have to match. So the WalMarts of the world would not have to match their employees 4 percent that they put in the private account. So the diversion into the side account is what led to the whole shortfall. In the second proposal that is now being circulated around Congress. it is just a shell game. All they do. instead of allowing someone to divert the money right away from their paycheck. you send the whole thing to Social Security and then Social Security takes a portion of it and puts it into a private account with your name on it. So it is just a typical Potomac twostep.",

There is going to be a tremendous increase in administrative costs for people to have to handle this money. and there is going to be a reduction in the benefits that people get. That is why we are here every week talking about the same issue over and over because we are not going to allow any privatization scheme to come through this body that is going to reduce the benefits. In the first proposal from the paycheck to the private account. the rest goes in Social Security. The second proposal. here is the paycheck. and everything goes to Social Security and then Social Security will then divert it to a private account with your name on it.

I am here to support H.R. 3127. but I have serious concerns that this legislation is too little too late for hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have died and continue to be in danger. Secretary of State Colin Powell declared the murder in Sudan a genocide in September. 2004. 2 years ago. I voted on this legislation in subcommittee 15 months ago. And every day since then. the violence and the humanitarian crisis in Darfur have gotten worse. Passing this legislation today may make us all feel good. but it will not end the genocide or even slow down the killing. Sudan is a rogue nation. Sudan is a state sponsor of terrorism. In the Darfur region. the Sudanese regime terrorizes its citizens. it trains. it funds. and it arms the Janjaweed militia that commits acts of terrorism and mass murder and the systematic rape of girls and women. More than 2.000 villages have been destroyed in Darfur. More than 2 million people have been driven from their homes. and thousands of lives are at risk of disease and ongoing terrorist attacks by the Khartoum regime and the Janjaweed militia. This is an evil regime perpetrating genocide. Genocide is not a number of random incidents of violence. Genocide is the sum. the horrible outcome. of acts of terrorism perpetrated in a systematic manner against civilians. 400.000 innocent people have died. When H.R. 3127 passed this House. it included language calling upon the Secretary of State to declare the Janjaweed militia a foreign terrorist organization. I thank Mr. HYDE. Mr. SirH. and Mr. LANTOS for supporting it. This language. unfortunately. has been stripped from the bill. But let us today call upon Secretary of State Rice to immediately designate the Janjaweed militia a foreign terrorist organization. Those who murder Africans are terrorists. Those who murder Muslim Africans are terrorists. and they should be given the same terrorist designation as those who attack Americans and Israelis. The Janjaweed militia are terrorists. and they must be held accountable for their crimes against humanity.",

This bill imposes sanctions on the government of Sudan and blocks the assets and restricts travel for individuals who are responsible for acts of genocide. war crimes or crimes against humanity in the Darfur region of Sudan. More than 450.000 people have died since 2003 as a result of the genocide in Darfur. There are twoandahalt million displaced people in camps in Darfur and another 350.000 in refugee camps in neighboring Chad. Almost 7.000 people are dying every month in Darfur. There can be no doubt that what is taking place in Darfur is genocide. and the government of Sudan is responsible. Crimes against humanity in Dartur have escalated in recent months. Over 500 women were raped over the summer in one camp alone. There have been renewed attacks and aerial bombardment. and twelve humanitarian workers were killed. two of them in the last 4 weeks. If the United Nations does not intervene in Darfur now. the death toll could rise dramatically in the next few months. Earlier this year. I visited the Darfur region with my good friend from California. Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI. and I was deeply disturbed by what I saw. As far as the eyes could see. there were crowds of displaced people who had been driven from their homes. living literally on the ground with little tarps just covering them. It is unconscionable that this should continue. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill and take a firm stand against the crime of genocide in Darfur.

I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. and look forward to it being signed into law. The scope of the Darfur tragedy is nothing less than horrific. As far as we know. an estimated 400.000 people are now dead and over two million have been displaced as a result of the violence. Thousands continue to die each month as a result of starvation. neglect and sickness. Unfortunately. little has changed since the House first passed H.R. 3127 in April: the Sudanese government has continued to ignore United Nations Security Council resolutions calling for the end of the conflict. the May 2006 peace agreement has largely September 25. 2006 CONGRI been ignored and the violence against the people of Darfur has raged on. As United Nations Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland noted in August. the situation has only gone \"from real bad to catastrophic.\" It is therefore more important than ever that the United States provide the strong moral leadership necessary to spur the world community to act to stop the killings. kidnappings and rapes in Darfur. As our nation continues to work within the United Nations for strong international action on Darfur. passage of this bill. and its enactment into law. will send a clear message to the govemment of Sudan that the United States will not simply stand by as these atrocities continue. Two years ago. this Congress and the administration declared the atrocities in Darfur to be genocide and vowed to end the ongoing campaign of violence. It is in that spirit that we must continue to work to ensure that these strong words are not empty ones. that peace can be found in Sudan. and that the people of Darfur are one day free of the threat of genocide.

Since independence. the people of Peru have faced many problems. including economic despair. an authoritarian regime. and a violent insurgency. During the 1980s. notorious terrorist groups such as Shining Path and MRTA destabilized Peru and the entire region and spread fear among the people. Financed in part by elicit narcotics. these terrorist groups reduced Peru to the position of the worlds second largest producer of cocoa. dimming Perus prosperous future. However. despite years of political turmoil and violent internal conflict and through the perseverance of its people. Peru was able to escape the stranglehold on its democracy and has recently blossomed into a vibrant free state. This is evidenced by the success of the recent elections in 2001 and 2006 and a growing economy. Today. Peru shares our Nations most treasured ideals and standards. a success story that demonstrates the power of a democracy. Peru has played a key role as a force for stabilization and peace throughout the Western Hemisphere. as well as the rest of the world. Along with providing over 200 troops to the United Nations mission in Haiti. Peru has been a staunch supporter in the global war on terror and the fight against drug trafficking and production. Today. farmers from Peru are beginning to cast off the specter of a narcoeconomy by cooperation with the United States on alternative development crops. such as Peruvian oranges and bananas. Peru has proven to be an invaluable ally and a role model for freedom in South America as well as the rest of the world. The United States stands with them on the continued progress and development of both democracy and as a nation. With my best wishes to the people of Peru and most sincere congratulations on the 185th anniversary of their nations independence. I fully support H.

His work on Latin American issues in the International Relations Committee is greatly appreciated. Madam Speaker. Peru has a long history as the center of cultural. political and economic life in the Andes. Before the country declared its independence from Spain in 1821. Peru served for centuries as the principal location of Spanish colonial power and wealth. Perus precolonial heritage is equally grand. The Incas built their impressive empire from Cuzco. their capital city. This empire stretched from what would become Ecuadors northern border to central Chile. After its independence from Spain. Peru oscillated between authoritarian and democratic forms of government. Finally. in 2001. Alejandro Toledo was sworn in as President of Peru and consolidated the countrys return to democracy. The Peruvian economy grew on average by 5 percent a year since then. one of the most robust rates in all of Latin America. and foreign exchange reserves reached a record $14 billion by the end of last year. The Toledo government is respectful of human and political rights. Nevertheless. grinding poverty still hamstrings over half of Peruvians. and the societal divide between indigenous people and those of European and mixed descent has widened. Perus new President. Alan Garcia. has promised to address these inequities and social cleavages. He has also embarked on a rapprochement with Chile as part of a larger effort to solidify cooperation between the likeminded nations of South America which are friendly to the United States. Madam Speaker. I am confident that. by the time of Perus bicentennial celebration. we and our Peruvian neighbors will enjoy one of the strongest alliances in this hemisphere. an alliance which will continue to build upon the policies of Perus democratically elected government and the contributions of the vibrant Peruvian American community in our own country.

If people watched TV last night and watched the debates on the floor with regard to our budget. there was much disagreement on our spending levels and the like. But one thing we all came to agreement on at the end of the evening is that we are spending too much and that when we spend too much it creates a deficit. So when we can at an appropriate time try to limit gnd rein in those spendings. I think that is an appropriate and common sense approach to do that. To do that we have this amendment. This amendment is basically to say that when Federal agencies travel overseas on international conferences there should be some limit as to how many members and their staff goes. The amendment picks out a reasonable number and that is 50. No one would disagree with the fact that we should attend international conferences and no one would disagree with the fact that we should allow staff to go to them. Our amendment simply says that only essential staff should attend those conferences. and we therefore set a limited number.

RICHARD POMBO. and he was asked to put language in a bill that would authorize the National Park Service. San Gabriel Valley Watershed and Mountain Special Resource Study to survey the San Gabriel River and its tributaries and the San Gabriel Mountains north of. and including. the City of Santa Fe Springs to determine if any resources are available for National Park Service designation. And when he approached me. it was because I am from the region. and we looked at the maps. His staff determined that this had no impact on my district. I agreed. when I reviewed the language. that it had no impact on my district. However. since then the National Park Service has been conducting public hearings in my district. The cities that they have been conducted in have stated very clearly. the cities I mentioned in my amendment to be removed. that they do not want to be part of the study. My city is clearly not in San Gabriel Mountains nor is it north of Santa Fe Springs. It is clearly far to the east of Santa Fe Springs. My cities have no affiliation with the National Park Service nor do they believe they should be part of the National Park Service. My reason for not objecting to this when the language was presented to me was I was assured by Chairman POMBO that this would not impact my district. In fact. the chairman wholeheartedly supports my language in this amendment that is asking that no funds made available by this act may be obligated or expended to conduct the survey in the cities listed within my amendment. We worked with the National Park Service. We have tried to get them to eliminate our cities. In fact. Chairman LEWIS today even called them and asked them once again to delete these cities from that study. They said they believed they had congressional authorization. although the committee chairman believes that is not the case.

The amendment that the gentleman from Michigan . the gentleman from Iowa . and I and others offer today will define where we stand on protecting water quality in America. Will we allow the Federal Water Pollution Act. the Clean Water Act. to be a national program. as it was intended by Congress when written and enacted in 1972. to protect the Nations waters. or will we allow it simply to become a limited program that abandons the national priority for clean water by leaving a rather substantial number of lakes. streams. and wetlands unprotected? This bipartisan amendment we offer would prevent the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing or enforcing the wetlands policy guidance issued in a joint memorandum of EPA and the Corps of Engineers in 2003. That memorandum was drafted in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Solid Waste Agency of North Cook County against Army Corps of Engineers. commonly known as the SWANCC case. The EPAs guidance in pursuance of the courts decision goes well beyond what the court directed. The court held that the Clean Water Act jurisdiction did not extend to isolated intrastate waters where jurisdiction is asserted solely on the presence of migratory birds. But the joint memorandum. EPA expanded upon the case and made it more difficult to protect all intrastate waters regardless of impact on water quality or on commerce. Our amendment would prevent EPA from implementing that unsound policy. With our amendment EPA and the Corps of Engineers will once again be able to follow their own regulations and procedures in determining what waters are subject to protection under the Clean Water Act. If the amendment is defeated. streams. ponds. wetlands will continue to endure unregulated wastewater and other damaged water discharges. The result will be loss of habitat for waterfowl. loss of habitat for wildlife. endangered wildlife. increased frequency and increased severity of flooding and increased risk of drinking water and polluted groundwater supplies.

This amendment reverses the harmful policy of EPA and the Corps of Engineers that empowers regulators to allow the pollution of waters and destruction of wetlands but eliminates the authority of local regulators to protect waters from such pollution and destruction. Since January. 2003. EPA and the Corps have restricted the ability of their own personnel to implement regulations that have been in use since 1986. These regulations are valid. understood in the regulated community. and are the method we use to protect some 20 percent of the Nations waters. The Nations ponds. streams. rivers. lakes. and wetlands can be no healthier than the headwaters and runoff that feed them. Since EPA guidance was put in place in 2003. regulators have allowed the pollution and destruction of these critical waters. imperiling the health of the entire aquatic system. This amendment is not about stopping the direct pollution of our great rivers such as the Mississippi or the Trinity River. which flows through my home city of Dallas. It is about protecting the waters that feed into these systems and that serve as the origins of these great rivers. When we fail to protect smaller bodies of water. we lose the flood control. water supply. water filtering. and habitat benefits that these waters provide. Waters that may appear isolated on the surface tend to be interconnected with the ground and surface waters elsewhere. We cannot simply ignore the connections among and the values of all of the Nations waters. I support this bipartisan amendment and urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting \"yes.\"",

Nonetheless. his sugar beet farm was ruled by the Federal Government as a wetland. The reason it was a wetland was because the creek was connected to his farm by way of an irrigation ditch with a pipe in it. The water to his wetland went through an irrigation pipe which he allowed to pool so the higher end of his farm could actually be irrigated the same way. In our district. 8 days of irrigation is one of the criteria for a wetland. I dont believe that those who actually wrote the Clean Water Act intended an irrigation pipe to be considered one of the navigable waterways of the United States. but the act is written so loosely and the interpretation by bureaucrats on the administrative side has been so perverse that indeed those kinds of decisions have been made in reality.",

And when he and his wife for medical needs tried to use the only asset that they had. which was their farm. and they tried to sell it for their needs and their family needs. the value of their farm was shot. because this is now farmlands. They were forced to sell their property for onequarter of the value of the exact neighboring farm with the same kind of crops on the same road. What we are doing with the Clean Water Act. as it is being interpreted. is hurting people. We are taking their property rights away without any kind of compensation from the Federal Government and forcing them to suffer. We are forcing them to try and prove to the person who made the original accusation that his accusation was inaccurate. For example. when the water actually dried up on his property. the person who made this request. who made this declaration it was water land. simply said we are in a drought cycle. we have to wait until we have a wet cycle in Utah to see if the water will return automatically by itself. This is unfair to people. And this amendment. wellintentioned as it is. just like the law. wellintentioned as it is. in its practice hurts people.

I believe the Ninth Circuit decision back in 2002 was wrong. and I believe the district court judges decision today is also wrong. I will later today write a letter to Attorney General Gonzales asking him to participate in behalf of the United States in the appeal of the Federal district court judges decision. again to the Ninth Circuit. and hopefully up to the U.S. Supreme Court so that we can get a final determination on this issue concerning the Pledge of Allegiance and how it is recited in our public schools.

I believe that our Homeland Security Committee is doing the necessary work to conduct a full investigation. The work has already begun. A new committee could take months to be organized and set up.

    "speech": "Mr. President. I wish to speak about the Senate amendment No. 1670. offered by Senator DORGAN. Earlier today the Senate held a procedural vote on this amendment. and I want to make clear the reason for my vote. Senator DORGANs amendment would create a Special Committee of the Senate on war and reconstruction contracting. It is modeled on the highly successful committee that former President Harry Truman chaired during his Senate tenure from 19411944. That committee demanded the strictest accountability from defense contracting and thus saved our Government billions of dollars. I agree with the aim of Senator DORGANs amendment. and look forward to supporting legislation in the future that would establish a special committee to review war and reconstruction contracting. Given the great cost. length and importance of the war on terrorism. I think it is appropriate to convene such a special committee to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. However. Senator DORGAN offered this piece of authorizing legislation on an appropriations bill. The procedural vote was whether the Senate should set aside rule XVI. which prohibits such authorizing on appropriations. There is a troubling history of legislating on appropriations. From 1995. when the Senate voted in effect to overturn rule XVI. until 1999. when the rule was established. there was a proliferation of socalled \"legislative riders\" on appropriations bills. No authorizing committees territory is safe without firm lines clearly differentiating between authorizing work and appropriations work. Moreover. from 19951999 many of the riders were aimed at undermining environmental laws. To avoid returning to this practice. I support rule XVI and its prohibition against adding authorizing amendments to appropriations bills. and thus voted to oppose Senator DORGANs amendment. Again. I state this to make clear that my vote was to uphold an important Senate rule. and not to oppose Senator DORGANs amendment.",

Congress had the opportunity and the charge to develop a comprehensive energy policy that would make America safer. decrease our dependency on foreign oil. and invest in the next generation of clean and renewable energy. Unfortunately. H.R. 6 falls the current and future needs of our Nation miserably. As gas prices and oil industry profits rise. this bill rewards oil and gas companies with $2.8 billion in tax breaks and provides $1.4 billion in tax breaks for coal producers. These corporate giveaways only continue our addiction to Middle Eastern oil and enable our dependency on old and polluting technologies. Mr. Speaker. the U.S. needs to be a world leader in energy selfsufficiency through conservation. alternative energy sources. and responsible leadership from the White House and Congress. Regrettably. this bill falls on all those counts. It neglects to include a Renewable Portfolio Standard. which would have required large electric companies to obtain 10 percent of their power from clean renewable energy sources by 2020. This act. once again. fails to increase muchneeded fuel efficiency standards of cars and trucks. As if this bill was not already bad enough. a new provision appeared after the conference committee had adjourned. which steers $1.5 billion to a private consortium located in the home district of Republican Majority Leader TOM DELAY. It provides that the consortium. of which Halliburton is a member. can keep up to 10 percent o the funds for administrative purposes. This is an outrage and a mockery of the democratic process. America deserves a comprehensive energy policy that invests in the development of the next generation of fuel sources like fuel cells. hydrogen power and home grown Minnesota fuels like ethanol. I was pleased to see the measure tripling the amount of ethanol re51. Pt. 14 July 28. 2005 quired in gasoline by 2012. but this bill could have done so much more to liberate our Nation from Saudi Arabian and Middle Eastern oil and move our Nation toward a sustainable and energyindependent future. Mr. Speaker. this is an energy bill for 1950. not 2050. It would have been difficult to support this outmoded policy decades ago. and I certainly cannot vote for it today.",

But between 1998 and 2002. 70 percent of New Yorks neurosurgeons. 60 percent of the OBGYNs in New York. 60 percent of New Yorks orthopedic surgeons. and 60 percent of the general surgeons in New York were sued. Mr. Speaker. it is impossible that all of these physicians were bad doctors. We can all agree that there are some physicians that may be better than others. but it would be difficult to come to the consensus that more than half of the physicians in several vital practice areas have performed this poorly. This is a problem. In New York. the average jury award increased from $1.7 million in 1994 to $6 million in 1999. which was an increase of 350 percent. New York physicians are now paying 34 to 50 percent more in 2005 for the same insurance coverage they had in 2002. This Is in part due to an acrosstheboard average rate increase of 7 percent for the 20042005 policy year. In 2001. six of the top eight medical malpractice awards in the United States came from New York courts. In 2002. 7 of the top 10 jury verdicts in medical negligence cases were from New York courts. And in 2003. it was four of the top six. The cost is not just to the doctors. It is a cost we all ultimately share. There are steps this Congress can take in solving the problem. The HEALTH Act is a step that is both reasonable and fair. It is reasonable because it calls for a cap on unquantifiable damages. State laws that otherwise cap damages at specific amounts. even at higher amounts than those provided in the HEALTH Act. would remain in effect.

Wisconsin was facing a medical liability crisis. not just because medical liability premiums were soaring. not just because insurance carriers were discontinuing the sale of medical liability insurance. but because too many physicians felt forced to leave their practice. leave their specialty. or leave the State for a more affordable State. But 10 years ago in Wisconsin. we figured out a reasonable answer. I led the fight to create a new medical liability system where injured parties receive every single dollar of economic damages to which they are entitled. But where there is a modest cap on noneconomic damages. things like pain and suffering. loss of society. loss of companionship. you know what? It worked. We hear a lot about studies here. We know as a fact in Wisconsin it worked. In a short period of time. Wisconsin became one of only six States not to have a medical liability crisis. As a result. as the State medical society reported. physicians. especially those in highrisk specialties. actually moved into our State from States like Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida and Illinois. It worked. But. sadly. Mr. Speaker. my State recently lost its way. Even though by any reasonable measure our reforms work. the Wisconsin courts struck them down. We can only hope that Wisconsin enacts a new medical liability reform act. But until then. we should pass the HEALTH Act. It will not only help Wisconsin doctors and patients but those in every State facing a medical liability crisis. This bill is Statefriendly. It does not preempt State reforms. If a State like Wisconsin has a cap on noneconomic damages. whether that cap is higher or lower. that cap will take effect. More important. it is doctorfriendly. It is patientfriendly. It will help us get a handle on at least a small portion of our health care costs. It will encourage doctors to continue to practice in vital specialties. and it will attack defensive medicine.

I would not have a problem with that if there was another avenue for these parents to go to get money. We created the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund to take care of that.

It says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to issue any new leases that authorize production of oil or natural gas under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to any lessee under an existing lease where such lease is not providing the proper royalties based upon market price. We have a situation here where the American public is being gouged for the price of oil on two separate occasions. once at the gasoline pump and once when their oil and natural gas is being drilled and obtained by oil companies that are not paying the royalties on those leases. This is something that needs to stop. We have right now over 1.000 leases. roughly 1.032 leases. to major oil companies to drill in the Outer Continental Shelf and elsewhere. and there is no provision for those oil companies to pay royalties on the product owned by the American citizens that is being taken out of the ground. whether it is dry or under the Continental Shelf. That needs to change. We are losing roughly $1 billion a year. and unless this is changed over the course of the next 20 years. we will lose more than $20 billion. So we need a situation that is going to address this. and this amendment will do so. It simply says that anyone who is interested in having leases to extract oil or natural gas from the Outer Continental Shelf. and they have already leases upon which they are not paying the proper royalties. is not going to be permitted to take those new leases. Those new leases provide for royalties between 12 and 16 percent. The royalties are on a product that is owned by the citizens of this country. whether it is the oil or the natural gas. and any oil company that is taking those products out of the ground. out of public lands. taking this public property and not paying royalties on it should not be provided with additional leases unless they are willing to pay royalties both on the additional leases and the leases that they already have.

Congress sought to protect underprivileged civil rights applicants by allowing them to collect attorneys fees if they won their suit. Today. groups like ACLU scour the country looking to sue cities and States with any kind of religious display. regardless of how popular those religious displays are in those communities.

In this backdoor way. the ACLU can collect taxpayer money to fuel even more lawsuits. Tragically. citizens precious symbols and monuments are being eroded with their own tax dollars. State seals in existence for hundreds of years have had to be redrawn. Many cities will not even fight in court for fear of paying costly attorneys fees. and some of them just capitulate at the first sign of a lawsuit.

This is simply not true. First. we are aware of no organization that has said they will not bring a good cause case under the establishment clause if they cant be awarded attorneys fees. In fact. the ACLU has said just the opposite. Peter Eliasberg. a staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. has said recently. \"Money has never been a deciding factor when we take cases.\" When asked specifically what the ACLU would do if attorneys fees in establishment clause cases were prohibited. he said. \"It wouldnt stop us from bringing lawsuits.\" Second. this section of the U.S. Code H.R. 2676 amends was never intended to apply to establishment clause cases. 42 U.S.C. 1988. which allows attorneys fees in cases brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983. was intended only to allow the award of attorneys fees under civil rights laws enacted by Congress after 1866. The history of 42 U.S.C. is as follows: in Alaska Pipeline Service Company v. Wilderness Society. the Supreme Court held that Federal courts do not have inherent power to award prevailing party attorneys fees to remedy government violations of the law. The Court observed that the American rule. that is. the rule that each party bears its own attorneys fees \"is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy.\" Mr. Speaker. I want to make one more point. and that is to emphasize that under H.R. 2679. establishment clause cases can in fact continue to be brought against State and local governments for injunctive or declaratory relief. which means that the court can still order that a State official or local government stop doing whatever it was in alleged violation of the establishment clause",

One group. or a small plaintiff. not only was pushing for the destruction of the war memorial. but actually got the fees paid to gain profiteering from the destruction of this war memorial.

Article III of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court. and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.

This bill reaches right into the Civil Rights Act. for the first time in history. I might add. singles out people who have Establishment Clause claims and tells them that they cannot recover any economic damages. How can this be so. Mr. Speaker? How can this be so. when the l1th Circuit in Glassroth v. Moore. a case decided in 2003. stated that: For Establishment Clause claims based on noneconomic harm. the plaintiffs must identify a personal injury suffered by them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error.

Current laws allow plaintiffs to put the following choice to localities: either do what we want and remove religious words and imagery from your public square or risk a single adverse judgment from a single judge that requires you to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees in a case that you cant afford to litigate through the appeals process. Mr. Speaker. local governments are being forced to accede to the demands of opponents. even when their actions are in fact constitutional. The section of the U.S. code H.R. 2679 amends was never intended to apply to establishment clause claims. 42 U.S.C. 1988. which allows attorneys fees. was intended only to allow the award of attorneys fees civil rights laws enacted by Congress after 1866. We need to return to that original purpose and pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it",

Quite simply. this bill would bar the award of attorney fees to the prevailing parties asserting their fundamental constitutional rights in cases brought under the establishment clause of the first amendment. This is. indeed. a change of heart for a Republican party that has tried in vain for years to impose a \"loser pays\" rule on attorney fees in tort cases. In fact. with this bill. the House Majority lays bare the outcome determinative agenda that guides the Republican party when it comes to issues that involve our legal system and judiciary. That is. the majority seeks to enact legal procedural advantages for those with whom it agrees. Make no mistake. it this bill became law. it would single out one area of Constitutional Protections under the Bill of Rights and prevent its full enforcement. Without question. that would set a dangerous precedent. The substance of the Constitution is meaningless unless all Americans have a fair and equal opportunity to go to court when their constitutional rights are curtailed by the state. By barring the award of attorney fees to prevailing parties asserting their constitutional rights in cases brought under the Establishment Clause. H.R. 2679 will discourage Americans of limited means from defending their rights. Taken to its logical to conclusion. this bill would make the U.S. Constitution the tool for those who can afford to vindicate their rights in a court of law.

This important legislation prohibits the transportation of a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion for the sole purpose of avoiding parental consent laws. It is a tragedy to deny parents the ability to consult with their child at the most critical time. It is a parent who can provide the emotional and psychological support that their daughter will need. Additionally. parents know their daughters medical history. They know any allergies that she may have to certain medications or anesthesia. In an era when a child must seek parental consent to receive aspirin from school officials. it seems reasonable to aspect that a child seek that same consent to obtain a major medical procedure. Mr. Chairman. I come from a state that requires parental notification. Yet out of state clinics are constantly trying to circumvent our parental notification laws. It is not an uncommon practice for clinics in New Jersey. a state without parental notification laws. to advertise in Pennsylvania phone books.

I commend the work of my colleagues. the gentlewoman from New York and the gentlewoman from Colorado in the work on this bill as well. Here we go again. The party that talks about States rights is stepping on the rights of States. The party that talks about family values wants to put Grandma and Aunt Jane in jail. Supporters of this bill argue that it will help reduce the number of abortions in this country or protect the health and wellbeing of our Nations youth and families. But while these types of bills may look good for politics for some. they make very bad policy for all. It is sad that the U.S. has the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the western civilized world. and I think everyone here agrees that we should take steps to counter that. That is why we should support programs that improve the health of our young people. improve communication among families. prevent teen pregnancy and reduce the number of abortions. Fortunately. these programs like those under Title X do exist. Unfortunately. these programs are not what we are focusing on here today. Congress should work to find common ground on real solutions to problems of unintended pregnancies and abortions. Funding for programs like Title X is one way to reduce abortions. Passage of H.R. 748 is not. and I urge a \"no\" vote.",

If you go to the language of the bill itself. it indicates it is essentially illegal to knowingly transport a minor across the State line with the intent that such minor obtain an abortion. and so on. Now. clearly the taxicab drivers intent is to obtain the fare. not that the young girl receive an abortion. So this is really unnecessary. 1 might add. during the course of this debate we have heard a number of things. We had heard that parents. for example. that a girl is not protected under this proposed bill because perhaps there is a case of incest. perhaps the father is the one that actually was responsible for the girl becoming pregnant. Judicial bypass. as we all know. as it does under the various State laws. protects that particular situation so that is really not an issue. I think the gentleman from Illinois",

Now. for anybody that thinks this is the same bill you have voted on three times. I want to tell you it is not. This bill goes far further and federalizes more things than any of the legislation we have ever had. And as the bill is drafted now. and as the gentleman from Virginia has perceived. anyone involved in any way with the transportation of a minor would have violated the law if they were going to get an abortion. whether he knows it or not. 151. Pt. 6 April 27. 2005 That is because the bill does not require proof of any intent to avoid State parental consent laws. Just simply transporting a minor. a driver. a taxi man. a bus driver. a family member. could be jailed up to a year or fined. or both. The same applies to emergency medical personnel. As the gentlewoman pointed out. doctors who may be aware that they are taking a minor across State lines to obtain an abortion but would have no choice if a medical emergency was occurring. what about the Supreme Court requirement for medical emergencies for abortion? Does that not mean anything to anybody here? Similarly. a nurse at a clinic just providing directions to a minor or her driver could be convicted as an accessory. We have never had that in the bills before us before. A doctor who procures a ride home for a minor and a person accompanying her because of car troubles. coupled with the minors expressed fear of calling her parents for assistance. could be convicted as an accessory after the fact. A sibling of the minor who merely agrees to transport a minor across States lines without knowledge of any intent to evade the resident States parental consent or notification laws could be thrown in jail and convicted of a conspiracy to violate the statute. Let us pass this amendment that brings just a little bit of humanity back into a very meanspirited bill. We need this amendment to protect these individuals who are innocently swept into the young womans abortion act and are not made innocent victims of the law. Support the Scott amendment.",

I just do not think the bill ought to apply to the taxicab driver. If the others do not think it applies. then just pass the amendment. I think it is a commonsense amendment. The taxicab driver ought not get caught up into an interfamily dispute over who did what and he get sued and the cab company get sued because he did not know it was illegal to take the fare to the nearest abortion clinic which happened to be across the State line. The taxicab driver could clearly know and he could hear the discussion about where they were going and why. That would make him guilty. the taxicab company guilty. the sorority sister that called the taxicab guilty for conspiracy. This is a commonsense amendment.

Mr. Speaker. this is about incest. My friends on the opposite side of the aisle would have you believe that there is an exception in this bill. that somehow they have taken care of this. It is not true. They have not made an exception for someone. a parent. that could now sue because the young girl did not come to them and get their permission. or if a person assisted this young girl.. taking her across State lines.

Mr. Speaker. a parent who has molested his child and left her facing pregnancy should not be allowed to sue a medical care provider who aided this child in her moment of need or sue someone who accompanied his child across State lines to help her safely address this tragic situation.

    "speech": "Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join my colleagues Congressman BLUNT and Congressman STRICKLAND in introducing legislation that would prohibit insurers from denying payment to health plan participants for injuries sustained while engaged in certain recreational activities like horseback riding or motorcycling. In January 2001. the Department of Labor. the Internal Revenue Service and the Health Care Financing Administration. issued a rule in accordance to the Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) that was designed to guard against discrimination in coverage in the group health market. These rules prohibited health plans from denying coverage to people who engage in recreational activities like horseback riding and motorcycling. However a loophole was created that allowed insurers to deny payment for services based upon the source of the injury. The rule states that: \"While a person cannot be excluded from a plan for engaging in certain recreational activities. benefits for a particular injury can. in some cases. be excluded based on the source of the injury.\" A plan could. for example. include a general exclusion for injuries sustained while doing a specified list of recreational activities. even though treatment for those injuries. a broken arm for instance. would have been covered under the plan if the individual had tripped and fallen. This loophole creates a situation that is especially unfair to people who ride motorcycles. horses. snowmobiles. or any other form of motorized recreation. Millions of Americans enjoy these activities safely every year within the framework of state laws and utilizing proper safety precautions. Should something extraordinary occur resulting in an injury. these individuals deserve the same consideration when it comes to their medical expenses as every other American. They should not be denied payment for health services for the mere fact that the injury occurred on horseback or on a motorcycle. The legislation that we are introducing today will remove any ambiguity when it comes to participation in certain recreational activities or modes of transportation should an injury occur. I want to thank Mr. BLUNT and Mr. STRICKLAND for joining me on this legislation. I look forward to working with them along with the multitude of groups that have made this legislation such a high priority. especially the American Motorcyclist Association and the Motorcycle Industry Council.

This legislation ensures that the United States continues to set the pace in science. and in the development of new technologies. I know my colleagues Senator BINGAMAN. Senator ALEXANDER. and Senator MIKULSKI share my conviction that this legislation addresses one of the most pressing challenges before us today. There are troubling signs that the United States is becoming less competitive in scientific and hightechnology fields. Today. the United States is a net importer of high technology products. The U.S. share of global hightechnology exports has fallen over the last two decades from 30 percent to only 17 percent.",

    "speech": "legislation closely follows the recommendations made in a recent National Academy of Sciences report entitled \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm.\" The metaphorical storm is the challenge to our global competitiveness in science and technology. I want to congratulate Norm Augustine. who chaired the National Academy committee. and the members of his committee for producing such a comprehensive. groundbreaking report on this important issue. The Augustine report makes 20 recommendations for U.S. schools. universities. research and economic policy. Our legislation will enact each of the recommendations. For example. our legislation doubles authorizations for basic research in the physical sciences by over the next 7 years. It also requires that at least 8 percent of Federal research budgets are allocated to highrisk. potentially high payoff research. It will strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and education programs at summer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories. We need to take U.S. competitiveness seriously. We need to take action to support our standard of living. and ensure we continue to grow and prosper. If we do not. we can expect other nations to rival our global competitivenessand one day to surpass us. I ask unanimous consent that the text of all three bills in the following order. the PACEEnergy Act. the PACEEducation Act. and the PACEFinance Act. be printed in the RECORD.",

One of the issues we have with regard to the confirmation of judges is that judges show restraint and be faithful to our law. not \"foreign law.\" There is no doubt that Judge Alito and Justice Roberts do not agree that we ought to be quoting foreign law to justify legal opinions in the United States. Judge Alito said this: I dont think we should look to foreign law to interpret our own Constitution. Amen to that. He said this: Our Constitution does two basic things. It sets out the structure of our Government and it protects fundamental rights. The structure of our Government is unique to our country. and so I dont think that looking to decisions of supreme courts of other countries or constitutional courts in other countries Is very helpful in deciding questions relating to the structure of our Government. Amen to that. He went on to say: As for the protection of individual rights. I think we should look to our own Constitution and our own precedents. . . . Our country has been the leader in protecting individual rights. Are we going to look to China. Yemen. or Iran on that issue? He goes on to say: I dont think that its appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution .... I think the Framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world. That is the kind of judge we need on the bench. That is the kind of judge President Bush promised to nominate. That is the kind of judge he sent up here. and he deserves confirmation. Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.",

Each of us has the opportunity to offer that same gift to young persons today. Each week with many of my colleagues in the Senate. I read with an elementary school student in the District of Columbia in the Everybody Wins program. During our lunchtime sessions. my second grade partner and I share good books and stories. Whether mentors choose reading programs or some other activity. these times are dedicated to listening and responding to the childs needs. Mentors have busy lives. but every child needs to know that we can make time for them. In States across this country there are long lists of young persons waiting for mentors.

I reiterate where this idea came from. It came not from Senators. not from lobbyists. nor from this or that clique. Senator BINGAMAN and I asked the people who should knowthe experts at the National Academiessthe answer to this question: exactly what do we need to do to keep our advantage in science and technology over the next 10 years so we can keep our jobs? They answered that question with 20 specific recommendations involving kindergarten through the 12th grade education. higher education. basic research. maintaining an entrepreneurial environment. These are ideas that many Senators on both sides of the aisle have advocated for several years. but the fact that the National Academy of Sciences. the Institute of Medicine. and the National Academy of Engineering joined together to say \"here is the blueprint\" is the reason this idea has gone so far. What it does is help keep our edge in science and technology. I am looking forward to the Presidents remarks tomorrow night. It is my hope that he makes the Augustine report and the whole idea of keeping America on top and keeping our edge in science and technology a focus of his speech and of his next 3 years.
